Last year, Excepter's <i>KA</i> provided a backbeat for spinning infinitives on rusty fire escapes. And now, on their second full-length, fellow New Yorkers Gang Gang Dance have created an equally powerful record: If <i>KA</i> functioned as a nighttime talisman, consider <em>God's Money</em> its daytime companion-- music for brightly lit graffiti-scoured parks. Despite their differences, Excepter and GGD both remove restrictive compositional components and turn electro-acoustic sprawl into a generative act. It's Throbbing Gristle's ""Hot on the Heals of Love"" reconfigured as a deck of shards.</p><p>
<em>God's Money</em>'s exuberant decay isn't a surprise; Gang Gang Dance have been intriguing ever since the ex-Cranium, Angelblood, Ssab Songs, and Actress members deconstructed their first denouement five years ago. But despite the linked evil-eye cover art between this and last year's Fusetron gathering, this collection jump-starts a new chapter of their sonic braille: Exit distended Ono, enter jubilant rebirth.</p><p>
    
    Recorded over the course of a year at Junkyard Audio Salvage, the nine tracks are mixed smoothly, and feel woven together. Each bit has a home, like paint spread thickly across a canvas instead of in globs dropped here and there. Instrumentally, drums (hand to electronic), MIDI, synth, keys, and treated vocals gel like a percussive centipede darting through the murk of the East River.</p><p>
    
    While the quartet act as a single entity, vocalist Lizzi Bougatsos emerges as a legitimate frontwoman: She knows her Living Theater and Picabia and feels at times like Karen O performing Kurt Schwitters' ""Ur Sonata"". Each track finds her ranting distantly, humming internally, and intoning over that aforementioned fractal backdrop of gentle nursery-rhyme cascades and quicksilver jaunts stitched with tiny cylindrical pulses.</p><p>
    
    In a few cases, her lyrics aptly describe her function. For instance, on ""Egowar"", which features rain sticks turned into pan flutes by fauns, she ""juggles mime with laughter."" Elsewhere, ""Glory In Itself"" drops a ""shiver of mint or rotten hay,"" a suitable descriptor of the album's atmosphere, before a tyrannosaurus guitar and glimmered new wave factory synth soon to be torn asunder.</p><p>
    
    It's difficult to diagram a textual storyline, but opener <em>God's Money</em> I (Percussion)"" launches us in medias res into tribal echos, snaps, bass de-tuned drum, and vocalizations (one voice further in the distance and the other up front counterpoint). There's a break at the end that recalls a drumline circling a drain, before GGD stop on a dime and saunter in opposing directions. The album never suspends movement: It continues to pulse and breath even in its quietest moments. And in each piece, there exists an amazing freeform beauty as well as a great sense of rhythm and melody hidden within ostensible chaos.</p><p>
    
    So I'm speaking in heightened terms, sure. There's flat out so much hype in my neighborhood-- some of it deserved, quite a bit of it completely off-the-mark-- and Brooklyn's baggage has been so sweatily decried/rehashed everywhere from the tiniest zine to the <i>Better Homes &amp; Gardens</i> recipe section. That kind of overkill makes me nervous, because Gang Gang Dance are one of those bands puritanical cynics avoid just <i>because the name's dropped so regularly (and OK, they're spotted chilling with Chloe Sevigny on the downtown society page). But, whatever the art-world association or hipster evaluation points, <em>God's Money</em> runs laps around all those noisy minions fucking with effects pedals at their feet.</i></p></div>"|3648.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3648-gods-money/|8.6|Brandon Stosuy

    strength of his name alone. He opted into music instead, currently
    playing in dream-pop act Joy Zipper with long-term S.O. Tabitha
    Tindale. The duo's sophomore album, <em>American Whip</em>, has been out
    in England since last year, accumulating predictable comparisons to
    Brian Wilson, My Bloody Valentine (a given-- Kevin Shields helped mix
    a few tracks, and his big neon fingerprints are all over it), and Air.</p><p>
    
    These takes are understandable: This particular strain of
    dreamy shoegaze is pure surface and form, and trying to write
    about it can be like trying to review a cloud: Does it look like an
    ice-cream cone or a mermaid? Does it matter? There's barely time to
    name its shape before the wind changes it again, and no matter what it
    <em>looks</em> like, it's only eddying mist.</p><p>
<em>American
    Whip</em> is engaging and sharply-drawn-- a spun-sugar confection of pale pinks and lemony yellows,
    oversaturated harmonies and gently whirring guitars, layers of liquid
    drone, the saccharine punch of outsized strings and horns.</p><p>
    
    On ""Christmas Song"", humming organ sunrises backlight translucent
    clouds of guitar, slashed with deep auburn wounds by the huge, breathy
    harmonies. ""33x"" finds Tindale doing her cute robot number over
    mournful slides and drenched chamber strings, and ""Out of the Sun"" is
    a kicky little psych-pop smokeout with a deliriously stacked vocal
    chorus. If <em>American Whip</em> makes you viscerally confront your
    mortality, you're probably looking too closely, like peering at a
    Monet from inches away when just standing back to enjoy the tableau is
    the more appropriate response.</p></div>"|4303.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4303-american-whip/|7.5|Brian Howe

It's Joe Meredith, and I've no idea why his surname became the source of the band's moniker-- I guess it works better than the Lucases or the Bryants, a few of the other options open to them. Anyway, there are five Merediths, and their debut EP positions them at an indie-geographical middle point between Athens, Ga., and Bloomington, Ind.</p><p>
    
    The part of their sound that leans toward Athens is evidently borne of some not-insignificant time spent with Olivia Tremor Control on the hi-fi, whilst the Bloomington end of things is the part that leans toward economical restraint and a tendency to rock more straight than out. Bloomington's Impossible Shapes aren't a bad reference point, though I think the Merediths have a bit more natural melodic grace. These five songs cover a neat range of harmony-moistened pop-psych, and it's immediately clear that they're best off when they inhabit a mid-tempo world full of vocal counterpoint that resorts to distortion only as an accent. I say this because the rawest track, ""Cruel Kind of Love"", is also the least successful, perhaps because the lead vocalist (they avoid informing you of which one this is in the liners, though I suspect it's that Meredith character) has to yell over the racket, and it's not his most flattering delivery.</p><p>
    
    He does sound plenty lovely when his mates are backing him up on the mic. ""Let's All Live Underground"" even lays off the mellotron and casual drumming for a big a cappella go at the chorus, with the band all stacked on top of each other like something from a tamer <i>Black Foliage</i>. Opener ""Marmalade Maggie"" has a nice little trick at the 1:30-ish mark where the clean-toned guitars back out in favor of a ""Strawberry Fields"" mellotron bit, and when it feels like they're about to toss every instrument they can find into the fray, they actually pull back instead, giving the listener a temporary taste of weightlessness.</p><p>
    
    The best of the lot is ""Homo Erectus"", which unfolds over a humming cello and spills into verdant fields of processed harmonies and keyboard. It's an interesting examination of human expansion, culminating nicely in sentiments like ""evolution don't just happen/ It takes a little time"" and ""my god has two thirds of my brain."" If that song is a launching pad for more like it, then the Merediths are worth watching. They're already quite worth listening to if you're into strongly crafted indie pop.</p></div>"|5644.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5644-a-closed-universe-ep/|7.0|Joe Tangari

It's a wonderful yet frustrating feeling. Looking at the rows of funk compilations at Chicago's Dusty Groove Records is enough to give me that giddy/sad feeling that there's so much out there to explore and not enough time or money/bandwidth to hear all of it. This compilation is in those rows now, a competitor amongst hundreds for your affection, but it's definitely worth leaning toward when your geek id pokes you in the pocket looking for something vintage, unique, and mostly cohesive.</p><p>
    If you're wondering what the heck a Wheedle is, you're probably not alone-- few remember the Seattle Supersonics' erstwhile mascot, who looked something like a giant muppet turd and supposedly lived in the Space Needle. He rode a bike around the basketball court and performed other mascotly tasks, and is sometimes reviled as the worst mascot ever amongst people who care about those kinds of things. Wheedle's resurrection as the namesake of this comp is an unlikely posthumous honor, but it works well enough: It gives character to a comp that houses music by a lot of interesting characters.</p><p>
    Obviously, Seattle is no stranger to musical icons-- Jimi Hendrix, Ray Charles, Nirvana, and Quincy Jones all came from there-- but the city's hippie-era funk and soul scene soldiered on noticeably absent of national recognition, basically until this compilation came out. Band names like the Black on White Affair and Cold, Bold &amp; Together emphasize the scene's diversity, and the songs are mostly filled with positive messages of better days to come and individuality. It's the kind of thing that's identifiably West Coast just from its tone-- it's brighter and thematically lighter than funk from the rest of the country, and Seattle funk has a particular rough, unpolished quality to it that makes it instantly endearing.</p><p>
    Though it's a generally strong disc, there are several mind-blowing finds here, such as the three offerings from the Black on White Affair, a sampling that sadly constitutes most of their recorded output. These guys had a huge, ultra-gritty funk sound that rode two sick drummers with psychedelic guitar and roaring organ on top, and the opening track on the record, ""Bold Soul Sister, Bold Soul Brother,"" kicks things off with a crashing intro before settling into a sweet groove full of bubbling riffs and ride cymbal. Other gems include the tight vocal harmonies of Cold, Bold &amp; Together's ""(Stop) Losing Your Chances"" and Dr. Leonard Roberts' mind-blowing symphonic horn arrangement on Cookin' Bag's ""This Is Me"", a song that's ridiculously tight and was reportedly nailed in one take.</p><p>
    A handful of sample-me-please instrumentals showcase the scene's compositional virtuosity, with the choice breaks of the Johnny Lewis Trio's ""Cissy Strut"" playing nicely against the mid-tempo bump of the title track, recorded by Spokane transplants Annakonda. The best instrumental is from the Black on White Affair, whose ""A Bunch of Changes"" is filled with a sense of intricate songcraft, wailing Hammond, and tense, claustrophobic guitar. Somewhat more confusing is the Overton Berry Trio's hotel lounge recording of ""Hey Jude"", a wild improvisation built off of the big ""Nah nah nah nanana nah/ Hey, Jude""s of the original song's outro that shows the group to be quite a lot more exciting than your average hotel combo.  </p><p>
    There are some legitimate complaints to be made, chief among them that the tracklist rather unnecessarily tries to tie in three modern funk tracks to the old scene and isn't really convincing on that score. I have to hand it to the Clarence Mack Express-- they have the old hot funk sound down pat\xD0but I still would rather have been treated to a few more cuts from the era that the disc purports to cover (it doesn't help that another modern song, Misterholmes &amp; the Brotherhood's ""Thrift Store Find"", is the most boring track on the record). Honestly, though, I can't say too many negative things about a compilation that includes Ron Buford's awesome ""Deep Soul Part 1"", a 1965 song that captures the feel of James Brown's 70s material five years early with an echoey Motown sound for a huge slab of spacious, heavy funk.</p><p>
    On top of all the great music on hand, there's obvious enthusiasm in the liner notes by Robert Nesmith and chief compiler DJ Mr. Supreme, not to mention a ton of biographical information, session notes, photos, and anecdotal evidence that Seattle was a great place to be in love with funk in the late 60s and early 70s. In spite of a couple odd detours, <i>Wheedle's Groove</i> is an undeniably solid survey of a scene and an era that holds up well.</p></div>"|2075.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2075-wheedles-groove-seattles-finest-soul-funk-1965-1975/|8.3|Joe Tangari

Redman spits raw maniacal gorilla mayhem all over ""One Shot Deal"". Bun B brings his gravelly authoritative drug stories to ""Purple Rain"". Twista contributes what may be his all-time greatest guest verse to ""Gotta Have It"", wrapping his dazzling machine-gun flow around Chad Hamilton's snare shuffle with James Brown timing and Louis Armstrong nuance. A lot of very talented rappers have worked hard to make sure <i>The B.Coming</i> is something special.</p><p>
    
    The second thing you need to know about <i>The B.Coming</i> is that none of these guest verses is the least bit important to the success of the album. It's nice to have them around, but the album would not suffer at all without them. Only two things matter here: the production, which is masterful, and Beanie himself, a virtuoso of lonely, bitter desperation.</p><p>
    
    Beans recorded the album in the weeks between being found guilty on a federal gun charge and beginning his one-year sentence. When that sentence ends, he'll stand trial for attempted murder. He could be inside for a long, long time. Fittingly, <i>The B.Coming</i> is suffused with a sense of dread and regret and emptiness. ""Wanted (On the Run)"" is based on a standard rap theme-- life on the lam-- but Beans attacks the track like it was ""Life During Wartime"", breathlessly painting a bleak picture: ""You never see the daylight/ Jakes get on your tail, never let 'em see the brake light""-- a stark contrast from guest Cam'ron's blithe confidence.</p><p>
    
    On the searing, gospel-infused track ""Lord Have Mercy"", he begs God for understanding and forgiveness: ""I do my dirt so my kids can see heaven on earth/ But the pain on my heart weighs heavy, it hurt"". But on the next track, the ominously cinematic ""Flatline"", he's snarling, ""Had to try to show a nigga what the metal do/ But didn't succeed; the nigga still breathing."" Even on ""Look at Me Now"", his song for the haters, Sigel sounds defiant and weary; there's not an ounce of joy in his voice.</p><p>
    
    The album's producers weave a grand, sweeping tapestry to give Sigel's lament the heft and majesty it deserves. Like Ghostface's <i>The Pretty Toney Album</i>, <i>The B.Coming</i> swims in the sad signifiers of 70s soul: glistening strings, weeping guitars, swollen horns. On ""Feel It in the Air"", producer Heavy D has nothing but mournful noir saxophones for ya, baby. Ty Fyffe slathers ""Change"" in swooning, melodramatic violins. On ""Wanted (On the Run)"", da Neckbones give the chipmunk-soul treatment to Bon Jovi's ""Wanted Dead or Alive"", mining that track's theatrical sweep with stunningly funky results. Even ""Gotta Have It"", the album's only remotely club-ready track, drowns in an ugly, metallic synth wash. The tracks build on each other, swirling into a symphony of pain, a fitting soundtrack to one man's dark days.</p></div>"|7808.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7808-the-bcoming/|8.5|Tom Breihan

Mix 4|0.0|Various Artists|[]|0.0|0.0|0.0|['Warner Bros.']|2005-04-12 00:00:00||2016-06-11 21:02:46.570337|"<div class=""contents dropcap"" data-reactid="".16n87rwphc0.1.6:0.1.0.$7893/=1$7893.0.3.2.0.1.0.1""><p>An admission: I've never seen one
    minute of ""The O.C."" Okay, maybe I tried to catch the
    one minute where the one skinny girl kissed the other
    skinny girl. But other than that, my experience with
    the show is made up entirely of promos glimpsed during
    commercial breaks of football games...okay, of ""American
    Idol"". Nothing I've seen from these 30-second flashes
    has put me off the common conclusion that the show is
    just Nu-""90210"": teen drama taken to soap operatic
    exaggerations via an upper-bracket setting and
    emaciated people.</p><p>
    
    If that was all, ""The O.C."" would be somewhere
    equivalent to ""House"" on my attentional scale, mere
    delay before hearing who's been voted home. But, of
    course, to the world Pitchfork inherits, ""The O.C."" has
    become much more, thanks to that scruffy haired
    character who doesn't look like Haley Joel Osment, and
    good old Death Cab for Cutie. Now mere mention of the
    show can induce a frantic feeling in slumped-shoulders
    zine-makers across the country, save for the segment
    that has (ironically? Double-reverse ironically? I'm
    too old to know any more) embraced the drama.</p><p>
    
    I don't think this allergic reaction has anything to
    do with the classic Sellout accusation, for surely
    we've all reached the post-modern point where we
    accept capitalism and don't begrudge our favorite
    bands for earning their fair ca$h money. No, I think
    ""The O.C.""'s boogeyman role has more to do with indie
    fans' perception of themselves than their worry for
    the eternal cred souls of the bands getting national
    exposure. That pang you're feeling when you hear the
    Walkmen on the show is the realization that indie
    lifestyle, in all of its anti-mainstream fervor, is
    just as commidifiable an identity as any high school
    hallway archetype, fit not only for the personality of
    an ensemble cast member but a whole slew of
    show-related merchandise...do they have ""O.C."" hoodies
    yet?</p><p>
    
    There's an uncomfortable fact about indie <i>music
    underlying this realization as well, one that takes a
    lot of salty pride-swallowing to accept: Indie rock is
    just pop music, folks. Well, most of it is. It all
    makes so much sense in retrospect. I mean, obviously my
    14-year-old fresh out of Vanilla Ice tapes self didn't
    fall in love with </i><i>Crooked Rain Crooked Rain</i> for
    Pavement's ability to innovate. It's 'cause they
    wrote pop songs, man, great pop songs, and even better
    for my age group, it was pop songs that nobody else
    was listening to! Well, okay, not as many people were
    listening to.</p><p>
    
    So every time ""The O.C."" releases one of their mix tapes
    (this is #4), it's like <i>The Smoking Gun</i> digging up an
    old crime report on the entire indie scene, blowing
    the cover on 1) its feelings of isolated superiority,
    and 2) its supposed disdain for pop music. Hell, even
    in my Zen-like well-adjusted state, I mentally
    flinched when I noticed that fully seven of the 12 tracks
    on this compilation were already somewhere in my
    digital archives, and that most are tracks that I
    myself would consider putting on a mix tape.</p><p>
    
    Unsurprisingly for a show that probably has a lot of
    montages of people walking alone on the beach and
    tearfully looking through shoeboxes full of old
    pictures and love letters and such, most of the tracks
    are from the glummer territories of indie rock. 
    There's Pinback (""Fortress""), there's Sufjan (""To Be
    Alone With You""), and there's the Reindeer Section
    (""Cartwheels""), all whispery and acoustic-y. They're all fine songs, and
    the only thing unnerving about their inclusion is how
    well they segue from/into the radio-slick twee
    Dido-likes of Imogen Heap and Flunk. But if you
    hadn't already realized indie rock moved into an
    adult-contemporary phase a while back, you're in need
    of an alarm clock.</p><p>
    
    More spastic moments on the show (torrid beach
    volleyball matches? Jacuzzi fights?) are potentially
    scored by Futureheads (""Decent Days and Nights"") or
    Modest Mouse (their dancepunk dalliance ""The View""). 
    A.C. Newman's ""On the Table""-- like The Shins before
    him-- should serve as a nice gateway drug for teenagers to discover the record store, and one of Beck's
    new shambling country jams again make him look like
    the old guy at the frat party. Really, there's
    nothing terribly unpleasant here, save the sub-Maroon
    5 act of someone called Bell X1 and a dreadful cover
    of ""Champagne Supernova"" from Matt Pond PA that adds
    nothing but string quartets and whininess to the
    godhead original.</p><p>
    
    So if this throwaway compilation has an underlying
    message, it's this: You're not special. That complex,
    detached, artfully depressed persona you've cultivated
    isn't unique; in fact, it's so easily simulated, the
    network that also brings you ""Life on a Stick"" can
    replicate it. But don't let it bring you down, it's
    only castles burning. Accelerate the inevitable:
    Embrace your lack of the unique, stop liking bands for
    their scarcity, enjoy the full spectrum of music,
    not just the portions with credibility directed
    prefixes. And don't forget to thank ""The O.C."" for
    saving you some time along the way.</p></div>"|7893.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7893-music-from-the-oc-mix-4/|5.3|Rob Mitchum

    any hip-hop cred because it would have undoubtedly vanished with the 
    release of <i>Folks Music</i>, an amateur-at-best disc from this Omaha rapper. Of 
    course, such a ridiculous title is akin to the funniest hick on ""Blue Collar 
    TV"" or the most accomplished post-<i>Pinkerton</i> Weezer album-- any way you cut 
    it, you're not saying much. Mars describes the Omaha hip-hop scene as 
    ""almost non-existent"" on the Team Love website, and it's only in such a 
    desolate music environment that his pitiful flow, painfully corny 
    emo-rhymes, and insulting bling-boasts could exist.</p><p>
    
    But all the blame for this wearying record can not be blamed on one man-- it can primarily be blamed on two. Producer-DJ E. Babbs is like 
    the Primo to Mars' Guru-- only without the raw talent, beat-mining prowess, and 
    smooth delivery. Babbs scratches, cuts, dips, and fades with 
    considerable dexterity at times, but his self-produced source material is sincerely 
    lacking. He takes Primo's peerless boom-bap style and turns it into a 
    murky put-put mess on tracks like the Linkin Park-tinged ""In the Street"" 
    and ""I Know Why"" with its ticky-tack garage sale drums.</p><p>
    
    Meanwhile, Mars' long expired old school flow seems stuck in the 
    pre-Rakim era. The rhyme patterns are painfully simple, and he is often found 
    behind the beat and woefully out of breath. To make up for his 
    lack of skill, Mars employs the ""louder means better"" strategy as he 
    tries to put a lot of overly exuberant feeling into his words, often 
    yelling them. On the apocalyptic ""Year of the Tiger"" Babbs provides an 
    uncharacteristically solid production based on crusading horns but Mars 
    ruins the track sounding like a madman screaming on a treadmill. Not a 
    good look.</p><p>
    
    Lyrically, the heartland MC puts too much stock in tired axioms like 
    keeping it real and knowing your history. ""I'm givin' you my life, not 
    a pack of lies,"" he says on ""Crack the Whip"". Turns out the life of a 
    Nebraska rapper just isn't that exciting. Even when he goes against his 
    mantra and spools out some obvious fibs, they come off as more pathetic 
    than ego-boosting: ""I'm the Jay-Z successor,"" he spits on ""Fade to 
    Black"", but even his moms isn't buying that.</p><p>
    
    Perched in a misguided holier-than-thou pose, Mars speaks some bullshit 
    about being true to the game in an interlude midway through the record.

Once at that size, several words would arbitrarily be bolded, italicized or in Wingdings, and there'd be entire paragraphs written with ellipses. Several 70s catchphrases like ""Dy-no-mite!"" or ""Kiss mah grits!"" would be dropped, but references to iPod shuffles and Johnny Cochrane tributes would clearly indicate the year is 2005. Oh, and the review would contain 20,000 words and use a language that's half Celtic, half Elvish.</p><p>
    Needless to say, London prog-rock trio Guapo produces some pretty far-out stuff, yet they do so with relatively familiar ingredients. Their hard-on for Magma has been extensively documented and they've clearly taken a few cues from Ipecac co-owner and Fantômas frontman Mike Patton. For the 70s fiends, they bring the mellotron and Fender Rhodes, but treat those trendy prog-rockers to sludgy basslines and caterwauling metal guitar. To top it off, the band's press releases and official website are littered with vocabulary like ""Behold!,"" ""avatar,"" ""beast,"" and ""dragon""-- further fusing the worlds of prog rock and D&amp;D.;</p><p>
    Sixth album <i>Black Oni</i> is actually part two of a trilogy starting with 2002's <i>Five Suns</i>, so it's no surprise many sci-fi savvy Guapo fans refer to this as the ""<i>Empire Strikes Back</i> record"". Not to encourage them, but the metaphor is peculiarly apt. From the gloomy black and white album art to the serpentine death marches scattered throughout the album's five tracks, <i>Black Oni</i> sounds more threatening than its predecessor. The Rhodes takes a back seat to more somber mellotron, organ and strings. While not exactly melodic, the album's several haunting fugues constantly mutating into one another until suddenly the squeal on final track ""V"" evaporates into nothingness, Guapo's stab at a musical cliffhanger.</p><p>
    Unfortunately Guapo feel a little too smug with the down-in-the-dumps sound they've cultivated here. Sure, they avoid the over-the-top horror movie shtick Fantômas has been pulling on recent albums and save face for prog in general after Mars Volta's pretentious antics, but 45 minutes packed with gloom is, well, depressing. Even the darkest, longest Godspeed!-like tracks peaked at a violin trill or eerie voice sample, unlike the teasing builds Guapo start but forget to finish. Hey, I'll listen to it during D&amp;D;, but the excitement won't be the same when my dwarf takes down a paladin.</p></div>"|3632.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3632-black-oni/|6.7|Adam Moerder

    mistaken for monotony. Witness: Of Montreal lead man Kevin Barnes, who
    has made his name on mirthful choruses that often sound suspiciously
    similar. But Barnes is anything but short on ideas, as <i>Satanic Panic
    in the Attic</i>, the band's 2004 chef d'ouvre, attests. Cumulative yet
    innovative, the album douses classically saccharine and vaguely
    psychedelic indie pop in gratuitous amounts of syrup. The key: Of
    Montreal handle the powerful flavors with soufflé-like gentleness.</p><p>
    By contrast, <em>The Sunlandic Twins</em>, the band's new album, is like a
    restaurant with multiple Michelin stars serving Sno-Cones. Missing
    <i>Satanic Panic</i>'s multidimensionality, the album feels like the
    hollowed-out shell of something great. Barnes can sleepwalk through
    a book of staff paper and come away with a set of leakproof pop songs-- or, in this case, a ""foray into 21st century A.D.D. electro
    cinematic avant-disco-- and that effortlessness lends Of
    Montreal's music a sort of indifference. The high-glucose diet that
    fueled the band's previous outings has landed them in a sugar coma.
    Blissfully adrift, <em>The Sunlandic Twins</em> lacks the essential reflexivity
    of <i>Satanic Panic in the Attic</i>'s ethereally silly
    pop gems.</p><p>
<em>The Sunlandic Twins</em> isn't without its share of coruscating hooks and
    major-key shenanigans. ""Requiem for O.M.M."" is powered by a galloping
    bass line, which draws back to let the succinct two-line chorus take
    center stage. Barnes' kaleidoscopic artwork (somebody give this man a
    larger format) complements the music, especially ""I Was Never Young"":
    both seem plucked from the overripe fantasy realms of ""Sonic the
    Hedgehog"". The song features a laid-back, strutting rhythm, onto which
    the instrumentation gradually builds until a trumpet fanfare calls in
    a tempo change. Abetted by handclaps and a bopping guitar line, the
    section recalls <i>Satanic Panic</i>'s snaking, poperatic song structures.</p><p>
    Elsewhere, ""Forecast Fascist Future"" and ""So Begins Our Alabee"" are
    airy but satisfying, meeting their melody quota while managing to have
    some fun with synthesizers. But around its midway point, <i>The Sunlandic
    Twins</i> takes a strange turn. ""So Begins Our Alabee"" initiates the second act: a self-styled electro pop opera with a
    startling lack of, well, songs. This independent, self-contained
    experiment has no business intermingling with the respectable opening
    set. A few tracks outshine their surroundings by dint of simplicity.
    ""Oslo in the Summertime"" rescues a glistening chorus from the maw of
    wandering pianos, twittering drum machines, and synth glides
    sandwiching it. ""October Is Eternal"", meanwhile, is admirable only for
    its titular appositeness: The song milks a discordant piano dirge for
    nearly three minutes before fizzling out in an ululating vocal loop and cheap-o MIDI instruments.</p><p>
    Of Montreal have always been silly, but <em>The Sunlandic Twins</em> is plain
    daffy. ""Wraith Pinned to the Mist and Other Games"" and ""The Party's
    Crashing Us"" are condescendingly aloof, piling on excessive
    amounts of sound: On the latter, a traffic jam of synths produces the
    oversaturated colors of a mangled paint palette. Particularly annoying
    among the record's contrivances is its frivolous use of drum machines,
    which skip and stutter when the songs call for simple beats.</p><p>
    Barnes is still an impeccable craftsman, but these songs won't make
    your brain spongy like <i>Satanic Panic</i>'s ""Lysergic Bliss"". This time, it
    sounds like Barnes is the one whose brain is gummed up. Of Montreal have accomplished the rare feat of honing an
    unusually nuanced signature sound. But with such a skilled songwriter at
    the helm, they should be making great records, checking the conceptual
    dalliances at the door.</p></div>"|5955.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5955-the-sunlandic-twins/|6.4|Sam Ubl

These rooms are full of acoustic guitar, banjos, mandolins, twelve-strings, and maybe an acoustic bass or two. These rooms are sanctuaries from the kid mangling ""Manic Depression"" on the budget Strat or the guy who thinks he's a slap-bass wizard. Instead, you have some old dude with a beard ripping through an incredible etude like it's no big thing.</p><p>
    
    I imagine that Jim &amp; Jennie's place looks and feels something like those rooms, bearded older guy included. If the photos in the liners to <i>Rivers Roll on By</i>, their fourth album, are any indication, they might actually live in a tin-roofed log cabin. Their home, the Pennsylvania countryside-- with its softened Appalachian ridges and innumerable valleys-- seems like a perfect place for music like this, a remarkably pure take on bluegrass, with only the sparest of modern twists.</p><p>
    
    Traditional songs and covers of bluegrass classics are included, but the band's originals, penned by Jim Krewson and Jennie Benford, show they've also done their homework. On the faster numbers, Krewson's twangy, nasal delivery is a dead ringer for an old bluegrass picker like Roscoe Holcomb, and his voice blends nicely in close harmony with Benford's, a mezzo soprano that sounds like a mountain sunrise. The two are abetted by an able cast of fiddlers, pluckers, and pickers who give an authentic ring to old chestnuts like ""Country Boy Rock &amp; Roll"". About the only thing here that wouldn't have fit on a Bill Monroe or Carter Family record is the occasional tasteful flourish of electric guitar, like the beautiful slide part on Benford's ""the Poison Vine"", a masterful original that could just as easily be a 150-year-old song your grandmother sang in the kitchen when you were little.</p><p>
    
    Jim and Jennie split their time between stark ballads and rollicking, banjo-fueled stompers, both played with aplomb, and there's rarely a misstep. When there is, it's usually subtle-- for instance, the lyrics to ""Mt. St. Helens"" feel like they ought to be metaphorical, but they instead are literally about living on Mt. St. Helens, a topic that feels more random than apropos. It's a pretty small concern, though, and this is about as fantastic and authentic a bluegrass album as you could hope for from a group of young modern musicians.</p></div>"|4255.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4255-rivers-roll-on-by/|7.3|Joe Tangari

    singer's timeless voice. It's bleached and pitted like igneous rock,
    at times cold and remote yet
    tempered by the ennui of her formative years in suburban Massachusetts
    and the grubby glitter of New York. None of this is literal-- geography influences lyrical purview, not the innate qualities of a
    voice-- but since the brief intersections of divergent personal
    histories are of such interest to Simone, one looks to her own when
    attempting to understand the provenance of her tremulous coos and
    tortured glissandos. There's something in them that's not quite pain-- more like tension, the countervailing gravities of too many clinging
    roots. ""When you fall in love with two people/ Choose whoever you
    knew first/ Because history is important,"" she sings tellingly, on
    the murky, two-toned strum of the title track.</p><p>
    
    Something new: Simone rejects the generically folksy strum that keeps
    many talented singers stuck on the coffee-shop circuit, choosing
    instead to wrap her smoldering voice around dark, fractured
    arrangements that tremble on the verge of vanishing entirely-- guitars
    that begin in two-note figures soon settle into one, rare
    embellishments like farfisa and trombone seem to come from far away,
    and percussion tiptoes in geological time, when it appears at all.
    Steve Revitte, who's best known for his production work with Liars
    and JSBX, should be credited for keeping the recording unfettered and
    spacious. If you close your eyes, you can imagine that you're hearing
    the music in a dim, sparsely populated nightclub, and closing your
    eyes is recommended: It really is prettier in the dark.</p><p>
    
    Something borrowed: Cat Power's whole damn steez, most of Shannon
    Wright's, and a little of PJ Harvey's.</p><p>
    
    Something blue: Blueness permeates <em>Prettier in the Dark</em>-- the
    deep indigo implicit in the sprawling-night-sky arrangements, the
    pining blue notes scattered throughout Simone's diaphragm-plumbing
    intonation, and her understatedly dejected lyrics. The plodding dirge
    ""Louisiana"" remembers a trip to the beach with an ex-lover; ""Siberia""
    imagines disappearing into a pure bluish-white; ""Cash America Pawn"" is
    all tired waitresses and cars broken down on access roads. The
    hollered invocation of America at it's conclusion is the most forceful
    vocal on the record; it's also a bit silly, as the song switches from
    quiet recollection to spleeny protest for no discernible reason, and
    makes one thankful for the album proper's relative restraint.</p></div>"|7807.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7807-prettier-in-the-dark-ep/|7.2|Brian Howe

Initially released on cassette in 1992, and later reissued on CD on the group's own Wholly Other imprint, this home-recorded collection finds the duo of Tom and Christina Carter tentatively marking their sonic territory at some distant nexus of loner folk, ghostly blues-based improv, and psych-guitar space rock. Now, as part of Kranky's ongoing Charalambides archival series, the album has been generously reissued in double-CD format, allowing listeners the best vantage yet to witness these formative, endearingly unpolished recordings.</p><p>
    Thanks to its humble birth-- a couple of these tracks are so lo-fi that you can hear someone pushing the stop button on the tape recorder- and widely varying sound <em>Our Bed Is Green</em> often resembles a loose assemblage of demos rather than a cohesive whole. This disunity is rather accentuated by the new version's running order, which recreates the track listing of the original cassette but is an extensive rearrangement of Wholly Other's initial CD pressing.</p><p>
    Despite this uneven playing field, however, the record remains loaded with gems, and this package also restores several tracks from the cassette, including a snappy version of the traditional tune (and long-time Grateful Dead live staple) ""Bid You Goodnight"", which had not previously appeared on CD. Unlike the longer, more fully distilled improvisations that populate Charalambides' recent albums like 2004's Joy Shapes, most of the tracks here are short and decidedly more song-oriented, placing much of <em>Our Bed Is Green</em> among the group's most accessible works.</p><p>
    At the time of these recordings Tom Carter was also playing with the semi-legendary Houston psych combo The Mike Gunn, and on tracks like ""Pasé El Agora"" his electric guitar work conforms more closely to heavy-psych orthodoxy than on subsequent releases, while ""The Core"" finds him dabbling in bluesy slide guitar traditions. Despite their drumless nature, tracks like ""I Don't Know You"" and ""The Bottle"" feature what are otherwise quite conventional rock structures, and the moody, Christina-sung ""20 Hours"" is likely the closest the group have ever come to K-records style indie-acoustics.</p><p>
    Delightful as these nuggets are, even more impressive are pieces like the crackling instrumental ""Take the Pointing Finger for the Moon"", on which the duo's guitars coil and rise like fragrant smoke, providing tantalizing glimpses of further excursions to come. Throughout the album, Charalambides perform their various wonders with the same natural, unselfconscious ease with which oak trees drop acorns. And though they sound as if they couldn't care less whether or not anyone is listening, the rest of us should be thankful to have such an available opportunity to do so.</p></div>"|1735.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1735-our-bed-is-green/|8.0|Matthew Murphy

After a re-released debut album      (<i>Wetheads Come Running</i>) and a stopgap EP (<i>Burn Radio Airtest</i>), the      band returns with an album that's no less schizophrenic but focuses on      the darker, electronic elements of their mercurial sound. What they've      managed to keep here is <i>Wetheads</i>' sense of discovery. Unfortunately, what      they've left behind are the hooks that made <i>Wetheads Come Running</i> worth coming back to.</p>
<p>In addition to the abrupt shifts in style between tracks, <i>Body/End/Basement</i> retains both the distorted, damaged electronics and the brevity of their debut-- every track      except closer ""Make Yourself"" is less than three minutes long, and there is a      fair share of ""skits"" and incidental pieces between songs. After an      instrumental opening suite, ""I'll Lose Your Balance"" expertly builds tension,      dropping chaotic guitar lines and drum machine beats between      otherwise calm verses of piano and low-key vocals, before ending in      guitar-thrash catharsis.</p>
<p>The unexpected funk of ""New Black Document"" is a      welcome surprise, and tracks like ""Exact Copy of This in the Basement""      push the dirty electro under the surface of <i>Wetheads</i> to the      fore. ""Exact Copy"" may be <i>Body</i>'s boldest and most ferocious track,      and most      indicative of the album as a whole-- more aggressive than <i>Wetheads</i>, but      with fewer guitars and a paranoid atmosphere that runs throughout its stylistic tangents.</p>
<p>After listening to their remix-heavy <i>Burn Radio Airtest</i> EP, it      should have been obvious that the band were more interested in lo-fi      experimentation than crafting ADD indie pop. I'd have expected an album of tracks more      like ""Make Yourself"", which adds electronic drone and found sound while      keeping its pop structure. It can't be called a sophomore slump, as      <i>Body</i> shows a lot of the promise that their debut did, but it's a      promise that I'd thought they would have built on by now.</p></div>"|11827.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11827-bodyendbasement/|7.2|Jason Crock

Longstreth started <i>The Getty Address</i> years ago as a Yale student, eventually abandoning the project, dropping out of school,     and releasing two other LPs. He's now revisited the work with a new approach, and though one could listen to     the album and skim the lyrics without noticing the     subtext, <i>The Getty Address</i> is a modern opera about post-9/11 America,     the destruction of our natural wilderness, the confrontation between Hernan     Cortes and the Aztecs in the early 16th century, and a protagonist named     after Don Henley.</p>
<p>Mind you, <i>The Getty Address</i> is compelling without     the back story. Where Dirty Projectors' previous albums featured drifting song     structures, <i>Getty Address</i> tosses verse-chorus-verse out the window and     relies on stuttering, repeated musical themes. Longstreth indulges     the classical influences he first explored on last year's     <i>Slaves' Graves and Ballads</i>, but the instrumentation (strings,     woodwinds, a female choir) is sampled <i>musique concrete</i>-style and infused with     electronic R&amp;B; beats. This isn't just opera with a little thump for     flavor, though-- Longstreth comes at modern R&amp;B; just as he does folk and     classical, with a deep appreciation and an outsider's flair.</p>
<p>It's a disjointed listen, but that's not a criticism; Longstreth has     never made pop records, and this is no exception. When things click, <i>Getty Address</i> features a series of stunning moments: The staccato guitar and     cascading beats in ""I Will Truck"", the impressionistic flutes on     ""Gilt Gold Scabs"", the female vocal solo on the swinging ""Tour     Along the Potomac"", the pleading yet ecstatic falsetto on ""Jolly Jolly Jolly Ego"". Longsreth's excellent voice is the most accessible     point of these compositions, although on this LP he's left out the tape hiss, chirping     crickets, and subway-tunnel caterwauling about Orange Crush. Crisp     production suits his vocals, and his performances here are more     controlled (and with a wider range) than his past work.</p>
<p>Learning the conceit of <i>The Getty Address</i> didn't change my opinion of the album either way. It's a challenging concept, but Longstreth's thorough deconstruction of     classical elements gives the colonization theme some precedence. And at the end of the day, it's the     music that makes this Dirty Projectors' most ambitious and     successful project to date.</p></div>"|2536.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2536-the-getty-address/|8.2|Jason Crock

His 1933 ballad, ""Öngyilkos Vasárnap"" or ""Gloomy Sunday""-- written after he made up with an ex-fiancée, but before she poisoned herself--- had been banned in the United States and his native Hungary. ""The Hungarian Suicide Song"", it was later called. Suicide notes allegedly hint to the tune's lyrics, and one tale says a delivery boy jumped off a bridge after overhearing a man whistling the song's melody.</p><p>
    Billie Holiday, an angel who lost her wings with $750 strapped to her leg and heroin found in her apartment, later recorded an English version of Seress's song. ""Little white flowers will never awaken you/Not where the black coach of sorrow has taken you/ Angels have no thought of ever returning you/ Would they be angry if I thought of joining you?/ Gloomy Sunday,"" she sang to a moon cloaked under bleary streetlight. Cynics can call that melodramatic, but the way the horns moan along with her to punctuate the end of her verses, her treatment sounds utterly convincing.</p><p>
    Aaron Funk (Venetian Snares) appropriately covered Seress and sampled Holiday's dread on <i>Rossz Csillag Alatt Született</i>, his 223rd album of shattering breakbeats and post-Aphex Twin poetics in the past five years. It's also his sharpest left turn to date, although Funk's juxtaposition of drill'n'bass beats with chamber orchestral sounds has been done by others for more than a decade, most notably on Aphex Twin's <i>I Care Because You Do</i>. But to his credit, Funk takes a chipped, charcoal pencil and illustrates a forest of leafless trees filled with the pigeons that he daydreamt of while watching the birds at Budapest's Royal Palace. Even better, his beats work <i>with</i> the orchestration instead of pulverizing it for an ironic counterpoint. Funk's baroque strings fittingly strike the air, while just about every melody is played with grinded teeth and bloodshot eyes.</p><p>
    The album title (translated ""Born Under a Bad Star""), and its songs have Hungarian titles. ""Sikertelenség"" has Funk opening a body bag to show a disbelieving piano its deceased lover. ""Szerencsétlen"" walks a rickety plank with stacco violin stabs and a grinding ""Amen"" jungle breakbeat. ""Második Galamb"" indulges in more breakcore delirium and nearly sacrifices the visceral impact of the melodies struggling to pull through. The brooding string piece ""Felbomlasztott Mentökocsi"" and the chase-sequence dramatics of ""Hajnal"" are deftest songs that Funk ever recorded.</p><p>
    While Funk's percussive palate could have ventured beyond the standard-issued ""Amen"" breakbeats, <i>Rossz</i>'s totality still possesses nerves that can cast shadows that never dissipate away from the mind in hours both sleeping and waking.</p></div>"|8445.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8445-rossz-csillag-alatt-szuletett/|7.5|Cameron Macdonald

    Edie Sedgwick, once upon a time, was Moyer (on bass) and Ryan Hicks (on 
    drums) jamming econo. In both cases, Edie Sedgwick performed songs in a 
    disco-punk fashion named after and concerning celebrities.</p><p>
    
    Moyer's press release claims he does this because ""the world is tired of both meaning and its absence,"" so they create ""substantial song[s] about 
    the substanceless (sic) celebrity."" To that end, Edie blesses listeners with empty slogans like, ""When 
    Martin Sheen is President/ I love living in the USA"", and ""Relapse, 
    recovery!"" (from ""Robert Downey Jr."", of course). ""Lucy Liu"" features Moyer 
    chirping ""Girl power!"" and ""Bullshit!"" in front of a spastic Nintendo 
    soundtrack, while ""Michael J. Fox"" makes like Liquid Liquid while 
    riffing on the near-incest of <i>Back to the Future (""She's in my room/ She 
    knows my moves/ She knows what's hers is mine"").</i></p><p>
    
    While Edie claims to be 
    avoiding any meaningful political statement, but there are two 
    tracks about the Governator, Arnold Schwarzenegger. ""I"" is a rinky-dink 
    dirge, bemoaning the sad life of a cyborg (""All the time I've spent in 
    fields of fire/ No one to hear my cry""). ""II"", on the other hand, 
    offers quick-hitting rhetoric regarding Ahnuld's rise to power (""The 
    girlie-men keep us apprised/ Of the alpha-male's meteoric rise""), and then 
    ends with a party-people roof-raising shout-out to areas of California 
    en fuego (""San Diego...there's a fire burning/ Angelinos...there's 
    a fire burning""). These tracks, in addition to ""Martin Sheen"" (drawing 
    a straight line from <i>Apocalypse Now</i> to ""The West Wing""), and ""Tim 
    Robbins"" (""Does the left have a fist?""), undercut the post-post-modern 
    fat-free shenanigans Edie and/or Moyer are trying to have and eat. Even 
    the album title (cribbed from the lyrics to ""Haley Joel Osment"") carries some 
    heft, if you're willing to muse on the nature of the celebrity/fan 
    relationship.</p><p>
    
    To Edie's credit, there are also flights of fancy like the minute-long 
    Big Black homage to <i>Pump Up The Volume</i>, the role call of Colonial 
    Marines in ""Sigourney Weaver"", and the reinvention of Molly Ringwald as 
    a biological weapon, that belie any attempts to arrive at anything 
    remotely approaching significance. Also to Edie's credit, the focus is 
    more on the katzenjammin' Fruity Loops swing than the loopy rhetoric s/he 
    offers. Even if the subjects of the song don't offer much substance, 
    there's plenty of musical meat on the bone. Though, to be totally 
    honest, when ""Martin Sheen"" comes on, I realize that I wouldn't mind living 
    in a USA where Jed Bartlett was president. But I digress. As does 
    Edie Sedgwick. And thank God for that.</p></div>"|2922.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2922-her-love-is-realbut-she-is-not/|7.6|David Raposa

Appropriately, on their self-titled debut (which was released in Canada in 2003), the band sound like they have one foot in both countries: they-- or rather, on this record, head Swimmer Tony Dekker-- play a brand of ambient folk that's strikingly similar to that of Floridian Iron &amp; Wine, but they add enough local color to make it sound more specifically local. Dekker even fashions the refrain of ""I Will Never See the Sun"" from points on a map-- ""I will never see the sun/ Spadina, St. George, Bay, and Yonge.""</p><p>
    
    That's one of only a few songs on the album featuring a full band; most focus squarely on Dekker's closely miked voice and guitar. <i>Great Lake Swimmers</i> proudly-- occasionally too proudly-- bears the marks of its creation. It was recorded in an abandoned silo in rural Ontario, so the structure adds an echoey cry to Dekker's vocals (which sound more like Jim James than Sam Beam) and the setting infuses the songs with a constant feedback of insect noise. The few other instruments are more suggestions than sounds: A fluid bass flows beneath the songs like an underground spring, an organ tiptoes through a few tracks as if trying not to wake the sleeping.</p><p>
    
    This naturalistic aesthetic suits Dekker's sadsack songs, which are stark and atmospheric, yet lyrically generous. To gauge the album's moodiness, consider this line from ""The Man With No Skin"": ""The world let me down...in a big way."" Even as his voice trails wistfully off on that last phrase, Dekker's not whining or even complaining: disappointment is a mere fact of life for him, not a personal injustice. And while he does admit on ""Moving, Shaking"" that ""It's hard to see all the little things when the big things get in the way,"" he is never too confessional that he can't see the world around him, like the ""an ant crawling across a broken tile.""</p><p>
    
    Dekker can be a startlingly literal songwriter at times. On ""The Man With No Skin,"" he describes that epidermal lack in such detail that it barely qualifies as allegorical: ""Nobody wants to see a beating heart or lung or a brain."" And as the album progresses, the Swimmers portion of band name becomes a central theme, as the final two tracks, ""Three Days at Sea (Three Lost Years)"" and ""Great Lake Swimmers"", describe the dangers of water in language that makes drowning seem as much a blessing as a doom. It's a fitting metaphor for life's breakers and gales, but Dekker's voice sounds haggard and tired as he hits the high notes at the end of each line. That fatigue makes both the song and the album sound all the more mortally dire, especially when Dekker sings, ""It's such a long swim.""</p></div>"|3672.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3672-great-lake-swimmers/|7.8|Stephen M.

Alongside Polly Jean Harvey, Garbage singer Shirley Manson was one of the most complicated and charismatic women in 90s mainstream rock, balancing power and pliability, mercurial sexuality and fears and emotions.</p><p>
    After the commercial disappointment of the musically adventurous <i>Beautiful Garbage</i>, they sound like they're trying very hard to reassert themselves into our collective consciousness. Despite being billed as a guitar album, <em>Bleed Like Me</em> more or less reworks their successful <i>Version 2.0</i> template, combining slick studio elements with ostensibly live-band instrumentation. This is, however, no comeback: The album is full of big rock guitars anchored to big rock effects, but it somehow never manages either to sound big enough or to rock hard enough.</p><p>
    Part of the problem is the band itself, which consists of producers Butch Vig, Doug ""Duke"" Erikson, and Steve Marker. Vig's drums are, as usual, pretty much redundant, buried with the bass beneath layers of programmed beats. And all the guitars are so fastidiously sculpted that they don't even sound like guitars anymore. In the past, those previous two sentences would have been mere descriptions rather than complaints, but on <em>Bleed Like Me</em>, the rhythms rarely lock into a formidable groove and too often the guitars-that-don't-sound-like-guitars don't sound like anything else very interesting either.</p><p>
    Despite its hammering riffs, ""Bad Boyfriend"", about a boyfriend who's bad but in a good way, is a surprisingly timid opener, and even Dave Grohl's drums can't liven up it up. Singing ostensibly in character, the most moxie Manson can muster is ""I've got something special for my bad boyfriend."" ""Why Don't You Come Over"" and ""Right Between the Eyes"" take shots at haters and critics, sounding defensive and distant even as Manson belts ""Stay alive my love"" Bono-style over a strangled guitar line. Whatever conflict she's describing remains merely an abstract notion, never an immediate reality. </p><p>
    That sonic blandness makes Manson the focus of <em>Bleed Like Me</em>, and while her vocals retain their forceful determination, her lyrics sound uninspired and awkward. ""True love is like gold/ There's not enough to go around,"" she sings on ""Sex Is Not the Enemy"", a generic post-Janetgate call to arms. ""But then there's god and doesn't god love everyone?"" It's doubtful even the chorus-- ""A revolution is the solution""-- will change anyone's mind or even preach to the perverted. The album's nadir, ""Sex Is Not the Enemy"" is a surprisingly naïve track, unimaginative and silly, and it works better as a parody of a protest song than as an actual protest song.</p><p>
    The disappointments color even some of the album's better moments. The first single, ""Why Do You Love Me"", is heavy and frenetic with a feverishly stomping chorus, but the verses and the whispered bridge recall <i>Tragic Kingdom</i>-era ""Just a Girl"" power and the song, despite its undeniable energy, ends up sounding dated. Likewise, Manson's catchy chorus and dancing-queen delivery on ""Boys Wanna Fight"" are marred by the song's predictable gender roles; with a little of the androgyny of ""Androgyny"", the song could easily fade into Franz Ferdinand's ""Michael"" on any dancefloor mix.</p><p>
    The saving grace of <em>Bleed Like Me</em> may be the band's deep knowledge of rock history, which they have gleefully plundered in the past and which gives the album its only subversive spark. ""Bad Boyfriend"" cribs Foreignor's ""Hot Blooded"" almost note for note, twisting its words into a new meaning. And the propulsive ""Run Baby Run""-- the album's best track-- builds off the Crystals' ""Da Do Ron Ron"", adding an almost playful edge to Manson's dark lyrics.</p><p>
    But it's just not enough. Despite attempts at audacity, <em>Bleed Like Me</em> sounds overly willing to please, which is all the more damning because it so rarely does.</p></div>"|3397.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3397-bleed-like-me/|4.5|Stephen M. Deusner

Do today's cardigan undergrad massive not appreciate one of the key DNA strands of what we once unironically referred to as Alternative Rock? Was this the final victory of new wave? Will no one else admit to sporting a homemade puffy paint Black Flag t-shirt for the whole of ninth grade?</p><p>
    
    It's not wholly surprising, given the deathless nature of early 80s nostalgia at the moment. The SST bands (and Dinosaur were proud to be on the label until they realized Greg Ginn's accountant was Houdini) rocked unashamedly, something very few bands do in 2005. It's understandable, given how many current rock bands came up in the 90s, a decade of unashamed rocking by unreconstructed doofuses like Collective Soul. Irony and earnestness are a precarious balance, and once hardcore went mainstream, beginning with Nirvana and peaking with Dashboard, a swerve towards brittleness and arched brows was inevitable, maybe even desirable. (Bright Eyes, ""O.C."" Mixtapes, and Matrix-rocking girl-pop shoot that theory to hell. Oh well!)</p><p>
    
    The band was nothing if not earnest, but those impulses were balanced by a gentle, aw-shucks bewilderment. They were-- and either enough time has now elapsed, or I'm going to turn into a pumpkin for writing this-- the quintessential slacker band. I'm not going to detail the WMD-grade antipathy going on in the band at the time these albums were recorded, but clearly J, Lou, and Murph had yet to develop what Dr. Phil would deem fully formed personalities. They're forgiven this because, in true ""Behind the Music"" style, their inability to interact with any sense of decency may have been part of the combustion that made them one of the best guitar rock bands of my lifetime.</p><p>
    
    Dinosaur were initially called Deep Wound, and played a particularly speedy and rectilinear form of hardcore that somehow wound its way across the pond and into the hands of the bands who would basically create grindcore and death metal. After the usual line-up shuffling (off to college, home from college, I don't like you anymore) and maturation (wow, there's other music than rat-a-tat 200bpm speedcore out there), they became Dinosaur. J Mascis switched from drums to a guitar that he took to playing as loud and hard as possible because it didn't have the bruising capabilities of his beloved kit. Lou Barlow played bass, not badly but too enthralled by half with Peter Hook. Murph played drums and was Murph.</p><p>
<i>Dinosaur</i> (the Jr. got safety pinned on after they became famous when a dinosaur Dinosaur came crawling out of the woodwork to protest) is, like many albums made by people just out of high school, stylistically incontinent. (This a polite way of saying it's a fucking mess.) There was all this cool music out there, new and old, and Dinosaur wanted to sound like all of it, with a hardcore base. Opener ""Bulbs of Passion"" cribs from Sonic Youth; ""Forget the Swan"" is an outtake from The Cure's <i>Three Imaginary Boys</i>; ""Cats in a Bowl"" shoulda called itself ""Burger Marionettes"", etc.</p><p>
    
    All the songs feel like they go on longer than they should. The confusion is right there on the back cover photo. J wears his love of the Birthday Party atop his head. (Nice pendant, dungeon master.) Lou looks like Sally Jesse Raphael has just violently possessed the body of Superchunk's Mac with styling by Bill Cosby. Murph looks like he should be working at 1985 Texaco (or be in Journey's ""Separate Ways"" video). This is actually quite charming in a moment when bands spring fully formed from a stylist's imagination into their perfectly mediated debut albums within six months (coughkasbiankaiserchiefsbraverycough).</p><p>
    
    It's amazing what a little growing up in public and support from your idols will do for you. In two short years, Dino went from bar band nobodies to a pop-noise outfit with a panzer attack and a heart of gold. The move to SST surely bolstered their confidence, and J's zen despondency over the guitar (he may have wanted it to sound more like drums, but you get the feeling he would have been just as happy playing a zither if it could get really heavy) burst into a particular volcanic ooze of proto-indie.</p><p>
    
    Dino cut all the excess ruffage from their diet, and Murph and Lou locked into a tuff little unit that made Joe ""I like rock, me"" Carducci and Ginn want to sign them in the first place. Even the solos feel like they're being corralled by their burgeoning pop instincts. If they lumber, it's a tuneful lumbering. They discovered the sweet spot between Black Sabbath and the Buzzcocks, which every carpetbagging grunge chancer (and one or two geniuses) took to the mall a few years later. (Though, to be fair, without the grunge chancers, I'd have maybe never heard of Dino in the first place.)</p><p>
    
    The album opens with skreeching chalkboard feedback before switching up for REM engineered by Swamp Thing. The opening of ""Tarpit"" casually invents all the parts of emo Rites of Spring didn't invent first, but then decides to, like, totally fucking shred. ""Poledo"", on the other hand, invents everything icky and solipsistic about indie rock in the 90s: Lou fishing for chicks in his bedroom with a four-track, an acoustic guitar, and some Stockhausen-by-way-of-Fisher-Price pause-button edits. It all climaxes with their immortal (and surprisingly reverent) cover of the Cure's ""Just Like Heaven"", which is a lot of fun but can't hold a candle to any of the live versions of this era, where J took the second solo as an opportunity to rend a hole in the space-time continuum. If you have any interest at all in rock music, the electric guitar, good songs, the freed weed, or teenage ennui, buy this album. Key lines: ""I'll be waiting by your window/ Please come pat me on the head/ I just want to find out/ What you're nice to me for.""</p><p>
<i>Bug</i> was recorded a year later as Dino crested on a wave of goodwill, good press, and international touring. ""Freak Scene"" is probably indie rock's greatest guitar performance and the band's greatest pop song, somehow finding room for Psychedelic Furs jangle, Edge-style ascending harmonies, Eddie Van Halen in the drunk tank, pickled country, and a cherry on top in three and a half minutes without feeling at all cluttered. ""What a mess,"" maybe, but worlds away from their debut. <i>Bug</i> is a tighter and cleaner a whole, and you can hear why they would soon be courted by major labels getting their noses open by first alt-rock drops of blood.</p><p>
    
    You can also hear the influence/feedback loop Dino had after razing London, specifically the combo of distant sounding feedback washes and Byrdsy plucking that closes ""No Bones"", a sound cut-rate shoegazers would milk for another six years at least. ""Yeah We Know"" turns like a tank's treads flipped in the mud, each crunching snare hit at the end of the verse tricking you into think the song's about to end. ""Pond Song"" showcases what a subtly clever drummer Murph was when the noise got stripped away, and ""Budge"" is a testament to the virtues of straight-ahead pounding. ""Keep The Glove"" is a jaunty little end tune, but it was pretty sadistic to make Lou scream ""why don't you like me?"" over and over on ""Don't"", when it was increasingly clear on stage that no one in this band liked anyone. It all collapsed, absurdly half-assedly, shortly after the <i>Bug</i> tour when J made Murph fire Lou who didn't even get the hint at first.</p><p>
    
    Dino were pretty much done at this point, though Mascis released a few more decent albums under the name-- <i>Where You Been</i>, in particular, was a fine slice of overlong, rangy grunge pop. Barlow formed Sebadoh, indie rock's longest running ugly late-night post-breakup phone call, and then what Stephen Malkmus neatly summarized as ""the thing with the loops."" Murph diminished into the west and remained Murph. The world suffered through a lot of bad loud-quiet-loud by guys in gas station jackets. The albums went out of print, and we sufficed with an aptly named best-of, <i>Ear-Bleeding Country</i>. Now Merge has reissued them in excellent new mixes (the SST version of <i>You're Living All Over Me</i> in particular sounded as if it had been recorded on gauze through a metal funnel) with good photos, liner notes, and slightly rejigged tracklists. Unfashionable or not, here's a band who cut through on nothing but heft, volume, songcraft, earnestness, and a kind of underrated virtuosity. Even if the on-record response was whatever, man. </p></div>"|11719.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11719-dinosaur-youre-living-all-over-me-bug/|6.2|Jess Harvell

Do today's cardigan undergrad massive not appreciate one of the key DNA strands of what we once unironically referred to as Alternative Rock? Was this the final victory of new wave? Will no one else admit to sporting a homemade puffy paint Black Flag t-shirt for the whole of ninth grade?</p><p>
    
    It's not wholly surprising, given the deathless nature of early 80s nostalgia at the moment. The SST bands (and Dinosaur were proud to be on the label until they realized Greg Ginn's accountant was Houdini) rocked unashamedly, something very few bands do in 2005. It's understandable, given how many current rock bands came up in the 90s, a decade of unashamed rocking by unreconstructed doofuses like Collective Soul. Irony and earnestness are a precarious balance, and once hardcore went mainstream, beginning with Nirvana and peaking with Dashboard, a swerve towards brittleness and arched brows was inevitable, maybe even desirable. (Bright Eyes, ""O.C."" Mixtapes, and Matrix-rocking girl-pop shoot that theory to hell. Oh well!)</p><p>
    
    The band was nothing if not earnest, but those impulses were balanced by a gentle, aw-shucks bewilderment. They were-- and either enough time has now elapsed, or I'm going to turn into a pumpkin for writing this-- the quintessential slacker band. I'm not going to detail the WMD-grade antipathy going on in the band at the time these albums were recorded, but clearly J, Lou, and Murph had yet to develop what Dr. Phil would deem fully formed personalities. They're forgiven this because, in true ""Behind the Music"" style, their inability to interact with any sense of decency may have been part of the combustion that made them one of the best guitar rock bands of my lifetime.</p><p>
    
    Dinosaur were initially called Deep Wound, and played a particularly speedy and rectilinear form of hardcore that somehow wound its way across the pond and into the hands of the bands who would basically create grindcore and death metal. After the usual line-up shuffling (off to college, home from college, I don't like you anymore) and maturation (wow, there's other music than rat-a-tat 200bpm speedcore out there), they became Dinosaur. J Mascis switched from drums to a guitar that he took to playing as loud and hard as possible because it didn't have the bruising capabilities of his beloved kit. Lou Barlow played bass, not badly but too enthralled by half with Peter Hook. Murph played drums and was Murph.</p><p>
<i>Dinosaur</i> (the Jr. got safety pinned on after they became famous when a dinosaur Dinosaur came crawling out of the woodwork to protest) is, like many albums made by people just out of high school, stylistically incontinent. (This a polite way of saying it's a fucking mess.) There was all this cool music out there, new and old, and Dinosaur wanted to sound like all of it, with a hardcore base. Opener ""Bulbs of Passion"" cribs from Sonic Youth; ""Forget the Swan"" is an outtake from The Cure's <i>Three Imaginary Boys</i>; ""Cats in a Bowl"" shoulda called itself ""Burger Marionettes"", etc.</p><p>
    
    All the songs feel like they go on longer than they should. The confusion is right there on the back cover photo. J wears his love of the Birthday Party atop his head. (Nice pendant, dungeon master.) Lou looks like Sally Jesse Raphael has just violently possessed the body of Superchunk's Mac with styling by Bill Cosby. Murph looks like he should be working at 1985 Texaco (or be in Journey's ""Separate Ways"" video). This is actually quite charming in a moment when bands spring fully formed from a stylist's imagination into their perfectly mediated debut albums within six months (coughkasbiankaiserchiefsbraverycough).</p><p>
    
    It's amazing what a little growing up in public and support from your idols will do for you. In two short years, Dino went from bar band nobodies to a pop-noise outfit with a panzer attack and a heart of gold. The move to SST surely bolstered their confidence, and J's zen despondency over the guitar (he may have wanted it to sound more like drums, but you get the feeling he would have been just as happy playing a zither if it could get really heavy) burst into a particular volcanic ooze of proto-indie.</p><p>
    
    Dino cut all the excess ruffage from their diet, and Murph and Lou locked into a tuff little unit that made Joe ""I like rock, me"" Carducci and Ginn want to sign them in the first place. Even the solos feel like they're being corralled by their burgeoning pop instincts. If they lumber, it's a tuneful lumbering. They discovered the sweet spot between Black Sabbath and the Buzzcocks, which every carpetbagging grunge chancer (and one or two geniuses) took to the mall a few years later. (Though, to be fair, without the grunge chancers, I'd have maybe never heard of Dino in the first place.)</p><p>
    
    The album opens with skreeching chalkboard feedback before switching up for REM engineered by Swamp Thing. The opening of ""Tarpit"" casually invents all the parts of emo Rites of Spring didn't invent first, but then decides to, like, totally fucking shred. ""Poledo"", on the other hand, invents everything icky and solipsistic about indie rock in the 90s: Lou fishing for chicks in his bedroom with a four-track, an acoustic guitar, and some Stockhausen-by-way-of-Fisher-Price pause-button edits. It all climaxes with their immortal (and surprisingly reverent) cover of the Cure's ""Just Like Heaven"", which is a lot of fun but can't hold a candle to any of the live versions of this era, where J took the second solo as an opportunity to rend a hole in the space-time continuum. If you have any interest at all in rock music, the electric guitar, good songs, the freed weed, or teenage ennui, buy this album. Key lines: ""I'll be waiting by your window/ Please come pat me on the head/ I just want to find out/ What you're nice to me for.""</p><p>
<i>Bug</i> was recorded a year later as Dino crested on a wave of goodwill, good press, and international touring. ""Freak Scene"" is probably indie rock's greatest guitar performance and the band's greatest pop song, somehow finding room for Psychedelic Furs jangle, Edge-style ascending harmonies, Eddie Van Halen in the drunk tank, pickled country, and a cherry on top in three and a half minutes without feeling at all cluttered. ""What a mess,"" maybe, but worlds away from their debut. <i>Bug</i> is a tighter and cleaner a whole, and you can hear why they would soon be courted by major labels getting their noses open by first alt-rock drops of blood.</p><p>
    
    You can also hear the influence/feedback loop Dino had after razing London, specifically the combo of distant sounding feedback washes and Byrdsy plucking that closes ""No Bones"", a sound cut-rate shoegazers would milk for another six years at least. ""Yeah We Know"" turns like a tank's treads flipped in the mud, each crunching snare hit at the end of the verse tricking you into think the song's about to end. ""Pond Song"" showcases what a subtly clever drummer Murph was when the noise got stripped away, and ""Budge"" is a testament to the virtues of straight-ahead pounding. ""Keep The Glove"" is a jaunty little end tune, but it was pretty sadistic to make Lou scream ""why don't you like me?"" over and over on ""Don't"", when it was increasingly clear on stage that no one in this band liked anyone. It all collapsed, absurdly half-assedly, shortly after the <i>Bug</i> tour when J made Murph fire Lou who didn't even get the hint at first.</p><p>
    
    Dino were pretty much done at this point, though Mascis released a few more decent albums under the name-- <i>Where You Been</i>, in particular, was a fine slice of overlong, rangy grunge pop. Barlow formed Sebadoh, indie rock's longest running ugly late-night post-breakup phone call, and then what Stephen Malkmus neatly summarized as ""the thing with the loops."" Murph diminished into the west and remained Murph. The world suffered through a lot of bad loud-quiet-loud by guys in gas station jackets. The albums went out of print, and we sufficed with an aptly named best-of, <i>Ear-Bleeding Country</i>. Now Merge has reissued them in excellent new mixes (the SST version of <i>You're Living All Over Me</i> in particular sounded as if it had been recorded on gauze through a metal funnel) with good photos, liner notes, and slightly rejigged tracklists. Unfashionable or not, here's a band who cut through on nothing but heft, volume, songcraft, earnestness, and a kind of underrated virtuosity. Even if the on-record response was whatever, man. </p></div>"|11719.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11719-dinosaur-youre-living-all-over-me-bug/|7.3|Jess Harvell

    and Oldhamesque Americana. Despite those stylistic shifts, Jurado's dolorous tenor
    and elliptical narratives-- his songs resonate
    with the verbal economy and hallucinatory clarity of Raymond Carver's
    short stories-- have been constants. Also like Carver, Jurado has undertaken a dystopian survey of
    lower-middle-class American life. His heartland is populated by
    divorcees on train platforms, schizophrenic brothers, unhappy lovers
    trysting in secret, and world-weary teen runaways-- transient souls,
    out of love, with relationships doomed by untenable circumstances.</p><p>
    
    On his most recent full-length, <em>Where Shall You Take Me</em>, Jurado's
    lyrics remained on point, but he traded in his emoting for a
    more measured, meandering style that seemed rather flat. If his recent
    <em>Just in Time for Something</em> EP presaged a partial return to
    form, <em>On My Way to Absence</em> cements it: Jurado is back to doing
    what he does best-- pairing simple, sprightly arrangements with 
    mobile
    vocal melodies. One of those singers who can make bitterness sounds
    sweet, he cops a coarser, more forceful vocal turn than usual on the
    emblematic ""Lion Tamer"", a dreamy haze of piano, guitar, and
    resentment masquerading as apathy: ""You are nothing to me now.""</p><p>
    
    While Jurado's lyrics have shed a bit of their specificity and
    retreated into a vaguer, more archetypal lovelorn stance, <em>On My Way
    to Absence</em>'s melodies and arrangements are some of the catchiest,
    most translucently beautiful we've heard from him since <em>Ghost of
    David</em>. On album opener ""White Center"", Jurado adopts a
    mealy mouthed slur that makes it difficult to make out much of the
    content, but its easy gentility trumps its inscrutability.</p><p>
    
    ""Lottery"", slicked with honeyed hums, recalls <em>Where Will You Take
    Me</em>'s elegiac ""Matinee"". The velvety harmonies and quivering
    strings of ""Big Decision"" usher in a more hopeful sentiment: ""Got a
    lot of problems, think I'll work it out."" ""Simple Hello"" is the sort
    of spare, smoldering rock that Jason Molina might have cooked up in
    his Songs:Ohia guise, and the poppy folk-rock of ""Sucker"" is a
    throwback to Jurado's <em>Rehearsals for Departure</em>.</p><p>
    
    This is another fine entry in a varied yet consistent career, and
    while it isn't Jurado's most daring work, it is among his most
    immediately engaging. The characters are blurrier at the edges, less
    strikingly defined, but the melodies are bold and vivid. All things
    equal, a story's told and it's done, but a melody is a book that never
    stops writing itself. It's melody that brings us back to a song over
    and over, and it's melody-- rich, fragrant and utterly human-- that
    Jurado leaves hanging copiously in his wake on his way to absence.</p></div>"|4329.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4329-on-my-way-to-absence/|7.3|Brian Howe

They dress like spangley futuristic mime robots, which I suppose is sort of annoying, but that really doesn't have anything to do with their music. They bankrupted their record label and waited way too long to put their first album out, but again, all that stuff is strictly extra-musical. They actively and knowingly marketed themselves as electroclash, but Fischerspooner has much more in common musically with the Scissor Sisters than Miss Kittin or A.R.E. Weapons. They've never managed to make anything as great as their first single, but then ""Emerge"" was such a dizzy, searing monster jam that it'd be hopeless to hold any group to that standard forever.</p><p>
    
    So the only real reason I can think of to hate Fisherspooner is the vwerdle-vwerdle-vwerdle oscillating synth-bass sound they use on every single song. This can grow tired after an entire album, but it's a good, malleable sound, as effective on breathy, luxuriant opium-disco tunes like ""A Cloud"" as on swooping, lazy filter-Fleetwood-Mac tracks like ""Happy"". And plus you can ratchet up the pitch a bunch on the chorus and the song will automatically sounds way more intense.</p><p>
    
    On <i>Odyssey</i>, the group piles on huge, clattering drums, mournful house pianos, deliriously sleazy strutting white-funk guitars. The album's production is clean enough to sterilize needles; everything has a lavish, glossy cocaine sheen. The group has recruited help from pop-music pros like Mirwais (who produced Madonna's ""Music"", which is fucking awesome) and Linda Perry (who wrote Pink's ""Get This Party Started"", which is fucking awesome). They got the now deceased Susan Sontag to write the lyrics for ""We Need a War"", which is nice, but it's not like anyone ever listens to the lyrics on Fischerspooner songs.</p><p>
<i>Odyssey</i> is Fischerspooner's attempt at kicking and screaming their way out of punchline hell, so it's a bit of a surprise how good everything sounds. The deluxe, swirley disco tracks that begin the album slide nicely into the brittle new-wave funk and imperiously sighed synthed ballads. All of this builds beautifully to the group's cover of the Boredoms' smeary psychedelic symphony ""Circle"". It's something of a shock hearing the Boredoms' messy drum-circle monolith translated through Fischerspooner's glammy synths, but the group approaches the song with the majestic fervor it demands, and the result is a truly gorgeous pileup.</p><p>
<i>Odyssey</i> isn't a great album: Many of the vocal hooks are weak and underfed, the group never finds the widescreen abandon of ""Emerge"", and there's that synth burble on every song. But the group has managed to come up with an appealingly grand, ridiculous epic, more than anyone could reasonably expect from these forgotten freaks. So find some other band to hate. May I suggest Kings of Leon?</p></div>"|3074.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3074-odyssey/|7.3|Tom Breihan

Originally released in an LP-only edition of 1,000, the group's debut album <i>Speed</i> has, despite its scarcity, remained one of the quintessential documents of the scene. And now, packed with four previously unreleased bonus tracks, this handsome new reissue illustrates that the intervening years have done little to diminish this music's pulverizing force.</p><p>
    
    With their complex song structures and dynamic rhythms, Crain bore enough resemblance to their local contemporaries to secure the always-irksome math rock tag, but in truth their sound was significantly heavier and more visceral than that vague categorization usually implies. Produced with typical unvarnished ferocity by Steve Albini, <i>Speed</i> is a merciless pummel from beginning to end, its brutally precise, thickly-coated riffs delivered with just enough melodic guile to lure the weary listener back inside for further exposure.</p><p>
    
    At the time of <i>Speed</i>'s recording, Crain consisted of vocalist/guitarist Joey Mudd, bassist Jon Cook, guitarist Tim Furnish, and drummer Will Chatham. (An early version of the group featured future Matmos maverick and Pitchfork wag Drew Daniel on vocals.) On the group's best tracks, such as the opening ""Car Crash Decisions"", the locomotive ""Proposed Production"", or the drag-strip ready ""King Octane"" the quartet function as a unit of almost-perfect cohesion, cornering their battleship riffs as though on rails. Each instrument is given equal weight in Albini's bracing 8-track mix, and each player proves capable of shouldering his share, although Mudd's abrasive, tormented screams are often unable to fully surface above the guitars' black, choppy waves.</p><p>
    
    It's never easy to accurately gauge what influence a particular album has truly had, especially one with such a limited initial release. Suffice it to say, however, that at the very least <i>Speed</i> was eerily prescient in anticipating much of the subsequent work of such acts as Helmet, Jawbox and Drive Like Jehu. One could even make the argument that just maybe Albini took a few of Crain's best ideas along with him to Shellac, although naysayers would probably be just as quick to point out Crain's debts to Big Black. At any rate, fans of nervy, aggressive post-punk thud should find plenty to celebrate in this reissue, enough to hopefully spread <i>Speed</i>'s influence even further into the future.</p></div>"|1803.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1803-speed/|7.5|Matthew Murphy

In gym class, even if you're not that athletic you can still get that ""A"" by looking absolutely titillated during racquetball, and a little flaky bullshitting never hurt in job interviews (""Oh yes, I have a passion for burger flipping!""). And, of course, a little gusto never hurt in rock music. Without it Ocean Colour Scene would still be shambling from gig to gig in Birmingham, yet something's fishy about their sixth album's cocksure title.</p><p>
    
    Don't get me wrong; they love their rock, but there's nothing ""hyperactive"" about them creatively. Guitarist Steve Cradock has undoubtedly logged countless hours absorbing classic rock fakebooks, and singer Simon Fowler attacks every song like a karaoke fiend-- a telling likeness considering three songs here are covers and several more could be misconstrued as such. How else could Fowler do his best Steve Perry on ""Another Time to Stay"" and then ape Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy on ""Have You Got the Right"", or Cradock unironically play the spandex-laden arena rock riff on ""Everything Comes at the Right Time""?</p><p>
    
    Then again, there's no reason to expect a change. Ever since Liam Gallagher dubbed them ""the second-best band in Britain"" (after Oasis, obviously) in the mid-nineties, OCS have milked a Muscle Shoals/Small Faces/Mod rock fusion with little deviation but plenty of aplomb. Single ""Free My Name"" flaunts fiddles, banjos, and campfire harmonies like a musical cousin of Rod Stewart's ""Maggie May"". The thoughtlessly titled ""I Love You"", but Fowler's fervent theatrics almost dupe you into thinking he just invented the monster ballad.</p><p>
    
    Occasionally their zeal pays off. ""Free My Name"" impeccably emulates the Spector sound and Fowler's got the pipes to pull off a respectable Motown howl. The cover of George Harrison's ""Wha Wha"" shows good taste, but (sigh) overeager beefy guitars and stadium-sized drumming detract from the luscious vocal hook. I've rooted for these guys because they nearly achieve that fine mix between tackiness and genius perfected by bands like T. Rex and the Darkness. Unfortunately, I can only give them points for effort.</p></div>"|5938.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5938-a-hyperactive-workout-for-the-flying-squad/|5.5|Adam Moerder

    recessed synthesizers, and bright major-key leads of <em>Open
    Season</em>'s first three tracks aren't proof enough, ""Like a
    Honeycomb"" seals it: British Sea Power have followed a clamorous post-punk debut with an album of unexpectedly gentle new-wave guitar pop that touches on, to name a few, early Cure, the Smiths, Echo and the Bunnymen,
    David Bowie, the Psychedelic Furs, and, most blatantly, <em>Bossanova</em>-era Pixies.</p><p>
    
    While the entirety of this unvaried but engaging sophomore album has
    the nostalgic feel of 80s new wave gone arena rock, it's ""Like a
    Honeycomb"" that really tips British Sea Power's hand. The track
    recasts the Talking Heads' anti-consumerism screed ""Once in a Lifetime""
    as make-out music for a middle-school prom, transmuting stark synths
    into arena-folk strumming and stepping all over the chorus, lyrically
    and melodically: ""In between the morning and the evening light/
    That's how the days go by,"" Yan sings with gruff abandon. It's more
    bombastic and syrupy, less paranoid and stiltedly funky, but
    unmistakably indebted.</p><p>
    
    Same as it ever was: British Sea Power's accessible new sound wasn't
    conjured out of thin air; these same pop melodies lurked under the
    distressed surface of their debut. You just had to listen closely-- around the strident guitars and train-wrecking rhythms, the barked
    love song to Dostoevsky and the evil dwarf harmonies-- to find them.
    <em>Open Season</em> inverts <em>The Decline of British Sea Power</em>'s
    ratio of melody to dissonance, weaving thin threads of discord through
    sunny expanses.</p><p>
    
    For a band known for unpredictability and idiosyncrasy-- performing in
    World War I regalia for no discernible reason, decorating their stages
    with fresh-cut local foliage, and interpolating their post-punk
    pastorales with violent outbursts and prerecorded birdsongs-- wrangling their esoteric lyrics into simple verse/chorus/verse
    patterns and rounding off the acute angles of their guitars is rather
    ingenious. They've unpredictably become predictable.</p><p>
    
    Predictability, in the context of a record review, isn't usually a
    compliment. But a one-trick pony's not so bad if it's a good enough
    trick, and the resultant feeling of familiarity will be more akin to that of a kid anticipating another long summer than a jaded adult staring down the barrel of another work week.</p><p>
    
    Retaining his arcane subjects but couching them in deceptively simple
    terms, Yan traffics in some tricky lyrical inversions. If
    you want to sing about death in a pop song, you've got to make it
    sound as if you're singing about love, and at least two songs on
    <em>Open Season</em> pull this off. On ""It Ended on an Oily Stage"", Yan
    sings ""I wrote elegiac stanzas for you/ I hope and pray that they
    come true"" with such earnest tenderness that it takes a minute to
    register that an elegy is a lament for someone deceased.</p><p>
    
    ""North Hanging Rock""-- a weightless, atmospheric trellis that guitar
    and piano snake through like ivy-- is the most superficially sweet song
    about death (""Drape yourself in greenery/ Become part of the
    scenery"") this side of Modest Mouse.
    And on ""Oh Larsen B"", Yan's invitation to his ""favorite foremost
    coastal Antarctic shelf"" to ""fall on me"" could be construed as either
    lovelorn or suicidal. By maintaining their singular aesthetic while
    venturing into more inviting pop sounds, the weirdest band from
    Brighton just might have become the smartest.</p></div>"|1080.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1080-open-season/|7.8|Brian Howe

The colors of the inner CD booklets are bright, practically joyous (and psychedelic), but with a soft tint-- pleasant rather than brash. And just as the band decks its sleeves in flawlessly crafted fonts and color-combinations, the music contained therein hums and writhes in counterpoint with sunshine precision. It's not so much that their songs were ""technical""; rather, they were like smooth-edged, powder-blue pebbles in a jewelry store-- not as immediately demanding of attention as some of their diamond-studded contemporaries (Simon &amp; Garfunkel, the Beach Boys), but somehow even more purely expressive, if in a precious, idealized way. These records (1970's <i>Sing For Very Important People</i>, 1971's <i>One By One</i>, and 1972's <i>There Is a Song</i>) track their movement into almost mystical ""easy listening"", quite possibly too much for some punk-baptized listeners. Still, like rare stones, the Free Design remind me how classic beauty and form can still be interesting.</p>
<p><i>Sing For Very Important People</i> is something of a children's album, replete with songs about cowboys, Sesame Street, familiar Free Design pastimes of kites, bubbles and even a short lullaby at the end. According to Bruce Dedrick (who would leave the band following this record), the album was partially inspired by Mary Travers becoming a mother (she of big folk-pop players Peter, Paul &amp; Mary)-- if that seems twee, just remember Belle &amp; Sebastian named themselves after a French kid's show. Chris Dedrick's opener ""Don't Cry, Baby"" uses lightly melancholy, but just as exquisitely placed vocal harmonies to impart its message of perseverance and love.

    vegetables. No TV till you finish your homework. No slobbery makeout
    attempts till you've had a conversation, or at least six drinks each.
    Avoid lame rockwriterisms like ""languid,"" ""pastoral,"" or ""soundscapes.""
    And never, never mix 60s throwback good-time rock'n'roll with languid
    pastoral soundscapes.</p><p>
    
    North Carolina husband/wife duo the Rosebuds may not break many rules,
    but they do challenge that last one. The
    <em>Nuggets</em>-distilled exuberance of the catchiest tunes from their
    2003 debut, <em>Make Out</em>, twists and shouts through half of their
    new six-song <em>Unwind</em> EP. The shimmery lullabies that seemed to
    break up the first record's party like an unexpected parental arrival
    flesh out the rest, and while they're still not as fun as the retro
    yeah-yeah whatsits, they make for a welcome, hazy comedown-- coasting
    home at 3 a.m. in a taxi instead of waiting for the subway.</p><p>
    
    Like dessert or TV, The Rosebuds' uptempo numbers are sweet, immediate,
    and familiar. Singer/guitarist Ivan Howard's rowdy pipes sound ideal
    for roaring through ""Mustang Sally"", but instead they're quoting Sonny
    Bono (""the beat goes on"")-- at least on punchy first track ""You Better
    Get Ready"". Howard's inevitable ""ahh""s and ""hey-hey""s and collaborator
    Kelly Crisp's jumpy keyboards pick up where the debut's raucous ""Kicks
    in the Schoolyard"" left off. Brassy ""Edmund Street"" tosses in
    snakes-and-ladders piano solos and smoldering ""Spirit in the Sky"" lead
    guitar. ""I'd Feel Better"" closes the disc with teenage heartache and
    teenage <i>schadenfreude</i> (what's the diff, really?) over the same
    straight-ahead rhythm the Strokes nicked from the Velvets, or was it
    Modern Lovers? Either way it still gets the kids to maybe consider
    shaking what Chuck Taylor gave 'em.</p><p>
    
    Like fresh vegetables or a Henry James novel, the slow songs are less
    fun and more demanding, but nearly as rewarding after they're
    digested. The deliberate ""El Camino"" is as spacious as Grandaddy's ""El
    Caminos in the West"" and as distortedly anthemic as the last few bars
    of Radiohead's ""Creep"". ""Is There Room?"" shuffles softly a la the
    debut's ""Big Heartbreak"", Howard's double-tracked vocals reflecting
    across a dusty hall of mirrors like Britt Daniel singing M. Ward.</p><p>
    
    The
    title track's synth string-soaked postmodern lounge-pop reminds me of
    (oh god oh god oh god) the last two or three Sugar Ray hits. Not
    unfavorably! So rules are rules and breaking them can be
    good/revelatory but sometimes weird, like boxer-briefs or dessert
    before dinner or ""Falls Apart"" or, uh, I'd better go.</p></div>"|6890.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6890-unwind-ep/|7.0|Marc Hogan

But with grime shifting the focus to the MC and the outsized personality, it's been far easier to pick and choose by who's got the best voice, the best bars, the most magnetic mic presence. (If I had space, I could also get into murky sociological discussion about the negative influence of America and abandoning a highly developed DIY economy for scraps from the major label table.) But with Terror Danjah's Aftershock, Davinchie's Paperchase, and, the one we've gathered here today to talk about, DJ Target's Aim High, grime is finally starting to develop a community of record labels that rank with UK post-rave's best.</p><p>
    
    As a producer, Target is one of grime's top boys, and I talk about him more in depth <a href=""http://pitchforkmedia.com/features/weekly/05-03-21-they-dont-know.shtml""><u>here</u></a>. The first Aim High mixtape relied too heavily on nicked US rap beats buffeted by a handful of amazing grime riddims. This one is all East London and all gravy.</p><p>
    
    Riko's ""Critical"" sets the stakes for everyone involved (""I ain't even got half a grand/ I'm bang on the penny"") and I bet you relate. Dogzilla's ""Never Ending Story"" conflates the cinematic reject from a cut-rate Henson creature shop with his own days on the grind. Target's hypnotic revamp of Sadie &amp; Kano's ""So Sure"" spreads the creamy vocals and heartswell synth pulses over a grunting, pixilated bassline and rat-at-tat drums. Roll Deep continue their inexplicable slide into mawkishness with Wiley's ""Be Yourself""-- all cloying soft-soul piano trills and unctuous male R&amp;B; chorus. So be careful you don't snap your neck with Crazy Titch's freestyle, a crazed Balkan barrage of corkscrewing fiddle, concrete block beats, and edge-of-hysteria vocals.</p><p>
    
    Riko's ""Don't Want You Back"" serves an ungrateful lover their walking papers over a tablamatic riddim with flickers of 80s metal guitar snaking through. Then Roll Deep earns back a smidgen of my grudging affection with the serpentine, buzzing ""Don't Choke"". (Later, they get keys to my apartment and my ATM pin number with the aptly titled ""Hardcore"".) Riko and Godsgift's ""Dead That"" is a classic Wiley-sounding cello-bass gunman tune with particularly aggro warlord MC'ing. Breeze's ""Marching On"" sounds like a quiet storm slowjam subjected to the Todd Edwards treament, liquefied and poured over some sizzling cymbals. Breeze's ""Be Like This"" may be the funkiest grime tune yet, swinging along to a gabba terror synth snipped into a bassline. Except it may be pipped by Dream's ""Get It Done"" which, gulp, reminds me of Kanye's production for Mark Spitz's ""One More For Me"". On ""Cuz Freestyle"", Flowdan calls himself ""the human iPod"" (is that sillier than Bruza claiming he's ""running past you in the game like Sonic the Hedgehog""?) over stalker strings.</p><p>
    
    If the above made you a little dizzy, wait till you hear it: Twenty-five songs crashing into each other, crushing for space, vying for your attention. Unlike jungle or UKG, with their built in stutters and beat barbs, there's little in the way of a comforting pulse to latch onto in grime. The effect is more like dancehall (little actual mixing, just slapping intensities down next to each other) or rap mixtapes (content overload.) Grime can actually be a little wearying at more than forty-five minutes a pop. But this needs to be heard for anyone interested in current beatmaking state-of-the-art.</p></div>"|2604.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2604-aim-high-vol-2/|8.5|Jess Harvell

The smog is terrible, energy costs are ridiculous, its cities are overcrowded, and, hell, things got so bad its residents turned to the conservative Arnold Schwarzenegger for political guidance. Due to this discord, bright-eyed California bands like Grandaddy and Beachwood Sparks still carry the torch ""Surfin' Safari"" lit 40-some years ago, though grim undercurrents like technology and pollution bog down what would otherwise be a happy-go-lucky sound. And yet, the Radar Bros. are an ultra-mellow California trio whose previous three LPs combined couldn't wake a baby.</p><p>
    
    Frontman Jim Putnam's voice is still softer than the Charmin bear and each song has the noise and intensity of an ocean breeze. Even with his most perturbed lyrics, Putnam maintains a lulling half-whisper while delivering his playfully winding, Wilson-esque melodies. However, although most of the tracks resemble permutations of <i>Pet Sounds</i> and Zombies chord progressions, the persistent dark undertones can't be ignored.</p><p>
    
    Like Neil Young's <i>After the Gold Rush</i>, <i>The Fallen Leaf Pages</i> was recorded in Los Angeles but sounds distinctly un-L.A.. It opens with the gentle acoustic strums of ""Faces of the Damned"", a disillusioned dirge lamenting the city's violence and debauchery: ""Women lie...so gaudily on bus stop benches/ The sunlight making sure of the hatred on their faces."" Most songs, however, opt for a more implicit protest consisting of bucolic backdrops and somber pensiveness, two staple subjects not exclusive to any one Radar Bros. record. ""The River Shade"", ""The Fish"", and ""Sometime, Awhile Ago"" musically and lyrically sum up the Radar Bros. sound, and their proximity on <i>The Fallen Leaf Pages</i> emphasizes the band's monotonous songwriting.</p><p>
    
    ""To Remember"" begins with a tense, jazzy piano line that unfortunately dissipates into a drowsy two-chord verse. ""Papillon"" churns like an angry Elliott Smith waltz, with piercing guitar licks complementing Putnam's dejected vocals. However, they're too often content to toy with a folksy acoustic shuffle and unabashedly sport their Beach Boys and Neil Young influences. I wouldn't accuse them of ripping off tunes, but their penchant to recreate the music they love leaves little room for innovation, and ultimately the album has the freshness of an unearthed time capsule.</p></div>"|6645.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6645-the-fallen-leaf-pages/|6.6|Adam Moerder

<p>""A lot of times when you're playing,"" Bennett comments in <i>I Am Trying to Break Your Heart</i>, ""if you don't have any kind of sonic landscape behind you, everything kind of turns into a folk song."" Appropriately, both of these albums are full of folk songs with some sort of sonic landscape draped around them, sculpted at Pieholden Suite Studio in Chicago. On <i>Bigger Than Blue</i> that landscape is minimal and more or less subjected to the demands of the songs, but on <i>The Beloved Enemy</i> Bennett indulges seemingly every whim that crosses his mind. He uses many of the same tricks that helped <i>Being There</i>, <i>Summerteeth</i>, and <i>Yankee Hotel Foxtrot</i> sound so distinctive; these solo albums, in other words, are no dramatic departure.</p>
<p>Of the two, <i>Bigger Than Blue</i> is more confident, cohesive, accomplished, and, perhaps tellingly, far less fussed over. ""My Little Wicked One"" and ""Outside Looking In"" feature only Bennett and his acoustic guitar, while a few tracks, like the Byrdsy ""Charming and Plastic"" and the George Harrison-haunted ""Let's Count Our Losses"", are enlivened by a small backing band that effectively draws out the melodies. ""It's Hard"" churns out a barroom dirge to match his lyrics about self-delusion and regret, and ""Curiosity"" has a gentle bounce to it, thanks to Brendan Gambel's brushed snare rhythms and Bennett's impassioned delivery, which recalls Elvis Costello in its rough-edged precision.</p>
<p><i>Bigger Than Blue</i> dips momentarily with the self-conscious ""Reasons for You to Love Me (Cars Can't Escape)"", which sounds like an overworked Wilco outtake. While the folksy guitar strum of ""Songs That Weren't Finished"" rights the album in time for its final track, ""Reasons for You to Love Me"" sounds out of place among so many more or less straightforward arrangements; it's more apt for <i>The Beloved Enemy</i>, which has a lonely, restless vibe-- the opposite of <i>Bigger Than Blue</i>'s shambling ease.</p>
<p>On this second album, Bennett is much more concerned with-- or distracted by-- the creation of a sonic landscape. Unfortunately, these songs are all so uniformly downtempo that his heavy production weighs them down and dampens their melodies; as a result, the album fails to establish any pace or momentum, but can only trudge leadenly along. At its most lively, it sounds like it's tumbling apart, with instruments rattling into a song and then falling away. This technique is only sporadically effective: it works on ""Genevera"", for instance, but not on ""It Might Have Looked Like Were Dancing"". Overused on <i>The Beloved Enemy</i>, it's too often obtrusive and unmoving.</p>
<p>Despite the difference in approaches and results, <i>Bigger Than Blue</i> and <i>The Beloved Enemy</i> work better as counterparts than as sovereign works: Taken together, they portray the surprise of abandonment, whether it's due to the dissolution of a band, the breakup of a marriage, or the death of a loved one (in addition to losing a few friends and relatives, Bennett went through a divorce prior to recording these albums). On one hand, he avoids lapsing into bitterness or blame, but sounds resigned to the disappointment of so many missed opportunities. On the other hand, these two albums cannot help but remind listeners of Bennett's previous collaboration, and that familiarity keeps him well within the penumbra of Wilco's looming shadow. Perhaps his upcoming third album with put much-needed distance between Bennett the sideman and Bennett the solo artist.</p></div>"|11673.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11673-bigger-than-blue-the-beloved-enemy/|7.1|Stephen M.

You Black Emperor) and Alexander St-Onge (Shalabi Effect), and that album's airy, minimalist electronics were a welcome departure from the expansive orchestrations typically associated with the Constellation crowd.</p><p>
    Since that time the group has added Stephen De Oliviera, Fly Pan Am drummer Felix Morel, and G!YBE's Sophie Trudeau. Despite this additional instrumental heft, however, Et Sans have remained faithful to their stripped-down, primal pulse and <em>Par Noussss Touss Les Trous De Vos Crânes</em> (the loose translation of which involves something about holes in your cranium) presents the expanded lineup in full flutter.</p><p>
    Though <i>Par Noussss Touss</i> is divided into four extended tracks, it seems intended to be best digested as one continuous piece. Throughout the album Et Sans artfully combine electronic and acoustic instruments in a manner that disguises the origins of each individual sound, with snatches of indistinct vocals-- some cooed, some hollered-- cascading in and around the music's crackled landscape.</p><p>
    At various points these tracks do recall some of the more abstract junctures of Fly Pan Am's 2004 <i>N'Ecoutez Pas</i> album, but Et Sans in general prefer to take that group's Krautrock-inspired repetitions in a harsher, more experimental direction. Here they open things with a prolonged hush, as male and female voices exchange whispers over a sparse, barely-moving riverbed of hazy, distorted tape samples. But it's not long before things become considerably more agitated and the group's insistent keyboards gradually build into a sinister, Suicide-like pounding, the vocalists' virtually wordless exhalations take on an increasingly ominous urgency, and swarms of electronically-generated insects gather in numbers on every horizon.</p><p>
    In fact, things eventually become so unhinged that during the album's noisiest stretches it's only Morel's dogged drumbeat and the keyboard's steady one-fisted propulsion that keeps Et Sans' flywheel from spinning completely out of control. Squealing radio waves and tapes of briefly recognizable reeds, guitars, and strings meet in various stages of disintegration, while disembodied voices chant opaquely and an impressive monolithic drone grows strength beneath it all.</p><p>
    In their fully extended line-up Et Sans have gigged alongside the likes of Wolf Eyes and Black Dice, and the more raucous sections of <i>Par Noussss</i> match those acts in spirit if not always in execution. And now that Et Sans more than ever resembles a full-fledged band, it should prove gratifying to watch as they further hone their distinctive brand of quiet thunder.</p></div>"|2921.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2921-par-noussss-touss-les-trous-de-vos-cranes/|7.1|Matthew Murphy

If ambient is often a highfalutin' way of saying ""mood music"" in the old-fashioned wine bar/yuppie high-rise sense, most people don't live in Arcadian forests or soundproofed lofts. As David Toop pointed out in last year's headwrecking <i>Haunted Weather</i>, most of us live with ambient noise levels that our ancestors of 200 years ago could only associate with times of war. Planes, trains, automobiles...many of us can't even get to sleep without a distant roar or clatter hovering overhead.</p><p>
    
    And, increasingly, music. The dull, subharmonic rumble of a passing truck with illegal bassbins. The endless clank-clank of a reggaeton drum pattern through the wall of the apartment next door. Urban street beats culture gets into you whether you want it to or not. Illbient embraced it, updating Eno's original theories with a little grime under its nails, taking hip-hop as its DNA. Brooklyn label theAgriculture has mined the inexhaustible lode of beats and textures far past its sell-by date in the style press. Its first masterpiece was Nettle's <em>Build A Fort, Set That On Fire</em>, a record that made like Oval and dancehall producers Steely &amp; Cleevie working over a cassette of underground rai hits. Now, they've released their best record yet with David Last's <i>The Push Pull</i>.</p><p>
    
    Last's sense of rhythm is as developed as any rap, dancehall, broken beat, or dubstep scientist you'd care to throw up. Whereas most post-downtempo electronic music shifts the burden of interest to the melodic/harmonic, Last's swinging beats and liquid metal bass throw all the weight on the rhythm section. This is a funky, funky record. On ""Secret Society"", a mutant dancehall pattern bumps to static offbeats and a hiccuping vocal that's an integral part of the groove. When Last drops a rattling, chiming melody, it's more rhythmic than simple coloration. ""Badlands"" filets some microsamples over percolating handclaps, bubbling steel drums, and a one-note bass plummet that'd rattle your teeth at the appropriate volume.</p><p>
    
    There's also a playfulness that takes it out of the city into more unmapped terrain. ""Besitos"" plucks and weaves like <em>The West</em>-era Matmos. ""Posca Kid"" pivots on a mournful little accordion melody over a doleful skank, surrounded by blips, blorps, burps, and other IDM onomatopoeia. There's also a faint taste of classic Black Dog running throughout, the evanescent Orientalism of tracks like ""Chiba"" and Balil's ""Nort Route"". (This is no bad thing.) Like the ""Coolie Dance"" and ""Egyptian riddims, Last has found a music that sounds urban and folksy, ancient and modern all at once. Play it late at night, and watch how eerily (and beautifully) it synchs up with both the wind in the trees and the guys playing Tupac upstairs at 3 a.m.</p></div>"|4983.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4983-the-push-pull/|8.3|Jess Harvell

    were also into Polvo, or, more specifically, the baroque cathedrals
    shared member Ash Bowie hewed from his guitar. If you were into Helium
    and Polvo, you probably loved intricately braided strands of
    melody and dissonance, art-school meets meat-and-potatoes punk a la
    the Breeders and Autoclave (Timony's first band), and tight packets of
    oblique imagery. And if you were into all of that, you were probably
    turned off when Timony went solo and started mining Tolkien for lyrics
    and Zamfir, Master of the Pan Flute for musical inspiration.</p><p>
    
    I guess if you're a Boston hipster and you want to check out the Ren
    Fair, solo is about the only way you're going to go. As a closet
    ""literary fantasy"" buff, I can sympathize with the impulse to reclaim
    the allegorical potency of works like <em>The Thousand and One Arabian
    Nights</em> from hokey sword-and-sorcery books. Writers like Neil
    Gaiman and filmmakers like Hayao Miyazaki have been instrumental in
    preserving the rich metaphorical cores of mythological archetypes
    against the depredations of trite fantasy franchises, but a similar
    savior has yet to come along in music: Elves are adorable, but even an
    unabashed <em>Sandman</em> fan like myself can't stomach their cavorting
    in the context of a song.</p><p>
    
    If you've been turned off by the ponderous whimsy of Mary Timony's
    solo output to date and pine for the sweetly sinister discord of
    Helium, you'll be pleased to learn that <em>Ex Hex</em> is a
    well-grounded return to form with decidedly terrestrial lyrics about
    uncommunicative men (on the plodding minor-key dirge ""Silence"") and
    the inconvenience of having drunks sleeping on your floor (on the
    fuzzy rock stomper ""On the Floor""). This is raw and raucous rock-- pounding drums, throttled prog riffs and breathy, hypnotic
    invocations. When Timony dips into fantasy, it takes the form of
    religious dread, as on ""In the Grass"": ""Even I know the fiery place
    you can go,"" she sings into a starry cascade of guitar.</p><p>
    
    ""Return to Pirates"" chimes and chugs through knotty chordage; ""Friend
    to J.C."" wails like stressed metal; ""Backwards/Forwards"" nearly
    plagiarizes the laddering riff from Modest Mouse's ""Shit Luck"" to
    close the album with a snarl. Brendan Canty's stark production lays
    out the rattling percussion, serpentine leads and woozy, serrated
    chords in a lean procession that emphasizes the songs' dark, rugged
    beauty. Many of the riffs are righteously medieval in tone, but they
    rework those tripping arpeggios for a scorched-earth rock setting,
    without a lute, zither or lyre within earshot.</p></div>"|8067.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8067-ex-hex/|7.3|Brian Howe

(In a wincingly obvious confirmation of taste, a live guest performance by the band has already been scheduled for later this month.)</p><p>
    
    Regardless, the past year has been appropriately transitional for Death Cab, as the band settles into its emerging popularity (a groundswell augmented, no doubt, by frontman Ben Gibbard's half-million-selling side-project, the Postal Service), shifting from tiny clubs to decent-sized theaters, and becoming accustomed to the quirks of dealing directly with a colossal corporation. Sold only in independent record stores, the seven-song <i>The John Byrd EP</i>-- blushingly named after the band's dutiful sound man (""The guy in the beard and glasses,"" Gibbard banters)-- collects seven live tracks (culled from shows at the Fillmore in San Francisco, the Wiltern in Los Angeles, and the Showbox in the band's hometown of Seattle) has the cobbled-together, vaguely desperate feeling of an awkward apology-- an earnest thanks to the folks on their crew and their support staff Barsuk, a fraught promise to fans, an unbreakable testament to the band-before-the-breakthrough. Conceptually, it's preemptive and timid; in actuality, the EP is perfectly nice but underwhelming and bland, a non-essential gesture from an outfit in flux.</p><p>
    
    ""We Laugh Indoors"", plucked from 2001's <i>The Photo Album</i>, is a comparably limp opener, with Gibbard's voice quiet, flitting in and out, lyrics unintelligible. Guitarist Chris Walla plucks out a meandering melody over a lazy haze of drums and guitar, sounding oddly detached and lifeless-- until two minutes in, when the band half-heartedly commits to some kind of energetic burst, Gibbard finally aiming for a microphone, his bandmates taking a woozy stab at redemption that works, sort of. The nine-minute ""We Looked Like Giants"" can be equally tiring-- all guitar wankery and live finesse that falls flat on record. ""Photobooth"" is excellent, sped-up, and animated, doing its best to engage a crowd that sounds (unsurprisingly) distant, all crossed-arms and cool stares. The EP closes with a solid cover of Sebadoh's ""Brand New Love"" (led into by ""Blacking Out the Friction"").</p><p>
    
    A few lyrics are switched, guitars wail, tempos trip up and down, and Gibbard's crowd chatter is charming enough, but the <i>John Byrd</i> EP is mostly just a pleasant boon for completists, more interesting for its timing than anything else. Death Cab for Cutie may, ostensibly, be teetering on the edge of newness-- but if this EP is any indication, they've already got their formula nailed down perfectly.</p></div>"|2234.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2234-the-john-byrd-ep/|6.5|Amanda Petrusich

They've taken moments of contemplation-- when one understands something on an emotional level but can't quite articulate his thoughts-- and dressed it up in a melodic frame. By transmitting at the frequency of pre-conscious association and intuition, <i>Thought for Food</i> and <i>The Lemon of Pink</i> were immediately accessible despite absences of obvious reference points. Both records felt like gifts, demanding little from the listener but paying out handsomely.</p><p>
    
    With their fresh sound and economic construction (the first two releases were each under 40 minutes), the Books did well to stick to a similar template on back-to-back records. But in preparing for their third album, one senses Nick Zammuto and Paul de Jong felt as if they'd mastered this approach and needed to try something different. On <i>Lost and Safe</i>, the Books take the vocals and song structures hinted at on <i>Thought for Food</i> and fleshed out on <i>The Lemon of Pink</i> and make them the centerpiece.</p><p>
    
    This time it's Zammuto alone on the mic; Anne Doerner, whose spare vocal contributions to <i>The Lemon of Pink</i> wound up being a highlight, doesn't sing any lead. There's more processed electric guitar (often used in a clicking, repetitive manner reminiscent of classical minimalism) and far less cello. Despite live vocals on nearly every track and the shifts in texture, the approach is still very recognizably the Books. In a way, the original lyrics aim for the same level of engagement as the odd samples, finding and skirting the edge between different meanings. ""Yes and no are just distinguished by distinction, so we chose the in-between"" are the first words Zammuto sings in his hushed whisper on the opening ""A Little Longing Goes Away"", and that sort of ambiguity sets the tone for the record. Words for the Books have been a subject in and of themselves, worth hearing purely as sound, and the written lyrics here have a similar character.</p><p>
    
    Most of <i>Lost and Safe</i> is pleasant enough but not much more. ""Be Good to Them Always"" is the record's lone great track, one that hints at potential interesting directions down the road. As clicky electric guitar with some backward reverb pans across the stereo field, Zammuto sings in concert with the sampled voices, finding the hidden melody in the deadpan newsman deliver of lines like ""I can hear a collective rumbling in America"" and ""This great society is going smash."" Reminiscent of Steve Reich's ""Different Trains"", which built tunes from the speech inflections of interviewed holocaust survivors, ""Be Good to Them Always"" is a fantastic reminder of the musicality of the spoken word, an idea that lurks constantly inside the music of the Books.</p><p>
    
    One of the more interesting things about the Books first two records was their democratic production; the music never seems to push the listeners ear toward any one element. But now Zammuto's voice is clearly the focus, and though his quiet and half-spoken phrasing works well with the arrangements, the ""tunes,"" as such, don't necessarily warrant the added attention. It's as though, with a few exceptions, the Books weren't quite sure what they wanted to do and they wound up stuck halfway between proper songs and the ambiguity of samples. Though the Books do a nice job here bending lyrics to fit the open-ended tone of their compositional style, the original vocals wind up draining their sound of mystery, and <i>Lost and Safe</i> seems by far more conventional than their previous two records.</p></div>"|856.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/856-lost-and-safe/|7.0|Mark Richardson

The seven-minute ""If I Ever Feel Better"" impeccably emulates the studio version until descending into an attempt at Brian May-like guitar theatrics.</p><p>
    
    Phoenix's song selection is party to blame for the record's failures: Six of the 10 tracks come from <i>Alphabetical</i>, the weaker of their two albums, yet with few exceptions those tracks fall short of their studio counterparts. However, when it comes to a few of the singles, the band knows how to bring it home. ""Too Young"" is one of few Phoenix songs truly made for the stage, with its pounding, scintillating synth and a bubbly Thomas Mars almost raising his voice above speaking level. Guitarist Christian Mazzalai drops the acoustic on ""Everything Is Everything"" for a clean, funky electric, making that nifty jazz progression throb even harder.</p><p>
    
    Aside from these differences, the live versions mostly sound like their originals with an adjusted EQ and crowd sounds randomly interspersed. Mars appears uncomfortable addressing the audience unless to announce a song title or say goodnight, and it's very likely this album was hastily assembled to promote the band before their big U.S. tour. As an already dubious release, the disc lacks cool extras like a bonus DVD, unreleased tracks, or inserts and there are undoubtedly more inspired Phoenix performances than those compiled here. Sadly, like most of today's live records, this one is for fans only.</p></div>"|6274.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6274-live-30-days-ago/|6.5|Adam Moerder

I blame it on the din of education: a dozen-odd classmates pouring their souls or resisting narcoleptic boredom by pecking at a synthesizers, drum machines, and effects processors, murdering their favorite Nirvana and Smashing Pumpkins songs on out-of-tune acoustic guitars, or taking five-minute turns playing medleys of Primus songs on a battered trapkit.</p><p>
    
    Whatever instrument or studio equipment used, there was a tendency to first be benignly calm in studying what each sound or widget can do, before the adolescence kicks in and taxpayers are left with the thousands in repair bills. Such memories hit me when I heard <i>Irrevocably Overdriven Break Freakout Megamix</i>, the first and possibly sole live document of Hrvatski-- recorded in San Francisco's RX Gallery during the Jiffy Scuttler concert series on July 30, 2004. This ""Croatian"" is the alias for Yankee noisenik Keith Fullerton Whitman. He is a Berklee-educated, electronic music historian who concocted mature pieces for guitar feedback, and experimented with Harvard University's Serge synthesizer. Yet, as Hrvatski, he typically follows moments of graceful meditation on his guitar or synth with splatters of beats and frequencies tweaked into high heaven.</p><p>
    
    It seems Whitman has three basic noises locked into his mind: Drones that drizzle trails behind every moving object, as heard in the projects authored under his Christian name; toy store-bought, zapper-gun buckshot; and his the ""Amen"" breakbeat-- operated like dilapidated steel factories run by sleep-deprived, sweatshop workers. If anything, Whitman is a pioneer of ""fuckstep,"" the art of shoving as many different breaks into a split-second as a possible.</p><p>
    
    That said, <i>Irrevocably Overdriven</i> could be one hell of an epitaph for Hrvatski. On his label Reckankomplex's website, he claimed this ""will most likely be Hrvatski's swan song."" That would be a damn shame; the laptop performance encompasses Hrvatski's seven-odd years of savagery and slapstick-- all caught in volumes cranked into the red on the recording deck. The set, which he describes as ""incorporating the guts of an analogue modular synth simulator, several pitch-tracking and attack-sensing random-event distributors, many tempo-synced filtering algorithms, 10 kinds of realtime granular grunkage, etc.,"" is a marvel to be pulverized with in one sitting.</p><p>
    
    The 40-minute concert is divided into 91 segments, ranging from 20 seconds to one minute long, but the performance feels as if lasts for three hours. He shows off his studies of about every square-inch of that damn ""Amen"" break-- making its soul float above its body or slowing it down to a cement mixer grind. The performance disrupts any sort of dance hooks by veering back and forth between beat assaults, their digitally enchanted smoldering of distortion, some tomfoolery with laser or robotic blurps, and then it's back to the firing squad. Whitman thankfully makes most of the discord addictive, deepening his sound's depth and textures by keeping it slightly distant with an echo. The best moments are surprises like a jazz piano melody that suddenly asks you for a dance amid the street riot, a Nintendo Gameboy melody that whistles on its way to work, and tracks from his sadly overlooked 7"" EP, <i>Raume</i>, where Whitman mutated household objects like pots, pans, bedsprings, and creaking doors into breakcore rhythms.</p><p>
    
    The self-indulgence can be too much at times, where Whitman often pulls apart his noises and leaves nightmares on the petri dish. However, if <i>Irrevocably Overdriven</i> is indeed his last recording as Hrvatski, then the dying breaths of this Whitman alias can be heard across all four winds on this record.</p></div>"|3946.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3946-irrevocably-overdriven-break-freakout-megamix/|7.7|Cameron Macdonald

The Welsh phrase proves a particularly ironic title for this rarities collection, not only because the band in question, Ffa Cowfi Pawb, has been defunct for more than a decade, but also because it has been handily overshadowed by its members' subsequent groups. Gruff Rhys and Daffyd Ieuan co-founded Super Furry Animals in 1993, Rhodri Puw joined Gorky's Zygotic Mynci after John Lawrence left, and Dewi Emlyn has toured with those two bands as well as Mogwai and Cornelius, among others.</p><p>
    
    By comparison, Ffa Coffi Pawb (which means ""everybody's coffee beans"") is basically obscure, at least to non-Welsh audiences. Formed in 1986, when they were university students, the band called it quits seven years later when heavy touring of Wales led to almost no touring outside of Wales. They released four albums altogether (three on Welsh label Ankst), but none are in print. <i>Am Byth</i> is their only surviving record, as of this writing anyway.</p><p>
    
    But that title isn't some Oasis-size declaration of self-importance; it's more like a mission statement. Ffa Coffi Pawb wanted to make durable music. ""Lluchia Dy Ffachlwch Drosda I"" (""Throw Your Flashdust Over Me"") reveals a strong belief in music's redemptive powers: According to Gruf Rhys's liner notes and translations, it's about ""the realization that the Earth is a flop and that sometimes the only friend we can turn to is dumb rhyming pop music.""</p><p>
    
    Thirteen years after the band's dissolution, their music holds up surprisingly well, especially considering all we have to judge it by are 16 ""lost songs,"" as the subtitle dubs them. Despite being one of the most recent songs on the album, the opener ""Valium"" starts with an 1980s-sounding drum machine that screams ""Cardiff Vice"", but most tracks don't seem to have aged much. Some are single-worthy gems, like ""Segur Sega"" (""Lazy/Redundant Sega"") and ""Arwynebol Melyn"" (""Yellow Superficial Pony""). Others, like ""Hydref yn Sacramento"" (""The Fall in Sacramento""), go on and on without having much going on at all, suggesting a young band that didn't have full control yet over its own creative powers.</p><p>
    
    It's easy to pick out the similarities between Ffa Coffi Pawb and their direct progeny, especially Super Furry Animals-- that's unmistakably Rhys's voice delivering those consonant-heavy lyrics, and that soaring three-note harmony on ""Segur Sega"" and those dreamy na-na-nas on ""Breichiau Hir"" (""Long Arms"") are prototype elements of the bouncy boogie of <i>Radiator</i> and <i>Guerilla</i>. As a result, it's now difficult to hear Ffa Coffi Pawb as its own distinct entity, but rather as the lead-up to other bands. Maybe those four ""lost"" albums tell a different story.</p></div>"|3339.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3339-am-byth-casgliad-o-ganeuon-coll-86-92/|7.0|Stephen M. Deusner

They're stuck between the country and the city, but not in the suburban or exurban senses-- their music reveals the parallels between small-town everybody-knows-everybody drama and big-city alienation. The Brooklyn (via Cincinnati) quintet engage with their American anxiety with a somewhat European elegance, and <em>Alligator</em>-- their third album and first for Beggars Banquet-- finds them pushing the tempos and trying on bigger shoes without losing the stately sense of pacing and dour melody that made their first two albums so pleasing.</p><p>
    
    Drummer Bryan Devendorf is the backbone of <em>Alligator</em>, his efficient, well-textured timekeeping featuring high in the mix and neatly delineating the band's newfound sense of rhythmic consistency. The music around him moves between lushness and austerity, bursting with chamber pop ornament and collapsing into wasted after-hours reverie. Matt Berninger's dry baritone deadpan is strangely emotional-- at times he almost sounds too tired of life to aim for a high note, and it brings an odd honesty to lines like ""I'm sorry for everything."" As he repeats the line over the violins and roiling guitars of ""Baby, We'll Be Fine"", he seems as if he's not only apologizing for everything he's ever done, but also everything that's ever happened that he couldn't control.</p><p>
    
    The slower, piano-driven death-pop of ""Karen"" offers some unusual chord progressions as Berninger warns a fading lover: ""Whatever you do, listen/ You better wait for me/ No, I wouldn't go out alone into America."" ""This isn't me, you just haven't seen my good side yet,"" he tells her, but he's obviously doomed and he grows more desperate as metaphorical black birds circle his bed. On ""Lit Up"", he grows more confident, even swaggering: ""My body guard shows a revolver to anyone who asks"" he deadpans gracefully over jagged electric guitars, while his band shouts along for the chorus. The shouted chorus returns for the ""Thunder Road""-sized rocker ""Abel"", the closest the National have come to writing an anthem.</p><p>
    
    Massed vocals and backing harmonies are two of the few things the National have added to their sound since their last album, and though <em>Alligator</em> is satisfying and engaging, it's not quite as bracing as their stellar sophomore outing, 2003's <em>Sad Songs for Dirty Lovers</em>. Still, the band's nocturnal vision of American pavement and deteriorated personal relations is engrossing, revealing itself slowly, peeling back the luxuriant layers and exposing intricate detail.</p></div>"|5719.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5719-alligator/|7.9|Joe Tangari

As for singer Sam Prekop's solo album, well: His was just the best. The people involved were the same guys as always-- O'Rourke, McEntire, Taylor, Abrams, Mazurek-- but something about Prekop made all the difference. Part of it was his hushed, husky ""soul"" singing, still the perfect accompaniment to that Chicago-style fake bossa nova. But the bulk of it was just the quiet lull of the thing-- the way half of its tracks laid back into spare, comfy sounds and let them drift along. Which made it a little strange to anticipate this album: How do you follow up something that seemed so much like a happy accident, or a gorgeous, quiet side-note?</p><p>
    
    Because with this set, Prekop's putting a lot more into it: There are more ""proper"" songs and less airy instrumental pieces, and in spots those laid-back soul inclinations bloom into something you could stretch toward calling funky. What stays true, though, is that sound-- soft, simple, and natural, the surprisingly un-slick tones of raw instruments in a big room. It has a little do with Jim O'Rourke's ""pop"" records (<i>Eureka</i>, <i>Halfway to a Threeway</i>), and a little to do with the Sea and Cake, but neither reference quite gets the particulars: What Prekop's playing is some form of half-jazzy bossa nova soul, some elegant laid-back concoction that's part beach and part dinner party. The rhythm section skips along in a loose shuffle, Prekop touches softly at his guitar in that electric bossa style, and his breathy croon winds the melody in and out of the occasional low swell of horns. The results can range from blissfully cushy to outright grand, thanks to their impeccable composition.</p><p>
    
    Forget the details: The sheer comfort of this stuff can charm just about anyone, from the rock bar to the office to your grandma's house. The timing couldn't be better, either, because it's difficult to separate the sound from the city. In L.A., you can get this kind of sunset white-guy soul any time; in Chicago, spring really means something, and there's no better use for this music than getting massively chilled-out in your big, suddenly-sunny apartment. Better still, this is anything but mood music: Prekop is a songwriter to be reckoned with, and the dynamics and arrangements on this disc have a depth that keeps luring you further in. Just like bossa nova-- its hot-bath laziness and lively, complex instrumental interplay, both somehow occupying the exact same space.</p><p>
    
    So I keep listening, and sorting through all that graceful composition, and dreaming of biking up Ashland in June. Up until now, Prekop's solo work has been the side-note in the Sea and Cake diaspora, that one album flying well below the radar of Archer Prewitt's singer-songwriter career. Hopefully this set will change that: Prewitt may be cuter, but Prekop's sound is the real marvel.</p></div>"|6456.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6456-whos-your-new-professor/|8.4|Nitsuh Abebe

Alog combine software-based sounds with acoustic instruments, some treated, some left alone; as Phonophani, Eide works with the same elements but in different proportions. <em>Oak or Rock</em> is more purely electronic than the most recent Alog record, with a particular emphasis on the bleeps that have been associated with number-crunching computers ever since fridge-sized, reel-to-reel consoles were dressing sci-fi movie sets.</p><p>
    The dominance of bleeps on <em>Oak or Rock</em> makes the appearance of sounds from the physical world that much more striking. It all works, but you can't help but think about the conflict between the various sources and their immediate associations. So the groaning cello on ""Take Off Your Wooden Coat"" is more mournful when surrounded by the gurgling computer noises, a swaying signpost of music tradition struggling to stand upright in the digital rain. ""You Must Welcome the Stranger"" also incorporates cello but abstracted vocal samples dominate. The rush of syllables are impossible to place, whether they come from songs or finely chopped speech, but the cumulative herky-jerky effect is something like flipping through a book of animation, sensing movement in the layers of images until your thumb sticks and you're left with a crudely drawn still.</p><p>
    A few tracks delight in finding leaks between the digital/acoustic divide. ""The Boiling Fjords Orchestra"" splits the difference between the worlds, stretching the drone of strings until it acquires a sparkling metallic sheen, but the best track on the record is ""Cloudberry"", a collaboration with vocalist Maja Ratkje. She's a natural for this sort of between-the-spaces world, sounding like a bionic Meredith Monk floating above the rhythmic bed of static. Her chirps, coos, and melodic croons blend easily with the electronic tones and it's sometimes difficult to tell where her voice leaves off and the processing begins.</p><p>
    When the computer takes over completely on <em>Oak or Rock</em> (""Earth Diver"", ""The Melancholic Giant""), the results are merely interesting, worth following for the off-the-grid unpredictability but failing to engage on a textural level. But these so-so lulls, constituting roughly half the record, are easier to ride out knowing an amazing little track is just around the corner.</p></div>"|6567.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6567-oak-or-rock/|7.5|Mark Richardson

The group began as a one-man project, with Shai Halperin doing all the writing, playing, and singing. After one album, 2000's <i>Meet Yr Acres</i>, he kicked the jack-of-all-trades route to the curb, got himself a band, and made a quick metamorphosis into a brash rocker. The full-band edition of the Capitol Years put together a hugely entertaining live show and released the rollicking <i>Jewelry Store</i> EP in 2002. An archival release put the solo act to bed, and now they've dropped the first full-band Capitol Years LP, <i>Let Them Drink</i>.</p><p>
    
    The record doesn't want you to just kick back and listen, preferring to taunt you from your chair via head-nodding blues punch-ups and brawling rock'n'roll. In their new, rougher state, the Capitol Years play with a lot of brash bravado, but they're not beyond a good three-part harmony or a strange song structure that, for instance, kicks into sudden overdrive at the end of the chorus. It's not all rock either, with songs like the title track eschewing drums and relying instead on insistently strummed acoustic guitar for momentum. The song's vocal melody see-saws over a simple chord progression, backed by full, rich harmonies.</p><p>
    
    Of course, the songs on either side of it are amped-up strutters, with ""Everyone Is a Skunk"" flying through about four different sections that could each be the chorus and ""Ramona"" flirting with undulating ""Suzie Q"" guitar riffs before twisting into a pummeling raver. ""Giant Drunks"" plays the best blues card, with a crawling beat, thick bassline, and chunky guitar riffs in the verse and breathy harmonies on the refrain.</p><p>
    
    The only place where it doesn't really work is unfortunately also the longest song, ""Nothing to Say"" (unfortunate title, too, come to think of it). It wants desperately to rock like there's no tomorrow, but the band holds back and then holds back some more and finally lets it die without having lived first. The sleigh-bell rock of ""Lucky"" closes the LP and nicely redeems it, ending this entertaining, varied rock record on a high note.</p></div>"|1297.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1297-let-them-drink/|7.7|Joe Tangari

Icelandic-Italian songstress Emiliana
    Torrini is far more than that: Her ululations over the credits to
    <em>The Two Towers</em> made old Gollum sound like, oops, Björk-- who,
    now that you mention it, was offered the job first (and said ""xF6"").
    Anyway, Torrini's debut, <em>Love in the Time of Science</em>, was
    totally more of a Portishead rip.</p><p>
    Like, hey, Beth Gibbons from Portishead, Torrini has since ditched the
    electronic accoutrements for subdued, ostensibly trend-proof
    Euro-folk. Listen, I'm as tired of Nick Drake comparisons as the next
    jaded rock typist, but on her latest album, <em>Fisherman's
    Woman</em>, Torrini dons Drake's hushed legacy as eagerly as she
    recently wore third-hand beats and Thievery Corporation guest spots. Pensive lead track ""Nothing Brings Me Down"" starts with a droning, finger-picked acoustic guitar figure, handled capably by producer/collaborator Mr. Dan, and peaks at a soaring wordless vocal straight out of ""Cello Song"". Bass and gentle percussion eventually shuffle in, establishing a spare framework that rarely deviates for the next 11 tracks.</p><p>
    A monochrome palette, sure, but when it works it works. For Torrini that's on first single ""Sunny Road"", an aching acoustic-pop love
    letter with a melody well-suited for Torrini's pleasant voice--
    which, by the by, definitely brings to mind Sweden's Stina
    Nordenstam, second, and fellow folk pixie Joanna Newsom, third, after
    you-know-who (not Drake). Lyrics aren't Torrini's strongest suit, but
    she acquits herself well on the catchy ""Heartstopper"", another
    gossamer number about soul-searching ""with number three still on my
    plate."" Torrini's double-tracked harmonies and Dan's supple guitar
    line on closer ""Serenade"", another highlight, could have come from
    <em>Wednesday Morning, 3AM</em>-era Simon and Garfunkel, whose ""Sound of
    Silence"" Torrini once covered.</p><p>
    Unfortunately, <em>Fisherman's Woman</em> doesn't always work, and its
    infrequent variations-- accordions and nautical creaking on the
    otherwise forgettable ""Lifesaver"", piano instead of guitar on the
    title track-- do little to disguise songs that can be as ephemeral as
    Torrini's voice. Fine, she's not just a Björk knock-off. Full credit,
    also, for penning the Kylie Minogue hit ""Slow"". But Torrini's folk-pop
    dalliance is as innocuously suited for health spas and pottery classes
    as any trip-hop relic.</p></div>"|8286.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8286-fishermans-woman/|6.3|Marc Hogan

After completing the review, I went on full media blackout from Hot Hot Heat, because what I knew about this band I did not like. Their pre-fame album, <em>Scenes One Through Thirteen</em>, was auspiciously crude; their live show, reportedly excruciating.</p><p>
    
    But despite my qualms, I couldn't stop listening to <i>Make Up the Breakdown</i>. Though they drew from the same new wave well as a lot of this young century's other hot prospects, Hot Hot Heat seemed to have a lot more flair and energy...and not coincidentally, a lot more Dexy's. Chock full of sugar-high keyboards, English-major alliterations, and singer Steve Bays' chutes-and-ladders voice, <i>Make Up</i> had an exuberance that made even its self-mutilation single a dancefloor staple for people who aren't dancefloor staples.</p><p>
    
    Ever since <i>Make Up</i>'s release, however, Hot Hot Heat have apparently been trying their damnedest to bump Interpol off the cover of the Post-Fame Jinx Handbook. Make the hasty leap to a major label? Check. Lose a key member to creative differences during second album's recording? Check (guitarist Dante Decaro). Delay follow-up album until all or most of the buzz generated by the debut has dissipated? Check plus.</p><p>
    
    The chorus cries ""backlash,"" but to paraphrase the golden oldie, just because we're backlashing doesn't mean we're wrong. It's unfortunate that what leaves me cold about <i>Elevator</i> are complaints levied in knee-jerk style to indie bands promoted to the big leagues, but that doesn't make the album's failings any less true: Hot Hot Heat sound like they're playing scared and playing it safe, and in doing so fall through the cracks between their established fans and their imagined ones.</p><p>
    
    A listener can pick up on this fear just from instrumentation alone, which-- given the departure of Decaro-- veers surprisingly away from Mays' spastic synthesizer and towards the safe confines of guitar-based rock. <i>Elevator</i> also muzzles what was a respectable rhythm section relative to the world of indie rock, one that believably swung through white-boy reggae (""Bandages""), white-boy Latin (""Talk to Me, Dance with Me""), and other white-boy takes on international flavors. <i>Elevator</i> sticks to largely straight-ahead pounding, ""Shame On You"" providing the sole remnant of these charmingly earnest attempts at flicking off 4/4 time.</p><p>
    
    Also abandoned back at Sub Pop is the coy wordplay, with only the half-hearted ""You Owe Me an IOU"" reflecting the infectiously nerdy winking of Bays' past lyrics. Instead, <i>Elevator</i> (itself a title that seems destined for bargain-bin files) contains a slew of public-domain-bland song names that reflect the lack of imagination within: ""Ladies and Gentleman"" we are ""Running Out of Time"" in the ""Middle of Nowhere"". Fittingly, most of these tracks sound groomed for immediate slotting into television montages comedy end-credits-- especially ""Pickin' It Up"", which sounds not unlike the theme to ""Friends"".</p><p>
    
    There are a few pleasant exceptions-- most notably ""Island of the Honest Man"". With a few abrupt tempo changes, some melodious bass and noisy guitar sheets, and a bridge that does a reasonable approximation of Brainiac, this song really is an island of Hot Hot Heat's previous promise, taking all their new-wave primary sources and just blazing through them in a caffeine furor.</p><p>
    
    It's enough to remind me that I really, honestly, do not want a band like Hot Hot Heat to fail-- I know you're thinking, ""hey look, it's the good old Pitchfork build 'em up and knock 'em down routine,"" and the thought hurts. Backlash continues to be the primary fuel source of indie scenery, and due to its omnipotence everything gets confusing and complicated when a band really does fall down the well of follow-up album expectations. Anyway, you'll just have to trust me when I say that <i>Elevator</i> isn't the victim of political bias, it's just disappointing, an effort that finds Hot Hot Heat in a piss-poor dead heat with late-coming doppelgangers the Bravery...the Crisp Rice to HHH's Rice Krispies. I may be skeptical of Hot Hot Heat's youth and style to the point of allergy, but things would've been much simpler-- and I would've been a much happier listener-- if they'd just lived up to their promise, rather than fulfilled my suspicions.</p></div>"|3929.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3929-elevator/|5.3|Rob Mitchum

Their solution? Pump up frontman Kelly Jones' vocals, hire Argentinean drummer Javier Weyler, cut the sentimental shit, and get back to the beer-stained, pool-cue-wavin', leather-studded cock-rock roots of the late-90s 'Phonics album Britain drooled over.</p><p>As the album title points out, Jones' lyrics deal with a motley cast of characters, all of which grounded in the basest barroom debauchery. The title character of opener ""Superman"" is drunk, plays poker, and wants to ditch Lois Lane for a ""teenage blonde."" Jones vents some sibling animosity on ""Brother"" by, well, beating up his brother. ""Girl"" is about fucking a girl. The whole bad boy bit gets pretty boring pretty fast, with Jones appearing especially ridiculous on ""Doorman"", a four-minute ""fuck you"" to some security guard he brawled with during a 2004 Seattle show: ""You look like a monkey scowling at me/ Well suck my banana, suck it with cream"".</p><p>The biggest joke of the album, though, is the group's shameless appeal to today's new wave hipsters. Single ""Dakota"" is the big culprit here, with its high-school romanticism and sugary synth workings. Jones pines for summer nights and adolescent innocence until his emotions boil over into the not-so-immortal line: ""You made me feel like the one."" There they mimic New Order; elsewhere, the basslines of ""Superman"" and ""Deadhead"" rip off the Cure's ""A Forest"", while ""Lolita"" is the Stereophonics' ill-advised, half-assed stab at shoegazer.</p>
<p>This unctuous new wave dabbling is the only departure from the album's otherwise humdrum Stereophonics sound. Jones still croaks out songs with that wretched voice of his, an amalgam of nicotine, alcohol and AOR. The guitars still churn out feeble riffs more appropriate for a Hot Wheels commercial than a grown-up's rock album, and even when they're on to something it feels like they're only fumbling with a good idea. It's Britain's cancerous version of Creed, Guns N' Roses, and Stone Temple Pilots rolled into one, though unfortunately lacking those bands' self-destructive tendencies.</p>

Yeah, they started off faultless; the strobe-light electro on their early singles was so precise that you had to assume they knew exactly what they were doing. But then comes their first LP, and geez: Suddenly they're playing shabby bass lines, the drum machine's booming from some corner of a crappy basement, and the whole shrill thing sounds as much like an art-school trainwreck as a sneaky reinvention. A single like ""Don't You Stop"" could reassure you that they were bringing it all back home to their strong suit, but then here we are with the <em>D.U.M.E.</em> EP, about which let's say this: It's certainly the logical extension of that full-length. The upshot of these six tracks seems to be that Adult. have been listening to a hell of a lot of Bauhaus. And I have to give them credit: They've followed that impulse right out to the sweet spot.</p><p>
    
    Because every time I think they've finally spun off into some dippy little world that I don't need to visit, they manage to pull me back onto their side. The shrieky basement goth on <em>D.U.M.E.</em> seems at first like a pretty cringeworthy development, even if you go for this kind of thing; you sort of want to let Nicola Kuperus know that yelpy witch vocals (half Peter Murphy, half Patti Smith) might not be her calling, or tell Adam Lee Miller he's better with discfloor programming than weird muddy stomps. But give it a few spins, and it starts to seem pretty useful: Who else these days is going to turn your bedroom into a bat cave? Everyone pillages the Reagan era, but who's willing to sound like a pack of raccoon-eyed art-school freaks from 1984? The sound is shrill and ridiculous, sure, but here's the half-remembered secret with this kind of stuff: No matter how self-important it may have sounded, being shrill and ridiculous was half the fun. You don't sing along with ""Bela Lugosi's Dead"" for its deep spiritual qualities; you just enjoy making the faces and doing the voice, and you're probably laughing while you're at it.</p><p>
    
    That's pretty much what's on offer here and Adult., as always, have a knack for embarrassing themselves in a good way. The propulsive drum programming on ""Hold Your Breath"" turns it into pogo cheerleading goth, or some vampire version of the B-52s; go-go bounce and weirdo yelping both make like the dark side of ""Rock Lobster"". The rest is a bit more of a pileup, but the bass crawl on the title track sounds like the earliest, creepiest version of the Cocteau Twins, and I'm a sucker for the Bauhaus-replica guitar that crops up everywhere else.</p><p>
    
    It's a mess, as usual, but this band has a terrific excuse: So long as no one else is willing to go quite this far out on a limb, it's not like you can say some other group is doing it better. Here's hoping they've got more high-energy sneering for their next full length, because when they're really rocking this stuff, it's a whole lot more fun than anything else on the rack.</p></div>"|57.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/57-dume-ep/|6.0|Nitsuh Abebe

""Who Are You"", ""Won't Get Fooled Again"", ""Baba O'Riley""-- as themes for CBS' ""CSI"" franchise the songs are meaty enough and beaty enough to match David Caruso's ego, while being big enough to hook baby boomers into Tivoing the clunky procedural crime dramas. Someday a CBS! Miniseries! Event! will unite the three ""CSI"" casts in an epic struggle against GSR residue and Dan Cortese's career as a character actor, and its theme song will be the 10-minute <i>Tommy</i> epic ""Underture"". When that happens, the Who will have reached Kravitzian levels of licensing overexposure. But in the meantime we can still enjoy the band's music for its strong points-- thundering power chords, machismo blending with naughty British schoolboy humor, ambitious flights of pop songwriting, and a conceptual scope that was as enviable as it was flawed.</p><p>
    
    All of that's wrapped up in <i>Petra Haden Sings: The Who Sell Out</i>, the Los Angeles singer's a capella interpretation of the Who's 1967 album. Haden recreates the entire record with only her voice and an eight-track recorder, from the flatulent trumpets and ""What's for tea, darling?"" drop-ins of fake advert ""Heinz Baked Beans"" to the swirling psych-rock of classic rock radio staple ""I Can See for Miles"". On the latter her harmonic selves suggest a Mellotron while she sings the lead in a voice that's clear and bright, but also a little deadpan. And that wryness is important for Haden, because it's both a connection to and a departure from her primary source. While <i>Who Sell Out</i> was a gleeful lambaste of advertising and radio, it also featured some really strong songs. Haden understands both aspects, but knows she can't retell it accurately with her limited materials. So she doesn't. She uses suggestion instead, and a fan's emulation, and her own sense of humor, too; she makes something that loves its predecessor but has no intention of resembling it exactly. And at that, the baby boomers and rockists breathed a little easier.</p><p>
    
    As the story goes, Mike Watt put Haden up to this project in the first place. She'd already done an a capella record-- 1996's fanciful <i>Imaginaryland</i>-- and Watt wondered what she might do with one of his favorites. There's no purism in that backstory. <i>Petra Haden Sings: The Who Sell Out</i> is just a fun exercise, the work of a daydreaming geek girl who sings like an angel and makes cool guitar noises with her mouth. Its casual ""Why not?""-ness is its greatest strength. But there's attention to detail here, too. ""Face the music with Odorono"", the original <i>Sell Out</i>'s fake ad copy smirked beneath a shot of Townshend mugging with an enormous can of the stuff. ""The all-day deodorant that turns perspiration into inspiration!"" But at the same time, the actual song ""Odorono"" exemplified the songwriter's emerging flair for epic pop. Haden has fun recreating the album art, and the songs on <i>Sell Out</i>, too. Of course, since she's the only instrument, this is done with lots of layers and a general knack for hitting the sweet spot of Pete's famous fanfares. ""TRIUMPHANT!/ Was the way she felt/ As she acknowledged the applause...""</p></div>"|4005.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4005-petra-haden-sings-the-who-sell-out/|7.0|Johnny Loftus

After all, if the man so wished, he could compile a full-length tour video entirely from instances of people jumping onstage to hump him. Morrissey's 2004 post-<i>You Are the Quarry victory lap unfolded in the atmosphere of ripe, obscenely pulsing global adulation; at least three people were ejected before my eyes from the Radio City Music Hall for attempting to mate with the star mid-song. Tempting as it is to approach <em>Live at Earls Court</em> as another cash-in, the moment it captures is indeed somewhat phenomenal. It certainly bears documenting.</i></p><p>
    
    Morrissey's moving into an interesting and barely explored territory here: throughout <i>Live at Earls Court (in fact recorded piecemeal in London, Glasgow, Birmingham, Brighton, and Dublin), he is a pre-rock crooner commanding Beatle-level hysteria; a smooth, urbane party host backed onstage by anonymous young chord-bashers. He's grown distinctly comfy around the old hits-- or as comfy as one could possibly be in that jagged terrain (his Smiths-era vocal lines careen against the chord progressions in astonishingly counterintuitive ways)-- and the recent songs appear to have been written with a new vocal prowess in mind: Witness the huge Broadway highs of ""I Have Forgiven Jesus"" and ""You Know I Couldn't Last"".</i></p><p>
    
    Indeed, Morrissey's singing appears to have taken a giant leap over the past seven years or so. Listening to the newly velvety Moz tackle ""How Soon Is Now"" (a ballsy choice for the disc's opener) is a pleasure of an entirely confusing sort: the song is still a roaring, lurching Grendel, all rage and laser tremolo, but the listener can't help feeling luxuriously entertained. The frustration, the urgency, the hormonal madness of the original are politely disinvited; that stuff is, after all, a bit infantile. Morrissey may well be the world's first rock star to fashion a successful shtick out of enthusiastically embracing middle age.</p><p>
    
    For the record, middle age does become him. That face, oddly enough, is hitting the iconic stage just now, with the crow's feet and a bit of sag in the jowls, and the Yves Saint Laurent shirts feel a little more warranted. Mainly, the years allow Morrissey to sidestep direct sexuality in a whole new way: Hilarious as it is for me to type this, he's become emphatically paternal, in a flirty who's-yer-Daddy way. The uproarious chorus of the B-side ""Don't Make Fun Of Daddy's Voice"" (""....because he can't help it/ When he was a teenage boy/ Something got stuck in his throat"") attests to this directly-- but a fatherly, bemused benevolence rears its head elsewhere (""First Of The Gang To Die,"" for instance, is full of it). At the same time, it is now harder than ever to imagine Morrissey settling into a Bacharachian loungy twilight-- not after the controlled squall of ""Irish Blood, English Heart"", the loudest, most pissed-off, and most direct song of his career. Plus, now it's Joan of Arc's iPod that melts in ""Bigmouth Strikes Again"", not a Walkman, so the kids will still know what Daddy's on about, at least for a while. And then, I guess we can just keep changing the device.</p></div>"|5438.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5438-live-at-earls-court/|7.8|Michael Idov

Whatever or Whoever brought the releases of M.I.A's <i>Arular</i> and Mahjongg's <i>Raydoncong 2005</i> together on the same date, I would like to thank Him/Her or The Void. On the one hand, you have an absurdly hyped, burgeoning pop star who strikes rebel poses and affects scenester fashion and vernacular. On the other, you have Mahjongg, smartass Chicago art-punks with an <i>Africa 70</i> fetish. So? Yeah, so their album covers look identical.</p><p>
    Half-full Scenario:</p><p>
    Bloggers, trend riders, fashion rebels, and people who want to own the ""Album of the Year"" descend on record stores nationwide, clearing the shelves of <i>Arular</i> in a rabid frenzy that makes the Cabbage Patch Riots of XMAS '85 look like a boxful of kittens. As the mob moves from store to store, devouring all in its path, those left behind wander the aisles in a bloody daze. Through the blur of a punctured cornea, they see the cover of <i>Raydoncong</i>. AK-47s, ethnic people, colors, pretty colors. <i>Arular</i> stash, whut gwan! And the concussee contingent becomes Mahjongg's motherlode.</p><p>
    Half-empty Scenario:</p><p>
    People calmly sashay into record stores to the ""new release"" shelves, holding hands, two by two. As they peruse for <i>Arular</i>, one reaches for <i>Raydoncong</i>. ""No, not that one, silly!"" says the other. ""Haha, my bad! I saw banana clips and, well, you know."" M.I.A. 1, Mahjongg 0.</p><p>
    Before you get all spazzy, I realize that album covers have little to do with the worth of an album. But fate has drawn these two together, however tenuously, and the contrast goes beyond the images on the cover. Where the lovely Sri Lankan is being praised/maligned for her earnest/misguided injection of personal politics into pop music, Mahjongg have apparently decided to go whole hog and appoint themselves impromptu Western mouthpiece for the Congolese opposition. How's that for self-serving appropriation? Their website is a bewildering mélange of anti-fascist propaganda and record reviews from <i>The Village Voice</i> and <i>Washington Post</i>. Then again, the rants against President Sassou-Nguesso are in French, so maybe Mahjongg just worked out a bandwidth timeshare with the Conseil National de la Résistance Brazzaville Chapter. It's all quite confusing, I assure you, but somehow Mahjongg's peculiar agit prop accurately visualizes their sonic delivery of junkyard afro-new wave. Sub-genre Alert!</p><p>
    Building on the jittery punk-funk of their <i>Machinegong</i> EP, <i>Raydongcong 2005</i> slaps together 46 minutes of beat-heavy agitation and organized chaos. There is so much overlapping clatter, it sometimes sounds like backstage at a battle of the bands, with everyone eventually falling into tune through proximity. Nearly every song contains multiple vocals, tempo shifts, guitars jabbing into strings over electronic bleeps, and radio dispatches plus a drum machine not to mention synths in addition to pots and pans and sticks and feedback and possibly a horse. Actually, ""The Stubborn Horse"" is a lazy nag which unpleasantly puts a Sheryl Crow song on the tip of your tongue, but Mahjongg makes up for that gaff.</p><p>
    As ""Aluminum"" was to <i>Machinegong</i>, ""The Rrabbitt"" is the standout oddity on <i>Raydoncong</i>. It's a song that sounds like nothing else on the album or much else at all. Equal parts Fela Kuti and Devo, it could sweat out a dancehall quicker than you could say ""Ba-na-na."" Sporting a hypersonic cowbell, percussive guitar scratches, a bounding bassline, and the falsetto nonsense requisite to any proper dance number, old timers might want to tape up their pelvises for this one.</p><p>
    As with M.I.A., Mahjongg's political gesturing ends up a mere distraction at the end because they find a way to shake your can. Mahjongg's version may not be as cutting edge, but it's effective. Now, if they could duplicate ""The Rrabbitt"" a dozen times per album, young Maya would be in deep shit.</p></div>"|5643.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5643-raydoncong-2005/|7.5|Peter Macia

""I can't believe he was doing this in '88,"" said Damon. ""And here we all were in our indie rock bands and we didn't know.""</p><p>
    
    Looking back, it's safe to say that hardly anybody outside of Japan had much inkling of what Masaki Batoh and his fellow mystics in Ghost were getting up to in the late 1980s. Nor could anyone have easily predicted what a psych-folk, prog-rock colossus the group would someday become. With their origins in guerrilla street performance and ritualistic collective improvisations staged at various Tokyo-area temples, the band's formative years seemed destined to remain in the shadows.</p><p> 
    
    Thankfully, however, that impression has changed with the release of <i>Metamorphosis</i>, Drag City's astonishing new collection of Ghost audio and video rarities. Packed with more than an hour of previously unheard music and nearly two hours of unearthed video documents, <i>Metamorphosis</i> contains footage from virtually every chapter of the group's existence. And though its appeal will likely be exclusively limited to those already familiar with Ghost's inspired majesty, for the avid fan this set might possibly seem too good to be true.</p><p>
    
    Comprised entirely of material dating from the years 1987-89, the CD portion of <i>Metamorphosis</i> showcases various early versions of Ghost as they ambitiously cast their sound about, quite audibly seeking to test their limits and capabilities. Centered around the steadfast core of charismatic leader Batoh and multi-instrumentalists Taishi Takizawa and Kazuo Ogino, the music created by these pre-Kurihara editions of the band often bears little resemblance to rock, and on the pieces collected here Ghost instead forge a potent, captivating blend of free jazz, acid folk, and traditional Japanese sounds.</p><p>
    
    It's difficult to guess what might've been informing the group's material of this era-- particularly since at points here these guys seem just a step or two removed from subsisting on twigs and lichen. But several of these improvised tracks consider the same fiery trails lit by such previous explorers as AMM or free players from the classic BYG label roster. Meanwhile, the 1988 outtake ""Blood Red River"" finds Batoh emoting over some bent dustbowl blues in a strange, low-pitched drawl that manages to evoke Skip Spence.</p><p>
    
    As fascinating as most of this embryonic music on the CD is, it's <i>Metamorphosis</i>' DVD presentation that contains most of this collection's true revelations. Featuring an abundance of live footage from various Ghost incarnations in a wide variety of venues, this disc provides a relatively succinct visual record of the group's timeline. Though much of this video is of rather shaky quality- most of the clips feature the erratic sound, dim lighting and stationary cameras that U.S. viewers might associate with cable access programming- this is made up for by the fact that this material exists at all and we actually get to watch it.</p><p>
    
    This video collection is rife with highlights, starting with the earliest clip from 1984 which features a skinny, shirtless Batoh staging a noisy one-man demonstration in front of Tokyo's Chinese embassy to protest the occupation of Tibet. Other gems include a dynamite set of acoustic material recorded in a wooden Jesuit church in 1993 (the band billed itself as a ""medieval music club"" to get permission to play) a couple raucous tracks from 2002's Terrastock Festival in Boston, and an extended segment of more recent material performed at a 2004 Tokyo concert.</p><p> 
    
    Another bonus video not to be missed is of a wild 1988 group performance in a busy Tokyo train station, showcasing Batoh and Ogino in full free-form wail as bemused commuters file past. As with all the best of <i>Metamorphosis</i>' delights, the piece fills the viewer with immense appreciation for Ghost's haunting alien magic, and also spurs the hope that somewhere right this instant-- be it in Tokyo, Helsinki, Sao Paulo, or in your own town- another such collection of enlightened players are kicking up their own similarly beautiful racket.</p></div>"|3441.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3441-metamorphosis-ghost-chronicles-1984-2004/|8.5|Matthew Murphy

It's difficult to imagine a wordless fjord of post-rock, jazz fusion, ambient electronica, and outlying points cracking the hook-happy American charts, but that's just what the influential dectet's 2002 sophomore album <em>The Stix</em> did upon its release in Norway. Only Coldplay and Queens of the Stone Age separated it from the top slot.</p><p>
    Even more outlandish is the idea of something like Jaga on America's compartmentalized commercial radio, but ""All I Know Is Tonight"", the first song on <em>What We Must</em>, is already in rotation in Norway. The track is nearly eight minutes of gentle pageantry: An echoing cavern of triumphant guitars and keys, the breathy song of wind and reed instruments, adroit percussion dancing concisely around the beat, and a beautifully barren middle section where a silvery, liquid guitar lead delicately contorts through distinct moods and colors before igniting in a series of minor explosions, more like sparklers than fireworks. On pop radio. For perspective, imagine tuning in to a major American station and hearing Nickelback fade into a Broken Social Scene instrumental. My mind!</p><p>
    The members of Jaga Jazzist can be traced through various high-profile Scandinavian bands including Motorpsycho, Supersilent, and Shining, and if you're beginning to liken their role in the Norwegian art-pod to Godspeed's in Montreal's incestuous scene, you're on the right track. <em>What We Must</em> plays like Godspeed encased in ice, shorn of dissonance and tooth-grinding crescendos to reveal a purely melodic, understatedly majestic core. It's alternately narcotic and galvanizing, like Icelandic composer Jóhann Jóhannsson's <em>Virðulegu forsetar</em> with a few more notes and lot more instruments, and its pleasures are many: ""Stardust Hotel"", a springy, reverb-drenched dream of flight; the sparse, fluid music-box jazz of ""For All You Happy People""; a chorus of angels with long brass horns straddling ""Oslo Skyline""; and the shapeshifting Apostle of Hustle-like cloud of voice-synths, bubbly drums and fleet vibes on ""I Have a Ghost Now What?""</p><p>
    Those of you who like your instrumental music to be fractured and shrouded might prefer the aforementioned Shining and write off Jaga as boring; the rest should find ample rewards in <em>What We Must</em>'s effortless sonority and memorable arrangements. And if you're like me, you're dreaming of a gigantic antenna powerful enough to pick up radio signals from Norway.</p></div>"|4196.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4196-what-we-must/|7.7|Brian Howe

    I wonder if there's any connection between this relatively new shift and this decade's obvious affinity for collectives. If a band (in the most traditional sense of the word) has historically been about conveying a unified front, maybe a collective works more like a safety net, something there to frame and contain all of the different music coming out of it, providing all the social support of a band without any of the commitment.</p><p>
    
    Of course, as we're slowly finding out, collectives have their drawbacks too, among which over-saturation by association ranks near the top of the list. With three of its five members also principle players in !!!, Out Hud's biggest challenge with this, their second record, would have been to shake off dance punk's residual baggage and make something that didn't sound like it was coming from within an echo chamber. On those terms-- and in fact, on pretty much any terms-- <em>Let Us Never Speak of It Again</em> is a huge success, a fresh-sounding record that doesn't feel too obviously indebted to anything that's come before it, much less like anything Out Hud have made before.</p><p>
    
    A lot of that has to do with the singing of Out Hud's female constituency, drummer Phyllis Forbes and cellist Molly Schnick, whose vocal presence-- their first outside of a few moans into an echo machine on early single ""Guilty Party""-- ceases the Kranky band's flirtation with post-rock and moves them into more overtly pop terrain. Just as important to the makeover is Justin Vandervolgen's production, which exchanges the sprawling, jam-based guitar workouts of the band's prior material in favor of a punchier, springier, more electronic sound. In terms of sounds and timbres, a decent analog would be Mu, who riff on disco, dance, haunted house atmospherics, and cheap MIDI patches to similarly great effect.</p><p>
    
    With its elastic snares, cheap pianos, and fluffy vocals, second track ""It's For You"" sets the tone for a much leaner album. Although Tyler Pope's distinctively robust guitar sounds creep into the mix every once and a while, Out Hud generally stick to a more plasticky, dance-informed palette; nowhere is that more pronounced than on the album centerpiece, the eight-minute ""The Song So Good They Named It Twice"". Comprising peeling synth lines, a rumbling bass kick and a flickering clap track, its maximalist builds are loosely informed by LCD Soundsystem's club-oriented tracks, which is no bad thing. Elsewhere, more song-oriented highlights include the lone guitar workout ""One Life To Leave"" and the wonderful ""How Long"", which begins on a lumbering cello line before dissolving into a gorgeous slice of digital pop.</p><p>
    
    But really, the album is so well-paced and smartly assembled that to single out individual tracks feels counterintuitive; as light and as effervescent as anything I've heard this year, <em>Let Us Never Speak of It Again</em> bounds between sounds and styles as freely as the people who made it.</p></div>"|6060.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6060-let-us-never-speak-of-it-again/|8.0|Mark Pytlik

Worse still when once you learn that it's just a mere alias for some moody, does-it-all indie-rock guy named Craig Gurwich. The moniker is too long and the alliteration involved makes it hard to say even two times fast. You could shorten it to Shatter Creek but that would be like moving from the heart of Bad Band Name City to the seedy outskirts. But such quibbles would be moot if Gurwich's apparition-folk somehow rose above his fifth-rate Skeet Ulrich slasher-flick handle on his second full-length. No such luck. Mired in empty waves of echo and sleepy-time acoustic-slosh arrangements, the singer/songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and producer matches the crushing boredom of his nickname as he listlessly indulges in his own banal depressions throughout much of <em>All the Answers.</em></p><p>
     
    ""I used to be optimistic,"" croons the California man in a lofty, angelic way that recalls a seriously NyQuil-ed Jim James of My Morning Jacket, ""But I can't lie/ All I see is the dying of the earth, junk piles of trash and disease."" Well, ok! If ""Optimistic"" was some kind of post-modern, post-liberal, self-reflexive take on overbearing pessimism, it could be worth a single tear. But as is, its downtrodden lyrical bluntness and airy atmospherics waft and sway without much impact. The song's noisy and dissonant outro is a welcome respite from the flat haze, too bad such restless moments are disappointingly rare.</p><p>
     
    Gurwich's chief strength is his voice and, as producer, the multi-tracked harmonies he creates with it. Delicate and pretty, his vulnerable wail connects on the few backwoods ballads that offer a pulse, weak as it may be. The album's title track offers an appealing, slow-motion melody with the singer finding a comfort in the naive helplessness of his own trembling delivery. Still, such helplessness easily turns into a pathetic desperation with lines like, ""You should pay more attention to me.""</p><p>
     
    Back-to-back insomnia cures ""You Don't Have to Be Perfect to Be Loved"" and ""Rebecca"" mark the record's crusty-eyed lowpoint. The former lulls with the requisite finger-pick strum and whisper vox along with a <i>Legend of Zelda</i>-esque whistle refrain; while listening, I half expected gnome-y old-timers to walk out of my closest, do a lame dance around my bed and tumble to the floor. With lyrics like, ""You were so young and pretty/ You were something else, yeah/ But you never felt quite pretty,"" the latter's twinkly-piano-propelled analysis of a young woman will make you long for the edgy insightfulness of Norah Jones.</p><p>
     
    Maybe the Craigster should learn to divvy out his many responsibilities (he also designed the album's artwork!) in a more appropriate manner for his next project because this one-man-band thing isn't doing much for my ears or, based on the record's dour words, his personal life. Get some friends. Find a nice girl. Plug in the guitar every once and a while. None of us have <em>All the Answers, but we can usually muster up a couple good ones when prodded.</em></p></div>"|7562.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7562-all-the-answers/|3.8|Ryan Dombal

Along the way they apparently recorded their every stray whirr and blip, and now-- after what must have been a mind-boggling editing process-- they've whittled nearly 18 hours of live audio footage down to the relatively succinct 45-minute compilation <em>Yearlong</em>.</p><p>
    
    Due to this nomadic recording process, Whitman and Davis have understandably put little emphasis on continuity here, choosing instead to offer <em>Yearlong</em> as something of a representative cross-section of their various joint creations. This has resulted in a sampler with an astonishing constantly evolving pool of noises and textures, but one that unfortunately doesn't generate the momentum necessary for these pieces to cohere into a gratifying whole.</p><p>
    
    As composers both Whitman and Davis possess a restless streak of invention, so it doesn't feel entirely accurate to label this album as a departure for either artist. Nevertheless, <em>Yearlong</em> consists predominantly of pieces that are considerably freer and more dissonant than what I've previously associated with either performer.</p><p> 
    
    Thanks to their chosen equipment and methods, it'd be virtually impossible to identify which musician is actually responsible for generating which noises. However, Whitman in particular seems to be really stretching his legs here, as most of these pieces bear little resemblance to either the fractured IDM of his Hrvatski recordings or the rigorous dronescapes of past albums like 2002's <i>Playthroughs</i>. Tracks like the opener, recorded in Cambridge, Mass., in May 2002, immediately thrust the listener into an inhospitable electronic dust-bowl, with loose, jarring fragments of sound flying from every direction. Other performances, such as the first of two recorded at the Knitting Factory in June 2002, are studded with random, percussive scraps that stubbornly refuse to assemble themselves into recognizable rhythms. (One can only hope that the audiences who witnessed some of these live events had somewhere comfy to sit.)</p><p>
    
    Elsewhere, snatches of piano or orchestral samples briefly bubble and surface before being dashed against the duo's rugged electronic coastline. The most vibrantly constructed piece, recorded at the 2002 Impakt festival in Holland, finds the two sounding as if they are conducting a distant symphony from within a gentle meteor shower, and draws <em>Yearlong</em> to a tranquil yet appropriately diffuse close.</p></div>"|8663.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8663-yearlong/|6.9|Matthew Murphy

    mark, <em>Get Ready was pretty damn good; but for New Order, that return-from-wherever effort was a bit meh. New Order's ""meh"" is often better than most group's ""hell yeah,"" but 
    that doesn't disguise their shortcomings, and ""Who's Joe""-- the first track from New Order's latest album, </em><em>Waiting for the Sirens' Call-- is a continuation of the 
    underwhelming competence of the band's previous album. That track isn't as in love with the 
    sound of space-age guitars as <i>Get Ready</i>, but it's still a 
    three-minute song that's given an extra two minutes' worth of rope to turn 
    stiff and tepid. Combine that with the unwarranted focus on Bernard Sumner and his lyrical stylings-- not often a main attraction for New Order (and for good reason)-- and I'm settling in for another reasonably competent, mildly underwhelming 
    effort from a group that doesn't need to prove a damn thing to anyone.</em></p><p>
    
    But then the second track, ""Hey Now What You Doing"", manages to make 
    its five-minute length seem like half that. Credit the pronounced presence 
    of that nifty Peter Hook basswork, or the pithier words Sumner spits 
    (""You have the brightest future/ Writing songs on your computer""-- 
    believe me, it sounds better in context), but this sounds more like a 
    group that's doing the damn thing and not just coasting on their own 
    coattails. And then the title track comes on, and it's this gorgeous 
    effortless shimmering thing, mournful and ebullient all at once. And then 
    the first single, ""Krafty"", with its synth flourishes and corny 
    pop-perfect sentiment (""But out there the world is a beautiful place/ With 
    mountains, lakes and the human race"") blows the doors wide open, and any trepidation I had regarding this record 
    dies on the vine.</p><p>
    
    In his review of <i>Get Ready</i>, Pitchfork's own Joe Tangari makes note of 
    how much the album rocked, which is probably why it felt to me as if the 
    group went astray. First and foremost, New Order is a pop band-- just 
    ask Frente!-- and for them to try their hand at loud guitars and 
    loud beats doesn't play to the group's strengths. Nor does such a 
    maneuver do them any favors when compared to their contemporaries-- Primal 
    Scream's Bobby Gillespie made a guest appearance on <i>Get Ready</i>, which is 
    fitting, since his group's <i>XTRMNTR</i> did what <i>Get Ready</i> attempted to do, only bigger, louder, and-- most importantly-- better.</p><p>
    
    In comparison, <i>Sirens' Call</i> features the Scissor 
    Sisters' Ana Matronic-- she gets a verse and a few background lines in 
    ""Jetstream"", a chirpy, flippant track where ""you are my jetstream lover"" 
    and a sense of laconic confidence out-Kylies Ms. Minogue at 
    her own coy game. When it's firing on all cylinders, <i>Sirens' Call</i> 
    offers manic pop thrills that either recall the group's heyday, or slyly 
    recalls the noise made by other people that were touched by New Order-- 
    dig that Ace of Base action in ""I Told You So"". The track lengths don't 
    lend themselves to a tidy, hit-and-run pop experience, but they do 
    offer a taste of what the inevitable extended dance remix would 
    sound like.</p><p>
    
    The one track that most conforms to the three-minute radio oligarchy is 
    closer ""Working Overtime"". It's a garagey barn-burner, not 
    too dissimilar to <i>Get Ready</i> single ""Crystal"". These track's placements on 
    their respective albums are a telling sign of New Order's 
    confidence level. ""Crystal"" was <i>Get Ready</i>'s centerpiece and calling card, the document that was supposed to announce to the world that New Order Is 
    Back and could ably play ball with the kids they fathered. In some 
    sense, it was a capitulation by a group that had no need to capitulate. 
    ""Working Overtime"" is an afterthought, a track that does what ""Crystal"" 
    did with less pomp and exerted effort, announcing to all those 
    aforementioned indebted groups that, oh by the way, they can write these sorts 
    of songs in their sleep, and they can put them at the end of their 
    records, because they don't need to play ball with the other kids. They 
    invented the game. In other words, they're New Order. And you're not.</p></div>"|5769.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5769-waiting-for-the-sirens-call/|7.9|David Raposa

In this case, that's a proudly sentimental compliment. Such dancers typically slap together bits of a dozen songs into a five-minute mix. There are no seamless pause-edits to keep the groove; you can actually hear the tape machine stopping and re-recording between each cut, and yet there is an odd pleasure in grooves that work <i>against</i> dancing.</p><p>
    
    Venezia almost rarely keeps his attention on a beat, sample, or melody for more than a couple of bars-- it's prime listening for the attention-deficient, like lysergic cartoon music that evokes the ghosts of <i>Looney Tunes</i> composers Carl Stalling and Raymond Scott. ""Rad Girl Killy"" nails that effect with a zigzagging, rubber-band violin, all bludgeoned by crashing ""Amen"" breaks. Nothing ever seems settled on <em>This Means Forever</em>-- before a sound can dig in its heels, it's slashed apart by a new sonic idea. Bedroom musicians have exploited that premise for years, but Venezia unleashes a genuine trash-punk vibe. He often sings like Fugazi's Guy Picciotto paying his bills as a rollerdisco DJ struggling to coax people onto the dancefloor. The audience response could be the breakbeats that shatter his DJ booth's glass after a thousand hits.</p><p>
    
    ""Wake the dead kids, one at a time!"" Venezia belts out on opener ""Shaken"" over broken-footed beats, before DSP work gags his vocals with an ether-dipped cloth midway through. ""Glassy Eyes"" thumps a groove barely held by twittering synths, while the stronger ""Rocker Party"" focuses on a testosterone-poisoned rhythm.</p><p>
    
    Standouts are the Alec Empire-on-Nickelodeon funk of ""Never, Nah"", the oxygen-depleted dancefloor strut of ""Hushhushdance"", and the diced-up serenades of ""Dubbio"". Most striking is closer ""Tivoli Clinic (10.28.00)"", a fading Polaroid of a ballad with brass drones that simmer into oblivion-- a prime comedown after all that delirium.</p></div>"|2603.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2603-this-means-forever/|7.1|Cameron Macdonald

For a 13-year-old with no concept of the intricacies of gouging consumers on shipping charges, the deal was stellar; the Damned, however, were not-- not then, anyway. I didn't get the ridiculously theatrical melodrama of ""I Just Can't Be Happy Today"" or the smirking, jovial skewering of the British tourism industry in ""Lovely Money""; the Damned seemed noisy, insane, and-- the worst offender-- they used a keyboard, which, after a decade of all the ""Axel F"" I could handle, was a problem. I had flannel to wear, and I couldn't be bothered.</p><p>
    So I listened once and forgot them for a year; when I finally returned, understanding suddenly bloomed from ignorance. If punk ever had an ideal of doing your own thing, breaking the rules, or any of the other liberating clichés it's been reduced to, the Damned embodied that for as long as any band could. They eschewed political poses and anti-authoritarian rants (except to piss off the mob once in a while) and just played whatever the hell they wanted and had some fun doing it.</p><p>
    That's the true importance of the Damned, in a way that my retelling of the band's convoluted history could never convey. And maybe that-- the unexpected spark of life not present in so many other punk artifacts-- explains why the Damned continue to be relentlessly compiled. Adding the three-disc <i>Neat Neat Neat</i> anthology to an array of live and ""best of"" comps that greatly outnumber the band's seven proper studio recordings (not counting any latter-day reunion offal) is a tough sell. <i>Neat Neat Neat</i> fights for table scraps at an already glutted table, but is further hindered by the Damned's own sordid recording history. Because as great and vital as the Damned were, they produced a limited selection of truly unassailable material: the white-hot fireball of <i>Damned Damned Damned</i> and their psych-punk powerhouse <i>Machine Gun Etiquette</i>. The intervening, stagnant <i>Music for Pleasure</i> and their later descent in gothic kitsch leave far less salvageable material.</p><p>
    Of all the comps, only the thorough <i>Light at the End of the Tunnel</i> managed to hit the necessary highs while making the band's lesser material stand up by comparison. Rather than include too little and join the multitudes of shallow, uneven also-rans, <i>Neat Neat Neat</i> errs on the side of overkill but simply can't justify its length. Still, credit where it's due: the Sanctuary comp misses none of the Damned's most important moments-- ""New Rose"", the blistering ""Love Song"" and ""Neat Neat Neat, and the brilliant, cocaine-fueled shot at the Beatles' ""Help"", to name a few-- while managing to pack in some extra quality as well. A couple of extra tracks from original lead guitarist Brian James' glory days, like the tongue-in-cheek lament of ""Fan Club"" or ""Born to Kill"", and some less-seen later-period gems such as the incomparable arrogance of ""I Think I'm Wonderful"" and ""Melody Lee"" are excellent inclusions. With the inexplicable exception of ""Plan 9 Channel 7"", virtually everything a casual Damned fan needs to hear is included.</p><p>
    But oh, they include a lot more than that, sadly. Like the Damned themselves, <i>Neat Neat Neat</i> is guilty of not quitting while it's ahead. Stultifying inclusions like ""Your Eyes"", ""Billy Bad Breaks"", and ""Dozen Girls"" make the LP a chore. The Damned endure, first among equals as the unsung (well, less sung) heroes of British punk, and they do so because unlike those eventually caught in their own rhetoric or tied to stereotype (with their own bondage, no less), the Damned epitomized the mindless, directionless energy that kinda got punk rolling in the first place. Thorough or not, a Damned compilation may be chaotic, uneven, and head-scratchingly baffling, but it should never be a chore.</p></div>"|2155.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2155-neat-neat-neat-the-alternative-anthology/|7.5|Eric Carr

Hey, there's ""Autumn Sweater"". Hey, there's the band's first single. Hey, it's a big day coming. Hey, it's a motherfucker. And, hey, it's a third bonus disc with 16 rarities and never-before released tracks! It's like the Kansas Jello mold I never knew I wanted! That is, until I heard Georgia Hubley singing both an acoustic demo of ""Tom Courtenay"" and a recording of Sun Ra's ""Dreaming"". Feel free to send back the unrecognizable mulching of Fleetwood Mac's ""Dreams"" for a full refund, and keep the rest of the music. Operators are standing by.</p><p>
    
    Be warned, though-- instead of chronologically progressing through the band's catalog, <em>Prisoners of Love</em> wants the listener to consider Yo La Tengo's body of work as a timeless object, all songs rising from the same fertile ground. It's a disingenuous approach to take, in some respects-- the early early stuff, for the most part, sounds like Springsteen and R.E.M. happening all at once, and it can stick out like a pair of neon Zubaz when set against the assured and confident music the group made once they found themselves.</p><p>
    
    The one exception to the earnest jangle of the group's salad days is ""The Story of Jazz"", a track from Yo La Tengo Album #2, <i>New Wave Hot Dogs</i>. It's that album's final track, a pisstakey indie-rock rave-up where Ira Kaplan works out his pigfucker tendencies by name-checking and emulating Steve Albini. ""And I saw this band/ Their name escaped me by Thursday/ And the way it happened, looking, look for something to believe in."" On this compilation, it's followed by their recently recorded version of Sun Ra's ""Nuclear War"", wherein the group, dropping f-bombs left and right like they're talking about the weather, sounds a lot meaner and ballsier.</p><p>
    
    Talking tough was never Yo La Tengo's strong suit, though: Yes, they can sound just fine giving the thrash rock of Dead C a trial run (as they do on their version of ""Bad Politics"", available on the Kansas Jello mold), but Yo La Tengo is a lover, not a fighter. ""Sugarcube"", ""Little Eyes"", ""You Can Have It All"", ""Autumn Sweater"", ""By The Time It Gets Dark""-- love love love. (Also, check the name of this collection.) Even when Kaplan's head splits open near the end of ""Pablo and Andrea"", it's all sunshine and lollipops. And when Kaplan sounds most like Thurston Moore (instead of Lou Reed), it's in the service of ""Big Day Coming"", a song that's unabashedly optimistic and ebullient. In some ways, it could be viewed as an answer to the studied rock-and-roll cynicism of ""Teenage Riot""-- ""We can play a Stones song, 'Sittin' on a Fence'/ And it'll sound pretty good, 'til I forget how it ends."" There's Yo La Tengo's 20 years summarized neatly into two lines.</p><p>
    
    If there is one problem with <em>Prisoners of Love</em>, it's the wonky pacing. The first four tracks on Disc One-- the mantra-like ""Shaker"", the organ-haze shimmer of ""Sugarcube"", the not-so-dull roar of ""Barnaby, Hardly Working"", and the gently shuffling ""Little Eyes""-- are all good in and of themselves, but end up butting heads when laid back-to-back. It's only after the fifth track, ""Stockholm Syndrome"", that the disc finally seems to start. Also, each disc tosses in the seven-minute Yo La Tengo jam near the end, because every Yo La Tengo disc has the seven-minute jam. The end is also where the covers are dumped-- Disc One's penultimate track is the group's Casiotronic version ""You Can Have It All"", while Disc Two pulls into the garage with Sandy Denny's ""By The Time It Gets Dark"" hot on the heels of Sun Ra. And, of course, there's the caveat I offered earlier about the haphazard non-chronological song ordering.</p><p>
    
    As odd as that approach might seem, it's a fitting way to pay tribute to the group's catch-all aesthetic. Even if the band's main influence is easily pegged (see: the Velvet Underground, if you haven't already), Yo La Tengo is informed by so many other musics (as their choice in covers will attest) that it's hard to say where one influence ends and another begins. It's an approach that's mirrored in how the group switches it up on the mic. If you're not paying attention, you might mistake Hubley's croon for Kaplan's warble, and you might mistake James McNew's high-pitched voice as either Hubley or Kaplan reaching for the high C over C.</p><p>
    
    It's also mirrored in how they denote songwriting credit-- all songs written by members of Yo La Tengo are attributed to Yo La Tengo, not to individuals. Three people, one voice, one body of song. The subtitle to this collection calls <em>Prisoners of Love</em> ""A Smattering of Scintillating Senescent Songs"". That 10-cent word in the subtitle-- senescent-- means ""old"" or ""aging."" As Byron Coley tells it in the liner notes, this ""aging"" involved the group transforming ""from folk-rock reinvigorators into loose-stringed riff monsters, keyboard dream-pop hypnotizers, and beyond."" Fine wines wish they could age as well as Yo La Tengo.</p></div>"|8872.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8872-prisoners-of-love/|8.2|David Raposa

Following the success of their recent singles compilation, <em>Meltdown</em> sets its crosshairs precisely at the continent across the pond-- it's their most American-sounding album so far.</p><p>
    The irony is that this album has been languishing without a stateside release for the past nine months. Hopefully, no one picked up the import sight unseen and expected to get their face melted-- despite palm-muted guitars and rollicking drums, the approach is a little more Smashing Pumpkins than Judas Priest. Most songs intermittently use heavy riffs as dressing to sneak in their sing-a-long melodies, like lead single ""Orpheus"" and ""Detonator"". Only the springy chord-thrashing of ""Clones"" befits the album's artwork, though given the convincing production from Nick Raskulinecz (Foo Fighters, System Of A Down) it would fit snugly into an American modern rock playlist. <em>Meltdown</em> has a cohesive sound, but takes a few dips into cliché, like the power ballad ""Starcrossed"" or the Placebo-like lyrical baiting of ""Vampire Love"".</p><p>
    Sadly missing here is Ash's sense of vulnerability, a key element to their charm. While it's an obvious grab for North American ears, if this is anyone's first exposure to Ash, they'd be better off hunting down the group's earlier albums to understand why the band has made it this far; <em>Meltdown</em> is an incomplete picture of what they're capable of.</p></div>"|310.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/310-meltdown/|6.8|Jason Crock

The 11 tracks on his 12th album plod soddenly, leaden of pace and bleak of atmosphere. Drawn-out running times and a uniform midtempo crawl can test the patience of even a devoted listener, so it's a testament to Chesnutt's intricate and intelligent songwriting that <em>Ghetto Bells</em> is listenable at all.</p><p>
<em>Ghetto Bells</em> eschews the shininess of 2003's <i>Silver Lake</i> for a dirtier, more organic sound. Again, the list of collaborators is impressive: Van Dyke Parks contributes a string arrangement for ""Virginia"" and plays accordion on other tracks; Bill Frisell plays guitar, most notably the mercurial solo on ""Forthright""; Chesnutt's niece Liz Durrett duets on ""What Do You Mean?""; and former Lone Justice and Jayhawks drummer Don Heffington keeps supple time throughout. Producer John Chelew describes the resultant sound as ""nighttime."" Songs like ""Vesuvius"" and ""Virginia"" amble along somnambulantly, and ""Forthright"" conjures a Gothic insomnia as Chesnutt wanders a lonely house contemplating death and hominy.</p><p>
    
    If slow, these songs are ultimately and admirably patient and fluid, building not to grandiloquent climaxes but to a greater and greater complexity of meaning. 
    The album's distinct personality derives from minute nuances. For instance, on ""What Do You Mean?"" Chesnutt's uncertain phrasing of the line ""like a puppy on a trampoline"" contrasts nicely with Durrett's ethereal rejoinder ""what does that mean?"" The result is an intergenerational call-and-response, a joke told in reverse, and a gentle jab at the enduring eccentricities of Chesnutt's lyrics.</p><p>
    
    The hyperquotable ""Vesuvius"" is a standout. It begins with the Herculean task of ""trying to clip the creek to the bank with a clothes pin,"" then declares that ""hypertension is not wisdom."" The line ""Christian charity is a doily over my death boner"" is an epigram in search of a subversive novel, and ""Neapolitan ice cream is never truly integrated/ Until it's too late"" reveals larger implications that transcend the merely personal. Chesnutt is singing about the confusion of race relations and ""whitey boy guilt"" filtered through a skewed sense of humor and an idiosyncratic system of symbols; the muddle itself is the meaning. Meanwhile Heffington's brushed snare and Park's sparkling piano prod the song toward its inevitable Vesuvian eruption.</p><p>
    
    Songs like ""Vesuvius""-- not to mention ""Rambunctious Cloud"" and ""Gnats""-- have depth, a cagey charm, and an elusive mystery that demand not just repeated but aggressive listening. Chesnutt and his collaborators don't make that level of attention easy, but they do make it worthwhile.</p></div>"|1434.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1434-ghetto-bells/|7.5|Stephen M. Deusner

    Lee's no fun to pick on anymore. A vengeful, hype-smiting deity has
    already rained down the toughest punches: rejection both by the majors
    and ex-girlfriend Claire Danes, best days past at 26, bottom billing
    in quasi-supergroup the Bens (and don't tell me it was alphabetical).
    On <em>Awake Is the New Sleep</em>, the former wunderkind decides the
    best way to exorcise his post-Danes demons is more syrupy, anonymous
    light pop.</p><p>
    
    Lee's ""album about waking up"" is as refreshing as a decades-old Nike
    slogan. ""Just do it, whatever it is,"" the young Aussie advises amid
    the repetitive finger-picking of opener ""Whatever It Is"". On ""We're
    All in This Together"", he philosophizes 20-plus times that we're all
    just that (""yeah!""), so ""open your heart"" and let the ""Hey Jude"" coda
    in. ""The Debt Collectors"" shoots for <em>Up</em>-era R.E.M., Lee's
    vocals breaking with tender emotion over rhymes like ""We can make a
    deal, everything is real"" and similes stolen from Built to Spill album
    titles. Vapid is the new deep!</p><p>
    
    Mostly, Lee really <em>really</em> misses his girlfriend. He aches for
    her in ""Ache for You"", feels far away on ""Close I've Come"", gets
    spurned by would-be rebounds on ""Get Gotten"". The ""Roxanne"" rocksteady
    of Australian single ""Gamble Everything for Love"" is at least
    bearable, but its ""you can go your own way"" lyric makes Lee's
    Fleetwood Mac-pillaging on ""No Right Angles"" that much more obvious
    (""Dreams"", bitches!). Let the healing start with soft-rocker ""Begin"",
    which could be this year's ""Cigarettes Will Kill You"" if it ever rose
    above seventh-grade poetry: ""It's OK for you to care, 'cause I can feel
    you in the air."" Dumb is the new sensitive!</p><p>
    
    Like a washed-up athlete, Lee's stuck reliving his glory years. Perky
    U.S. radio hit ""Catch My Disease"" proudly (and ironically) brandishes
    the obsolete badge of 90s indiedom: ""They don't play me on the radio/ And that's the way I like it."" Lee big ups Good Charlotte, too, and
    revisits lyrical coup ""open your heart,""-- this time as a chorus. Fellow
    90s phenom Brad Wood produces, vainly drenching the lackluster
    songwriting in the dentist's-office electronica of Lee's 1999
    <em>Breathing Tornadoes</em>-- which ""Into the Dark"" name-checks in the
    most pathetic self-allusion you'll hopefully never hear. The new Ben
    Lee is the old Ben Lee is every LSAT-flunking strummer in the
    fraternity of your choice-- and cute, too!</p></div>"|4713.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4713-awake-is-the-new-sleep/|2.9|Marc Hogan

He's also had a lot of
    girlfriends, most of whom have left him. This combination is the
    nuclear fission of pop songwriting, and the afflicted can (and do)
    write inexhaustibly about the topics. Benson has been at it for almost
    a decade, and until now he's shown no sign of shaking his nicotine
    grievances. But there may be hope for him yet: On the title track to his new album (a song carried over from his 2003 EP <i>Metarie</i>), we learn he's been ""forever in search of the alternative to love.""</p><p>
    
    Has he found it? Nah. Benson's verbalizes his commitment to change, but action precedes essence, <i>mon frere, and while </i><i>The Alternative to Love</i> is an well-intentioned record, Benson ends up sticking to his water pistols, squirting lovelorn power-pop spooned with la-la vanilla.</p><p>
    
    I imagine Benson works game the same way his songs ingratiate themselves, which is to say he knows smiling indomitability can be endearing when the hipsters' disinterested shtick grows tiresome. Jaunty and overeager to reach the chorus, ""Spit It Out"" abides its title. But while it isn't ""Tiny Spark"" (<i>Lapalco</i>'s stellar opener and Benson's Saturn commercial-poached claim to fame), ""Spit It Out"" has its charms, including a tease of a chorus that pulls back right when you expect it to explode.</p><p>
    
    ""Cold Hands Warm Heart"" features <i>The Alternative to Love</i>'s most appealing come-on: a twinkling, pendulous bell melody that perfectly
    captures Benson's brand of shrug-it-off determination. The rest of
    the track is an exercise in la-di-da filler.</p><p>
    
    On ""I Feel Like Myself Again"", Benson proves himself a master pop
    mathematician, slithering around an offset beat to deliver a wontedly
    chewy vocal hook. He keeps saying something about ""just wait till I
    feel like myself again,"" but up to this point Benson has been in top
    form. <i>The Alternative to Love</i>'s opening triumvirate is as strong as
    any string of songs he's written, and the wistful finality of the
    sweetly cathartic title track foreshadows a disappointing comedown.</p><p>
    
    If Benson had chosen to cut the album here, he would have had a
    perfect EP. Unfortunately, breakup tales can only go as far as their
    melodies and arrangements carry them, and <i>The Alternative to Love</i>
    fails to rise as soaringly above Benson's pablum in its second half.
    We're not asking for wit and personality, just the saccharine-drunk
    that helps blur the messy details. ""Flesh and Bone"" brings a
    hippocampus-feasting melody but can't match the svelte sophistication
    of its predecessors. And although Tchad Blake's mixing is a fabulous
    constant, his consistency means the weaker tracks are revealed for
    what they are: solid formula-followers lacking the elusive intangible
    charm that an unexpected note or rhythmic tic can bring.</p><p>
    
    Latecomers ""Get It Together"" and ""Last Man Standing"" stir up a fuzz
    storm, but closer ""Between Us"" is more ellipsis than exclamation point, and
    that's a pretty accurate reflection of the kind of songwriter Benson
    is. On ""Last Man Standing"" he sums it up best: ""I have friends that
    are married and their lives are complete, and here I am stumbling down
    a darkened street."" Benson knows better than anyone that being a
    beautiful failure beats tidy, predictable success any day.</p></div>"|657.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/657-the-alternative-to-love/|7.2|Sam Ubl

Never mind that the band had by then been around for years and that two-thirds of it-- Adam Schlesinger and Durrand's husband, Andy Chase-- were not only American but did double duty in Long Island\xD0based Fountains of Wayne. Since then, Ivy took steps away from their Francophilia on 2001's overlooked <i>Long Distance</i> and the 2002 covers album <i>Guest Room</i>, Schlesinger wooed Stacy's mom 24-7 on MTV, and Durrand released an EP and an album with side project Paco.</p><p>
    On <i>In the Clear</i>, their fifth full-length, Ivy sounds less like a 90s throwback than a late-eighties throwback. Their brand of jetset pop has grown so aerodynamic and mature, so sophisticated and airtight, that they're beginning to sound like Danny Wilson, Johnny Hates Jazz, or Breathe. That comparison may read like a harsh criticism, but this trajectory doesn't necessarily lead downward. Much of <i>In the Clear</i> sounds slick and over-rehearsed, but songs like ""Thinking About You"" and ""Tess Don't Tell"" recapture the winsome mood of the band's best work.</p><p>
    On the opener, ""Nothing But the Sky"", a low-key wash of reverby keyboards and starry-eyed guitars keeps Durrand's voice aloft as she drifts ""15 miles high."" On ""Four in the Morning"", a low bass line intermingles with an acoustic guitar to create a lonely a.m. ambience, and a backmasked guitar adds an eddying solo to ""Ocean City Girl"". But most songs on <i>In the Clear</i> focus on delivering bittersweet hooks instead of evocative atmosphere. ""Corners of Your Mind"" has a mod energy in its chorus, and Brazilian composer Zé Luis's subtle string arrangement adds snap to ""Thinking About You"".</p><p>
    As the chiaroscuro cover image implies, the album is about movement and travel, a theme that aligns with the band's strengths. Like Nina Persson and Francoise Hardy, Durrand benefits from the sleepy detachment in her voice; on these 10 songs that quality makes her sound resigned yet wide-eyed and even hopeful. Here, constant motion is not a luxury but an emotional necessity: ""In a world without you,"" Durrand sings, ""all I can do is keep moving.""</p><p>
    As produced by Chase and Schlesinger and mixed by Steve Osbourne, the album tries to conjure the anchorlessness of travel, but instead it sounds oddly weightless, floating by pleasantly but unobtrusively and rarely demanding your attention, as if the music is dissolving into the ether as it leaves your speakers. <i>In the Clear</i> ultimately proves too airy, too ephemeral: each song exists only when it's playing, washing over you but rarely lingering once it ends.</p></div>"|4144.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4144-in-the-clear/|6.5|Stephen M.

    Subject: Beck Hansen, 35 years old, Caucasian</p><p>
    
    Medical History: Physically, subject's health is good; no major or chronic issues, although voice suggests persistent sinusitis.
    Psychologically, Mr. Hansen shows a history of Multiple Personality Disorder (MPD), diagnosed in 1995 and treated intermittently
    via analysis and hypnosis. Subject's recorded personalities include:</p><p>
    
    * Dust Bowl-era folk singer, prone to wearing flannel, acoustic guitar always present, unable to leave house without harmonica
    clip (see attached materials, <i>One Foot in the Grave</i>).</p><p>
    
    * Ardent practitioner of ""hip-hop,"" exhibits ""word salad"" symptomology characteristic of schizophrenics (see <i>Mellow Gold</i>).</p><p>
    
    * Self-described ""space cowboy."" Similar to personality #1, except with claimed origin in future, rather than past. Also known to
    dabble in bossa nova. (see <i>Mutations</i>).</p><p>
    
    * Smooth-talking sexaholic, race indeterminate. Causes subject to wear small outfits with big collars. Frequently does ""the
    splits."" Earnestness of personality questionable. (see <i>Midnite Vultures</i>).</p><p>
    
    * Depressive, excessively self-reflective middle-aged man. Moves at very slow pace, exhibits fetish for exotic string arrangements,
    and shows delusional belief that he's <i>Blood on the Tracks</i>-era Bob Dylan.  By far his least enjoyable persona; friends report
    being ""really bummed out"" in his presence when these traits are dominant (see <i>Sea Change</i>). </p><p>
    
    Mr. Hansen has experienced one distinct period of personality cohesion, which is widely considered to be his most healthy and agreeable
    time (see attached materials, <i>Odelay</i>). Since this psychological peak, the patient has experienced pressure to return to this
    state, wherein all of the above personae peacefully co-exist to create a unique and well-balanced whole.  However, Mr. Hansen has
    appeared unable or unwilling to bend to these outside demands, instead spending periods of 1-2 years at various extremes of the above
    stated categories.</p><p>
    
    Current Session: Lately, Mr. Hansen has shown an increased willingness to accept the advice of his peers and doctors, mounting a
    highly motivated and publicized effort to return to the behavioral cohesion of his <i>Odelay</i> period. Reuniting with his therapists
    of that era, the Dust Brothers (Drs. M. Simpson and J. King, M.D, Ph.D), he has made a lot of progress towards this goal, exhibiting
    behavior (see attached media, <i>Guero</i>) that appears to resemble his healthier days. But whether this restoration of character
    balance is merely superficial, and, furthermore, whether it is the proper attitude for the patient, remains to be determined. </p><p>
    
    Note the resemblance of <i>Guero</i> opener ""E-Pro"" to <i>Odelay</i>'s ""Devil's Haircut"", both tracks assembled from guitar-driven
    riff-loops and Mr. Hansen's drowsy talking-blues delivery.  Notice that the twangy-acoustic vs. turntable-scratch paradoxes of
    ""Jackass"" are repeated on ""Earthquake Weather"" and ""Farewell Ride"". Further antecedent is seen in the quirk collage (sonar blips,
    harmonica, Christina Ricci) of ""Hell Yes"", which can be directly traced back to the earlier period's ""High 5 (Rock the Catskills)"".</p><p>
    
    That the patient is re-visiting past combinations of his constituent personalities is not in itself a cause for worry; after all, it
    is what most of his support system has been suggesting for many years. But one wonders whether Mr. Hansen's heart is in the proceedings,
    as many of the songs appear to be little more than weak echoes of their similar predecessors. Furthermore, stray remnants of individual
    personality types, particularly the most recently-seen ""mope"" character, pop up on ""Missing"" and ""Broken Drum,"" in the form of slow
    tempos and ""Blue Jay Way"" strings.</p><p>
    
    Other areas give indications of new, healthy ways of rectifying the contradictions within Mr. Hansen's torrid mind. ""Girl"" uses an
    NES symphony prologue to introduce a Cali-rock pastiche, the sweetness of which overcomes its serial killer lyrics and ""Hey Ya""
    biting. ""Black Tambourine"" finds the patient stripping down his usual methods, concentrating on foreboding rhythms and gimmick
    economy, while ""Earthquake Weather"" is similarly sparse, and sees Mr. Hansen using his falsetto for a purpose other than adding a
    musical wink to his less serious efforts.</p><p>
    
    All in all, my assessment of the patient's recent advances is a mixed one. Mr. Hansen has certainly attempted to follow the regimen
    recommended to him, and has done his best to recapture earlier moments of lucidity and unity, but in many ways the final result
    feels rote and calculated. It seems likely that what worked for the subject almost ten years ago may not be appropriate at this
    later stage; in today's landscape, the methods seem a bit obsolete and over-prescribed. Mr. Hansen may have given us what we
    demanded, but, at this juncture, we should consider that his personalities have drifted so far apart that they are better left that
    way.</p></div>"|621.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/621-guero/|6.6|Rob Mitchum

The British rapper's album <i>Run Come Save Me</i> had introduced a heavy, claustrophobic, dub-inflected strain of hip-hop, going gold in the UK and earning Manuva a Mercury Music Prize nomination in the process. But I can't shake the image of Manuva staring at the ""21 Seconds"" video, shaking his head, muttering to himself, realizing that his time was over just as it was starting.</p><p>
    
    Since 2001, everything has changed. Grime has become Britain's homegrown hip-hop, and Manuva can't possibly hope to compete. As an MC, Manuva is more Tricky than Kano. He uses the empty spaces of his slow, layered tracks, laying his strong, commanding voice over the top of the beat rather than riding it. It's not that he's not a good rapper-- he is-- but if he was a contestant on Making the Band 2 and Diddy made him freestyle against Ness or Chopper, he'd stare at his shoes and mumble: ""Um, toast, um, government conspiracies. Um. I like dub."" D Double E would eat him for breakfast.</p><p>
    
    But then, D Double E would never record a track of vague slam poetry about ""mystic maze of sonic mathematics"" mumbled over late-Specials chamber-ska; Manuva does just that on ""The Haunting"". <i>Awfully Deep</i> is Manuva's <i>Kid A move, his retreat from street-rap relevance to navel-gazing experimentation. On older tracks like ""Witness (1 Hope)"", Manuva's voice was sharp and urgent; he had something to prove. These days, he sounds old and tired, and he knows it. ""This could well be my last LP/ I've had a good run, I've made a few Gs/ I've had a bit of fun, I've smoked a few trees/ And now I wanna rest my knobbly knees,"" he raps on ""Colossal Insight"".</i></p><p>
    
    As a result, <i>Awfully Deep</i> makes for churning, menacing background music. Manuva did much of the production himself, and the album's oceanic basslines, winding laser synths, and echoing guitar ripples dissipate nicely into the air. But Manuva still sounds nicest on songs like ""Rebel Heart"" and ""Chin High"", brittle, ominous tracks that don't sound too far removed from grime. Manuva has the force, vision, and charisma to remain relevant, to keep ahead of the game. He's too good to let the world pass him by, but that's exactly what will happen if he continues to disappear inside himself.</p></div>"|6944.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6944-awfully-deep/|6.4|Tom Breihan

    at a group of teenagers who just got damn lucky, winning an Australian radio contest Pearl Jam-esque demo. Their reward was a hit single and a recording budget, used to create a platinum album, and their worst crime was 
    watering down Helmet and Soundgarden riffs. Don't blame them; blame the record labels, blame alternative radio, blame the 90s. However, former Silverchair frontman Daniel 
    Johns is entirely to blame for the failure that is the Dissociatives. And 
    this debut, created with co-writer Paul Mac, is a sweeping, Technicolor failure but like 
    train wrecks and plastic surgery makeover shows, it's an 
    oddly fascinating mess.</p><p>
    
    ""We're Much Preferred Customers"" opens the LP with a soft 4/4 thud and 
    manipulated vocals. Johns then whispers 
    non-sequiturs like ""And skin that flakes like ancient paint/ Suffocate contentment"" 
    over sparse piano before the song builds to a pounding climax 
    of keyboards and multi-harmonized nonsense. It's such a shameless 
    imitation of Radiohead's ""Everything in Its Right Place"" that it'd be 
    grounds for infringement if their attempt wasn't so laughable. But from there 
    the album moves from merely bad-- the strained, disjointed 
    electro-pop ""Somewhere Down the Barrel""-- into the brain-melting disaster 
    ""Horror with Eyeballs"". It features a carnival-like verse melody and another 
    wall of Johnses on the chorus, singing ""All of this time on my 
    hands/ So far has gone/ To feeding my animals"" amid distorted, barking 
    ""na-na-na's"". It's a mad professor's experiment that's been 
    given a pop polish, and it sounds like Backstreet Boys covering Captain 
    Beefheart in a bad way. Only the strong will make it through the entire track.</p><p>
    
    The rest of the tracks songs are merely bland: ""Forever and a Day"" is whiny adult-contempo, and ""Old 
    Man, Young Man"" sets its compass towards the Beatles, almost making it 
    out of mire before the chorus turns into Collective Soul. ""Thinking in 
    Reverse"" is another near-miss that squanders a kinetic beat on an overwrought melody.</p><p>
    
    Leftfield techno vet Paul Mac seems stale working away from a 
    club-oriented context, but it's Johns who seems out of his depth. Maybe he can write a three-chord rock 
    song, but here he under-sings, over-emotes, and 
    writes melodies that spiral off in insane directions before ending up 
    nowhere-- all while multi-tracking his vocals to cover his failings. In a way, 
    this album validates the achievements of the aforementioned Radiohead 
    and other electronic-dabbling rockers: ProTools and bong hits do not an 
    artist make, nor will an electronic sheen save Johns' turgid 
    performance.</p></div>"|2602.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2602-the-dissociatives/|2.5|Jason Crock

DeMille epics that boldface hype ""A Cast of Thousands."" If it were a concert, it would be an indie-verse Live Aid. If it were a story, it'd be that chapter of <i>Ulysses</i> where James Joyce introduces the reader to just about every goddamn person in Dublin. We're talking a big canvas here, with so many guest stars you can't spit without moistening someone who has spent time on the (CMJ) charts.</p><p>
    All of which is somewhat of a U-turn for Scott Herren's best-known pseudonym, as the Prefuse 73 catalog has been distinct among its IDM environs for being emotional, intimate, and focused affairs.  Prefuse albums have had guests over for dinner before, but rarely so marquee (sorry, Prekop) and never in such numbers...hell, I'm hard pressed to think of any non-compilation that has featured so many interlopers.  Whether Herren is using <i>Surrounded By Silence</i> to spread the word about some of his favorite acts, or to insta-build a portfolio of outside production work, or a little of both, it's a much different-- and far more inconsistent-- affair than previous Prefuse efforts.</p><p>
    Much of the blame for this unevenness lies with Herren's attempts at hip-hop production, a role with tantalizing potential that so far had only been teased at with isolated, underwhelming efforts for Diverse, MF Doom, and others. <i>Silence</i>'s first taste of Prefuse on the decks, ""Hideyaface"", finds Herren brokering a backpacker's dream summit of Wu-Tang and Def Jux municipalities. Sadly, it's outperformed by the instrumental reprise that appears down the tracklist, containing a merely routine showing by Ghostface that nevertheless still manages to embarrass the cottonmouth delivery of El-P, who lamely titles himself ""Laserface"" and follows the Def Jux party line of substituting hyperlogia for talent. (See also: Aesop Rock's blunder through ""Sabbatical with Options"".)</p><p> 
    Only charismatic tracks with Jux defector Beans (""Morale Crusher"") and relative unknown Camu (""Now You're Leaving"") manage to fulfill the concept's promise, leaving one to wonder whether Herren is the victim of phoned-in MC work (looking at you, Masta Killah and GZA) or whether his considerable talents just don't adapt to background duty. Indeed, the composition of tracks like ""Just the Thought"" seems neutered compared to usual Prefuse material, short on ideas and compromising complexity. Ironically, it might be Herren's knack for atmospherics and jazz-like swing that keep his hip-hop dalliances from liftoff, as they tend to amplify rather than alleviate the dreary bookishness of underground rap emcees.</p><p>
    Appearances by artists from the rock and electronic side of the indie fence score slightly better on <i>Surrounded By Silence</i>, ranging from the disastrously shrill performance by Blonde Redhead's Kazu Makino to the delicious laptop jam between Prefuse and ihe Books. That latter track, ""Pagina Dos"", is pretty much exactly what you would expect from its constituent parts, but no less entrancing for it; an all-too-brief mixture of fractured banjo, chop-chop dialogue, and an itchier, funkier beat than the Books would normally allow themselves.</p><p>
    ""And I'm Gone"" somehow manages to squeeze another Herren alias (Piano Ovelord), Stereolabbites Broadcast, and Mexican outfit Café Tacuba into a less-than-three-minutes package, but makes it work as dense, dreamy psychedelia Caribou/Manitoba would envy. The two appearances by Claudia Deheza from On! Air! Library! (one with twin sister Alejandra) similarly make me reach for the ""ethereal"" meme, breezy like Herren's Savath + Savalas project, but without sacrificing the trademark Prefuse lope-swing and scissorhands editing.</p><p>
    Almost lost amidst the collaboration addiction are a handful of Prefuse-only tracks, the placement of which makes even the longer compositions feel like interludes. That's a shame, because while Herren shows signs of recycling old ideas (the album-opening fanfare, the wandering bassline of ""Ty versus Detchibe""), some of these solitary works outshine the superstar vehicles. ""Expressing Views is Obviously Illegal"" is the Prefuse concept at its best, with jazz, hip-hop, and IDM elements all colliding in a granola-bar musicology lecture. Similarly, ""Minutes Away Without You,"" reprises the One Word Extinguisher trick for juicing sentiment out of loops and samples, a slow jam tempo complimented by late-night noir horns.</p><p>
    Yet, if I may be albumist for a moment, it's this emotional core that's lacking from <i>Surrounded By Silence</i>, which is so caught up in the red-carpet procession that it loses the flow and cohesion of Prefuse's prior efforts. Like John Wayne popping up as a Roman guard in the crucifixion scene of <em>The Greatest Story Ever Told, any momentum achieved by the music gets tripped up by another celebrity appearance and the ensuing reach for the liner notes. Getting by with a lot of help from his friends is clearly Herren's goal on <i>Surrounded By Silence</i>, but that doesn't keep the fulfillment of that goal from making the album his least rewarding effort yet under this name.</em></p></div>"|6452.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6452-surrounded-by-silence/|6.8|Rob Mitchum

Ever since 1989, though, we've been treated to the gradually fading glow from that initial burst-- <i>Second Coming</i> was a dim reflection of their former glory that took too long to make. We won't bother talking about former Roses guitarist John Squire's Seahorses project and subsequent failure to do much of anything, but I remember when I heard Ian Brown's first solo effort, 1998's <i>Unfinished Monkey Business</i>. It was such a crappy record that I gave up on him completely, admitting to myself that one fantastic album and a bunch of pale shadows was all I'd ever get from this crew (Mani's contributions to Primal Scream notwithstanding).</p><p>
    
    I shouldn't have been completely dismissive to Brown: The two albums he's released since <i>Unfinished</i> haven't been great, but they've at least had flashes of something interesting and even a few genuinely killer songs mixed in amongst the puzzling experiments. <i>Solarized</i>, his fourth under his own steam, is his most focused, consistent solo album yet.</p><p>
    
    There's nothing terribly new to the electro-psych sound he's worked up for himself-- it actually throws back quite a bit to the Roses-- but here he has a clutch of great melodies for him to hang his honey-dipped voice on, and he delivers those nicely. It frequently helps to ignore the lyrics, mostly worn post-Britpop platitudes like ""Let the stars shine on/ 'Til the break of dawn,"" from opener ""Longsight M13"". He gets angry and topical on ""Kiss Ya Lips (No ID)"", decrying national ID cards and singing with gritty emotion instead of his trademark arrogant disaffection, but he addresses his complaints to ""Mr. Politician"" and other vague entities of authority, which doesn't help his cause.</p><p>
    
    Thankfully, ""Kiss Ya Lips"" has a sweet, spiky groove, a monster bassline, and a simple, direct beat that makes it one of the album's best tracks. The strength of the record is songs such as that-- effortlessly melodic and insanely catchy, they don't care what year it is or that trip-hop is deader than dead, and they're better for it. ""One Way Ticket to Paradise"" is a heavy guitar beatfest that nods to bhangra by way of Led Zeppelin's ""Kashmir"" and it's best if you pay no mind to how all the parts fit together and just nod your head to the deliberate tempo.</p><p>
    
    So does this restore my faith in Brown or make me mourn the members of the Stone Roses' sophomore (and junior, and senior) slumps any less? Well, no, though I'm happy that he finally gave us something that's better than merely listenable-- and that his solo career is improving, one small step at a time.</p></div>"|969.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/969-solarized/|6.1|Joe Tangari

    when my Busch Light-swigging, Kenny Chesney-worshipping ex-roommate-- who hadn't once, in six months, said a word about any of the music I
    played constantly during our time together-- mistook the singer for
    Johnny Cash. If you were lead Angel Michael Gira, what would you be
    more flattered by: Passing for the ""man in black"", or conveying to
    someone who had remained so militantly mum about, quite literally, a
    thousand other bands?</p><p>
    
    Whereas it once might have seemed ludicrous, the comparison is no
    longer that far off: Nearly 20 years removed from his work with
    seminal sadist folk-rockers Swans, Gira sounds sobered (if not
    necessarily sober) and peacefully wearied. Without the drone-soaked
    meditations and wild-eyed dynamic spirograms, Gira's music is now, shockingly,
    almost docile.</p><p>
    
    For that alone, <i>Sing ""Other People""</i> is a gutsy record. It maintains the band's lo-fi intimacy while
    expanding its breadth to include back-up singing and more
    voluminous instrumentation. Fans of <i>Everything Is Good Here/Please
    Come Home</i>, the Angels' tumultuous 2003 stab at lysergic goth-folk,
    shouldn't be faulted for thinking they're hearing a different band
    altogether. Part of this metamorphosis can be attributed to the
    assistance of fellow Young God signees Akron/Family, whose self-titled
    debut is seeing contemporaneous release.</p><p>
    
    Opener ""Lena's Song"" stakes Gira's booming baritone against a
    glistening backdrop of nylon-string plucking, fretless bass,
    glockenspiel, and a chipper Beach Boys-esque vocal
    harmony. The song proves Angels of Light capable of clarity and
    levity, qualities missing (not unfortunately) from their previous
    work. ""My Friend Thor"" is as subtle an act of self-immolation as
    a club to the head from its namesake: It starts acoustic, with a
    laconic Gira following the rigid outline of his strumming, before he's
    blindsided by a burbling gamelan orchestra. The detour moves the song from the sound of stark isolation to
    a full-on fireside jamboree, replete with a veritable tabernacle-full
    of backup vocalists.</p><p>
    
    ""Michael's White Hands"" and ""Purple Creek""-- a pleasantly woozy
    nocturne that features actual howling-- recall the
    melodrama of Angels of yore. But <i>Sing ""Other People""</i> goes
    easy on the sexual anger, capitulating to a refreshingly mundane
    flavor of storytelling. Gira doesn't take the move lightly-- he seems
    at times to be grasping for well-worn territory before refocusing
    himself with a rap on the noggin. In the end, the album is like an
    afternoon in an overstocked Salvation Army thrift store spent trying
    on heaps and heaps of secondhand merchandise, a lot of which is
    ridiculously colored, or an awkward fit, etc. But Gira's songs have
    many one-of-a-kind nuances that tether the album even when it
    ventures.</p></div>"|188.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/188-sing-other-people/|7.7|Sam Ubl

Which is why, when I first threw on Gustav's <i>Rettet Die Wale</i> after only hearing perky single ""We Shall Overcome"", I was expecting another foreign enchantress delivering sugary melodies in broken English over genre-bending beats. Boy, was I wrong. For one, Gustav, aka Eva Jantschitsch, is closer to a one-woman Ms. John Soda than a global pop diva, and some fiddling on Freetranslation.com reveals the album title's politically charged message, ""Save the Whales"", as a sign of activism to come.</p><p>
    However, Jantschitsch is way too intricate and arcane to simply rant about environmentalism and human rights for 40-plus minutes. Just as lush strings and woodwinds clash with synthetic IDM on the album, Jantschitsch's quirky intonation creates a perplexing dynamic between the vocals and gravely suggestive song titles. Take the title track, for example, where Jantschitsch croons the title mantra in German over strings borrowed from a Sinatra session. In addition to rescuing Shamu, we're also urged to fuck the system and get laid, a meta take on popular liberalism. Similarly, on the tragic ""One Hand Mona"", the portentous line ""she lost her left arm and married Karl"" is sung with a quiver and a smirk, as if Jantschitsch's on the verge of cracking up at her star-crossed protagonist.</p><p>
    The sonics on <i>Rettet Die Wale</i>, however, are far less veiled. The brainy Jantschitsch taps an extensive range of musical sources ranging from Eno to Björk to Civil Rights songs, grounding all of them in cut-and-dry laptop pop. She's perfectly content to disassemble a straightforward pop song and stretch its melody and chord progression over several more bars than necessary, isolating each individual constituent from the conglomerate. As a result, the slow-tempo numbers here require considerable patience; the six-plus minute ""Little Weird Grrrl"" doesn't burst from its rigid seems until the final 60 seconds, and a shrill organ in the Gothic ""Mein Bruder"" chillingly resonates for the song's duration, filling the listener with either absolute terror or ennui.</p><p>
    This inconspicuous backdrop pushes the vocals uncomfortably to the sonic foreground. Unlike the breathy lap-pop vocals of groups like the Notwist and Lali Puna, Jantschitsch's protrude in the mix, drawing attention to every lyric or inflective tick. ""Da, Am Monopøl"" and ""We Shall Overcome"", with their intricately proactive arrangements, are two notable exceptions, but the majority of the album leaves us to grapple with cryptic lyrics, which gloss over the tedious music beneath. Fortunately Jantschitsch's bookish, <i>She's All That</i> charisma is enough to maintain interest, and while you may have no clue what she's saying, you'll somehow come away more cultured in the end.</p></div>"|3669.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3669-rettet-die-wale/|7.4|Adam Moerder

    really be that stupid?  How much coke did Radio 4 need?  What sort of stygian rider clauses did the Air contract contain?  Did Stormin'
    Norman have nekkid pitchers of their mama to get them to put out <i>Palookaville</i>?</p><p>
    
    Though they never moved Chems-at-their-height numbers, I had assumed the Jaxx would have been one of the label's best sellers.  Yet
    Astralwerks never seemed to know how to market a studio duo with a revolving cast of singers and players to a personality-ravenous
    U.S. audience.  To date, no Basement Jaxx album has sold 40k in the states.  This can't be blamed entirely on the suits.  Unlike in
    England and continental Europe, disco <i>did</i> die here, and it's been a long, estranged trip for dance acts ever since.  We
    Americans generally like our dance music subsumed into a singer, even if that singer is Rick Astley.</p><p>
    
    From their inception, Basement Jaxx have been a house act reconciling with song, and it's been a rather protracted process.  They
    toyed with Afro-Brazilian hoo-hah for a good few years before they started mashing up ragga, noise, punk, and R&amp;B; in a Brixton
    sardine tin.  Their 1999 debut <i>Remedy</i> seemed an unexpected explosion of fecundity from sorry old house music, but it was the
    result of five years in the lab.  And it was only on 2003's <i>Kish Kash</i> that they finally, fully embraced verse/chorus/verse
    structures.  It won them a Grammy, but it may have been too late.  Even in England, dance music feels all but dead, as fragmented
    and niche-oriented as that late-80s moment before house.  The choice the Jaxx now seem to face is between fully embracing pop (as
    producers, though Felix Buxton has a lovely singing voice), or retreating to the safety (and reduced vision) of dance.</p><p>
    
    Which is a fucking shame, because their essential tension (and what makes <i>The Singles</i>, a best-of that substitutes for their
    bi-yearly new album this year, so great) is between dancefloor compulsive repetition and hook-crammed P-O-P.  The obvious point of
    comparison is P-Funk, and indeed Brother George lords over the whole B.Jaxx project like a spirit guide.  He's most audible on
    opener ""Red Alert"" from 1999: hollow, metallic slap bass, temple-wincing g-funk synths, chanted nonsense, Big Bertha Butt vocals.
    The Jaxx had done funky, noisy, and slick before, but this was the first time they didn't portion them out like Weight Watchers,
    one sound per single.  It helped that you couldn't see the joins.</p><p>
    
    ""Jump'n'Shout"" was ragga-house that barely overlapped with UK garage. You can see guest Slarta John's eyeball veins throbbing, his
    vocals all but gobbing at you, as the boys play acid like they were Ron Asheton. This is the kind of stuff-- along with the 20,000
    leagues fuzz-bass of ""Yo-Yo""-- that pinned the ""punk garage"" badge to their knapsack, both insult and perverse identification. So
    they decided to keep ratcheting things up, knowing full well Phuture didn't title one single ""Rise From Your Grave"" because they
    wanted their music to soundtrack khaki sales. ""Where's Your Head At?"" listened to Gary Numan and heard Slade, doom metal, and disco
    simultaneously. ""Plug It In"" reanimated Bonzo to play boy band R&amp;B; on oil drums filled with fulminative mercury. Maybe I'm just
    broken, but I can't hear this song and not hear a hit. Not a Timberlake-sized hit (don't be silly), but still a hit.</p><p>
    
    And they were never just for the lads; there's always been a slightly belittled girly side to the Jaxx. ""Jus 1 Kiss"" is twilight disco
    motion; that moment when the chorus soars as the groove kicks in is as swoonworthy as anything else in house. ""Romeo"" is R&amp;B; played a
    little too fast, speed-bossa with the most nape-tingling bridge of the 21st century.  And ""Do Your Thing"" is just good old-fashioned
    gay-as-fuck piano barreling house.  Somehow I don't think they're displeased this wound up as interstitial music in every other
    <em>Queer Eye episode.  If you think brassy disco is old hat, you're probably too straight for you own good.</em></p><p>
    
    The second disc pales slightly, but that's a bit like saying David pales compared to the Sistine Chapel.  Jaxx B-sides are generally
    heads and shoulders, knees and toes above 95% of electronic dance A-sides. ""Bongoloid""-- with a dreamy intro, clanking groove,
    bubbling raggas, and Smurfette intrusion-- is worthy of their albums as well as a guaranteed floor killer. (Why do you think they'd
    risk that just-this-side-of-cheesy ""wave your hands in the air"" part?)  ""Mere Pass"" samples the Modern Lovers' ""Egyptian Reggae"" (!)
    and sneaks a peek into a studio collab between Asha Bhosle and Eiffel 65, Bollywood Baeleric. ""Magnificent Romeo"" is an official
    version of Soulwax's Clash mash-up, nearly as good as the originals. Not so sure about the live ""Good Luck"" (without accompanying
    visuals) or superfluous acoustic ""Romeo"" (though less superfluous than the acoustic ""One More Time""), but they make more sense on
    a party disc than than Dillinja's (thankfully missing) collapsed ""Lucky Star"", featuring hands down the ugliest bassline of all
    time.</p><p>
    
    If you're wondering what's keeping this from its 10.0, there are a few (very) minor quibbles. It's missing at least one major single,
    the grinding, square-wave raunchfest ""Get Me Off"". (Which out-Peaches Peaches and which Janet Jackson should have wisely accepted
    when offered.) It's missing a few crucial B-sides, like the Oh-the-Humanity hailstorm of ""Razocaine"". Plus, the nature of a singles
    collection obviously means you lose out on the quirky asides-- no ""Living Room""-- that make the albums so charming. But still, here
    are 15 Top 40 hits (and six certifiable number 1's) from a more just universe while we settle for Kenny Chesney. Basement Jaxx may
    wind up selling white labels out of a Yugo in Zagreb, but they already made ""Good Luck"", which is what those Jean Hersholt Humanitarian
    Awards are for.</p></div>"|574.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/574-the-singles/|9.5|Jess Harvell

Disregard those silly liner-note photographs! Never you mind the Decemberists' attempts at theatricality-- <em>Picaresque</em> is the band's least stagy, most serious, and most accomplished effort yet. It's also as good a follow-up to <em>Her Majesty the Decemberists</em> any devoted fan could hope for. On that previous effort, head insurgent Colin Meloy proclaimed, ""I was meant for the stage,"" and indeed the songs sounded like production numbers performed by eager actors in a cramped playhouse. That album still retains its considerable charm, but the Decemberists sounded less like a band than a traveling troupe at the behest of fickle royalty.</p><p> <em>Picaresque</em> easily dispels such limitations. Here, as he plaintively proclaims on ""The Engine Driver"", Meloy is ""a writer, a writer of fictions.""  As its title suggests, the album collects a compendium's worth of well-crafted story-songs, most of which sound more literary than theatrical (the nearly nine-minute ""Mariner's Revenge Song"" excepted). In other words, the Decemberists are no longer the indie rock version of the Max Fischer Players; these songs are content to be songs, not one-acts, and the music is music, not sonic scenery. As a result, <em>Picaresque</em> sounds similar to <em>Castaways and Cutouts</em> and their live shows: The music is more dynamic and all the more evocative for not attempting to romantically conjure the past and filter it through Meloy's imagination.  Despite some historical backdrops, most of these narratives are set in the here and now, a milieu that suits the band very well.</p><p>  The spring in the band's collective step here may be somewhat aided by Chris Walla's crisp production, but I imagine it's mostly the achievement of the band itself, who sharpened their teeth on last year's mini-LP <em>The Tain</em> and now tend to Meloy's songs like bodyguards trotting alongside the presidential limousine. Chris Funk packs an arsenal of exotic instruments, brandishing his bouzouki, hurdy-gurdy, and dulcimer like firearms, and Rachel Blumberg, in her farewell performance (she has left to concentrate on her band Norfolk and Western) proves a capable foil for Meloy, her voice blending nicely with his on ""From My One True Love (Lost at Sea)"" and ""The Mariner's Revenge Song"". She also adds thunderous momentum to the opening ""The Infanta"", a heartbreak pulse to the quieter parts of ""On the Bus Mall"", and an athletic shuffle to ""The Sporting Life"", and her hi-hat decorates ""We Both Go Down Together"" like jewels on a lover's necklace.</p><p>  In developing into such a formidable flock, the Decemberists not only have far outstripped those ridiculous comparisons to Neutral Milk Hotel that dogged <em>Her Majesty</em>, but have also allowed Meloy to widen his lyrical scope and hone his ambitious narratives. He remains enamored with tawny historical verisimilitudes, which inform the devastating ""Eli, the Barrow Boy"", ""The Infanta"", and ""The Mariner's Revenge Song"" (the latter of which, legend has it, was recorded live around a single mic). But much of his chosen subject matter sounds startlingly contemporary, even if these songs still confront the familiar theme of impossible love.</p><p>  A cousin to Belle and Sebastian's ""The Stars of Track &amp; Field"", ""The Sporting Life"" views the roaring crowds, disapproving parents, unfaithful girlfriend, and disappointed coach from the vantage of an averse athlete lying injured on the field, and ""The Bagman's Gambit"" conjures a compromised U.S. government, a D.C. where everyone is for sale, as a backdrop for the story of a government official in love with a spy.  Meloy's acoustic guitar is delicate here, while the band churns a car-chase momentum climaxing in a nightmarish freakout that sounds like <em>Manchurian Candidate</em> dementia triggered by ""A Day in the Life"".</p><p>  Perhaps the best song he's written, ""On the Bus Mall"" is Meloy's own private Idaho full of boy gigolos amok in the city, and he evocatively contrasts their innocent affection (""Here in our hovel we fused like a family"") with the grittiness of their lives: ""You learned quick to make a fast buck/ In bathrooms and barrooms, on dumpsters and heirlooms/ We bit our tongues/ Sucked our lips into our lungs 'til we were falling/ Such was our calling.""</p><p>  The one standout, the apple among the oranges, is ""16 Military Wives"", which on first listen doesn't seem to fit the <em>Picaresque</em> aesthetic. It's not a story, but a protest song that uses a slick horn line and Meloy's loosest vocals yet (I distinctly hear a ""whoo!"") to tally the mathematics of war-- plus dollars, minus lives. But it's the sequencing that allows Meloy to work this aside into the album's larger mission: Following ""To My Own True Love (Lost at Sea)"", about futilely awaiting a lover's return, it becomes clear that the narrator could be one of the ""five military wives"" left widowed by ""14 cannibal kings"" while ""15 pristine moderate liberal minds"" look on helplessly.

Hella, a Sacramento guitar/drums duo whose music elicited little more than a shoulder shrug and a ""meh"" from most listeners, confidently put the cart before the horse with <em>Church Gone Wild/Chirpin' Hard</em>. Borrowing the <em>Speakerboxxx/The Love Below</em> format, the epic double-solo album is the band's third and most extensive full-length, capturing virtuosos Zach Hill and Spencer Seim at their creative and technical apex.</p><p>  So Zach's got <em>Church</em>, Spencer has <em>Chirpin'</em>, and the two albums couldn't steer freak-out rock in more disparate directions. Seim's crowning moments thrive on electro-pop/noise synergy; as a result, <em>Church</em> feels a bit homogenous and redundant when juxtaposed to <em>Chirpin'</em>-- which is no surprise considering Hill initially composed the disc as one hour-long song. Still, on numbers like ""I'm Quitting the Cult"" and ""Wish I Never Saw a White Man"", Hill's metronome goes haywire as he pulverizes the skins at Mach speed, a change of pace from other tracks on which he merely bludgeons them at 220 bpm. To top it off, Hill throws in fuzzed-out vox, hellraising guitar sounds, chilling church organ, and any other instrument appropriate for the apocalypse.</p><p>  Seim's response? A soundtrack for a chaotic NES game that never existed. The part-time Advantage drummer uses that band's covers as prototypes for his own twisted form of Nintendo-rock. <em>Chirpin'</em> employs Hella's traditionally linear song sequencing to enhance the disc's narrative quality. Opener ""Gold Mine, Gold Yours"" is exactly the song I'd expect after pushing the NES power button, ""Famnail"" conjures up that impossibly long level I could never beat, and ""Home on the Arrange"" menaces like so many Mega Man bosses. Even more impressive is Seim's channeling of NES pathos; just as Bowser simultaneously appears intimidating and ridiculous, Seim's songwriting evokes a healthy balance of fear and lightheartedness. And oh yeah, those 8-bit beeps and squelches are mostly acoustic instruments slickly altered to resemble digital sine waves.</p><p>  Naturally, the double-album's peaks occur when both members' ideas intersect. ""Song From Uncle"" fuses Church's proactive percussion with Seim's buoyant songwriting. Likewise, Seim's guitar playfully mimics Hill's nihilistic vocals on ""Imaginary Friends"", Church's closest stab at melody. With these moments, Hella back up their ambition with impressive amounts of ingenuity and elbow grease, creating a <em>White Album</em> for disgruntled Gen Xers still finding solace in shoeboxes full of NES cartridges.</p><p> </p></div>"|11757.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11757-church-gone-wildchirpin-hard/|7.8|Adam Moerder

After all, this was a group that dismissed both commercial jig and the underground's nostalgia obsession. Their <em>Arrhythmia</em> LP bursted with creativity, and its singularity seemed like it would be difficult to top. Former APC member Beans has since shown flashes (tempted to say, ""given whiffs"") of creativity in reinventing himself as the underground's ass-shaker eccentric, but Kool Keith still sits comfortably atop that throne. APC's other members, High Priest and M. Sayyid, have made less racket in the interim. Releasing solo singles and two preemptive mixtapes, Priest and Sayyid held steady while preparing their debut as Airborn Audio. With <em>Good Fortune</em>, they return to the more experimental ideas on APC's <em>Tragic Epilogue</em>-- and echo some of that album's monotony.</p><p>  On the opening moments of ""Miami/The Jungle"", Sayyid rhymes over a boiling synth bass only to be halted by Priest demanding that he ""spit something hotter."" Sayyid's response is an interpolation of an old Snoop lyric. That offhanded humor hints at the album's underlying problem: Sayyid and Priest don't sound like they're sure what they're doing. The production is lazy, sounding like A.R.E. Weapons leftovers most of the time. Lyrically, they veer closer to the clichéd topics of hip-hop battle rhyming than the abstract intellectualism of past mindbenders. The hooks also stumble, lacking the originality of APC classics like the absurd ""We Kill Soap Scum"". Instead, we get, ""I'ma fuck you up this year/ Don't come around here,"" from M. Sayyid on ""This Year"". Seriously? Can I get a ""Silver Heat"", please? How about a ""MEGA/MEGA/MEGAAAAAA!!!!""? No?</p><p>  One thing that becomes clear after listening to this LP is Beans was APC's hookman. He may have been a megalomaniacal pain in the ass, but dude stirred the pot. There's not a single moment on <em>Good Fortune</em> that rivals anything that the three together produced on <em>Arrhythmia</em>-- or any of their other material, for that matter. I tried not to compare the two groups, but Priest and Sayyid claim in interviews that Airborn Audio is a continuation of the Anti-Pop movement, a return to form. ""<em>Tragic Epilogue</em> '05,"" says Priest. It's tragic. It's an epilogue. It's 2005. I guess, technically, he was in the pocket.</p><p>  It's even more frustrating when compared to the material on last year's <em>Close Encounters: The Mixtape</em>, which was supposedly a teaser for the full-length. On the mixtape, the duo sounded hungry, rhyming over noticeably non-APC production. The snippets were bloated with grimy synth-encrusted street beats that borrowed knowingly from everything from Hollertronix to Dipset's anthems. It wasn't abstract. It wasn't groundbreaking. But, it was good. It made me think that <em>Good Fortune</em> would be an ugly, gritty reclamation of the worldwide underground. Instead, the pressure of resurrecting APC shackled them to a tired sound. Where the low profile of the mixtape allowed them to let loose, the spotlight on the Airborn Audio project over the last year-and-a-half seems to have provoked a backslide.</p><p>  Here's the deal with taking a step back; you better be damn sure everyone else is still standing where you left them. They're not? Shit. The landscape is not the same as it was when Priest and Sayyid left. Killa Cam spills purple diamonds over opera vocals. Lil' Jon's scoring the apocalypse with terror-synths down in Atlanta. Swishahouse is screwin' and choppin' everything until the streets run red with the 'Tussin. And don't even get started on the juggernaut that is grime. And that's just what's on the radio. Whether hip-hop would sound the way it does today without APC is arguable (probably not), but the APC sound isn't as avant-garde as it was three years ago. And the slight tweaks of that sound on <em>Good Fortune</em> aren't enough to keep pace with current frontrunners. If you want to hear what Airborn Audio might eventually sound like, get the mixtape and maybe Sayyid and Priest's solo 12""s on Sound-Ink.</p><p> </p></div>"|472.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/472-good-fortune/|6.0|Peter Macia

    crying-baby-in-a-movie-theater of musical instruments. You've got your
    bag of popcorn and enormous Sierra Mist, feet propped up on the cup
    holders, the teenagers behind you scolded into tentative silence-- basically, you're all settled in, when a brassy squeal jars you out of
    your trance and makes you painfully jab your inner cheek with your
    straw. And that stain in your lap better be ""buttery topping"" that
    leaked through that bag there, hair-trigger.</p><p>
    
    Steve Sostak's alto-sax playing is adept but hardly restrained, a moot
    point given that <em>Palm Reader</em> is an entire theater full of
    wailing infants. Stosak formed ZZZZ (pronounced ""chk-chk-chk""-- just
    kidding, I think it's ""zeez"") after his sax-laden post-rock band Sweep
    the Leg Johnny disbanded, enlisting his former group's bassist John Brady,
    classically trained electric pianist Ellen Bunch, and former Tekulvi
    drummer Greg Sharp. Those of you who've ever wondered what a cross
    between Drums and Tuba, Squirrel Nut Zippers, and Fiery Furnaces might
    sound like are some kind of damn weirdoes: Who sits around wondering
    what different combinations of bands would sound like? Well, here's your
    answer anyway.</p><p>
    
    The Drums and Tuba comparison is especially salient, except that ZZZZ
    eschews D&amp;T;'s varied moods and keeps the pedal to the metal. It's all
    wildly swerving, vaguely Eastern European math rock with
    delay-drenched horns and keys waltzing across rumbling rhythms and dipping into swampy Cajun jazz, jaunty swing music, neckerchiefed
    gypsy dirges, and demented Klezmer rhythms. There's a giant
    accordion-shaped hole in the album, but during its
    better moments-- such as the sultry bass phrase that weaves through ""Bandit King &amp; Queen""-- one is thankful for its absence:
    Already trembling on the brink of kitsch, accordion might have shoved
    <em>Palm Reader</em> right over the edge.</p><p>
    
    The Fiery Furnaces influence finds purchase in the theatrical feint
    and parry of Sostak's and Bunch's vocals. They add some nice rhythmic
    accents to the lean swirls of ""2nd Hand Smoke"", but don't do much for
    the stammering stomp of ""Forget It"" and mar the middle stretch of
    ""Assassination Polka"" with some squirrelly scatting. On an album
    that's already busy, the prudence of adding two panting, slithering
    voices is sometimes questionable, especially as they try on campy
    inflections like costume jewelry. Now, this is the part where savvy
    readers are eyeing the band's name and waiting for the inevitable,
    obvious joke. No dice-- thrilling and exasperating by turns, <em>Palm
    Reader</em> is never anything short of (over-?)stimulating, its
    soporific powers on par with caffeine pills or Baby's First Movie.</p></div>"|8962.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8962-palm-reader/|6.5|Brian Howe

The Edmonton
    hip-hop head Pemberton aka Pimperton aka Cadence Weapon has just released his debut ""mixtape,"" scribbling the e-pen that skewered
    Juelz and Vast Aire to put his own rhymes on the e-line and rep the production skills that already got Lady Sov going blah blah blah
    (a good thing).</p><p>
    
    I scarequote ""mixtape"" cause the term beguiles here. The 19 tracks on <i>Cadence Weapon Is the Black Hand</i> aren't actually mixed,
    and confusing things even more gloriously, Cadence's chameleonic delivery suggests the tape's got a whole crew behind it.  One track
    he's all paragraph pilates like Gift of Gab (""Reeking of rifle precision, like my life is a prism/ Then mark off the list, I bark
    often, twist off the tryst of a prism/ And life is an ism, on the real, vice versa, verse a vice/ When you're labelled by your genre,
    my personal price/ Of immersion in the right right""-- he gets that all out in about five seconds), the next he's Doomy (""Up in
    the club on some 'How're you?'/ But I don't like photos like Howard Hughes""), and in between he softens his consonants like Z and
    irrrrs his ers like Aesop and Sage Francis.</p><p>
    
    Elsewhere, Cadence's hometown shoutouts get Simon Reynolds off his back.  While most of us can't appreciate the local flavor of
    ""Oliver Square"", we feel Cadence's connection to them, and the low-level mystery of it all-- like the best low-level mysteries--
    keeps us on pins.  The city, seemingly forgotten by as many Canadians as the millions of Americans who don't watch ice hockey,
    serves as an ideal backdrop for Cadence's occasional ""people are gonna respect me if it kills them"" demeanor: ""Don't generalize,
    you must think and wonder/ Why I drink 40s and memorize BusLink numbers/ Well, I don't have a license, but I'm tryna gain prominence/
    'Cause I'm living in a house with a fridge full of condiments.""</p><p>
    
    And in case it's not clear, Cadence knows genre-- ""old school new school need to know this,"" as it were-- impressively adapting his
    flow to production and even playing with the anachronisms: 80s throwback on ""Falco vs. Starfox"" is paid in full when Cadence flat-out
    pokeballs.  (And for the record, my friend who's the best at Smash Brothers is better than your friend who's the best at Smash
    Brothers.)</p><p>
    
    Behind the boards Cadence's just as bizzle, remixing Beastie Boys, M.I.A., Gwen Stefani, and fellow countrymen Death From Above 1979
    to deep bass hip-hop abstractions but otherwise with no pronounced shtick.  Here we get the most definite hint that Cadence, as a
    listener, devours most everything.</p><p>
<i>Is the Black Hand</i> puts Cadence's best feats forward, but his extremely varied musical interests seem to hold him back from
    developing a cohesive on-mic personality-- no callings cards, let along overarching concerns or worldview, even when showing his
    hand on pregnant heartbreaking closer, ""Julie Will Jump the Broom"".  But that's a debut thing-- most debuts are mixtapes in that
    way-- and, maybe, just an age thing, too: He's 19!  Jay, here's your Saigon.</p></div>"|1802.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1802-cadence-weapon-is-the-black-hand/|7.8|Nick Sylvester

    to apply their post-rock chops in different contexts: angry rockers, 
    more restrained experiments, nautical themes. The first 
    track from <em>Flies the Fields</em> is yet another diversion: ""Axons and Dendrites"" 
    is a slow-builder with a jaunty rhythm that only reveals a melody 
    just before its abrupt finish. But, on the whole, <em>Flies the Fields</em> doesn't
    build on the experimentation of their three most recent EPs-- collected on 
    <em>Three-Four</em>. Instead, this record sounds like a step backward.</p><p>
    
    The majority of <em>Flies the Fields</em> is bogged down by too much discipline. The guitar jangle of ""Louven"" is a bit flat-footed, and ""It's Not Too Late"" toes the line 
    between tense and droning before crawling into the latter. The 
    performances here are capable, but the melodies consistently interlock and 
    drone, and the drums merely underline the crescendos. ""While songs like '(Morays or) Demons'
    may flirt with rocking out, the album feels like a jam session that was never edited or arranged into proper songs 
    (""proper"" being relative to the genre). The ominous, whisper-sung vocals, 
    creeping bass, jangling guitars, and prodding drums have all been used to 
    greater effect in countless other places-- heck, they've been pulled off 
    better by the members of Shipping News themselves.</p><p>
    
    Stranger still is that the songs with variation or texture are 
    pushed to the end of the record. The final third of <em>Flies</em> 
    rewards your patience: ""The Human Face"" starts slowly, drops off into 
    silence, and returns with the album's most spirited, rocking performance 
    and stop-start precision from the rhythm section. ""Untitled w/Drums"" 
    features a truly stunning melody sung by overlapping male and female 
    vocals, and shows the band stepping out of the stiff roles they've been 
    playing on <em>Flies</em> up until now. ""Untitled"" segues into the final 
    ""Paper Lanterns"", a creepy, industrial throb that I'd label as an album 
    highlight-- just as its original version was a highlight of the <em>Three-Four</em> 
    compilation. The new ""Paper Lanterns"" may be even more 
    captivating than the original, but it could also be a warning sign that 
    the Shipping News' collective pen is running dry.</p></div>"|7124.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7124-flies-the-fields/|6.7|Jason Crock

Now available on CD for the first time, complete with liner notes by Current 93's David Tibet, this album is the type of bizarre curio that-- though it can't honestly be said to have universal appeal-- should be an endless source of fascination for those with an appetite for florid post-hippie excess.</p><p>
    
    Comprised of three lengthy tracks, <em>Mice and Rats in the Loft</em> amply showcases the formidable talents of multi-instrumentalists Michael Bairstow and Derek Noy, joined here by drummer Dennis Conlan. Throughout these pieces, the musicians gallop exuberantly across genre borderlines, gobbling everything in their path as though afraid that some stray idea or blinker of inspiration might somehow escape their clutches before they can commit it to tape.</p><p>
    
    The album opens with the utterly staggering prog-folk epic ""Sun Symphonica"". Over the course of nearly 19 minutes, it careens chaotically from hyperactive folk strumming through meadows of muted jazzy woodwinds, lazing for a time in ornate chamber music splendor before again returning to THC-addled art-rock reminiscent of such groups as the Soft Machine or Gong. Overflowing with trilling, theatrical vocals and contributions by flute, violin, clarinet, and exotic percussion, this manic tour de force is so dense that after awhile it becomes difficult to name instruments that don't get used. Towards song's end they even cap the indulgence with a completely gratuitous harmonica solo, drawing the confounding piece to an appropriately arbitrary close.</p><p>
    
    The following ""Call of the Wild"" finds Jan Dukes in somewhat more conventional British folk regions, raising their strident voices in praise of the liberated life (""I will be free to sleep where I want and with who and what I will."") These vocals emote even more fervently on the closing title track, telling gruesome tales of ancient bloody rituals (""The screams of the victims still echo/ though it's centuries since they died"") with gleeful relish as heavy droplets of Hendrixian wah-wah guitar gather in puddles at their feet. Some of the more flute-heavy passages veer uncomfortably close to Jethro Tull territory, but <em>Mice and Rats in the Loft</em> generally manages to avoid the prog-rock pitfalls of bloated self-satisfaction and pomposity, as the Jan Dukes instead infuse their music with enough psychedelic grit, sonic invention, and sheer unfaked strangeness to make this album a knotty puzzle worth many return visits.</p></div>"|4356.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4356-mice-and-rats-in-the-loft/|7.4|Matthew Murphy

The mix highlighted her big-tent approach to global rhythms and Now Sounds, an M.O. that was cemented when she professed her love for hip-hop crew the Diplomats and rap's spiritual cousins, grime, baile funk, dancehall, and reggaeton in <em>The New York Times</em>. Faster than you can say ""galang-alang-alang,"" M.I.A. became the one-woman embodiment of what to some is great about the contemporary pop music landscape. All that's left is for M.I.A. to draft Seba as producer and that voice that name-stamps dancehall tracks like a heavily drugged, vocoded Just Blaze as MC: ""M.I.A. on... Bionic Ras... Baile Funk... Forward Riddim...""</p><p>This transglobal express isn't new, of course: Young Jamaicans have been combining the best of U.S. hip-hop and UK dance culture for years, American rap producers seem addicted to the sub-continent, grime is actually lobbing singles into the UK top 40, and Nigeria is threatening to become the new hip-hop hot spot. ""From ghetto to ghetto, backyard to yard, taking it transglobal on the aboveground, because that's where the people are,"" Hyperdub's Sterling Clover said of this trend a few years ago. At the time he was talking about bhangra and the Indian influences on hip-hop, but he could just as easily have been talking about dancehall or grime or baile funk. And when it comes to M.I.A., you can practically talk about all of them at once.</p><p>Unlike most musical tailors, neither she nor her mixtape partner Diplo is afraid to let the seams show. Rather than hiding up the ass of cratedigging culture, they relish sharing the spotlight with and revealing their sources, with M.I.A. dropping names in NYC broadsheets and Diplo opening two-way routes between Philly and the favelas rather than stashing all the best dubplates for himself. Northern Soul is probably turning over in its grave.</p>
<p>If the two are interested in creating a dialogue between different artists and sounds, they're also more than happy to allow listeners to eavesdrop, whether they're improvising (<em>Piracy</em>) or well-rehearsed (<em>Arular</em>, <em>Favela on Blast</em>). M.I.A.'s freedom-through-homelessness is shared by other artists (most notably dj/Rupture) but not by many of the source sounds found on her records, most of which are fiercely regional. Where Rupture's name suggests a destruction of the borders between scenes, cultures, and nations, his methods-- which include healthy doses of splatter beats and breakcore-- can also seem violently deconstructionist. M.I.A's moniker, on the other hand, appropriately suggests rootlessness. She's not exploring subcultures so much as visiting them, grabbing souvenirs and laying them out on acetate: The favela trumpet on ""Bucky Done Gone"", the London slang of ""Galang"", the disco sample on ""Sunshowers"", the steel drums of ""Bingo"", the electro-fueled vocal edits of ""Hombre"".</p>
<p>M.I.A.'s detractors claim her flirtations with terrorism and revolutionary politics reveal the biggest case of sufferer's envy since Joe Strummer but little depth of thought. But if the latter is true, so what? An in-depth examination of demonizing The Other, the relationship between the West and developing nations, or the need to empathize with one's enemies would likely make for a pretty crappy pop song. An argument can and has been made that her political lip service is unique enough to get those topics onto your tongue or into your brain, prodding listeners to at least examine them. Some might find that off-putting, but pop music that reflects uncomfortable realities and is packaged in this sonic collage beats the hell out of 1980s left-wing hand wringing from Bragg or Bono or Biafra.</p>
<p>And when it comes down to it, that ""sonic collage"" is still what's important here. With all the column inches and message board posts arguing about whether M.I.A. is an opportunist or a clever contextualist, genuine or a fraud, full of good intentions or no specific intentions at all, the closest thing to a truism about <em>Arular</em> is that it's a taut, invigorating distillation of the world's most thrilling music; a celebration of contradictions and aural globalization that recasts the tag ""world music"" as the ultimate in communicative pop rather than a symbol of condescending piety.</p></div>"|5618.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5618-arular/|8.6|Scott Plagenhoef

On ""<i>Black Forest</i>
    II"", drummer/vocalist Lars Finberg enumerates Armageddon's casualties
    with a hint of contented zeal: ""No people, no trucks, no cars/ No
    movies, no TV stars/ Humanity is erased/ Black Forest left in its
    place."" Sure, it's a bit heavy-handed, but musically they
    keep it short and sweet: The best of <i>Black Forest</i>'s 14 tracks are
    usually a done deal 'ere the two-minute bell strikes.</p><p>
    
    Actually, the album would be better if it, too, was kept on the short
    side. Like fellow dystopia-dwellers Liars and Fire Show, A-Frames prefer a sustained din to an expansive roar. <i>Black Forest</i> tends
    to drone, which is okay when A-Frames remember to bring the riffs.
    Among the songs that include a melodic counterpoint to the band's combination
    of jaundiced electronics and sludgy bass is ""Experiment"",
    which waits for the pitch then slugs it into the bleachers with a
    flick-of-the-wrist guitar hook. ""Galena"" pounds a see-sawing
    bass/drums vamp before breaking form to deliver a brusque but
    satisfying chorus. Throughout its exciting yet repetitive first half, such
    well-placed, melodious turnabouts are <i>Black Forest</i>'s saving grace-- they affirm the album's aesthetic by temporarily breaking with it.</p><p>
    
    Those breaks aren't as prevalent on the LP's brooding second side.
    Starting with ""Quantum Mechanics"", the album sounds like
    an undeveloped skeleton of its first half. ""Memoranda"" is muted,
    stiff, and lacks the gorilla low-end that buttresses even the band's
    weakest numbers. ""Negative"" carries far too much
    bass racket and comes off like malcontent Icarus Line. On
    Side B, only ""My Teacher""-- with its tick-tock bass line, mottled
    spoken-word lyrics, and almost-dub clicks and rolls-- interrupts the
    clangor. ""Age of Progress""-- the second set's strongest track-- follows, and it's both the dankest, dirtiest thing A-Frames
    have ever recorded and an interesting sound for them to
    explore in the future.</p><p>
    
    At their best, A-Frames evoke a half-digested Pop Group. (They
    spared themselves the other half to leave room for melody.) This
    approach could take off if the band keeps sight of the details
    and don't let its songs linger. But here A-Frames teeter on the line between
    consistency and monotony, falling mostly on the former side-- their
    endless doomsaying can grow tiresome but more often it's fun to play
    along. Even perdition can seem appealing when it's paired with a killer
    hook or two.</p></div>"|471.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/471-black-forest/|7.0|Sam Ubl

You had your hardcore kids, punks, and skate rats big on yelling and beer, skeptical of synths and Englishmen. You had your goths and art school kids, big on keyboards and eyeliner. And you had your tweedy collegiate types, the ones with their hands on the radio transmitters, and who made (sm)arty-pants indie-rock their reigning sound. It was that audience that took Unrest up as a flagship, making them loom as large as Pavement, Hal Hartley, and David Foster Wallace in the mid-90s college-sophomore canon. Super-minimalist pop, cloudy atmosphere, trans-Atlantic cool, and obscure obsessions like Cath Carroll and Isabel Bishop: Nothing seemed to fit quite as well with design courses and corduroy.</p><p>
    
    Design types, after all, have that thing about minimalism, and this band's stark, elegant sound could strip things down to a strikingly small number of moving parts-- some kind of warm, detailed dream of the indie-rock group as postmodern 50s pop combo. This reissue of 1992's <em>Imperial f.f.r.r.</em> demonstrates where Unrest, formerly a scattershot pseudo-punk outfit, became that version of itself-- an art-pop guitar band drawing incredibly simple lines. If the story of this group is that of frontman Mark Robinson gradually admitting he might rather be an English kid from the early 80s, well, their EP of Factory Records covers may be the coming-out party, but this is where it counts.</p><p>
    
    The first attraction is the sound of their big ecstatic pop songs, which feel as crisp and joyous as ever: ""Suki"" rushes along on clean guitar jangle and Robinson's coy babble (no one's ever sounded so good just repeating the word ""kicking""), and ""Cherry Cream On"", an even coyer come-on, is still the record's standout blast. Come to this reissue looking for that pop rush, though, and you'll barely get an EP's worth of what you want-- even counting the eight bonus tracks. Because no matter how easy it is to remember Unrest as a racing pop act (""Cath Carroll"", ""Make Out Club""), the fact is that they were starker and artier than that, and the scattershot experiments of their early releases can still be heard fading into this one. The first track is just the test tone used for mastering, and around its edges you get just as many art pieces: Here a collage of beats, bells, and bass; there a pattern of feedback bouncing between speakers.</p><p>
    
    But those are the poles: The actual core of this album is stark, warm, and elegantly simple, and it's in that space that Unrest wound up doing their most interesting work. The title track, for instance, is just a slow, chiming guitar run and one of Robinson's awkward choir-boy vocals; a 14-minute variant among the bonus tracks strips it down even further. The album version of ""Isabel"" is similar, just acoustic guitar and a careful chorus harmony; it was the 12"" version, included here, that fleshed it out into a college radio hit, sounding something like indie-pop trip-hop. ""June"", one of the band's best-ever tracks, glides smoothly along on just bass, drums, and bassist Bridget Cross's vocals, then fleshes it out into a harmonized wash that's a blueprint for the post-Unrest Air Miami project.</p><p>
    
    There are plenty of skips around that sound-- they're something like Crispy Ambulance fans on ""Loyola"", something like Krautrock devotees on the bonus ""Hydrofoil One"". But on a track like ""I Do Believe You Are Blushing"", it sounds absolutely pure: They seem to have whittled down American indie-rock into some variant that feels as lush and dreamy as English post-rock, and you start to see how a guitar-based three-piece from DC could share fans with acts like Stereolab, share UK label-space with the Cocteau Twins, and cover both new wave obscurities like the Family Fodder and indie pop prototypes like Miaow.</p><p>
    
    The trick is to see Unrest for what they were: A pop band that didn't often play pop songs. There's always that rushing, radio-friendly jangle, yes. But the bulk of their work-- both here and on the even more accessible <em>Perfect Teeth</em>-- was a lot more stylized than that, and the oddly dreamy pop sound they sketched out tends to be unique enough to inspire devotion. <em>Imperial</em>'s littered with tracks you'll wind up skipping; even with those eight bonuses (more
    prototypes and variants than anything else), I can only whittle it down to a nine-song Perfect Album. But when it's worth it, it kills: This stuff is pure style, and unlike just about anything around it.</p></div>"|8362.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8362-imperial-ffrr/|8.2|Nitsuh Abebe

    your girlfriend, your sister, your grandmother last summer. As if they
    had a choice: When Coldplay's Radiohead-lite grandeur met Lou Barlow's
    emotional verisimilitude, Lightbody's opening slot for hoary
    arch-anthem-mongers U2 was assured. But now, a <em>mixtape</em>? Quick, you
    grab his legs while I mock his record collection!</p><p>
    
    OK, so you noticed the number at the top of the page. Turns out
    Lightbody's entry for Family's <em>The Trip</em> series (previous
    participants: Dirty Vegas, Saint Etienne) had me-- if not your
    grandma-- at Sex in Dallas's ""Everybody Deserves to Be Fucked"". Does
    Keane listen to French electro-house, too? Didn't think so. Over two discs, ""Bert""
    and ""Ernie"", Lightbody puts to plastic the stuff of his recent DJ (!)
    sets: chill-out electronica and indie, c. 2004. Notably absent:
    Barlow, Coldplay, My Bloody Valentine.</p><p>
    
    In fact, Lightbody's <em>Trip</em> is best when it sounds more like
    Optimo's recent <em>How to Kill the DJ [Part Two]</em> than last year's
    Grandaddy-curated, Snow Patrol-featuring <em>Below the Radio</em> comp-- in other words, when it's more like the club than the arena.
    Most of Lightbody's dancier offerings are scattered throughout disc
    one, including the hilarious Sex in Dallas cut, Four
    Tet's typically organic ""Everything Is Alright"", and Mylo's Daft
    Punk-inflected ""Drop the Pressure"" (motherfucker!)-- plus, y'know, TV
    on the Radio (the single, natch). Lightbody closes the disc with the
    stylish jazz-pop of Feist's ""Mushaboom"".</p><p>
    
    Even when Lightbody treads more expected ground-- the Shins, sometime
    Snow Patrol guitarist Iain Archer-- his picks are more likely to
    evoke his band's casual first two albums than last year's high-polish
    <em>Final Straw</em>. Make merry with Joy Zipper's dreamy ""Christmas
    Song"". Ponder where CocoRosie's bluesy number got those inane lyrics.
    Get shot up G-Unit-style (don't worry, it won't kill you) by
    Pitchfork's Rob Mitchum for remaining ambivalent toward Fiery
    Furnaces' ""Bow Wow"". Then wonder what a funk workout by Bill Withers
    has to do with any of this.</p><p>
    
    If you read Pitchfork last year and did all your homework, little of
    <em>The Trip</em> will strike you as an epiphany. The tracks are
    illuminative if rarely breathtaking, and will likely yield most
    listeners a discovery or two. Then again, we've all put together
    mixtapes: Does Lightbody <em>really</em> like Deerhoof, or does he just
    want the girl from Brit Lit to think he does?</p></div>"|7306.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7306-the-trip/|7.2|Marc Hogan

Compiled by Bad Seed Mick Harvey, <em>B-Sides and Rarities</em> contains all of those things from every dark corner of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds' 20-plus year career, but it still proves a better retrospective than the equally matter-of-factly titled <i>The Best of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds</i>.</p><p>
    
    This discrepancy might be surprising, but coming from the Aussie boogeyman and his henchmen, it seems perfectly fitting, perhaps even inevitable. Since his days with the Birthday Party, Cave has nurtured an almost academic obsession with the underbelly of society and the basest of human urges, populating his songs with murderers, rapists, and rogues doing their God-appointed jobs and arguing moral issues as justification. So it's wholly appropriate that the underbelly of Cave's own career should itself be so fascinating.</p><p>
    
    Those characters stake their claim to the first two disks, especially the tracks culled from the eras of <i>The First Born Is Dead</i> and <i>Murder Ballads</i>. ""Scum"" is a kiss-off to a ""fuckin' traitor, chronic masturbator, shitlicker, user, self-abuser"" who apparently had the temerity to give Cave a bad review. Cave revives the beauty-inspired killer of ""Where the Wild Roses Grow"", with Bad Seed Blixa Bargeld singing Kylie Minogue's part, and there are four installments of the ultraviolent ""O'Malley's Bar"". But the best murder ballad (even if it is a stretch to consider it as such) is ""(I'll Love You) Till the End of the World"" from the 1991 Wim Wenders film <i>Until the End of the World</i>. Cave's not a lunatic on a killing spree; he's a lovelorn bombmaker, and he caps this cinematic story of devotion with a spirited sing-along.</p><p>
    
    As a writer and especially as a vocalist, Cave understands and appreciates the power of overstatement, and these seldom-heard rarities strike a resonant chord because they make no virtue of subtlety. Singing like he's Jesse Garon Presley, Cave writes the messages of ""God's Hotel"" and ""Jack the Ripper"" in all caps, bolded, underlined...in blood. As a result, the violence of his songs-- physical, moral, and emotional-- is all the more grotesque and haunting, and the three-disk format of <em>B-Sides and Rarities</em> gives him an enormous canvas for his scrawled screeds.</p><p>
    
    It would be negligent, if not outright criminal, not to mention the Bad Seeds, who could very well be the focus of <em>B-Sides and Rarities</em>. Over the years they have proved themselves a remarkable and reliable backing band-- perhaps one of the best in rock history-- possessed of a dynamic range and intuitive sophistication without which Cave could not possibly achieve his lofty ambitions. The diversity of styles and moods they master over the course of these three disks is truly impressive, from the Sun Studio minimalism of the first three tracks to the lurching menace of ""Black Betty"" and ""King Kong Kitchee Kitchee Ki-Mi-O"", from the sinister soundtrack flourishes of ""Cocks and Asses"" and ""Red Right Hand (Scream 3 version)"" to the gentle restraint of <em>Boatman's Call</em>-era tracks like ""Black Hair (Band Version)"". In culling material for this compilation, Harvey consciously excluded any of Cave's solo work from the tracklist (only one song, the baroque ""Time Jesum Traseuntum Et Non Riverentum"" from the <i>X-Files</i> compilation, does not feature the Bad Seeds, although it does feature sometime Bad Seed Warren Ellis' band the Dirty Three). As a result, <em>B-Sides and Rarities</em> is as much the band's show as it is Cave's, which may be the key to this collection's dark sense of adventure.</p></div>"|1372.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1372-b-sides-and-rarities/|7.8|Stephen M.

    Nevertheless, <i>Living Contact</i> consists of home recordings that Carter created between 1994-98 using nothing more than acoustic guitar and the occasional trace of intuitive vocal. Shorn of Charalambides partner Tom Carter's often-turbulent electric psych textures, Carter burrows deeper into the fertile soil of American folk to fashion simple works whose mesmerizing, out-of-time splendor tidily anticipated several subsequent free-folk adventures.</p><p>
    
    Recorded on boombox and originally released in a limited-edition CD-R pressing on the Charalambides' Wholly Other imprint, <i>Living Contact</i> is heavy with tape hiss, false starts, and abrupt endings, and couldn't feel any more intimate if you were a spider on Carter's ceiling. Although as a guitarist Christine lacks the technical virtuosity of such contemporary John Fahey acolytes as Glenn Jones or Jack Rose, on pieces like the opening ""Silhouette"" or ""Dream Mother"" she utilizes an elliptical finger-picking style as she works her stark melodies carefully and methodically, as if turning through the fragile pages of an ancient, inscrutable book.</p><p>
    
    At points during the 14-minute epic ""Alone, Not Alone"" her circular, minimalist repetitions recall the more experimental primitive stylings of German guitarist Steffen Basho-Junghans, and become so hypnotic that it always comes as a something of a startling jolt when she at last begins singing.</p><p>
    
    When Carter chooses to use her voice, it's translucent and otherworldly, with her lyrics a gauzy, practically wordless stream of secretive exhalations. The literal meaning of her words clearly bears less importance than their placement, best evident on the track ""Going Down"", when the sole whispered phrase ""I'll go down"" fractures the song's placid surface as a single thrown stone into a tranquil lake, which leads into an extended fade-out as her guitar frantically kicks and splashes.</p><p>
    
    As pleasing as <i>Living Contact</i> is, however, one can't help but be left with the nagging suspicion that there could be acres of such material lurking in Carter's closets. And though this album does rank as one of the most starkly pretty items in the extended Charalambides catalog, it doesn't aspire to the ambitious, transcendent levels of the full group's best work, and seems destined to appeal primarily to the faithful diehards who (understandably) cherish Carter's every move.</p></div>"|1800.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1800-living-contact/|7.2|Matthew Murphy

I'm not 50, despite some piss-poor toddler judgment, and my nephew got a pile of bricks for Christmas last year, courtesy Unka P. I'm also not 16. I am old enough to remember Liz Phair's Stones rebuttal and Juliana Hatfield's sugary confessions. As a young lad, they were among the quiet riot girls who shaped my post-pubescent view of female empowerment. At the time, I wondered why the girls I knew couldn't be more like these wise, wisecracking, and casually confident women. The answer was, and is, that 99% percent of teenagers, male or female, won't acquire these traits for a good decade. Not that Pony Up! are a bunch of teens, but their music exudes a bratty naiveté-- a mix of soda-pop psychology and the Shaggs after a few rigorous lessons-- that makes it difficult to stomach for more than a couple of listens.</p><p>
    Much of their self-titled debut comes across as a weekend project between a group of friends, and the band's bio does little to refute that. The members are two sisters, the sisters' brother's ex-girlfriend, one of the sister's ex-bandmates, and the sisters' brother's ex-girlfriend's former co-worker. <i>Degrassi</i>, anyone? They all got together, made a demo for shits and giggles, and ended up giving it to Ben Lee at one of his shows. Lee, another champion of teenage angsty jangle pop, heard kindred spirits and signed the band to his imprint. However, Lee isn't doing anyone a favor, least of all Pony Up!, by releasing what amounts to a half-assed demo.</p><p> 
    Pony Up! have done their homework on early-90's indie pop like Phair and Hatfield, but their sound is eerily similar to cult-faves Cub and Tiger Trap, whose loose-limbed lo-fi told similar coming-of-age stories. Cub and Tiger Trap also didn't last very long. The major difference between those artists and Pony Up! is that the latter's simplistic odes lack the knowing smirk of their predecessors. Pony Up!'s lyrics are sonic defense mechanisms, deploying humor to avoid confronting any real emotion. I'm all for jokes; they're funny. But, the girls sprint over the tipping point with the first song they ever recorded, ""Matthew Modine"", a dirty note passed to an 80s semi-icon. Okay, mini-icon. I love <em>Vision Quest</em>. There, I said it.</p><p> 
    Elsewhere, PU! make up some ground with catchy, gloomy pop but even then, it's not the hooks that stick with you-- it's the self-defeating lyrics. ""Minstrel"" and ""Shut Up and Kiss Me"" have their moments, but when a line like ""my brother and sister are going to beat you up"" follows an honest sentiment like ""you are all my fault,"" someone needs to tell these girls to cut the crap. I nominate Ben Lee. He started it.</p></div>"|6560.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6560-pony-up/|3.5|Peter Macia

(Members of Fu Manchu, Monster Magnet, Soundgarden, and A Perfect Circle have all slipped in and out of the collective.) Still, the looseness of the band's lineup has never significantly altered its sound: The Queens' reigning aesthetic-- droning, riff-heavy rock peppered with vaguely cosmic flourishes-- has been fiercely maintained by core members Josh Homme (vocals, guitar) and Nick Oliveri (bass, snarls).</p><p>
    
    Scrutinizing and compartmentalizing the internal chemistry of rock bands may be a thankless (if not stupid) pursuit, but when Oliveri was publicly ejected from the band in early 2004 (ousted by Homme, who disapproved of certain ""bad behavior""), the future of the Queens' swampy rock seemed awfully precarious. But any lingering doubts about who was actually commanding the band's direction should soon dissipate: <i>Lullabies to Paralyze</i> is, at least stylistically, not terribly different from the three Queens records preceding it.</p><p>
    
    Now rallying the contributions of bassist Alain Johannes, drummer Joey Castillo (ex-Danzig), and multi-instrumentalist Troy Van Leeuwen (formerly of Failure, currently in A Perfect Circle)-- while snatching guest turns from ZZ Top's Billy Gibbons, Garbage's Shirley Manson, and the Distillers' Brody Dalle (who sing together for a barely-audible 10 seconds)-- Homme is hardly playing alone. Still, even with all that sweaty support, <i>Lullabies to Paralyze</i> can feel vaguely alienating, often twisting itself into an unsociable and determinably distant collection of hazy, leaden rock. Maybe because of Oliveri's absence, Homme seems slightly more guarded, and his breathy falsetto and tinny guitar tones are now more cagey than jubilant, mixed low and perpetually retreating. Homme has always had a habit of slathering most everything with a few too many multi-tracked drone effects, all ghostly echoes and over-dramatized coos, and, unsurprisingly, <em>Lullabies is most successful at its most brash.</em></p><p>
    
    Homme clearly digs a good giggle (see the handclap-riddled, ""I hate rock'n'roll!"" musing of ""'You've Got a Killer Scene There, Man...'""), but he's even more of a sucker for proggy chops and dry ice-fueled metal theatrics. Unsurprisingly, Grimm's Fairy Tales are often cited as a significant influence on Homme's songwriting, and the dark, no-shit didacticism of those cautionary fables is recreated flawlessly-- the plodding (and awkwardly misogynistic) ""Everybody Knows That You Are Insane"" indicts relentlessly, (ill)advising without coddling, thrashing itself into oblivion.</p><p>
    
    The excellent ""I Never Came"" opens with twitchy drums and muffled bass thumps, unfurling slowly and majestically and exploding into a thick, heady swirl of high, airy vocals and guitar theatrics, while the equally impressive ""The Blood Is Love"" swallows a spinning, carnival-esque melody, layering pert metal chords over a meandering and ethereal guitar line (reminiscent of 2000's <i>R</i>). Single ""Little Sister"" is all cowbell and sneering vocals, flirting with but never quite indulging pop perkiness, a honking guitar riff shooting through like a punchline, while ""Tangled Up in Plaid"" is impossibly addictive (flitting from spare, echoing verses to a raucous, wind-milling chorus-- not entirely unlike former single ""No One Knows"").</p><p>
<i>Lullabies</i> occasionally evokes early Black Sabbath and nods to a few psych-rock stalwarts but, like most Queens' records, it's oddly unclassifiable. It's also troublingly inconsistent, sagging and losing steam (opener ""This Lullaby"" and the plodding, seven-minute guitar jerk of ""Someone's in the Wolf"" are unimpressively limp)-- all sprints and breath-catching, highs and lows. Ultimately, <i>Lullabies to Paralyze</i> stands as a frantic, steamrolling realization-- dynamic, twitchy, and anchored by Homme's uncompromising vision.</p></div>"|6607.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6607-lullabies-to-paralyze/|7.5|Amanda Petrusich

    than dense, freeform Appalachian folk. When I'd return home around 10,
    I'd try to give <i>Ragas</i> a close listen, sorta dig it but
    inevitably collapse. I never thought the record was boring (at least
    any more than other guitar improvisations zing), just a little daunting and very time-consuming.</p><p>
    
    Funny then that the only luck I've had feeling out the record came as I packed for good. <i>Ragas &amp; Blues</i> still gets
    schrifted-- I listen saddled with last-minute tasks, deciding which
    books I'll bring with me, washing sheets for the pull-out couch I'll
    sleep on until I can afford a mattress, tearing myself apart over
    whether I should buy a Mac Mini for the time being or sack up until a
    G5 laptop comes out. A million things are happening, and throughout it I'm thankful
    for the extent to which <i>Ragas &amp; Blues</i> has been my
    narcotic.</p><p>
    
    Really, I'm just happy to know records like this can still affect me
    when I make time for them. Only a year ago, I couldn't get enough of
    this stuff, warm drones and inscrutable anti-pop washing over me as I
    prepared for general exams and master's dissertations. Now I walk an
    hour in the cold for twenty-cent dumplings just to save money for
    rent, enjoying one-liners and beats to make me bang bang bang before
    high fidelity and thoughtful conversation. One lifestyle's not
    necessarily better than the other but, for instance, a thoughtful
    conversation could've saved me the embarrassment of my mother telling
    me last night that in the word ""folk"", the ""L"" is silent. Yep, like
    salmon.</p><p>
    
    Last year several people understood neo-foke aka freakfoke as the
    Great Otherworldly Escape from 2004's terrible reality. What
    a farce. I like Devendra and Joanna and Espers and the Animal
    Collective and all the Tower Recordings records I finally got to
    hearing, but they're all fleeting, convenient distractions next to TR
    members Matt Valentine and Erika Elder's patient and full-fledged
    invasion. This record's vinyl-only for a reason: The duo's Eastern
    strings and sruti box drones and flutes and occasionally proper blues
    guitar make sense only with undivided time and wide-open ears-- which
    is to say, <i>Ragas &amp; Blues</i> may be the worst iPod album ever.
    Instead, this is a different, more proactive kind of background music,
    the kind that, if you want it to, will vacate and occupy you-- make
    you disappear.</p><p>
    
    Anyway, now for some cartoons...</p></div>"|8537.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8537-ragas-blues/|7.9|Nick Sylvester

For his first outing as Langtry, McKinney straps on his acoustic guitar and takes off on a 45-minute journey through the backwoods and waterways of America, nodding to such familiar signposts as John Fahey, Leo Kottke, and Robbie Basho.</p><p>
    
    McKinney experiments with various tunings, and seems particularly fond of dropped tunings that give him a guttural low-end he can hammer on in his most percussive passages. ""The Ballad of Painless Parker"" makes striking use of this technique with a flurry of big-voiced, crashing chords. These compositions don't like to sit still, and McKinney maintains an impressive balancing act of kinetic motion and searching melody, often feeding one with the other. The nine-minute ""Chasleen, You Better Run to Catch That Train"" is a good example of this, creating melodic sparks from an inferno of rapidly shifting chords before settling down to develop the themes sketched out in the initial torrent.</p><p>
    
    The album's slower moments-- like those in the middle of ""Chasleen""-- tend to be its least exciting, and though McKinney's technical proficiency is breathtaking, he often sounds too sparse or melodically meager. Still, such misgivings are forgivable in light of an exhilarating rag like ""Hobojangle"", a song that feels like the ghosts of dozens of itinerant bluesmen bursting back into our world. It's the best of McKinney's compositions and one that keeps the Takoma spirit alive as well as any I've heard. It's not easy to make one acoustic instrument engaging for a whole record, but Langtry has managed to do it, taking his place alongside contemporary guitar explorers such as Stephen Basho-Junghans, Shawn Persinger, and M. Ward.</p></div>"|4982.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4982-as-upon-the-road-thereto/|7.1|Joe Tangari

    turntablism, found-sound collage, and indie-folk, and seems locked in a tug-of-war between clarity and deconstruction. Adding to this sonic tension is Broder's gentle and genial voice: It projects a tenderness absent from most collage-based
    music, which is typically either instrumental or features anesthetized
    vocals as a simplistic trope for modernity and alienation.</p><p>
    Those contradictions played a major role in the success of Fog's sprawling but almost brutally minimal <em>Ether Teeth</em>. It's a shame then that <em>10th Avenue Freakout</em> pulls away
    from this blankness, thereby muting the effects of its
    incandescent peaks. Here Broder is breaking with
    obscurantism and moving toward catchy Postal Service-like song structures, but although the spacious, detailed production is still topnotch, the record suffers because Broder doesn't fully embrace his pop impulses.</p><p>
    ""Hummer""-- the title track to Fog's 2004 EP-- recurs and is a template for this album. Over plodding drums and a clipped choral sample, Broder intones a
    melodically tedious verse that gives way to pristine, perfectly
    phrased falsetto harmonies. The
    off-kilter drums, patchy organs, and faltering vocal melody of ""Can You
    Believe It?"" evoke an electro-pop Neutral Milk Hotel-- especially the
    chirpy brass near its finale-- and the svelte, suburbanly sexy whirr of
    ""We're Winning"" dips into some cheeky cultural criticism: ""Jesus
    Christ is my American Idol/ He's the brand new funky president."" And
    ""The Rabbit"" returns to <em>Ether Teeth</em>'s sharply drawn contrasts,
    surging and collapsing with counterintuitive élan.</p><p>
    If the whole album were this charming, it'd be an unqualified
    success, but too many songs proceed from point
    A to B with little variation or depth. Those tracks seem
    to equivocate between the collagist Fog and the pop Fog, reconciling
    their tensions instead of exploiting them. And so despite being peppered with luminosity, <em>10th Avenue Freakout</em> is too often dragged down by aural wallpaper-- stretches of
    anonymity with few distinctive moments.</p></div>"|3132.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3132-10th-avenue-freakout/|6.8|Brian Howe

About average build, rocking the British Knights or Etonics, he was the ""all-around"" athlete you hated to guard: He'd box out effectively, hustle relentlessly, and played an unselfish, risk-free game. He sported that ""I'll dunk when it's worth three points"" <i>No Fear</i> tee. He loved the mid-90s Pacers and owned a shelf full of instructional videos.</p><p>
    
    Like that guy, Emanon-- the L.A. duo DJ Exile and Aloe Blacc-- have made a career out of mastering the fundamentals. Singles such as ""Andyadontstop"" and ""Emcees Like Me"" evoke a toe tap or head bob, but never at the same time; Aloe Blacc's solo EP on Ipo Wax knocked but didn't bang. So, tame as it is, <i>The Waiting Room</i> is the closest they've come to rocking the proverbial boat.</p><p>
    
    Lead single ""Count Your Blessings"" is a classic case of the group trying to step out of its shell but not succeeding. Sampling Sister Nancy is hardly audacious, but Exile makes do by pushing the punchy reverb on the horns while Aloe spits back-to-back numerical metaphors: ""All across the map in seven continents/ I'm the 8th wonder.../ Shoot em' out like 9mm gats/ All these wannabe cowboys with 10-gallon hats."" The title track also echoes their usual mix of somber, sun-setting, and slightly bouncy <i>ritmo</i>. But ""usual"" is the problem: Since their days on hand-passed mixtapes in the mid-90s, little has changed in either Aloe's benedictions or Exile's creations.</p><p>
    
    Exile and Aloe do flex a bit down the stretch. ""She Thinks"" flaunts Aloe's pipes, previewing some of his future R&amp;B; projects. And the barbershop nonsense on ""The World Don't Sing"" is a complete red herring. But <i>The Waiting Room</i> is wholly frustrating. Aloe is pointed and dexterous, but on the whole Emanon can't seem to step out of their SoCal bubble long enough to do something unique. They're like the Tim Duncan of hip-hop: Yeah, his game is well-rounded, and he gets the job done, but wouldn't you rather see Ron Artest eat a fan in the lower mezzanine?</p></div>"|2920.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2920-the-waiting-room/|6.7|Jamin Warren

I mean, I know who he
    is-- he's the most ubiquitous little bald man
    this side of Verne Troyer. I meant, who
    is he, really? Because years of pop culture
    brainwashing have created a caricature of Moby as a posterboy for
    electronic music, Buddhist-vegan mysticism, and
    stiff-back political correctness-- none of which is evident on <i>Hotel</i>.</p><p>
    
    For starters, Moby used to make electronic music,
    am I right? I distinctly remember the first time I
    came across his literary moniker; it was affixed to a
    single of his rave-house burner ""Go"", which still lingers in my
    hippocampus. Nowadays, other than the couple of vanilla
    slices of new age, er, I mean, ""ambient"" that bookend
    <i>Hotel</i> (as well as, yikes, an entire bonus disc), Moby's songs
    are less techno than the song in which Eminem gave his
    famous anti-techno bitch-slap. Sure, some drum loops
    and keyboard diddles are still in the background, but
    nothing that couldn't turn up on an aging midlife crisis album by, say, John 
    Mellencamp.</p><p>
    
    Mellencamp isn't a bad point of reference, come
    to think of it. <i>Hotel</i> strikes the same mood of
    one-way-street sloganeering, although it's
    aimed at a sort of coastal blue-state weekend
    mysticism rather than a Midwest red, farm, etc. And strangely, the author of <i>Buddhism for Dummies</i>
    anthem ""We Are All Made of Stars"" now apparently
    thinks we are all on about a first-grade level of
    comprehension. Songs tip off impending choruses like a bad poker player
    leaning back in his chair when he's got a big hand. 
    Imagery is simple, familiar, and recycled-- rain
    is used twice, first on ""Raining Again"" and
    reprised on ""Love Should"". And Moby spends a lot of time repeating trite
    phrases, such as ""look at us, we're beautiful."" (Twenty-two
    times in, duh, ""Beautiful""-- counting is less painful
    than listening.)</p><p> 
    
    Most disturbing is a two-song block roughly
    halfway through <i>Hotel</i> where Moby abruptly decides to
    stop Up With Peopling and, gulp, gets his sex on with the help of chanteuse-on-payroll, Laura Dawn. 
    Over a beat that sounds like what sci-fi movies
    pass off as futuristic pop (think
    the Diva scene in <i>The Fifth Element</i>), ""Very"" drops
    pillow talk like eight-year-olds imagining how babies
    are made: ""Now we are naked/ Just you-oo-hoo/ You and
    meeeee."" And slow jam wannabe ""I Like It"" comes complete with soft-core moaning, wet
    keyboards, and spoken-word talk-singing of the title
    (43 times, to be exact)-- all it needs is Bob Odenkirk
    occasionally adding ""Yeahhhhh.""</p><p>
    
    Dawn is also a collaborator on the album's most
    egregious sin, the track that drops <i>Hotel</i> from being
    mediocre dreck, easily quarantined and ignored, to something far worse. 
    I'm talking, of course, about Melville's cover of New Order's
    ""Temptation"", which takes the lovestruck dancefloor
    daze of the original and strips it down to nauseating Rhodes, preset, and canned strings
    slowcore. Suddenly, I find myself longing for the
    halcyon days of Frente!.</p><p>
    
    If Moby has accomplished anything with <i>Hotel</i>, it's
    that he may have become the rare musical artist
    equally despised by both of modern music criticism's
    warring camps. Rockists will retch at the blatant AAA
    radio-whoring of ""Raining Again"" and ""Spiders"", while
    popists will abhor Moby's indie-esque
    self-satisfaction-- though thankfully there's nothing
    here as condescending as <i>Play</i>'s ""South Side"". But being the man in the middle isn't working for
    Moby; overdosing on moderatism, the guy who supposedly
    gave electronica a face is ironically now a blank
    manufacturer of rock-by-numbers. Whether seduced by
    chart flirtations or weary of constant mockery, Moby
    has filed away his distinguishing characteristics, and
    all that's left is an artist too played out to even be
    one of Eminem's punchlines.</p></div>"|5349.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5349-hotel/|2.4|Rob Mitchum

(Better renew my JAPM membership card.) Admittedly, 75% of modern d'n'b is pretty much shit: syncopated gabba that you'd have a hard time holding me to my sneaking affection for under oath. But drumfunk, choppage, edits-- whatever you want to call it-- is about a bazillion times more interesting than the great minimal techno swindle. (No matter what that sniffly grouch Michael Mayer might say.) And if people who were trading Elephant 6 singles at the turn of the millennium are now listening to six minutes of swish-swish-swish with the occasional acid noise, then surely there is room in their hearts for six minutes of a Shiva-armed Art Blakey going nuts on DMT.</p><p>
    
    The Emerald Isle's Bassbin label has made a crusade out of reviving the spirit of Blue Note (the club where the early Metalheadz sessions took place, not the jazz imprint). The godfather of the scene is the mighty Paradox, who looks like a tiny lawnmower got taken to his hair. Dev is one of the few old skool junglists-- check 1991's still preposterous ""Mixrace Outta Hand""-- to rail against the scene's entropic drift towards mid-range distortion. (The drums and the bass were lost in a poker game to UK garage but were later found behind a council estate after being stripped for parts by grimey gremlins.) Here, on ""Bongolia"", he goes in hard on the ""Apache"" break, throwing some pounding Dillinja-style subs underneath to sate the raving massive.</p><p>
    
    Bassbin's beats aren't as choppy as market leader Inperspective's or as twistedly two-steppy as Offshore's. Instead, their <i>raison d'etre</i> is in their name: This is soundsystem music for boomin' in ya jeep. Skitty's ""Sweet Vibrations"" rides the titular punchy bassline to nowhere in particular. Equinox finds the 9,000th variation on the ""Amen""-and-dub combo on ""Don't Want to Hurt You"". Usually d&amp;b; tracks with ""soulful"" vocalists are deadly (Robert Owens, so much to answer for), but Robert Manos keeps it restrained against Seba and Lenk's swimming low-end and gorgeous synths on ""Everyman for Himself.""</p><p>
    
    Burial tune of the comp is Calibre's ""Can't Stop This Fire"", which-- with bouncy drums and a jolly vocal hook-- is not a million miles from the mainstream scene. It's a reminder that, once upon a time, rolling d&amp;b; was <i>dance</i> music, tugging at your hips, vibrating up your spine, making you feel warm and enveloped rather than just an excuse for veiny teenagers in puffy vests to take a lot of speed. (My only real request is to slow it down to a more reasonable 160bpm. Too much soft-core d&amp;b; still sounds like hummingbirds playing soul jazz.) Still, I am about as happy as could be expected with the health of underground d'n'b in 2005. Fuck microhouse, you can have it back. I'm home again.</p></div>"|2074.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2074-rare-grooves/|8.2|Jess Harvell

By this point, the length and productivity of Wynn's solo career completely dwarfs that of Dream Syndicate, and over the past few years he's logged more gigs with his current combo the Miracle 3 than he's managed with any other lineup. And, as this well-rendered, 17-track compilation illustrates, the argument could be made that Wynn's more recent solo work bests his earlier group's output in both ambition and consistency.</p><p>
    
    Throughout his career, Wynn has done little to disguise his ardor for the Bob Dylan/Lou Reed/Neil Young pantheon. A gifted tunesmith and raconteur, like his heroes Wynn has always made the most of his rather unremarkable vocal range, and his best songs are frequently detail-packed narratives which chart as close to prose as to poetry.</p><p>
    
    By his own admission in this set's liner notes, Wynn was left somewhat adrift in the immediate aftermath of Dream Syndicate's breakup, and the middling nature of glossy albums like <i>Kerosene Man</i> and <i>Dazzling Display</i> reflected this uncertainty. But in 1996, his career took a revitalizing turn with the release of <i>Melting in the Dark</i>, a collaboration with Boston's Come, whose Thalia Zedek and Chris Brokaw provided Wynn a much-welcomed injection of raw punk energy. This was a beginning of a fruitful alliance with Brokaw that extended through Wynn's landmark 2001 double album <i>Here Come the Miracles</i>.</p><p>
    
    So it should come as no surprise that this collection is wisely weighted in favor of Wynn's more recent material, as it steers the listener immediately into the buzz saw of ""Amphetamine"", from 2003's <i>Static Transmission</i>. This opening track is a near-perfect collision of primal VU thump and serrated, <i>Ragged Glory</i> guitar, and should be ranked alongside the Modern Lovers' ""Roadrunner"" as an ideal soundtrack for a long distance driving. From there the album moves unceremoniously from strength to strength without regard for chronology (or continuity, for that matter). Other highlights include two raucous tracks with Come-- ""Shelley's Blues, Pt 2"" and ""Why""-- the pounding, atmospheric ""Death Valley Rain"", and the somber, Lennon-like balladry of ""What Comes After"".</p><p>
    
    As with most collections there are sins of omission and inclusion (personally I would've chosen the Byrdsian jangle of <i>Dazzling Display</i> 's ""Tuesday"" over ""Conspiracy of the Night"", which features a typically overbearing cameo by the infernal Johnette Napolitano) but <i>What I Did After My Band Broke Up</i> should not only serve as a valuable introduction for latecomers but also as evidence that Wynn's near future may very well prove as valuable as his recent past.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for <i>Visitation Rights</i>, a bonus disc included with <i>What I Did...</i> that consists of old Wynn songs reinterpreted for piano and vocal. Featuring keyboard assistance from Green on Red's Chris Cacavas, this set finds Wynn playing against type, stripping tunes like ""Crawling Misanthropic Blues"" and ""My Family"" down to spare, cocktail lounge arrangements. And though this method proves songs such as ""Drought"" and ""Mandy Breakdown"" to be virtually indestructible, this format does not (to say the least) display Wynn's reedy vocals in the most flattering light. Variations like the bouncy strut of ""For All I Care"" do nothing to improve upon the originals, and in fact could likely make you cherish the previous versions all the more. Though Wynn's career has been pockmarked with enjoyable detours and one-offs (such as 1998's acoustic <i>Take Your Flunky and Dangle</i>) perhaps <i>Visitation Rights</i> is one cul-de-sac best left unexplored.</p></div>"|8757.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8757-what-i-did-after-my-band-broke-up/|8.0|Matthew Murphy

    dismissed as fluff-- <em>Field Rexx</em> is an earnest crack at bluegrass, 
    country, and folk that's young and brazen enough to incorporate elements 
    from multiple genres.</p><p>
    The album opens with a brief honky-tonkin' interlude and ""Lux and Royal 
    Shopper"", which adds some crunch to a cluttered, Rouge 
    Wave-esque modern take on folk. ""Love I Exclaim!"" puts anemic good-time 
    country over funky breakbeats, and is one of the album's most ingratiating moments, but the early 
    peak is the gentle, spaced-out ballad ""Summer Twin"". That track 
    leaps into the aptly self-described ""freak-pop"" on its chorus, which is all 
    referee whistles and chicken-scratch guitars. Several different musical 
    elements-- howling rock, acoustic plucking, electronic percussion, 
    harpsichord-- pop in and out of its simple melodies, 
    but the lo-fi production lends it a sonic cohesion.</p><p>
    On the record's second half, the songs become more traditional and their 
    arrangements more homogenous, but they're just as worthwhile. ""Concrete Heaven"" is equal parts 
    Willie Nelson and the shambling folk experiments of Beck's <em>One Foot 
    in the Grave</em>, its lyrics alternating between evocative and goofy 
    (from ""Paper cups and cigarette butts left in the sink"" to ""I'm still 
    walkin' around in rainbow-colored thongs""). They play the wide-eyed AM pop 
    of ""Asleep for Days"" comfortably and convincingly, and the chorus of 
    ""40 Stripes"" recalls CSN&amp;Y.
    </p><p>
    ""Dirty Pearls"" is a speedy, competent bluegrass number, but the last 
    few songs lack the strong melodies and quirk of the bulk of the album. 
    Quirkiness isn't the main selling point of <em>Field Rexx</em>, however-- 
    it simply has a healthy sense of variation. There's a lot of disparate, 
    whimsical sonic elements in the disc's earlier songs, and they're 
    tastefully incorporated, but most of the memorable twists and turns are 
    provided the old-fashioned way, like the subtle guitar lead in 
    ""Summer Twin"". On <em>Field Rexx</em>, Blitzen Trapper may not take the 
    same chances as other genre-bending artists, but nor do they strive to. It simply (and successfully) aims a back-porch country/folk album for 
    left-of-the-dial tastes.

    But don't confuse Nagisa Ni Te members Shinji Shibayama and Masako Takeda with the childish, giggling Japanese stereotypes depicted in <i>Lost in Translation</i> and <i>Pokémon</i>; these guys know their rock'n'roll history down to the grit. After all, their name (translated) is borrowed from the esteemed 1974 Neil Young album <i>On the Beach</i>, and on <i>Dream Sounds</i> the duo delve deep into classic North American rock, emerging with shimmering bits of Young, the Beach Boys, and Bob Dylan. The nostalgia is doubly powerful considering the album's four lengthy tracks are re-workings of previous Nagisa Ni Te songs, though here both classic rock and classic Nagisa Ni Te get a 21st century facelift.</p><p>
    More a retrospective than a ""best of"" album, <i>Dream Sounds</i> starts and ends with longer, more pensive Shibayama-dominated numbers, with Takeda's punchier pop gems sandwiched in between. In opener ""True World"", Shibayama (formerly of Idiot O'Clock and Hallelujahs) slowly and wistfully delivers the song's folksy melody as though paging through a photo album before passing the vocals off to an equally starry-eyed Takeda midway through.</p><p>
    Takeda's tracks are closer to straightforward rock; power pop nugget ""Anxiety"" holds up to most anything from <i>Last Splash</i>, while ""Me, on the Beach"" channels Neil Young's candid harmonica and acoustic interplay. Those songs form a sweet, gooey middle inside the album's thick, oftentimes strenuous outer layer. Twenty minute-plus closer ""True Sun"" doesn't get points docked because of its length and repetition; instead it's hampered by guitar chords and melodies that run past their sell-by dates. Because of these flaws-- and the song's reflective mood-- it turns the second half of an otherwise captivating album into something self-serving and distant. Luckily, the scintillating treasure within <i>Dream Sounds</i> shines through the dense outer shell, and-- as far as I know-- it's safe to put your guard down and indulge in its cherubic bliss.</p></div>"|5700.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5700-dream-sounds/|7.0|Adam Moerder

Considering how lush Stereolab records can be, <i>Socialisme</i> really did seem like a different animal.</p><p>
    
    On <em>A Few Steps More, the line between Monade and Stereolab is blurrier. With the addition of permanent members, Monade are now a proper band recording in a professional studio, and the result sounds a hell of a lot like Stereolab. Sadier has one of the most distinctive voices in indie rock, so in one sense the similarity isn't surprising. Catch her in a duet with your granny on bongos and you'll still hear plenty of our beloved Groop. But here so many of the trademark influences and timbres (AM radio horns, Brazilian rhythms, lots of Moog) are presented in essentially the same proportions we've come to expect from late-period Stereolab, and it's a little strange that two different bands can be pointed in almost the exact same direction. It also makes me wonder what Tim Gane-- the person I once imagined to be Stereolab's genius auteur (there's subconscious sexism for you)-- is contributing at this point.</em></p><p>
    
    Still, once you get past the initial disorientation, <em>A Few Steps More is a solid record. Sadier's vibrato-less purr (she's singing mostly in French here) is as enticing as ever on ""Das Kind"", and halfway through she dusts off the high-pitched, far-off wail that shows which layer of Beach Boys harmony caught her attention. ""Wash and Dance"" has a nice build, transforming from a floaty ballad into a swirl of ringing guitar and driving drums. A few songs are too long, and it gets a bit samey by the end, but the album projects a coherent and well-realized mood: Mid-tempo, mellow, and dreamy, these songs make me glad spring is just around the corner.</em></p><p>
    
    ""2 Portes, 7 Fenetres"", which is basically two songs in one, is enjoyable but illustrates the problem with this record. Starting out as a dirge that gives Sadier a chance to demonstrate her trombone playing, ""2 Portes"" slides into a crisp bossa nova beat with a fat Moog line and harmony vocals by Marie Merlet. Hearing Merlet's husky, unfamiliar voice against Sadier reminds me how cool it would be for her to challenge herself and immerse her talent in something unfamiliar. The head of steam built by years of good Stereolab records is considerable, but <em>A Few Steps More still feels like the work of someone who's coasting.</em></p></div>"|5389.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5389-a-few-steps-more/|6.7|Mark Richardson

We live in our world, right: Pop stars are sexy extroverts and hip-shaking tomcats and there's something suspect about a guitar group getting too sappy, too cloying. For this band, though, pop stars are just starry-eyed suburban virgins or maybe librarians, and ""sappy"" isn't even a real word. If that sounds like a wimpy schoolboy wish, well, so do a lot of Robert Wratten's lyrics. Check out the milky-wet martyrdom of ""Sensitive"", or song titles like ""I Can See Myself Alone Forever"". Wratten's big-eyed earnestness can go beyond the point of embarrassment and into some realm of almost <i>psychedelic</i> earnestness, and in spots it's difficult to tell whether it's studied naiveté or whether he's genuinely arrested in some weepy boyish crush phase.</p>
<p>Attitude like that is the better part of why the Field Mice make some people blissy-happy and some people pukey-sick; this stuff can sound gorgeous or creepy, brave or pathetic, dreamy or reactionary. Listening through these LTM reissues of the band's catalog, though-- three albums, 1989 to 1991, with all those out-of-print Sarah Records singles and EPs folded in-- you get a keen demonstration of what a huge red herring the schoolboy stuff actually is. The truth is that critics-- hell, even fans-- haven't come far in developing a vocabulary to talk about this kind of music: It's still referred to as all barrettes and cardigans and ""pure, perfect pop.""</p>
<p>But if the Field Mice were just adorable indiepop amateurs, then why do they sound so slick and stylish? Yeah, they have their sunny strum-a-longs and wistful laid-back jangle-- songs so ""pop"" that it feels like someone must <i>always</i> have sounded like this. But then not so long afterward, didn't Ride come along in the same stripey shirts and fuzz the exact same stuff up into ""higher"" art? And weren't the Field Mice just as ambitious? They tried their hands at just about every leading edge-trend of the era: Fuzzy pop, homespun ""indie-dance,"" wimpfueled acid house, and sweet-cream dream-pop shoegazing-- all moves that struck late-80s ears as full-on trippy. Couple that with the non-stop starry eyes, and there's something kind of intense about reckoning with this music: No matter how sweet or guileless they sound, they're as ""difficult"" of a band to deal with as your average avant-gardists.</p>
<p>The payoff is this: When the songs work, it's all easy. The first of these reissues, <i>Snowball</i>, wraps up the band's sweet-and-simple early work-- open chords and a muted drum machine, stripping down bookish English indie to a purity that can leave the Sundays looking like a prog-metal outfit. The best of these tracks have a charm that makes boyish idealism sound like one of the better phases of life, and they cast a long shadow on everything that came after them. These singles are the wellspring of nice-kid indiepop and crooning-about-English-rain tricks and nearly everything the Lucksmiths or the Ocean Blue ever did; they sound nostalgic now, but then they sounded nostalgic from the moment they were recorded. ""Emma's House"" is legendarily great, dead simple, and endlessly forlorn; it's like the Go-Betweens gone weepy, with one of Wratten's best lyrics folded in. ""Let's Kiss and Make Up"" is dance music played by a band that's on the verge of falling asleep; it's easy to forget how much better it sounded in Saint Etienne's hands. ""You're Kidding, Aren't You"" is all style, and ""Everything About You"" is one of the most joyful, least opaque love songs I've ever heard: Just ""I love the sound of your voice/ I love the way that you smile."" If the Field Mice were ever <i>really</i> a band for the wallflowers and the librarians and the shy little suckers in their beds with their books, then this was it-- and like most things that seem a little regressive in the UK, it's a sleepy Anglophile's wet dream.</p>
<p>But if Wratten was that kind of reactionary-- retreating, Morrissey-style, from the real world of ""cool"" into some lonely-schoolboy phase-- then how to explain the next album, <i>Skywriting</i>? The thing kicks off with a nine-minute ""We are Interested in Acid House"" epic that sounds like some failed prototype of the stuff Seefeel and Slowdive did. The next few tracks are more reassuring. ""Canada"" is a bouncy strummer that has Wratten pining away for some girl who's pining away for some other guy: ""The ones we love don't always love us back/ You and I, the two of us, know that."" ""Clearer"" even sounds like the Smiths, or at least McCarthy. But by the time you get to ""Humblebee"", they're doing-- get this-- a washed-out sample collage that half-sounds like Disco Inferno on an off day; its mantra, ""Chocolate, love, sex,"" even made it as far as a t-shirt. Fold in a collection of surprisingly slick pop singles, and the whole shambly-wallflower caricature is demolished; some of this stuff sounds just this side of scoring a fluke pop hit, something like Modern English's ""I Melt with You"" or the Lightning Seeds' ""Pure"".</p>
<p>The last record, <i>For Keeps</i>, is the most accomplished of the bunch: The pop is more ambitious and sprightly, and the cutting-edge failures seem a lot less failed. It's here that the band starts to sound like Slowdive gone ultra-sappy-- which, depending on your tolerance for chimy guitars and Swiss Miss keyboards, can be a mildly remarkable thing. In and around that, you get plenty of acoustic sweetheartism, and some of the band's most winsome pop songs: I spent part of my teenage years convinced ""Coach Station Reunion"" had to be a Monkees cover, despite its psychedelic sighs. When the pop jangle and the spacey tricks come together right-- on ""Of the Perfect Kind,"" or New Order wannabe ""Missing the Moon""-- you realize the Field Mice were a lot better at making music than they get credit for; these tracks are as impressive as they are cloying, and dated in a pretty fascinating way.</p>
<p>What's hard to say is how <i>much</i> of this material is all worthwhile. Even if you develop the kind of massive soft spot that fuels the band's obsessive cult following, you'll still wind up picking through these tracks looking for the moments that really and truly work. Even stranger is the realization that the Field Mice weren't particularly better at anything than the bulk of their peers. Blueboy were more musical, the Railway Children were more stylish, Heavenly were smarter, and the Primitives were more exciting; the Darling Buds were better for dancing, Blind Mr Jones were better at low-budget shoegazing, the Hit Parade were more reliably adorable, and Honeybunch-- though far from English-- were better than just about everything ever. There's a reason, though, that the Field Mice loom so large above so many of their contemporaries, and it's just that they were the damned Field Mice: Whether you're swooning or laughing or rolling your eyes at this stuff, the reason is that it's packed with so much personality, so many idiosyncrasies and extremities, that you can't help but get involved. For the English, this stuff is wrapped up in a whole indie-kid social-class context the rest of us don't have much chance of ever grasping-- but on this side of the Atlantic, it's the singularity of the thing that counts.</p>
<p>So whatever their reputation, this is a band that asked-- and deserved-- to be taken on the same ambitious terms as the groups they admired.

The
    Thunderbirds Are Now! frontman plays up his vocal femininity and
    vamps all over <em>Justamustache</em>, belting out exhortative
    non-sequiturs like Tim Harrington impersonating Exene Cervenka.
    Prototypically feminine vocalization allows for a broader range
    than the less subtle masculine style, and you'll find Allen cooing,
    yelping, sighing, wailing, and ranting, but reining it in just enough
    to avoid the overweening brattiness of, say, Beep Beep.</p><p>
<em>Justamustache</em> is Thunderbirds Are Now!'s second full length,
    but it smacks so strongly of a new start that we might as well consider
    it their first. The Detroit 
    quartet
    have mostly abandoned the labyrinthine meters and abrasive textures of
    their spaz-punk roots, retaining only their penchant for variety. Now
    their songs tend toward lambent melodies, cyclically striated guitars,
    and galloping disco-punk rhythms, and are usually comprised of several
    potential choruses.</p><p>
    
    The raucous ""198090 (Aquatic Cupids)"" demonstrates this
    focused miscellany, quickly shuffling through succinct
    hooks. ""Harpoons of Love"" follows and is more
    direct, jumping out as the album's other instant
    attention-getter; its reeled-off lyrics and quick changes call to mind
    a new wave version of Blood Brothers. Spitting drum machines,
    neon-tinted synths, corkscrewing guitar lines, and shout-a-long refrains
    sustain the record's teetering glide across 10 sleek yet pockmarked
    tracks.</p><p>
    
    Allen cites Les Savy Fav as a major influence, and
    <em>Justamustache</em> evokes a poppier, starker take on that band's <em>Go Forth</em>. This is particularly apparent in the
    guitar playing, which shades Gang of Four's Andy Gill's expressive, staccato slashing
    into LSF's Seth Jabour's melodically complex stutters and coasts, sharply
    contrasting sinewy rhythms with fanning sprays of squealing notes.</p><p>
    
    ""Better Safe Than Safari"" sends the album rocketing out of the gate
    with this hectic formula, its relentlessly thumping low end and bright
    synths holding it together like skin. ""Eat This City"" juxtaposes
    rapidly ascending electronic tones and runaway clatter with a late
    solo that's pure, wafting Jabour Zen. ""To: Skulls""
    and ""From: Skulls"" sound like guitars rehearsing long-since dropped
    conversations to themselves, synthesizers attempting to speak like
    humans.</p><p>
    
    With their signing to the influential Frenchkiss label, their stylistic
    quantum leap, and their
    dancepunk steez, Thunderbirds Are Now! are in a good position to earn some attention. If they gain entry into the new new wave winner's circle, we'll all be doing a lot of reading about Gang of
    Four this year...again. It makes for drag reviews (only so many ways
    to say ""great energy-- classic post-punk with a modern twist!""), but
    it's a hell of a good time. I'll take it.</p></div>"|8244.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8244-justamustache/|8.0|Brian Howe

There's no other sound quite like it, and there's no other band like Konono No. 1, the assemblage of Bazombo musicians, dancers, and singers from Democratic Republic of the Congo (formerly Zaire) that makes the likembe the center of their sound. It's something of an accidental update on Bazombo trance music, and it's thrillingly unique stuff, a torrent of kinetic sound that straddles the line between the traditional and the avant-garde. The likembe is commonly known in the West as a thumb piano, and there are variations of the instrument in different cultures across Africa-- perhaps the most well-known is the mbira, which is used across Zambia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, and parts of South Africa. The instrument has a pinging tone that is practically designed by nature to sound awesome with a bit of amp fuzz on it.</p><p>
    
    Konono employ three electric likembes-- each in a different register-- and the amplification is very makeshift. The band formed in the 1980s to perform its traditional music, but soon found that being heard above the street noise of Kinshasa wasn't a going concern as long as they remained strictly acoustic. Scavenging magnets from car parts, they built their own microphones and pickups, and they augmented their percussion section with hi-hat and assorted scrap metal. Vocal amplification came from a megaphone, and the accidental distortion they drew from the likembes cemented their distinctive sound. Though their music is still traditional in style and content, recent trips to Europe have turned them on to how avant-garde what they're doing is, and they've fallen in with musicians like the Ex, Tortoise, and the Dead C.</p><p>
<i>Congotronics</i> is actually the second Konono record to receive international distribution-- last year's <i>Lubuaku</i> was a live recording from a European tour-- and it's bound to win them a following amongst noiseniks, experimental music buffs, and open-minded worldbeat fans, though most other people will likely find it merely interesting. The record opens with ""Kule Kule"" and a reprise of the same, and these tracks stake out the sound of what follows quite precisely. ""Kule Kule"" is hauntingly subdued, with the three likembe players locking in with each other on a series of choppy riffs and bursts of crazy melody (anyone familiar with the Ex's ""Theme From Konono"" from last year's <i>Turn</i> will recognize the themes and riffs), while the reprise adds vocals sans megaphone. The four remaining songs all sound as though they were recorded live, and there is in fact some applause between a few of them.</p><p>
    
    The themes laid out on the introductory songs surface repeatedly over the course of the album, lending it a suite-like feel. ""Lufuala Ndonga"" comes crashing to an end, and its conclusion becomes the introduction of ""Masikulu"", on which the frantic chants are swept up in swirling currents of percussion. The most stunning song is the instrumental ""Paradiso"", which puts the likembe interplay front and center, their distorted, scattershot melodies ricocheting from side-to-side over a thumping backbeat, skittering hi-hat, and some amazing snare work. It's funky in a sort of incidental manner-- obviously meant for dancing-- but hitting on a sort of deep funk rhythmic sensibility without really even trying.</p><p>
    
    Konono No. 1 are the kind of band that remind us that music still possesses vast wells of untapped potential, and that there's virtually no limit to what can be developed and explored. There's little precedent for a record like <i>Congotronics</i>, even as the music at its core goes back many generations and predates the discovery of electricity by some time. It's important to note that these are not pop songs in any sense of the word-- this is traditional trance music with an electric twist, and should be approached as such. That said, it's among the most fascinating music I've heard and deserves a listen by anyone with even the remotest interest in the possibilities of sound.</p></div>"|4596.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4596-congotronics/|7.9|Joe Tangari

Sick of them yet? In the early 90s, the measures of people in their 20s against their teenage 80s plasticity resulted in everything sounding like Grand Funk. In the early 00s, everyone realized the 90s were a drag and wondered if there was something to that Thompson Twins thing after all. I anxiously await whatever Jill Sobule/G-Funk hybrids the early 2010's will bring us!</p><p>
    
    The 12"" single was <i>the</i> art form of the 80s. They were the last gasp of the single as a physical, commercial artifact. Disco made the 12"", and it brought disco's dub-space and length to everything it touched. Yes, even the Thompson Twins. Sure, it's survived via dance music, but today what comes between those elongated intros and outros is a lot less likely to be a song. (Oh, but what about the cassingle? Well, it destroyed the B-side. The CD single gives us up to six bullshit ""remixes"". So you were saying?)</p><p>
    
    Now just look at that cover up there: those stark white letters, that deep salmon background, that gorgeous boombox. It's enough to give the design fetishist in me an erection of the heart. And the idea of a compilation of 80s 12""'s already wins points as they were some of the first records I ever bought. And this comp makes a pretty good case for all the various aspects of the 12"" philosophy. The Cure's ""A Forest"" just goes for sheer treetop scaling length. Scritti Politti's ultra-brite (p)op-art stabs and gimmicky samples are a mini-essay in mid-80s remixing-- as well as on what the 80s did to punk. Grace Jones' ""Pull Up To The Bumper"" all but invents M.I.A. (yeah, I said it) except scarier and better. The Icicle Works' ""Love Is a Wonderful Color"" is one of those ""wow where was this hiding?"" tracks that make you think there's something left to 80s crate-digging. On some level, I should just be able to write ""Tainted Love/Where Did Our Love Go?"" and go out for a beer.</p><p>
<i>12""/80's</i> is one of those collections that-- due to concept, packaging, and a goodly portion of its contents-- I want to grace with a much higher rating. But I can't deny one thing: There's a Simply Red song on this box set. If you meet a beautiful boy with a unibrow, you can shave it, but it's always going to grow back. Likewise, you can skip tracks here, but Mick Hucknall, the unibrow of pop, returns every time you replay it. There is some real wack, horrid shit (Lloyd Cole? The Style Council??) next to the unmitigated triumphs (Yazoo, they can never tarnish you). Plus, it's too white (only one rap song and no Prince), too British (understandable since it's a UK import, but a U.S. version is urgent and key), and too in thrall to the whole ""80s = stuff you hear in a dentist's office"" idea. Also, despite containing two Trevor Horn productions-- ABC's Fairlight panto-cabaret ""Tears Are Not Enough"" and Propaganda's Bergman-funk ""Dr. Mabuse"", there's no Frankie Goes To Hollywood! You wouldn't make a box set called <i>7""/60's</i> and leave off ""I Heard It Through the Grapevine""!</p></div>"|2072.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2072-1280s/|6.2|Jess Harvell

Since Dischord moved away from caffeinated teenage hardcore in the mid-80s, the label has become a one-stop shop for crashing angular guitars, churning post-funk rhythm sections, inscrutable and sometimes political lyrics, and furiously clenched vocals. Some of the label's bands have been stunningly great (Fugazi, Lungfish), and some have been pretty meh (Faraquet, El Guapo), but few have been above resorting to guitar clang. Dischord's D.C.-only policy is only part of the story; the District has produced a ton of independent music (the Dismemberment Plan, Dead Meadow, go-go), which the label has opted not to fuck with. Instead, it centers itself around a loose circle of friends who constantly seem to be forming and breaking up bands. If you've been in one Dischord band, chances are pretty good you've been in two or three or seven.</p><p>
    
    Jerry Busher and James Canty, the two multi-instrumentalists who make up French Toast, have been kicking around this scene for years. Busher is The Other Guy From Fugazi, the second drummer at that band's live shows, and Canty was a member of Nation of Ulysses and the Make Up. French Toast are sort of Dischord's Spoon, stripping the label's sound down to its essentials. The guitars are flat and muted, the vocals spare and disaffected, and the theatrical, climactic scream-along choruses are absent. The band's economy and sparseness may have something to do with the fact that it only has two members, but there's no sense of looseness or abandon to its tracks; every element of every song is carefully put into place.</p><p>
    
    There's a certain cold disaffection to songs like ""Back Off or Els"", with its tightly-wound guitars and monotone Busher vocal, and ""Pattern"", with its restrained motorik chug-- Canty's yelping background vocals buried deep in the mix. A few tracks toy with drum-machine beats and electronic flourishes, and one, ""New Dub"", is a headlong leap into its titular genre.</p><p>
    
    Many of the tracks have an almost uncomfortable tightness; it's easy to miss the messy passion of Canty's previous bands. But the two have a way of locking into a tense, neurotic groove and hanging on to it until their knuckles turn white. Only on the last track, the stunningly gorgeous ""Nobody Knows"", do Busher and Canty fully realize the possibilities of their newfound minimalism. The track entirely abandons Dischord post-hardcore, relying on a few piano plunks and a soft, plaintive vocal until a slow, sad piano-and-drum-machine groove kicks in halfway through, recalling the blissful, melancholic rapture of Spacemen 3's <i>Playing With Fire</i>. It's an unexpectedly huge leap forward for a band that might need to leave its origins behind in order to find its voice.</p></div>"|3335.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3335-in-a-cave/|6.8|Tom Breihan

Recently, however, there seems to be a mini-wave of UK acts brandishing their accents with a frequency last heard in the early days of post-punk.</p><p>
    
    To these American ears, those vocals are part of what makes the Futureheads and Bloc Party sound as good as they do. Kaiser Chiefs are another of these groups, although their first album, <i>Employment</i>, isn't in the same league as the debuts from either of their above-mentioned countrymen. One reason for this is that the band keeps the energy level constant over the course of the entire disc. There's plenty of variety in the material-- with different rhythmic feels and tempos-- but every song is approached with the same kind of in-your-face ebullience as the others, an approach that grows tiring.</p><p>
    
    Still, it's deadly entertaining in bursts-- especially if you pick out the right bursts. There are a handful of potential singles that make <i>Employment</i> worth the trip. Chief among them is ""Na Na Na Na Naa"", a song that rockets along on Manfred Mann pianos, setting the workmanlike harmonies of the verses against the titular falsetto hook. Kaiser Chiefs seem most comfortable at a sort of medium boil with big, energetic harmonies, Moog squiggles, and mild guitar/keyboard interplay. They can unleash an anthem when they choose, like ""Modern Day""-- the only song on the LP that is truly dynamic. Its fluid verses are the most spacious, unforced passages on the record, and there's a palpable sense of build prior to the towering chorus. Admittedly, the song also makes me picture band members asking for more cowbell in the monitor during recording, but that's also part of its charm.</p><p>
    
    Opener ""Every Day I Love You Less and Less"" sets the tone with its tale of a guy who's so over his ex-girlfriend that he feels obliged to tell her how great his life is without her (in other words, he's pining). The band's spirited attack sells the track hook, line, and sinker. It's a shame that enthusiasm becomes exhausting by the record's end.</p></div>"|4595.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4595-employment/|6.7|Joe Tangari

Lyrics you might not expect from a Kristin 
    Hersh record: ""You know what?/ Shut the fuck up!"" It's not even 
    the words themselves that are surprising there-- even at her most misleading, 
    there's a directness to Hersh's lyrics, a plainspoken candor that 
    grounds even the most disparate imagery she can conjure. The surprise lies in how 
    she leans hard on that ""fuck"" line. Usually, such profane offerings 
    sneak out the side of her mouth. Here, Hersh throws her whole body 
    behind those four words, belting them out while the music gathers mass and 
    speed like a cartoon snowball.</p><p>
    
    In all fairness, <em>Golden Ocean</em> isn't much different from recent Throwing 
    Muses records (or the EP that preceded the disc, which shares three tracks 
    with this album). Where 50 Foot Wave distance themselves from Hersh's other work is in the volume department. Say what you want about the 
    quality of the record, but there's no denying that it is ridiculously loud-- squealing and slamming all over the place. If there's a brief eddy in 
    a song, it's going to give way to a tidal wave. If the song already seems like its heading toward a noisy conclusion, don't be surprised if they double-time it.</p><p>
    
    The catalyst for this slight change is most likely the drummer, Rob 
    Ahlers. Unlike Hersh's usual drummer (longtime Muse David Narcizo), 
    Ahlers eschews subtlety and polyrhythms for full-out, balls-to-the-wall 
    banging. He barrels through this entire album, and it's up to the other 
    two Wavers to keep up. For Hersh, this means bellowing at the top of her 
    lungs for most of the record, subsuming any prettiness in her voice for 
    the scratchy old-woman's yell hiding behind quick-cutting couplets like, 
    ""Your voice has a sing-song quality/ And bones were made to be 
    broken.""</p><p>
    
    It's fantastic stuff-- at its best, the innate catchiness of Hersh's 
    writing gets a shot in the arm from her cavalier vocals and musical 
    caterwauling. One of Hersh's former labelmates posited that motherhood 
    equaled mental freeze. No doubt said labelmate never envisioned Kristin 
    Hersh, mother of four, entering her 21st year as a professional musician, 
    leading a group that runs laps around most rock bands.</p></div>"|3296.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3296-golden-ocean/|7.3|David Raposa

Fabric-- with its slickster graphics, awkward metal tins, and terminal hesitation between hauteur and crowd-pleasing-- is as responsible as anything for the continuing gentrification of dance music as hipster lifestyle accessory. Friends rave (no pun intended, swear to God) about the London club for which the series is named, and a few of these mixes you can't beat with a wiffleball bat. But there's something off-putting about what basically amounts to ultra-cheesy <i>Ministry of Sound Annual</i> comps (big up DJ Sammy and Darude) with a kind of <i>i-D</i>/<i>Nylon</i>/<i>Wallpaper</i> sheen superimposed.</p><p>
<i>Fabric20</i> is probably the most blatant case yet of this series wanting it both ways. Let's get one of the biggest, blandest DJs in the world and give him a crate of microhouse we boosted from the Voigt brothers' yard sale. Godlike genius producer Ewan Pearson probably didn't know Fabric was planning this when he ribbed on his blog that a new Perlon track could be played ""safe in the knowledge that in nine months time Erick Morillo et al won't. Hurrah!""</p><p>
    
    But there's a strain of ""underground house"" that's getting closer and closer to ""big room"" prog/trance on its own, much of it spearheaded by Kompakt. (Bite your tongue.) So it's not surprising Michael Mayer's remix of Superpitcher's ""Happiness"" mopes in after the disc's climax. What <i>is</i> surprising is that Digweed didn't go with even trancier Kompakt gear like Magnet's ""Rising Sun"" or Mayer's ""Privat"".</p><p>
    
    We join our program already in progress with the gorgeously stereo-sensitive atmospherics of Pete Moss' ""Strive To Live (16b Mix)"". (Next time I'm over at Ashton and Demi's in the isolation tank, I'll request this.) Then the beats arrive before we've put our makeup on and we're gliding through Adam Johnson's unobtrusive ""Traber"" (zzz) before Richard Davis gets his Martin Gore on to Repair's ""Forgive &amp; Forget"". Then Diggy sends me all funny by dropping the breakbeat and tuff little sax riff of DJ RaSoul's ""True Science"".</p><p>
    
    The rest of the mix isn't particularly micro-- or even that hip-- just ""solid"" (in the same sense that a Ford Taurus is) house music that doesn't earn a differentiated genre tag. (Solid House would be wholly redundant without the existence of the adobe.) I couldn't remember a single thing about it when it came time to write this review, but, then again, I usually nod off after ""Fascination Street"" and that doesn't make <i>Disintegration</i> any less of a stone classic.

Artists who were once on top of the world are half-forgotten footnotes a few years later. But hip-hop is also fiercely regional, and its backwaters are undyingly loyal to their hometown heroes. Chicago, the third-largest city in the nation, has only produced a few rap artists of note, and therefore remains a hip-hop backwater. So when Do or Die-- the first hip-hop group to bring a platinum record home to the Chi-- decide to mount a comeback, local royalty like R. Kelly and Kanye West line up to furnish them with beats and hooks. Former Do or Die protégé-turned-superstar Twista helps out, as well.</p><p>
    Do or Die need any help they can get. The trio-- comprised of AK, Nard, and Belo-- moved a million copies of its 1996 debut <i>Picture This</i>, but its three successive LPs have yielded diminishing returns. Worse, the group has little in the way of star quality or personality. Do or Die may have pioneered the Midwest quick-tongue style that brought Twista to prominence-- and it's fun to hear rappers that genuinely enjoy practicing their craft-- but the group doesn't have a lot to say. AK and Belo rap quickly, and Nard raps slowly, but otherwise they're difficult to tell apart. When your album's only quotable lines come from a guest spot (Remy Ma on ""U Already Know"": ""I keep it pimpin', treat niggas like hoes/ Oh, I got dick in different area codes""), you've got a problem.</p><p>
    The group's lack of personality has a blank-canvas effect: The album is only as good as its beats. <i>D.O.D.</i> starts out strong with a few epic bangers but quickly dissolves into limp stepper's tracks. On N.O. Joe's bombastic operatic opener ""Right Here"", the group's members slow their flow down to a Scarface preacher boom, and it works. On Kanye West's phoned-in, lite-funk, cheesed-out slow jam ""Higher"", the group sound completely lost, and it doesn't work. And so the album's one great track, ""Magic Chick"", is almost entirely the work of its producer and guest vocalist, one Robert Kelly.</p><p>
    Kells turns in a deliciously slippery Eastern-inflected track with chilly winding acoustic guitars and a gorgeously tossed-off hook. Kelly also raps, dropping one of the sleazy, slippery bounce flows that he introduced on <i>Unfinished Business</i>.

In that world, where this is just another record by another dance act, <i>Human After All</i> is passable and hardly special.</p><p>
    
    But in my head, where items like <i>Homework</i> and <i>Discovery</i> and-- oh, what the hell-- ""Music Sounds Better With You"" and ""So Much Love to Give"" are allowed to be admitted as evidence, and where the weight of expectation and precedence get to have a say, this feels like not just a failure, but a heartbreaker.</p><p>
    
    The rap on <i>Human After All</i> is that it was recorded in two weeks, which should've been our first clue that it was going to surface as a droopy flower. Such cavalier recording approaches fly in the rock world because listeners are forgiving of minimal production methods; hell, as any Julian and Fab'll tell you, under the right light, they'll even embrace them. In rock music, where descriptors like ""raw"" and ""ragged"" are virtues, finesse is not only unnecessary, it's often discouraged. In dance music, where the illusion of performance has to be sculpted, finesse is more critical-- make a record in two weeks and 99.6% of the time, it'll sound like it was made in two weeks.</p><p>
    
    Turns out Daft Punk are (mostly) human after all, because from a compositional standpoint, this sounds like it was made in about 19 days. Even the good stuff sounds painfully extemporaneous, like early sketches of tracks that deserve to be much better. Take the title cut-- a slick, vocoder-driven track that, despite being one of the better offerings on the record, has such a clinical build that it registers as patterned and completely starved of joy. It's Daft Punk going through the motions and, for the first time in their career, sounding like cynics.</p><p>
    
    If there's a defining thread to <i>Human After All</i>, it's that there's very little here that rings with wonderment or joy. The songs that make the most overt stabs at those emotions still sound like vague approximations of better songs that preceded them: ""Robot Rock"" is a poor man's ""Aerodynamic"", ""Technologic"" a poor man's ""Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger"", and so on. Ultimately, it's the phoned-in ""Television Rules the Nation"" that confirms Daft Punk's slackening standards; they give us nine proper songs after four years and this is one of them?</p><p>
    
    In the end, it's not as if there aren't things to like about <i>Human After All</i>-- both ""Make Love"" and ""Emotion"", for example, are totally charming. I just wish that they didn't come at the expense of Daft Punk's mystique. Then again, if the point is to <i>be</i> rock, maybe on some totally boring level, they've succeeded admirably: What's more rock'n'roll than hitting the self-destruct button?</p></div>"|2137.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2137-human-after-all/|4.9|Mark Pytlik

It was 1996, and I was at work in downtown San Francisco, listening to a show on the independent radio station KPOO called ""The Uplift Broadcast"", whose tagline was ""featuring the music and wisdom of John Will-I-Am Coltrane."" Put on weekly by the Church of St. John Coltrane, an African Orthodox institution that recognizes Trane as a saint, ""The Uplift Broadcast"" occasionally played records from other artists in his sphere.</p>
<p>One afternoon I heard something new to me. I could tell right away it wasn't Coltrane. Too playful. The singsong refrain sounded like a tune a kid might whistle on the way home from school, but I couldn't place it, and then the melody fell apart little by little until the saxophone player started blowing his lungs out. It was visceral and complex, channeling positive energy despite the noise and dissonance. It was ""Ghosts"", from the album <i>Vibrations</i>, by Albert Ayler and Don Cherry.</p>
<p><i>Vibrations</i> was released in 1964, the same year Ayler recorded <i>Spiritual Unity</i> for a new label called ESP-Disk. For years, ESP-Disk has been semi-dormant, licensing its back catalog to other labels for manufacture, but they've now reasserted control and have started a reissue campaign. <i>Spiritual Unity</i> and <i>Live on the Riviera</i>, which are interesting pieces in Ayler's astonishing run, are part of the first wave.</p>
<p>Personally, my favorite Ayler material involves him working with another horn. Something about his fat, driving tone-- the way it conveys joy even as his overblowing threatens to crack his instrument-- sounds a little lonely with just bass and drums. Still, some of his best music was recorded in the trio format, and he had a telepathic empathy on <i>Spiritual Unity</i> with bassist Gary Peacock and drummer Sunny Murray. Together Peacock and Murray form a sound backing that at times seems more like an endlessly shifting cluster of sound than an actual rhythm section. Murray has a light, rapid touch, keeping the cymbals and snares going pretty much constantly, never breaking the flow of the music with a heavy roll, and Peacock functions as an extension of his textures.</p>
<p>Out front is Ayler, sounding strong and huge, opening and closing with versions of ""Ghosts"". His approach to this signature piece sets the tone for what he tried to accomplish with his music. Though he obviously has a deep love of simple folk melodies, the intensity of his feeling is such that a tune could never contain it, and the sound spills over and around the structure until it eventually bursts forth in a chaotic torrent. ""The Wizard"" doesn't begin quite as catchy and features an even harsher tone, moving into more challenging areas of free jazz, and ""Spirits"" is a swooning lament that has Ayler stretching notes to melodramatic and deeply moving lengths. <i>Spiritual Unity</i> is short (just under 30 minutes), intense, and a deserved classic.</p>
<p>Fast forward to the final year of Ayler's life, 1970, as he toured Europe with a quartet. Constantly searching for new textures, during the past couple years he'd experimented with vocals, bagpipes, harpsichord, and rock bands. On <i>Life on the Riviera</i>, the main remnant from these restless years is the presence of Ayler's girlfriend, the poet and musician Mary Maria. While her spoken words on ""Music Is the Healing Force of the Universe"" are on the one hand painfully dated hippie drivel (""music causes all bad vibrations to faaaade away"") there's something oddly fascinating about the clash between her sentiments and Ayler's insane screeches. He's screaming through his tenor, pinching it to sound like a kazoo as the force of his wind drives it up a few octaves, and yet Maria's words (""it makes one want to love instead of hate, it puts the mind in a healthy state of thought"") imply that what they're doing is a universal expression of affection and warmth.</p>
<p>Maria's voice is scattered throughout, sometimes reciting verse, sometimes singing, sometimes mimicking Ayler's phrasing with blubbery scat. Her crooning on the straighter ballad ""Heart Love"" is pretty solid, and when Ayler pipes in to sing a verse, as he often did in his later years, he makes her sound like Dionne Warwick. But as awkward as the vocals can get, the material is strong enough to survive it. The bouncy ""The Birth of Mirth"" shows that Ayler was writing great themes all the way to end.</p>
<p>A rousing version of ""Ghosts"" is the closer. Seven minutes into it, the band stops playing-- it's the apparent end of the set-- and the crowd applauds appreciatively. After 15 seconds or so of cheers the band kicks in with a reprise of the theme, the crowd explodes, and then, for three more minutes, the variations continue. It's incredible to think of how many places Ayler could still take the tune. Sadly, within four months the ending would be final and his opportunities would cease.</p>

    fluke. The album was recorded on a whim and wasn't intended for
    widespread release. As indulgences go, it was an astonishing feat:
    gently balanced, melodically fecund, restrained yet
    confident. That Keren Ann would want to keep the album private almost
    makes sense: Her lyrics are peppered with the oblique aphorisms of
    someone who's concerned exclusively with herself.</p><p>
    
    Compared to its subdued predecessor, <i>Nolita</i> almost feels
    tense. But Keren Ann keeps a cool head. Patience is her biggest asset,
    and <i>Nolita</i>'s 10 songs sound relaxed even when you'd expect them to
    break a sweat. Opener ""Que N'ai-Je"" (the first of four French-language
    tracks; there were none on <i>Not Going Anywhere</i>) is a dreamy wash. One
    by one, the instruments overtake each other until Keren Ann is
    half-drowned in a mash of upright bass, acoustic guitar, trilling
    strings, brush-stroked drums, and a laconic organ. The surplus is a
    break with the stark minimalism of <i>Not Going Anywhere</i>, but
    the change is welcome: This noirish, world-weary Keren
    Ann is no less captivating than her more precious former self.</p><p>
    
    Keren Ann has a frail, diaphanous voice that's predisposed to the soft, solvent French language. Singing in English at the
    impossibly low volumes she favors, syllables are often lost as her
    voice shows fine cracks, like a weathered painting. On ""Chelsea
    Burns"", the LP's first English-language track, the lingual contrast is
    revelatory. Luckily, this is one of <i>Nolita</i>'s strongest songs, a
    wistful, electric ballad marked by the appearance of a fiddle and a
    harmonica-- outsiders to Keren Ann's standard
    instrumentation.</p><p>
    
    The album's title track is also its centerpiece. Seven minutes long and wontedly unhurried, the song opens with a
    facilitating acoustic guitar lullaby played at a tempo verging on
    lugubrious. Keren Ann enters with a purposefully punny vocal: ""It's
    late, I think I'm gonna stay, think I'm gonna bury you,"" she sings,
    but the ""bury"" is drawn out and slurred-- she could just as well be
    singing ""marry you."" A hollow, reverberating trill stretches out in
    the darkened space like moonlight rippling over water. She eventually stops singing altogether and just breathes, at first
    lightly, then deeply and insistently as the background strings build
    to whooshing climax. The moment is at once gloriously baroque and understated.</p><p>
    
    Everything thereafter is a comedown, but is still satisfying.
    ""Roses and Hips"" and ""One Day Without"" recall the mindless drift of
    Keren Ann's erstwhile work, only perhaps a bit more grounded in
    realism. The latter layers a brisk,
    distorted-beyond-recognition guitar beneath Keren Ann's wispy vocal as
    she struggles to keep her footing; that the singer would test herself
    against her own songwriting shows maturity and humility beyond
    her 30 years.</p></div>"|4594.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4594-nolita/|8.2|Sam Ubl

Mop-topped and horn-rimmed, Chicago by-way-of Florida singer Devin Davis is ambitious, but it's not necessarily his nasty trombone or theremin chops that make his debut solo album better than your local mom-and-pop clerk's self-described ""Bolan meets Pollard"" pop masterpiece. Instead, it's his knowing way around a walloping chorus and his welcome sense of restraint and economy that allow said hooks to live for many hum-worthy listens.</p><p>
    
    A loosely conceptual record, <i>Lonely People of the World, Unite!</i> sees Davis embodying a varied cast of, well, lonely people-- or, as it happens, lonely ghosts or lonely turtles. ""Iron Woman"" doubles as the record's seafaring jumping-off point and its most distinguishable, immediate moment. ""It's hard to live in a basement and not get carried away,"" sings Davis on the Guided By Springsteen stomper. This lone wolf mostly takes his own advice to heart. Recording the vast majority of the album by himself, Davis doesn't often succumb to vain overindulgence and his piled-on retro-instrumentation punches up more than it bogs down.</p><p>
    
    The singer's limited yelp hinders some songs from reaching Kinks-esque fantasia, but on ""Turtle and the Flightless Bird"", Davis' vulnerability matches his hard-shelled counterpart's grounded hopefulness. The track finds the title pair in an unlikely partnership, and it reads like a heartbreaking fable.</p><p>
    
    Davis' less quirky, more obviously derivative endeavors fall flat. ""Moon Over Shark City"" isn't as much homage to Bowie's ""Suffragette City"" as an inexcusable copy-- all the way down to the pounding piano and ""woo-hoo"" back-ups. And the power ballad ""Sandie"" slips under its own well-worn bombast.</p><p>
    
    The exclamation point at the end of this album's title is a testament to Davis' sense of mutual togetherness. Just as he looked to organs, drums, and gongs to quell his own isolation in a new city, many of the characters in his tales of woe are buoyed by the songwriter's optimism. Loneliness has rarely sounded so celebratory or inviting.</p></div>"|2600.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2600-lonely-people-of-the-world-unite/|7.2|Ryan Dombal

    indie pop. After all, in post-emo America, it takes a certain sort of
    music geek to get into the irony-free cuddlecore of, say, the Softies,
    whose live ""It's Love"" caps this two-disc set. Let's face it, though: Either you're with the
    Lucksmiths, or you're with the terrorists.</p><p>
    
    That aesthetic in mind, <em>A House Full of Friends</em> compiles the
    highlights of 34 house parties you probably didn't attend unless you
    were living in Portland, Ore., between 1997 and 2004. The story goes:
    Faced with dwindling all-ages options and a prohibitively costly bar
    scene, Magic Marker co-founders Mark Rothkopf and Curt Kentner invited
    their favorite bands to play in their home. Those bands, in turn, lend
    their recordings to this retrospective of twee times at 4306 SE 34th
    Ave.</p><p>
<em>A House Full of Friends</em> is best received as an introduction to
    recent indie pop from the Pacific Northwest and beyond. The Shins, the
    compilation's biggest name, are represented here with a slinky,
    worthwhile cover of T. Rex's ""Baby Boomerang"" from last year's
    <em>Fighting in a Sack</em> EP, while the Lucksmiths turn in a
    characteristically chipper tune about a drowning relationship, the
    previously unreleased ""Once Again"". The Decemberists' still-vivid
    Victorian vision on 2003's ""The Chimbley Sweep"" may be familiar to most
    listeners, but Ashley Park's pleasantly <em>Band on the Run</em>-tinged
    ""Chelsea Beautiful"" probably isn't.</p><p>
    
    Magic Marker's own Dear Nora, All Girl Summer Fun Band, Lunchbox, and
    Tullycraft also make strong appearances, but labelmates the Owls,
    whose ""Air"" should have been among last year's
    most-blogged mp3s, are regrettably absent. And tucked away as the second
    disc's penultimate song, the Salteens offer a brassy pop
    nugget, ""Time You Have Been Wasting"". The rest of the tracks are the
    stuff of a Twee.net listserv wish list: famous-if-you've-heard-of-'em
    bands like Aislers Set, #Poundsign#, Dressy Bessy, and Mates of State.</p><p>
    
    The collection isn't without its clunkers, such Andrew Kaffer's
    glitchy title track. Still, indie pop fans will find the disc's
    lesser-known discoveries deserving of their time, and the accompanying
    24-page photo booklet almost succeeds in making me wish I lived in a
    town where it rains all the time. All told, a very, very fine house.</p></div>"|2067.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2067-a-house-full-of-friends/|7.1|Marc Hogan

    comes motherfucking Erlend, doing that motherfucking thing he does!
    Fuckingshit C+C electro Power Rangers! Sweet weed with dicks, Øye's
    making his Ø-face!</p><p>
    No doubt, this album was a blast to record-- a party-and-a-half in a
    small room with only awesome dudes. If <i>Hello Stranger isn't
    terra nova, Berlin's old man technogloom DJ Kaos has definitely loosened
    up a bit since the other things he used to do. Here he's collaborated
    with old and new buds alike, coming up with this programmatically fun
    italo punk-funk chi-house post-9/11 distillation of every remotely
    trendy genre coolly revisited in the last five years. Divatox, this is
    your worst nightmare.</i></p><p>
    Copies of copies of copies, whatever-- some of these songs are actually
    likable. Kaos and dudes know each sound's sweet spot, picking, cutting,
    and pasting only the most time-tested licks for nine flawless
    test-tube babies. These songs look human, but they will never know
    their parents-- especially something like Gattacampy opener ""Lessons In
    Love"", which is all breathy electro vox and understated italo swells and lines
    like ""Lessons in love/ Where does it go from here?"" Better still is ""Now
    And Forever""-- jangly chromatic rhythm postpunkin, octave bass slaps,
    cowbell, falsetto chorus, a pisspoor guitar solo, timbales, and-- wait
    for it-- cowbell.</p><p>
    Written out, the album sounds bloated. But most tracks on <i>Hello
    Stranger</i> take more than seven minutes to unravel, lending this LP a DJ set vibe. First come
    the drink-on tracks, then the hard rockers, then Snax to the max, then
    the early morning too-drunk-to-care-<i>what</i>-the-DJ-plays tracks (these tracks on <i>Hello Stranger</i> are kinda
    boring), then the DJ runs out of stuff to play and combs for his least
    shitty B-sides (these tracks on <i>Hello Stranger</i> sorta
    suck), then, finally, a ""last song"" track, which, in LCDspeak, erases
    the whole album so we can spin it again. That track on <i>Hello
    Stranger</i> sounds erasey.</p><p>
    Yup.</p><p>
    For the record: Captain Snax got his duefork a few weeks ago <a href=""http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/tracks/05-02-18.shtml#song2""><u>here</u></a>.</p><p>
    Random and overly reductive: I find the similarities among the Out
    Hud, LCD, and Kaos albums-- same number of tracks (cutting Out Hud's
    28-second intro), ""last songs,"" openly referential and genre-based,
    none of them as dancey as people expected them to be-- somewhat
    amusing.</p><p>
    Insightful and more important than anything I've said so far: Midway

One can only speculate what the neighbors thought when he put up the sign that said ""Hitsville, USA"", but Gordy's optimism was backed by a strong business sense and proved to be well-founded: the Tamla name never became a household word, but his second label Motown did, and the rest is history. Motown grew quickly into a Motor City assembly line for hit songs, the label that put black music into white living rooms, and an institution that's taken for granted today as a part of the American cultural landscape.</p><p>
    Gordy wasn't exactly new to the music industry when he opened up shop; he had dabbled in management, owned a failed record store, and co-written several hits in the mid-50s for soul innovators Jackie Wilson and Etta James. It was an admittedly spotty record, but one that earned him respect amongst local musicians and performers. So Hitsville became a hangout for young musicians hoping to make it big, and the cast of characters that turned up in the label's first three years-- the period covered on Hip-O Select's new six-disc box <em>The Complete Motown Singles, Vol. 1: 1959-61-- is incredible: Smokey Robinson, Brian and Eddie Holland (two thirds of Holland/Dozier/Holland), James Jamerson, Benny Benjamin, the Temptations, the Supremes (née the Primes, or Primettes), Norman Whitfield, Barrett Strong, Marvin Gaye. These are names writ large across even a cursory knowledge of r&amp;b; and classic pop, and all of them helped build the label into a legend.</em></p><p>
    As this set reveals, though, there were plenty of secondary players, one-offs, novelties, experiments, and trend-hopping tangents (not to mention a ton of gospel, Gordy shrewdly realizing that the audience for it was very stable) that helped shape the label as well-- and that's part of the reason these discs are so fascinating. Of course, you know the Miracles' ""Shop Around"" (just Motown's 20th single, but its first million-seller) and the Marvelettes' ""Please Mr. Postman"" (Motown's first #1 hit), but most of what's compiled here has been otherwise lost to history, leaving whole chapters out of one of popular music's most important stories. The Swinging Tigers, Eugene Remus, Gino Parks, the Equadors, the Valadiers, and Herman Griffin are anything but well-known, some having released just a one 45, but you can hear the Motown sound developing on their singles-- several of which are real gems.</p><p>
    Every A-Side, B-Side, and replacement side from every single released on Gordy's Tamla, Motown, and Miracle labels from 1959-61 amounts to more than 150 tracks and almost seven hours of music, and to explore it both as it's presented here,
    in strict chronological order, and to jump around comparing, say ""Shop Around"" with Debbie Dean's answer song ""Don't Let Him Shop Around"", is supremely rewarding.  Marv Johnson's ""Come to Me"", originally released on Tamla, opens things triumphantly-- not only is it a fantastic song, it was also a hit, albeit only after Gordy licensed it to United Artists, who were far better equipped to promote it nationally than he was.  Barrett Strong's ""Money (That's What I Want)"" gave the label a national hit on just the eighth try, and it's typical of the impromptu genius of Motown's early years; the song was written by Gordy and Hitsville receptionist Janie Bradford off the cuff and recorded on the spot as two local white high schoolers stopped in on their way past Hitsville to sit in on bass and guitar. To this day, no one can even speculate as to who those two kids were, and who knows if they have any clue what they contributed to?</p><p>
    Novelties abound on this set as well, including a half-dozen attempts to jump on the twist bandwagon that swept the nation on 1961.  Of these, the most notable are ""Ich-I-Bon #1"", a surprisingly sharp surf instrumental by a band called Nick &amp; the Jaguars, and the odd minor-key story-song of ""Small Sad Sam"" by Bob Kayli, actually Gordy's brother Robert performing under a pseudonym.  The most mystifying of all the novelties, though, is Popcorn and the Mohawks' ""Custer's Last Man"" (incredibly, it's not even the only song about General Custer present here). ""Last Man"" is a totally bizarre, even mildly offensive radio play that stretches out to a ridiculous 4\xBD, and the single most glaring example of the fact that Motown hadn't yet established its famed Quality Control department.</p><p>
    Other oddities are more successful, like Ron and Bill's ""It"", an attempt to create another ""Purple People Eater"" while that song was still hot, and Gino Parks' hilarious ""Blibberin' Blabbin' Blues"", an obvious attempt to beat the Coasters at their own ""Yakety Yak"" game.  Parks actually proves on his second release, ""Same Thing"" b/w ""That's No Lie"", that he deserved far more than a novelty hit; the A-Side drips with soul, while the flip is like Sam Cooke and James Brown rolled into one-- gravelly, soulful crooning punctuated by startling, ear-piercing yelps of joy.  No obscure act from the early days of Motown deserved fame more than the Satintones, though. A brilliant doo-wop act, they recorded five singles for the label and none took off, though all were great. Their aching, gorgeous ""Angel"" is one of the best songs here, and its B-side, ""My Kind of Love"", features beautiful harmonies and a crazy, very unusual string arrangement.</p><p>
    String arrangements are something of a running theme throughout these six discs. Gordy became convinced early on that they were a signifier of class and a key to crossover success, hence several songs appear in two versions-- one with strings, and one without.  Gordy would pull the original single and then reissue it with the same catalog number and the new arrangement, a tactic that did manage to produce some sales, but one that also understandably drives collectors nuts.</p><p>
    Yet hearing alternate versions gathered in one place is fascinating.  Other do-overs include the slower, inferior regional version of ""Shop Around"", a take on the song in which the Miracles sound almost tentative. Gordy apparently sensed that, and gathered the house band-- an early incarnation of the legendary Funk Brothers-- and the Miracles in the middle of the night to re-cut the song for the reissue, which of course would go platinum.</p><p>
    As a musical journey, this set is nothing short of amazing, despite a handful of mediocre cuts and a few downright awful ones.  By disc six, Motown is a well-oiled hit machine, and even a few of the twist knock-offs are pretty entertaining.  It's huge fun to hear Marvin Gaye trying to position himself as a sensitive interpreter of showtunes (thank God <i>that</i> didn't last) or to check out the truly amazing house band-- has their ever been a pop bass/drums combo as outstanding as James Jamerson and Benny Benjamin?-- cutting loose on ""Snake Walk"" under the name Swinging Tigers.</p><p>
    Ultimately, the failures are as much a part of the early Motown story as the successes, and Hip-O has done about as good a job as humanly possible chronicling it, making this the kind of package you want to wash your hands before touching.  Motown went on to much bigger things and had better years, to be detailed on future sets in this series, but there's no experience like hearing the label get on its feet and find itself; for that, this is truly essential.</p></div>"|2064.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2064-the-complete-motown-singles-vol-1-59-61/|9.0|Joe Tangari

The lead-off ""In State"" could be ""Six O'Clock News"" redux, since both describe the same romantic quandary: What do you do with a lover who's a recalcitrant criminal and whose lawlessness interferes with your relationship? On ""Six O'Clock News"", the narrator sits by as her lover is gunned down on television, her unborn child left fatherless. But on ""In State"", the narrator is an active agent in her fate: She turns him in with no illusions and very little compunction, singing, ""Maybe 20 years in state will change your mind.""</em></p><p>
    
    The differences between these two lead-off tracks and their narrators reveal Edwards' growth as a songwriter since recording <em>Failer. </em><em>Back to Me is a bolder album, with Edwards figuring more prominently and actively in the more personal songs. Nowhere does she sound more brazen than on the title track, in which she promises no escape for an errant lover: ""I've got ways to make you come,"" she sings, drawing out the last word in a sly innuendo before finally clarifying, ""back to me.""</em></p><p>
    
    Fittingly, her band on <em>Back to Me sounds tighter and more dynamic than the one on </em><em>Failer. This type of country music is not especially notable for its innovation, but there are flourishes of sound that elevate </em><em>Back to Me above similar efforts by Tift Merritt and Kasey Chambers. In addition to Benmont Tench's churning organ and Eric Heywood's stately pedal steel, Colin Cripps' crisp production and feedback-heavy guitar work give songs like the title track and ""What Are You Waiting For?"" an edgy urgency that that matches the rough vulnerability of Edwards' voice.</em></p><p>
    
    Cripps, like Dave Draves on <em>Failer, understands that the album's distinctiveness lies entirely with Edwards, the daring of her songwriting and the rawness of her vocals. She sounds tough-minded but world-weary as she sings of small-town inertia, big-city intimidation, and the thousandth romantic crime she's perpetrated. These characters aren't necessarily Edwards herself, but she inhabits them so unreservedly that she sounds believably vulnerable and alternately confused and confident.</em></p><p>
    
    Edwards recently moved from rural Canada to the big city of Toronto, which ostensibly inspired the sense of dislocation that informs much of <em>Back to Me, especially the final three songs. On ""Somewhere Else"", she longs to be anywhere but her new hometown, and ""Copied Keys"" evokes the sense of never belonging in a new lover's life: ""This is our apartment filled with your things/ This is your life, I get copied keys."" The gentler ""Good Things"" completes the trilogy and rounds out the album with its open-ended resignation that ""good things come when you stop looking.""</em></p><p>
    
    Along with her reckless vocals, Edwards' insistence that place can affect identity and emotion has earned her numerous comparisons to Lucinda Williams, and her empathetic depiction of dead-end characters shares a strong kinship with Freedy Johnston. These comparisons are not without merit, but both Edwards' physical and lyrical voices are resolutely her own: she absorbs these and other starting-point influences but is never beholden to them. In fact, on <em>Back to Me, she has joined their estimable ranks.</em></p></div>"|2685.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2685-back-to-me/|7.7|Stephen M. Deusner

And though Chariots don't actually succeed in turning any new noise-rock sod, they deliver these 10 tracks with such passionate, frenetic panache that they're able to deftly sidestep the numerous landmines that could've potentially fatally wounded the project.</p><p>
    
    Recorded by Dave Gardner (who has also worked with Rocket From the Crypt, Detachment Kit, and Hot Snakes), <i>Congratulations</i> is loaded with massive, airtight riffs yet fully outfitted with invigorating whiplash contours-- as when the driving, headlong locomotion of ""Hips Unite"" dovetails abruptly into a hand-clapping, pint-raising hooligan stomp worthy of AC/DC. The heavily effected vocals of Travis Bos, whose work in Song of Zarathustra was often abrasive enough to qualify as a deal-breaker, remain forceful but manage to be relatively nuanced and (on occasion) surprisingly tuneful.</p><p>
    
    It's long been my opinion, however, that the success or failure of such an enterprise is almost wholly determined by the quality of the rhythm section, and in that respect Chariots emerge smelling like clover. Bassist Arthur Gandy plays with the same spare, limber economy with which David Sims once anchored the Jesus Lizard, while Matt Kepler's pounding, casually intricate drumming serves as a virtual focal point on hyperactive tracks like ""GRPSTX"" or ""Bored Housewife Syndrome"".</p><p>
    
    The album's title track finds the group expertly matching dissonant scrawls of guitar to Gandy's lively Peter Hook bassline, while Bos screams indistinct unsweetened nothings and his party-crashing keyboards flirt shamelessly on the sidelines. Meanwhile ""Number One With a Bullet"" revisits some of the more metallic territory covered by Zarathustra, before the album finally collapses onto the broad shoulders of ""The Laundry Room in This Building Is Equipped With a Burglar Alarm""; the entire group wrapping their collective fists around the song's meaty core and squeezing it into oblivion.</p></div>"|1798.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1798-congratulations/|7.2|Matthew Murphy

See, the smart kids who liked pot but didn't have the balls to sell it had already spent so much time syncing <i>The Wizard of Oz</i> with <i>Dark Side of the Moon</i>, that answering the high-creativity/low-math requisites of a film studies program was the next logical step. But like so many others, I found myself lulled into a coma by the French New Wave, indifferent to samurai films, and learning absolutely nothing about filmmaking.</p><p>
    The one bit of quasi-useful information I retained, however, came from a class entitled something totally pompous like ""Debunking the American Comedy 1960-1990: From Droll to Dull"". After watching Stanley Kubrick's <i>Dr. Strangelove</i>, our professor made the fairly obvious observation that the film is a brilliant satire because although the audience may be in hysterics, at no point do the characters ever laugh at themselves. In spite of the barrage of ludicrous imagery and verbiage used to satirize an impending nuclear holocaust, no one in the film seems to find anything funny. Crappy metal bands have thrived on this very same technique for more than two decades.</p><p>
    For anyone who's familiar with grindcore, and in particular gore-grind, the genres have blended technical wherewithal and tongue-in-cheek sex, violence, and drugs seamlessly. One of the reasons songs about flatulence and midget porn can actually be enjoyable is because the musicians are almost always competent, and almost never take themselves too seriously.
    Then we have Cephalic Carnage, a Denver-based quintet who've made a pesky habit out of melding numerous styles of experimental music with death metal and grindcore. Though the band truly established itself as a key player in the burgeoning avant-garde metal community with its 2002 release <i>Lucid Interval</i>, Cephalic Carnage have spent the better part of 13 years smoking weed, touring extensively, and-- most importantly-- knocking metalheads like me on our asses.</p><p>
    I loved every second of their previous LP, <i>Lucid Interval. From the mock black metal to the hilarious mariachi track, it's a damn-near perfect blend of mind-bending metal and deadpan comedy. And in the three years since its release, we've witnessed the band soar to the top of Relapse's impressive talent roster. But while CC have lost none of their mammoth bite and originative wiles, the unruly dose of irony on the overcooked </i><i>Anomalies</i> left me a bit overwhelmed, and more than a little disappointed.</p><p>
    ""Scientific Remote Viewing"" is a perfect opener. Featuring vocals from Cattle Decapitation's Travis Ryan and lyrics that could be interpreted either as a conspiracy theorist's musings on MKULTRA or a DMT travelogue, the track is flawless. ""Wraith"" follows a similar mold of crunching grind. On it, drummer John Merryman lays down his best drumming to date: searing blast beats and jazzy syncopation, all executed with taste and precision.</p><p>
    Guitarists Zac Joe and Steve Goldberg's blistering arpeggios shine on ""Counting the Days"", a song that resembles labelmates Pig Destroyer musically, but lyrically is a cloying thank you note to fans. And ""Kill for Weed"" is a great little grindcore stoner anthem. Its Golem vocals are a nice touch, but it works because it doesn't aspire to be anything more than a metal band expressing its lust for marijuana. Regrettably, there are few moments like that on <i>Anomalies</i>. More often than not, the band spends so much time amusing itself with creative technical masturbation that the audience is left wondering when to laugh.</p><p>
    The first real misstep of the album is ""Piecemaker"", which starts with a fantastic Electric Wizard stoner riff and then turns into Suicidal Tendencies wankery. Although it's probably intended as homage to Terrorizer's grind-meets-hardcore aggression, the track is a bunch of genre clichés run amok.</p><p>
    ""Enviovore"" bears a striking resemblance to Cattle Decapitation's <i>Humanure</i>, revisiting all of 80s thrash's favorite themes: overpopulation, plague, genocide, and pollution. ""Dying Will Be the Death of Me"" is a hilarious of parody of metalcore mallrats like the Blood Brothers, featuring actual-sung vocals, and represents the band's most radio-friendly offering to date.</p><p>
    On ""Inside Is Out"", the band falls into the trap of passing off recycled Mr. Bungle noodling as experimentation, and here we encounter the major shortcoming of <i>Anomalies: Instead of exploding the structure of a single genre and creating a unique sound, Cephalic Carnage knock the cobwebs off of a bunch of tired traditions (hardcore, fusion, doom) and do their best to incorporate as many of them as possible into 45 minutes. One of the most trying aspects of this disc is that it juxtaposes so many disparate styles-- and to CC's credit, that's no small feat-- and as a result it often feels more like a tribute record than 12 tracks of original material.</i></p></div>"|1381.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1381-anomalies/|7.0|Isaiah Violante

It was during one of these escapades that a manager approached me and pronounced Charles Mingus' <em>The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady</em> ""too raucous,"" adding that he liked his jazz ""spry,"" before hiking his Dockers and trudging off to the <em>New York Times</em> Bestseller List section.  I bring this up because jazz purists (and in this dude's case, ""pure"" = ""freshly fallen snow"") make even the most obnoxiously close-minded indie nerds look as chilled-out as opium-drugged Taoists.  So, those of you who never graduated beyond ""hard bop"" would be doing yourselves a favor by turning back now.  For anyone else:</p><p> <em>In the Kingdom of Kitsch You Will Be a Monster</em> is the third album (and first for Rune Grammofon) from Norway-based Shining, an experimental collective whose lineup includes two former members of Ninja Tune's electro-lite combo Jaga Jazzist: This album doesn't even remotely hint at that band's bland, ivory-tickling, snare-wrapping pedigree; <em>Kingdom</em> is labyrinthine, alternately creeping and brutally visceral, and certainly raucous.</p><p>  Maybe these sparkling, teetering, huge sounds reflect the coming-of-age of Shining's leader, multi-instrumentalist Jørgen Munkeby, who joined Jaga in 1996 when he was only 16.  Tellingly, Munkeby grew up listening to Sepultura and Pantera before taking on the saxophone at the wee age of nine.  Helping point Shining in other non-jazz (and non-metal) directions, bassist Aslak Hartberg is the mastermind behind Norway's best-selling hip-hop collective, Klovner i Kamp.  So what do we have here: Jazzy art rock?  Proggy jazz?  Who knows.  On top of any number of brassy instruments, there are clattering drum machines, moaning synths, chameleonic samplers, swooning (and frequently buried) vocal harmonies, and thunderous, window-rattling cathedral organs.</p><p>  Shining frontload the record with ""Goretex Weather Report"", an opener as mighty as anything I've heard this year.  It begins with sparse, muted saxophone exhalations, clean handclaps, and tentative, chugging ministrations before, after a minute or so, thundersticks connect with earthly skins and guitars picks off stars.  Taciturn in comparison, ""REDRUM"" offers dueling horns over squiggles of drums, rat-a-tat rave-ups, and a sighing vocal clip. ""Romani"" goes for flute/clarinet, distant bass, some drums, and vibes/xylophone, and the instrumentation descends while airy, harmonizing vocals ascend. The track doesn't explore much distance, but it covers a lot of surface area.</p><p>  Despite its ostentatious, <em>Dune</em>-referencing title, ""31 = 300 = 20 (It Is By Will Alone I Set My Mind in Motion)"" is a whisper, as if the band were playing from behind a wall of Tony Conrad gauze.  But after a few minutes of drifting, sighing, and softly imploding, Shining mash together AM-radio vocal bugs, some extinct country's national anthem, and a feverish drum breakdown.  Elsewhere, like wheedling new wave, ""The Smoking Dog"" kicks electro-drumpad Western tango and some (I kid you not) Bobby McFerrin-inspired scat, while the gonging and droning ""Magazine RWRK"" buzzes with atmospherics reminiscent of a plodding noise band jamming with a virtuoso French horn player.</p><p>  Check it out: There, somewhere over the horizon, that guy in the Mr. Bungle shirt took silent note of a playful 7/8 atmospheric break and wept in double-time.  Over there, some kid tired of improvising to Rush and the ""Benny Hill Theme"" just got his groove back.  But, hey techy, before you pick up a stopwatch and dork out, note that Shining keep things brief, subtle, tight, and aesthetically on-the-mark, suggesting progness (or at least, jazz kids spreading their rock wings) is often less about duration and bombast than complexity, invention, and the rigorous interplay of its players.</p><p> </p></div>"|7805.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7805-in-the-kingdom-of-kitsch-you-will-be-a-monster/|8.3|Brandon Stosuy

    of the Valkyries""; it ends with a narrator asking someone to sing him ""Happy Birthday"" ""like it's gonna 
    be your last day on earth"". In between are disheartening references 
    to psychoanalysis, economic ruin, the slow death of living, and 
    couplets such as: ""You're what happens when two substances collide/ And by all 
    accounts, you really should have died"".</p><p>
    
    But while the lyrics here are the stuff of sleepless 
    nights and empty liquor bottles, the sonics belie any gloom or 
    doom. The music on <i>Eggs</i> is ebullient, starting with a nameless, minute-long 
    intro that features Bird's winding wind-swept violin 
    and beguiling whistling. That's right, whistling-- he's credited as a 
    ""professional whistler"" in his bio, and since he can make the breath 
    passing between his lips sound like a singing saw or a radiant theremin, 
    I'm willing to take him at his word. As for the violin, Bird's 
    trademark instrument-- it's all over the album, but it's not what the album is 
    about. Any plucking or sawing or twittering is done in service of the track 
    at hand, not as a grand flourish of technique.</p><p>
    
    The CD's accompanying insert features fantastic illustrations by 
    Jay Ryan, one for each song on the album. At first glance, Ryan's 
    drawings look like half-finished sketches, with faint pencil marks still 
    visible in the finished picture. These sketch lines, rather than making 
    the artwork seem sloppy or half-ass, give the pictures a sense of 
    motion, a frisky kinetic energy reflected in the music. Whether the song is 
    slow and somber, like the gentle ""Masterfade"", or 
    contagiously upbeat, like Bird's musical nod to ""Tomorrow Never Knows"", ""Fake 
    Palindromes"", there's a looseness and freshness to the playing. Even 
    though this record took three years to finish, it has the life and verve 
    of a one-take, time-is-money recording session.</p><p>
    
    Such verve is also evident in the words themselves. For the most part, 
    Bird eschews straight-forward storytelling, opting instead to drench 
    the listener with wordplay and imagery. He might send you to the 
    dictionary a few times, but there's nothing wrong with a little research. He might 
    also sideswipe you with seemingly random lines-- ""Memories like mohair 
    sweaters/ Stretched and pilled faux distressed letters/ Moose's horns 
    and figure eights/ White plastic bags in search of mates""-- but Bird's 
    love of language is so evident in lines like this that it's easy to 
    forgive him his excesses and missteps.</p><p>
    
    All this talk about lyrics isn't to say they'll ever get in the way 
    of enjoying the record. They're there if you want them, but you can 
    still savor the fantastic popcraft of <i>Eggs</i> without giving a damn about 
    what's being said. Andrew Bird's voice is the spoonful of sugar that 
    makes this medicine go down so smooth. Much like his violin playing and 
    his whistling and his songwriting, Bird's voice is versatile, 
    simultaneously recalling Paul Simon's conversational croon, Rufus Wainwright's 
    self-aware drama, and Thom Yorke's mournful wail. He can hang on one 
    word and give it emotional heft, and he can nail a line like ""and I'm 
    gonna tie your wrists with leather/ and drill a tiny hole in your head"" 
    with the nonchalant whimsy it requires.</p><p>
    
    Ultimately, whimsy leavened with wisdom and humor is what typifies this album. When Bird sings, ""Sing me 'Happy Birthday'/ Sing like it's going to be your last day,"" it's a call for carpe diem, not a requiem. <i>The Mysterious Production of Eggs</i> might wrestle with unsavory topics, but it does so with a shrug of the shoulders, a wry smile, and a heart full of awe-inspiring song.</p></div>"|714.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/714-andrew-bird-the-mysterious-production-of-eggs/|8.3|David Raposa

Apparently the band acquired one as they began to write the album, and the instrument became the sonic foundation of the record. I've heard it said that the whole thing was recorded in sessions scheduled for the middle of the night, which also makes sense. Between the Wurlitzer's full-bodied, rounded sound and the generally chilled mood of the writing and playing, the album has a subdued, reflective tone, albeit with a healthy rhythmic underpinning.</p><p>
    
    Whichever of the band's four members sings lead (all are simply listed in the liners, and all are multi-instrumentalists) sounds a fair bit like this Ben Gibbard fellow we've been hearing so much about lately, but the Death Cab/Postal Service references don't take you much further than that. Being a band named for the Golden State, it's unsurprising to hear some Beach Boys threads weaving their way through the mix, like the xylophone that duets with the vocals on ""May Day"", as prime an example of the band's basic sound as I could name. The painterly drums are recorded with a wide-open feel, slung low in the mix to propel the big, bounding Wurlitzer chords and swirls of Mellotron, Hammond, and Chamberlin. The languid verses are balanced by rhythmically dynamic refrains that serve as mini-climaxes.</p><p>
    
    The half-time lope of ""In Scarlet""-- with jangling guitars rising to presage the sweetly layered harmonies-- makes it easy to imagine Greater California opening for Kingsbury Manx (indeed they have), and they build the song into a nice start-stop passage that gives way to an acoustic verse and a cascading return of the keyboards an electric guitars. Though the general quality is high, two songs in particular demonstrate the band's talent for songcraft. ""Patterns"" shifts between swelling, buzzing instrumental passages and big, whispy harmonies drawn into thin contrails by reverb. The band also adds an oscillating coda that nicely tricks you into expecting a build-up that never comes. Even better is ""Looking In"", a beguiling thing decked out with a jeweled chorus and vaporous vocals that nonetheless coalesce into an ear-grabbing hook.</p><p>
    
    With all that Wurlitzer, the album could feel monochromatic, but the instrument acts more as a sonic signature than a gimmick, and the sounds around it vary enough to maintain one's interest. The album starts much stronger than it ends, with a couple of rather inconsequential instrumentals and a weak title track near its close. But even those aren't bad, and ultimately <em>Somber Wurlitzer</em> is a record in which you can make yourself at home.</p></div>"|3671.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3671-somber-wurlitzer/|7.6|Joe Tangari

<i>The Phife Dawg Complex</i>: The inability for a solo artist to repeat the tremendous success of a previous group or collective. Often marked by several substandard breakout attempts. Results in career paralysis, droves of guest appearances, and recurring bouts of the ""coulda's."" Correlates with indie rock's ""ex members of"" syndrome. Notable subjects include: L.A. Sunshine and DJ Easy Lee, Lonzo from World Class Wreckin' Cru, everyone in Boogie Down Productions except KRS and Biz, Cormega and AZ.</p><p>
    
    It's more than a trope. If you're in a trio and two of the members blow up, you're done. Just retire and practice your storytelling for the kids. So for Big Pooh of N.C. heads Little Brother, the odds certainly don't look promising. 9th Wonder dropped a career-changing (albeit mediocre) track on <i>The Black Album</i> and got nods for the Destiny's Child LP. Phonte caught a deal with BBE for Foreign Exchange's phenomenal <i>Connected</i>. All Pooh got is KC Royal Desi Relaford to back his release's label 6 Hole. Uh oh.</p><p>
    
    To be fair, <i>Sleepers</i> isn't a freshman disaster on par with Phife Dawg's <i>Ventilation: Da LP</i>, but it's a far cry from Little Brother's <i>The Listening</i>.  Fellow Justus Leaguer and Away Team beathead Khrysis's additions ""I Don't Care"" and ""Just Friends"" aren't quite on par with 9th's cuts. Unlike 9th, who excavates the classic dusty soul oeuvre, Khrysis merely copies-and-pastes elements without recomposing the original's character. The results are murky, almost organic rehashes.</p><p>
    
    (Un)fortunately, <i>Sleepers</i> performs best as an imitation. Pooh and Phonte's lyrical handshakes feed the snaps and pops of ""Every Block"" with each of 9th's patent-pending staccatos. O-Dash (or is it Joe Scudda?) and Darien Brockington's talents help transform ""My Mind"" into a mournful, lovelorn whistler. But both cuts only mimic the best moments of Little Brother and the endless sundry of Justus League collabos.</p><p>
    
    So what to do with Big Pooh? <i>Sleepers</i> is solid and avoids all the totemic markings of the subpar ""other dude."" And certainly Pooh is cognizant of his critics' free-rider accusations: ""You say 'Pooh, the weak nigga'/ I don't care"", he jests. But Pooh lacks Phonte's sense of humor and profound wit. <i>Sleepers</i> gives Pooh a headstart, but his sophomore release needs to sparkle if he's to avoid a seat next to Phife on the sidelines.</p></div>"|6943.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6943-sleepers/|6.7|Jamin Warren

It was how the genre
    gained a foothold in a subterranean market dominated by punk's
    protestations and ska's smarmy sense of humor. So, nearly a decade
    after bands like Mineral and Sunny Day Real Estate had the bright idea
    of uniting distortion and schmaltz in a minor key, who can blame the
    genre's descendants for wanting to have some fun?</p><p>
    
    By the End of Tonight are the far-detached heirs to a complicated legacy. Their
    aptly-titled 2004 EP <i>Fireworks on Ice</i> was one of the more adventurous
    re-imaginings of emo since screamo's inexplicable one-night stand with
    the mainstream. The EP wedded paranoiac, Drive Like
    Jehu-esque melodies to the previously stepped-around realms of
    thrash metal and prog.</p><p>
    
    On <i>Tribute to Tigers</i>, By the End Of Tonight flip the shit on its head,
    regressing from their cathartic, unselfconscious brand of emotional conflagrations to something slower, safer,
    and much less interesting. At five tracks, it's a wonder they aren't
    packaging the album as another EP. Opener ""4's, 5's and the Piano That
    Never Made It Home"" is an eight-minute mini-opera that proudly
    shows its framework. On that track, By the End seem to have overreacted to the
    wild-eyed excess of <i>Fireworks</i>: We hear each instrument clearly, but
    that's because the mix is watery; the band is flawless, but the players sound as if they're afraid of making mistakes.</p><p>
    
    Unlike <i>Fireworks</i>, <i>Tribute to Tigers</i>
    was created in an actual studio; but paradoxically, the
    album sounds more amateurish than its predecessor. The best riffs are often pitted in
    opposite channels, where the guitars feel distended and have trouble
    blending. The boys don't feed off of so much as accede to one another.
    ""7:30 Easter Morning"" hops around a lot, but in a timid manner that's
    less exhilarating than their EP's frenetic perambulations. ""Tigers""
    seems to be what they're driving for: A slow-burning epic that follows
    impulsive instrumental corollaries without losing its focus. Though
    sullied by a somewhat maudlin melody, it's the structural ideal By the
    End of Tonight should try to replicate.</p><p>
    
    Avoiding the stop-on-a-dime changes and gloriously overemphasized
    climaxes that characterized <i>Fireworks</i>, <i>Tribute to Tigers</i> feels waify.
    The album proves that greater cogency doesn't guarantee success; only, perhaps, increased smoothness. When it isn't
    a plain bore, this gentler approach is pacifying--- the band often
    sound like a less stuporous Do Make Say Think-- but ultimately less
    gratifying.</p></div>"|1128.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1128-tribute-to-tigers/|5.7|Sam Ubl

    The band is often described as sexually menacing, but the feeling here is more akin to a couple of best friends who toy with their sexual tension, fully realizing that doing anything about it would ruin everything. <i>No Wow</i> plots the wax and wane of relationships like this, as the duo drop the Velvet Underground curtain and spaz on each other in plain view. On the title track, they're talking shit and issuing challenges: Alison Mosshart scowls, ""You're gonna have to step over my dead body/ Before you walk out that door"" over Jamie Hince's steady rumbles and thrusts, the two taunting each other until the song explodes into a raunchy playfight chant. ""Love Is a Deserter"" threatens the firing squad if someone doesn't ante up, while ""Dead Road 7"" gets sick of the bullshit and shows you the exit sign.</p><p>
    The mothballed drum-machine used on <i>No Wow</i> feels less a Suicide nod than a means to eliminate outside interference. It provides the cool, mechanical pulse for Hince and Mosshart's theatrics without getting in the way like a live drummer would. There's no ""hey, hey guys"" interventions from the dum-dum box, and the little robo-bastard gets his freak on throughout ""The Good Ones"", a pulsating convection whose video has onlookers infected by pink lust at the mere sight and sound of the Kills.</p><p>
    ""I Hate The Way You Love"" and its ""Part 2"" comedown are Hince and Mosshart moving past the pseudo-drama, both attempting to prove each is more over it than the other. The former is a raucous ""whatever"" mock insult; the latter is a sappy, screeching acquittal mantra.</p><p>
    The Kills pay tribute to the Benton Harbor, Mich., Meijer's supermarket on ""At the Back of the Shell"", a handclap-driven exposé of smalltown romantic endeavors. Hince's obsession with a rare Flickinger mixing board that was once coated in Sly Stone's coke rails led the pair to the Lake Michigan town that's as well known for its racist cops as it is for washing machines and Sinbad. Once there, they squatted in a studio and wrote the entire album in just over two weeks. Three weeks later, the record was finished. The expedited process lends <i>No Wow</i> an immediacy and rawness that enhances the band's intention to pare down the sound of their full-length debut <i>Keep On Your Mean Side</i>.</p><p>
    The guns brandished earlier are holstered on ""Rodeo Town"" which is also the first song on the album to let Hince's guitar take a rest. It's country-fried jangle providing Mosshart the opportunity to stretch her vocal chords a bit. Hince's vocals are only separated once on the simmering ""Murdermile"" which also has Mosshart briefly revisiting her wailing days with Discount. Closer ""Ticket Man"" sends the band packing, exhausted and emotionally spent. Over a plodding piano, Mosshart pines, ""Too many tickets is the problem, man/ Too many problems is the ticket in my hand"". It's a fitting end to a fitful tantrum of a record.</p><p>
    The Kills might wear their obsessions on their sleeve, but they wear them with pride. They follow the tradition of the tempestuous male/female sparring of bands like X and Royal Trux with an utterly current sense of uneasy self-awareness. <i>No Wow</i> steps up to the promise of their EPs and debut LP, a boisterous reminder that kids can still hook up to songs that are little more than a guitar and attitude. If that makes the Kills poseurs, they'd probably be the first to admit it.</p></div>"|4427.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4427-no-wow/|8.3|Peter Macia

    The Zutons have had to watch all their positive press be tempered by a slew of comparisons to fellow Liverpool-born, <i>NME</i> darlings the Coral (""cosmic scouse"" is the proper genre name, for those prone to keeping track). Happily, the Zutons' multi-decade larceny is more decisive and inventive than anything the Coral have unleashed: Loopy, spastic, and perpetually impassioned, the Zutons squeal and kick like a scrubbed-up Deadly Snakes, flitting from weird, Devo-inspired disco jerks to steel-led country mourning to sax-driven swamp-funk. Ultimately, all the Zutons and the Coral actually share is a producer (the Fall and Echo and the Bunnyman twiddler Ian Broudie), a label (both are signed to UK indie Deltasonic), and completely incomprehensible accents.</p><p>
    
    Tight and polished, <i>Who Killed...the Zutons</i> lacks a bit of the loose, spiraling vehemence of the band's live show, but vocalist Dave McCabe is so unconscionably prone to moments of unwound ferocity-- twitching and squealing with microphone-eating fervor-- that his shrieks alone are more than enough to make up for the record's otherwise-alienating sheen. Likewise, saxophonist Abi Harding, who seems half-schooled in the finer points of horn-blowing, adds a welcome touch of scrappy grace, tooting with haphazard glee.</p><p>
    
    Packed with cowbell, handclaps, and twitchy disco rhythms, UK single ""Pressure Point"" (which was featured in a Levi's commercial earlier this year, soundtracking a dark-haired heroine's scramble up a tree while a dog chews her pants off), is, like much of who <i>Who Killed...</i>: tense, playful, and vaguely deranged, full of vocal hoots and loose, slinking drums. Opener ""Zuton Fever"" is a brash, self-referential mix of guitar diddles and sax puffs; ""Havana Gang Brawl"", with its urgent ""Where will you sleep tonight?"" queries is all nervous energy, heavy bass, and bleating vocals.</p><p>
<i>Who Killed...the Zutons</i> is an unexpectedly impressive start, consistently showcasing off the band's dynamic songwriting and penchant for weird, sprawling throwdowns-- maybe just enough to transcend all the front page exclamation points.</p></div>"|8961.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8961-who-killedthe-zutons/|7.8|Amanda Petrusich

    paper, folds it, passes it to the next person to do the same, and so on. 
    The result is a collage of words that may or may not make sense, but is bound to be interesting. The approach-- named after one of its first notable results: translated, 
    ""the exquisite corpse shall drink the new wine""-- was also employed by painters, as 
    well. The historically minded Daedelus has used that method to construct his latest album, bringing in a disparate group 
    of artists-- rappers, singers, poets, and producers-- to contribute to 
    his usual palette of whimsical field recordings and 
    downtempo beats.</p><p>
    
    Working with both sonics and language, the LP highlights the power of collage art. On ""Impending Doom"", an appropriately titled collaboration with MF 
    Doom, the emcee does well with Daedelus' irregular beat. Doom sounds comfortable in this setting, and the song's lo-fi sample of 
    swooning strings could have easily 
    slipped onto <em>Madvillainy</em>. Also right at home among Daedelus' 
    vintage soundscapes are rap group CYNE on the 
    slick jazz-rap throwback ""Drops"" and poet Mike Ladd on the coffeehouse thump 
    of ""Welcome Home"" (reprised earlier by Prefuse 73).</p><p>
    
    But as it was with the old word game, the more vivid or unusual your 
    contribution, the better the ""corpse"" collage. When Daedelus is 
    given some linear acoustic guitar picking and vocals from One AM 
    Radio's Hirshikesh Hirway in ""Thanatopsis"", he pulls out an unexpected, fresh 
    vocal sample that blurs the line between scat and Prefuse-style 
    manipulation. ""Now and Sleep"" 
    veers from music-hall piano into harsh, industrial drones, but singer 
    Laura Darling keeps it as soft as a lullaby. And the rappers in TTC 
    would sound strange in any context, but the way they ride that light 
    bell sample in ""Cadavre Exquis"" evokes an ominous, narrow, after-hours Parisian street.</p><p>
    
    For better or worse, Daedelus lets his guests walk all over him, 
    tailoring his compositions around their contributions. Unfortunately, although Daedelus' work is often dynamic, his guest-first approach prevents him
    from moving away from his typical sonic style. The result is an album that's exciting solely because 
    of its guest contributors, but exciting nonetheless.</p></div>"|2132.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2132-exquisite-corpse/|7.1|Jason Crock

    Rounded out by the formidable rhythm section of bassist Ingebrigt Håker Flaten and drummer Paal Nilssen-Love (both members of Mats Gustafsson's the Thing, among countless other credits), Scorch Trio produce a particularly ornery form of incendiary fusion, a hybrid strain that bears nearly as much resemblance to over-driven rock trios like Cream or Band of Gypsies as it does to avant-jazz guitarists such as Sonny Sharrock and Nels Cline. However, thanks in part to the group's extemporaneous recording style, compositional interests get short shrift on <i>Luggumt</i>; instead, the musicians focus almost exclusively on uncorking their inner genies. And though this approach results in some bone-powdering displays of rabid virtuosity and group interplay, it does not do wonders for the album's staying power.</p><p>
    As many guitarists do, Björkheim unabashedly uses Hendrix as his sonic point of disembarkation. This is never more evident than on the 12-minute opening epic ""Kjøle Hole"". Strafing torrents of sparks like an errant tommy gun, Björkheim's playing is an unstoppable natural force, his every rapid-fire note articulated so precisely it sounds as though he's using a straight razor for a pick. A few minutes into this attack his tone takes on an unearthly, almost robotic-sounding distortion. As the track progresses it takes on a pronounced metallic edge, and towards its end there are a couple note-heavy passages that sound similar to Van Halen's ""Eruption""-- a development I didn't exactly find unwelcome.</p><p>
    Elsewhere on <i>Luggumt</i>, the Trio wisely monitor their pace, allowing spacious tracks like ""Synnja Vegga"" and ""Snaeke Rojnd Naevinj"" enough fresh oxygen and legroom that each individual sound is able to appeal for a listener's attention. Throughout the album, Håker Flaten and Nilssen-Love perform yeoman's work to keep the proceedings from collapsing under the considerable weight of Björkheim's onslaught. Nilssen-Love in particular is an utter maniac, never neglecting any portion of his drumkit for any significant length of time (although there are several points when he probably could benefit from being stingier with the cymbals). As often can be the case with live free/improv recordings, <i>Luggumt</i>'s charms are most blisteringly evident on first hearing, and incongruously enough this album is perhaps best enjoyed via infrequent listens, so that the peaks and troughs of the Scorch Trio's rugged topography are better able to retain their moments of unexpected alien beauty.</p></div>"|7804.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7804-luggumt/|6.8|Matthew Murphy

    muttering, ""Who's your daddy?"" in fake British accents, and you know
    they're serious about their raunchy sleazy guitar fucking or else

    These guys will steal your girlfriend and knock her up in your

    sensitive-style, like: ""Hey carrot juice, I wanna squeeze ya every way
    until ya bleed."" That's from their super-rad hit single ""Finding Out

    or the ""About a Million Girls"" song from <em>The Simpsons</em> over the chords from
    Green Day's ""Brain Stew"" played through Jack White's distortion pedals. Plus it has a beat you can dance to, but that's OK because chicks dig that shit.</p><p>
    
    This album has raunchy sleazy guitar solos, like on opener ""Louis XIV"", which sounds like Noel Gallagher fucking AC/DC's
    guest list in assless chaps. Lead Louis man Jason Hill tells
    MTV that I've never heard T. Rex, and of course he's right. I haven't heard Mark E. Smith, either, but my pansy-ass
    neighbor says something called Art Brut ""does more with Smith's
    influence."" Plus, he says make-out anthem ""Marc"" sounds like a Ben Folds post-Five
    piano ballad with delusions of ""Life's a Gas""-like grandeur instead of
    humor or melodicism. Twerp doesn't get half the tang I do,
    though. Rawk!</p><p>
    
    These songs have lyrics that don't have to make sense because the guy
    singing them is too busy with raunchy sleazy fucking for all that
    shit; lines like ""you said so in a letter that said return to sender, my
    illegally illegal tender."" Timeless, yes, but Hill's words are
    time<em>ly</em>, too: ""weapon of mass destruction"" in a rawk song? What
    next? There's also an instrumental, ""Louis Reprise"", which starts like
    the Beatles' ""The End"" from Dad's classic rock station but swerves
    into fiddles and horns, like a more frat-ready Dave Matthews Band, whose concert last year almost got me stoned and laid, so whatever.

In fact, the only song I remember them playing was ""Happy Birthday"". It's surprising that the Flaming Lips don't spend more time making lifestyle accessories; I'd pay top dollar for a day-glo pink inflatable recliner that comes with its own light show!</p><p>
    This new mix disc, assembled for Azuli's <em>LateNightTales</em> series, is a perfect example of Lips-branded atmosphere. The album does more than showcase the band's taste in classic and contemporary pop; it sets a precise and peculiar mood, a kind of late-night sensation that's weightless but not silly, and askew but not deranged. Most of the tunes sound like they were made out of yawns, smoke, and sighs, and aside from a couple of bumps, it's an indisputable post-party mix.</p><p>
    Oddly, the songs that least belong are the exclusive recordings. David Shirgley's ""The Jist"", a disturbing spoken word piece that feels like pure stoner talk, closes the album and overrides what could have been a blissful send-off courtesy of Brian Eno's ""Another Green World"". The other curveball is the Flaming Lips' cover of the White Stripes' ""Seven Nation Army"", a piece of sonic hostility with sirens, fuzzed-out riffs, and Coyne emoting through a megaphone. It's cartoonishly effective and less terse and gritty than the Stripes' original, but this isn't the side of the band you'd expect to hear on this mix; it's a nice hook for collectors, but not essential by itself. (You can hear the single at the start of their promotional Radio Mix, found online <a href=""http://www.azulishop.com/media/wma/FlamingLipsRadioMix1.wax"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><u>here</u></a>.)</p><p>
    The rest of the album is damn near sublime. Björk's ""Unravel"" ushers us in, and then gently segues to 
    the champagne music of Miles Davis playing Gershwin's ""My Ship"". Sexual urges are sublimated throughout the album, evoking the late-night making out that it was built to soundtrack; on ""Speed of Sound"", Chris Bell makes a lyric about not getting laid sound like the ballad of the unknown soldier, while Nick Drake's ""River Man"" is a little too obviously the song where you should lean over and make your move.</p><p>
    The Lips know how to use each song to bring out what's strange or special about the others, so that 10cc's ""I'm Not In Love"" sounds far more psychedelic here than it ever did on your mom's AM radio, and Radiohead's ""Pyramid Song"" shakes off any of the studied chilliness it absorbed from <i>Amnesiac</i>. And the album's good-natured, fun-and-shiny undercurrent explodes in cuts by the Chameleons and the Psychedelic Furs, which prove once again that you could make a mix disc 
    for a funeral and there'd still be room for 1980s new wave.</p><p>
    While the promotion for this album emphasizes how many years and styles it spans, anyone who's made an eclectic mix knows that finding what the songs have in common is more important than emphasizing what sets them apart. This record is perfect for the end of a night when the lines are getting blurry and no one has to move, or drive home, or even get up from where they're lying in the back yard, while the last strains of Eno greet the first bleed of dawn: What's this bubble we've landed in, and why does it ever have to burst?</p></div>"|3087.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3087-latenighttales/|7.6|Chris Dahlen

That said, there is also a certain power in veering off into tangents, forcing a listener to follow stories and thoughts as they drift. Regan Farquhar (Busdriver) is an ace at tangents. On ""Unemployed Black Astronaut"", the MC begins by announcing, ""It's the resurgence of the happy black rappers."" He then sub-sonically narrates his rise to minor stardom as a rapper before reminding everyone that he is the first black astronaut to land on the moon in a hot-air balloon. Our man then blathers about rewriting Hollywood flicks to not have black men die in their opening scenes, telling of Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons players mowing lawns for a living, comparing himself to the best of the <em>Krush Groove</em> DVD, and living off of chicken pot pies as he is a mere tax write-off for his record label. <i>Fear of a Black Tangent</i>, he calls his power.</p><p>
    
    As heard in his last joint, <em>Cosmic Cleavage</em>, Farquhar continues his persona as a loser who chases his demons on a public bus or in a subway station. He typically sounds like David Allan Grier with amyl nitrate in the air. Our man raps in an ""ohmygawd this is sooo ridiculous"" tone that can make you either think he is a jackass or a jester. My instincts say it's the latter. Hell, on his self-introduction, ""Yawning Zeitgeist Intro (Freestyle)"", he says, ""Now, some of your friends will reboot and do a Google search and will be discouraged that the truth will hurt when they see that I'm not their zeitgeist, nor am I Christ-like, nor do I dislike whites. I just want a better chance as, most likely, I'll sell more records in France."" Amen.</p><p> 
    
    Daedelus, Omid, Nobody, Prefuse 73, and even Danger Mouse leave their fingerprints on the album's loose production, which samples everything from gothic, Aquarius-age organs and Roosevelt-era swing jaunts to Spaghetti Western ballads. Farquhar is a Charlie Brown of sorts, blaming artistic shortcoming on lousy choices (""What kind of name is Busdriver? Is it just a wack allegory? And can't it be justified by any background story?""). He cries that his music only appeals to ""hipsters dress like Russian spies."" Farquhar's self-loathing comes dangerously close to being wearisome until ""Befriend the Friendless Friendster"" kicks in, as he sing-raps and tap-dances with Irving Berlin on the gawddamn Ritz. And then there is the closer, ""Lefty's Lament"", where he retires in an elephant's graveyard of the American left wing. Poor sod.</p></div>"|1033.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1033-fear-of-a-black-tangent/|7.9|Cameron Macdonald

On her fourth album, <em>The Golden State</em>, she put herself in the hands of producer Mitchell Froom, a man not exactly known for musical restraint. In conjunction with Todd and co-producer Yves Beauvais, Froom decorated the album (containing both new and old songs) with ornate, luxurious arrangements that at once pushed things forward while remaining true to the unadorned heart of Todd's music. Though that record seemed superficially like a departure from her previous work, it fit in just fine with what preceded. For her newest album, <em>Manzanita</em>, Todd tried a different tact-- instead of gussying up her usual types of songs, she takes the opportunity to digress in unexpected directions, with equally unexpected results.</p><p>
    Opener and Dead Meadow collaboration ""The Way"" is a psych-damaged protest song that would probably be better served in the hands of a histrionic harpy like Grace Slick. As is, Todd's plaintive pleas (""seems like paradise is lost and won't be found"") clash with the backwards guitars and the double-bass action. The lukewarm reggae workout ""Casa Nova"" is an even weaker genre exercise. More successful are excursions into Bacharachian horn and string charts (on ""The Last Night of Winter"") and flamenco-styled guitar strumming (on ""Tongue-Tied"").</p><p>
    The high points of the album are the tracks that feature Todd by herself either on guitar or piano, filling the song with the trembling strength of her singing. Of course, mileage may vary concerning her lyrics, which can err on the side of simplicity and cliché redemption (""All the butterflies rise to the surface/ I say stupid things when I get nervous""). Her poetic voice is strongest when the words state their intentions in concise yet inventive ways (""We kiss for the first time, our lips and tongues tied in fitness, infiniteness""), or she finds contentment in the wonder of the everyday (""We woke up from dreams/ Took turns at the sink/ We crawl back into bed"").</p><p>
    No doubt Mia Doi Todd's music is an acquired taste-- as offered in her press clippings, reactions range from orgiastic fawning (""[l]ike a 21st century Yeats she transforms our species' dilemmas, follies, and misery into cathartic beauty"") to unapologetic brusqueness (""jaw-droppingly pretentious""). Somewhere in between those two poles is a center where Todd's particular charms can be appreciated with the requisite grain of salt. While <em>Manzanita</em> tries to add more spice and panache to Todd's folk-flavored brew, the album works best when it stays true to the original recipe.</p></div>"|8092.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8092-manzanita/|6.9|David Raposa

Prenatalism is the new
    futurism (which is also the old postnatalism): drummers yearn for
    their first belly kick, vox chicks their primal scream. A cough's a
    far cry from a scream-- heyo-- but like Schjeldahl said in praise of
    Twombly, this Chicago six-piece had to work pretty damn hard to sound
    so effectively purposeless, so magically prehumanstinctual. 'Nother
    words: baby Swans.</p><p>
    
    Coughs are loud and droney and noise-bursty and the female lead singer
    sounds like Kim Deal (obviously). But unlike a lot of
    these amniotic noise-is-the-next-frontier ballsacs Coughs stay in the
    crib, drooling over their own toddler rhymes and popping off the milky
    noise teat we call time signatures, somehow never giving up the
    charade (except once, I'll get to it, something about a banjo). Even
    the alphabetical song ordering smells like Gerber baby: as if Coughs
    just greened out the tracks and Ma Load had to sequence them, aka
    the noise label diaper wipe.</p><p>
    
    I know I'm making everything this band does sound so dreadfully
    important. Truth is most songs on <i>Fright Makes Right</i> are not
    hard-passed shits but gratuitous giggles. String out a Zulu Nation
    break and tap that <i>Lord of the Flies</i> beast called men's
    predisposition to backyard evil (""I killed a snake today!"" shout
    Coughs)-- that song's called ""Garter Snake"". ""Give Peace a Chance""
    goes ""Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!""; ""Mail Order"" goes ""Stay in your
    house/ Never come out!""; ""Starchitect"" goes ""Frank Lloyd Wright!
    You're all right! I.M. Pei! You're OK!"" (Pei is ""pay,"" not ""pee""
    didyaknow?). My favorite of this sort is Coughs' same-titled homage to
    Schoolhouse Rock's ""I'm Just a Bill"": The bill's vicious taunt, ""We're
    the architects of society!"" plays on the album title all too well-- if
    Bob Dorough had been covered by Josef Mengele.</p><p>
    
    There's a saxophone, too. With such a fine line between virtuosity and
    complete horseshit (yes you, Coltrane), over time the instrument has
    rightfully secured a spot as incomprehensibility's choice musical
    avatar. First-lesson squawks and third-lesson flourishes stripe the
    disc, but Coughs totally tow the line on ""Elephant""-- with its reedy
    whole-note slams, East London cocked back guitar needling, and Ashlee
    pre-studio vocal-- and ""Narwahl"", a pleasant Sonic Youth rip.</p><p>
    
    But let's talk about this banjo track. It's called ""Come Back to Me"",
    and like any banjo track it's simultaneously the best and worst track
    on the album. Best, because it's meant to be the best-- here Coughs
    freakfolk and sungtong counterpoint to the delight of us kids who
    didn't even know about Brian Wilson until last year. Worst though,
    because, as Glenn McDonald felt about ""One With the Freaks"" on the
    Notwist's <i>Neon Golden</i>, the song becomes <i>Fright Makes
    Right</i>'s reverse blackhole, a pop gem that robs Coughs of their
    rub, the how-to magic show that betrays their sleights of hand.
    Coughs, cough, get in my belly.</p></div>"|1797.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1797-fright-makes-right/|6.5|Nick Sylvester

They're geekier than video game cover bands. Even geekier than geek rock. When they're not sitting in their bedrooms memorizing scales and modes, they're performing finger exercises to increase things like pinky strength and pick speed. Behind every ass-kicking riff lies about a dozen years of neo-classical guitar lessons and privately-tutored ear training. On Behold...the Arctopus's second EP, <em>Nano-Nucleonic Cyborg Summoning</em>, the New York trio showcases years of extensive schooling on three incredibly dense prog-metal opuses, hardly coming up for air over the course of a furious 17-minute span.</p><p>
    
    At the epicenter of this metal maelstrom is the touch guitar, or as Arctopus touch ax-man Colin Marston calls it, the ""12-string Hell-harp."" The monstrosity spans the range of both bass and guitar and its fret-tap friendly design would make any guitar shop employee shit his pants. But enough advertising, how valuable is this thing musically? Sure, Marston can bend, tap, trill, slap, and pluck to his heart's content, but as Steve Vai and Yngwie Malmsteem have demonstrated time and time again, technical prowess isn't necessarily equated with aesthetic success.</p><p>
    
    For several instances on opener ""Exospacial Psionic Aura"", Marston and company appear to buck this trend. The jazz breakdowns, blistering arpeggios, and almost-catchy outro make it worth waiting through entire minutes of mindless Mixolydian mode improvising. Unfortunately, the band blows their load early here, leaving little creativity for the remaining two tracks. Frenetic pick scrapes and blitzkrieg cymbal crashes at 180 BPM can get awfully tedious after 17 minutes, and excepting the occasional acid-rock interlude, this is all the Arctopus pumps out.</p><p>
    
    Metal-shredding guitars and machine-gun drumming should never become boring, but sadly the band's affinity for mathematical riffing and technical showmanship suck out all the fun. For a band whose moniker is a command, the Arctopus come off as pretty lackluster. And as for the ""12-string Hell-harp,"" I haven't seen ax gear this ridiculous since Spinal Tap's amps went to 11.</p></div>"|1152.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1152-nano-nucleonic-cyborg-summoning-ep/|5.1|Adam Moerder

    as the longest dry spell of new Ian MacKaye material in his storied, 20-plus year recording career.  The Fugazi faithful,
    however, will be continuing their patient vigil for fresh music from the full group: MacKaye has instead turned his eye--
    at least for now-- to a new project, the Evens.</p><p>
    
    A duo comprised of MacKaye and former Warmers drummer/vocalist Amy Farina, the Evens distill Fugazi's familiar locomotive
    post-hardcore down to its barest essentials.  Utilizing casually rich vocal harmonies and the bubbling warmth of baritone
    guitar, the Evens re-address the steadfast themes of MacKaye's work dating back to his Minor Threat days: contempt for
    the tyranny of petty authority, dismay at the disintegration of local community, and a passionate conviction in critical
    thinking and self-reliance.  But thanks to the intimacy of the Evens' approach (as well as to their impressively
    well-developed melodic sensibilities), the album displays a beguiling tenderness not often present in MacKaye's previous
    efforts, a laid-back, disarming sweetness that causes the Evens' eponymous debut to feel like his most personal work to
    date.</p><p>
<i>The Evens</i> positively brims with revelations, not least of which is the consistent effectiveness of MacKaye's
    singing voice.  Though melodic Fugazi tracks like <i>The Argument</i>'s ""Cashout"" or ""I'm So Tired"" from the <i>Instrument</i>
    soundtrack have hinted at the broader possibilities of his vocal range, his work here represents the first time he's
    wholly abandoned his trademark rottweiler bark for an album's entirety.  Here his vocals are particularly appealing
    when closely coupled with Farina's, whose bracingly cloudless voice proves to be an ideal match for MacKaye's weathered,
    pliable delivery.</p><p>
    
    Farina, however, is far from merely MacKaye's supporting player, and thoroughly establishes herself as a fully vested
    partner.  Her lead vocals on tracks like ""Around the Corner"" and ""If It's Water"" spur pleasant memories of the early-90s
    heyday of femme-led indie outfits like Tsunami or Scrawl, and her inventive, textured percussion serves to remind the
    listener how boring and perfunctory the majority of rock-based drumming actually is.  When paired with MacKaye's
    restless, rumbling baritone guitar, her low-lit drumming can cast tracks (particularly ""Sara Lee"" or ""Minding One's
    Business"") in alluring, almost Tortoise-like post-rock hues, which provides the album with incredibly vivid depth of
    field, despite the duo's simplified, modest palette.</p><p>
    
    Though powerhouse tracks like ""All These Governors"" and ""You Won't Feel a Thing"" pack the strongest initial mule-kick
    (closely related to such Fugazi anthems like ""Keep Your Eyes Open"" or ""Great Cop"", both songs come equipped with
    classically direct MacKaye choruses like, ""They'll beat you with the truth so you won't feel the lies"") many of
    <i>The Evens</i>' most memorable moments occur within the intimate portraiture of ""Blessed Not Lucky,"" or the opening
    ""Shelter Two"". Cataloging the minute details of a new relationship, ""Shelter Two"" makes a trip to the hardware store
    sound like high adventure, as MacKaye and Farina sing, ""We keep on climbing but we never find the top/ It's all downhill
    from here,"" in untailored Exene-and-John Doe harmonies, sweetly punctuating the importance of these crucial, seemingly
    trivial moments that so often comprise the highlights of our lives.</p><p>
    
    There are occasions when the album too closely resembles the skeletal, unfinished demos that bulked up the <i>Instrument</i>
    soundtrack, and others where one can't help but imagine how Fugazi might've handled these songs. (I suspect the Canty/Lally
    rhythm section could absolutely pulverize ""You Won't Feel a Thing"" in a live context-- or at least I'd like to hear them
    try.)  Ultimately, though, this eponymous debut not only introduces the Evens as a wholly distinct and vital group, but
    also contains performances that MacKaye would likely have been unable to deliver in any other context.</p></div>"|2917.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2917-the-evens/|8.0|Matthew Murphy

I don't know what that's called. But my mother has Munchausen Syndrome and tried to diagnose me with it last year. I think she called it scabies or something. But it turns out I just had ashy legs. So whatever my mother thought I had, Lib certainly got it bad.</p><p>To be fair, we all have it. A restless, churning in our bellies to produce and/or download more music than is humanly possible to process and to share our discoveries with the world. So then we start mp3 blogs to serve as a testimony for how dedicated musicheads we are and how we have a lot of rare shit to drop on everyone.

The exclusives range from the tek-ridden staccato refreak of Madvillain's ""Money Folder"" to a spitfire phantom organ dirge from Diverse on the unreleased ""Space Goat"". And to think the Japanese have been hoarding this stuff since last summer...</p><p> Moreover, Madlib's remixes push his differing tastes in hip-hop through his personal beat appliances. As he's done with the bootleg <em>Remixes</em> 12"", Lib adds a patented new spin on classics and unclassics alike. So Mash Out Posse gets dressed up with a sinister juxtaposition: vaudeville keys and whip-snapping snares to evince Fame and Danzenie fiery verses on ""Stomp the Shit Out You"". Meanwhile, he reworks ""Who You Be"" from N.J. supercrew The Outsidaz with a laquered blip and ghastly organ without losing any of the energy from Red, Zee, or Pacewon's verbal claps. </p><p> <em>Volume 2</em> is less Madlib the producer than Madlib the listener. It's all straightforward funk and breaks from Madlib's crates including some classic material from Henry Franklin, Elvin Jones, Marcos Valle, and Pharoah Sanders.</p><p> As a fan, Madlib's prolific nature is perfect satiation. Everything he thinks he releases, allowing diehards and admirers tremendous insight and perspective into his workings.

    from Kansas City-- John Upchurch, Barry Phipps, Mark Greenberg, and Archer Prewitt-- whose music didn't fit any category
    even when it veered close to one.  They dressed in matching yellow tuxedos, designed and printed their own ultra-retro
    concert posters, and wrapped their releases in packaging that looked alternately like something from the 50s Blue Note
    catalog or something from the coolest thrift store in the universe.  The garish tuxes eventually became more stylish
    suits and the band uprooted for Chicago, where they established themselves as regulars at the legendary Lounge Ax venue
    (R.I.P.) and convinced the old Wax Trax! record store (R.I.P.) to let them erect three-foot-tall effigies of themselves
    in the front display window to promote their first album.  (Those same papier mache figures now overlook the bar at
    Empty Bottle.)</p><p>
    
    From their loft space, they ran two record labels-- Hi-Ball for their vinyl releases, Carrot Top for their CDs-- and
    recorded on old analog equipment with a menagerie of instruments that would make any instrument fetishist plotz.  They
    were equally comfortable playing weddings or opening for Shellac or the Skatalites-- among the many great concert posters
    included in the liners of <i>Popcorn Box Box</i>, their new three-disc round-up of rarities, unreleased material, and select
    album cuts, is one that shows them opening for some band named Corndolly, with Liz Phair third on the bill.</p><p>
    
    What's really remarkable about the Coctails, as this set amply demonstrates, is that in a decade when facelessness and
    a supposed lack of affect ruled the underground, and anonymous post-rock collectives lumbered their way to shining
    reviews, they made their faces into Beatlesque icons, wore their personalities on their sleeves, embraced comic book
    art and toys as promotional devices, and exuded humor, unfettered creativity, and high spirits.</p><p>
    
    People try to point to the Coctails as a precedent for the regrettable lounge revival, but as this compilation attests,
    they aren't so easily pigeonholed: These guys interpreted Sun Ra, took the occasional turn into garage mayhem, recorded
    a superb album of alternately weird and elegiac jazz (<i>Long Sound</i>), cut holiday and children's records, covered
    Raymond Scott's cartoon scores, and set an excerpt of Samuel Beckett's <i>Waiting for Godot</i> to music. <i>Popcorn Box</i>
    takes in most of this over the course of its three-plus hour runtime, cleaning out the vaults of worthy unreleased stuff
    and filling in the blanks for fans who can't locate the limited-run vinyl-only EPs and numerous compilation tracks the
    Coctails released in their six years together. It also does a nice job of not duplicating the band's other set of
    rarities and album tracks, <i>The Early Hi-Ball Years</i>, and offers just about anything you could reasonably ask of
    liner notes: archival photographs, album art, comic strips, concert posters, tracks notes with comments from the band,
    and a couple of heartfelt essays from Coctails associates and admirers.</p><p>
    
    Though it does an excellent job of scraping together a huge amount of often difficult to find material, <i>Popcorn Box</i>
    is obviously not for everyone-- some people will find the abstract jazz that dominates disc three impossible to sit
    through, while others with be put off by the guileless goofing off of tracks like ""Donut Shoppe"" (""Pirates run the
    donut shoppe.../ They used to have a pirate ship but it sank"") and ""Abba-Dabba-Do-Dance"", a truly weird surf blues
    featuring lead vocals by a friend of the group that ends with the band collapsing in laughter. But lovers of pure sound
    will find plenty to embrace, from the interesting horn arrangements that populate the majority of the tracks to the
    heavenly bowed vibraphone of ""City Sun"" to the pretty jazz ballad ""Marseilles"" to the bastard klezmer touches that
    color much of disc two.</p><p>
    
    Previously unreleased tracks like the crazy percussion, marimba, and sax (two of which Upchurch plays simultaneously)
    pile-up ""Skeleton Bones"", or the great surf-inflected pop song ""Hey Ho"", recorded at a ""beach party"" in the band's loft
    space, should be all the incentive fans of the band need to drop dime on this-- though there's plenty of added value for
    those who still need some convincing.  The six-song EP of freaky, richly detailed instrumentals they recorded for John
    Flansburgh's Hello Records Club has been out of print for ages and makes a welcome return in its original running order
    at the beginning of disc one. It's actually one of their most solid, cohesive releases, immediately illustrating that
    the band's utilization of theremin, marimba, banjo, musical saw, and bass clarinet was never a gimmick, but rather a
    means to an end.</p><p>
    
    That end is some of the most memorably loopy music in recent memory, a good time that wasn't afraid to play with
    dissonance or experiment with free jazz-based open melodic structure.  Newcomers (most likely curious fans of Prewitt's
    solo work or the Sea &amp; Cake) probably shouldn't start by tackling this box, which seems aimed at established fans--
    <i>Peel</i> or <i>The Early Hi-Ball Years</i> are better starting points, or <i>Long Sound</i> for those more interested
    in the band's jazz leanings.  For those who try it with open and eager ears, though, <i>Popcorn Box</i> is a rewarding look
    back at a truly singular band.</p></div>"|1796.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1796-popcorn-box/|7.4|Joe Tangari

They love hangar-sized, doomy, simple melodies played slooooooow, on Rapmaster keyboards that've spent some time in the shed with dad's Krylon. It's not scary or menacing but vaguely silly-- huge synths cycling in midair, sour and sagging. Not for nothing does MC Tinchy Strider politely suggest on ""Move"" that you bang your head. They probably picked it up through some perverted polyglot of drum &amp; bass smog riffs and southern rap's Trans-Euro affectations. Wherever they got it, they may be the first act to come pre-screwed. (Blame English socialized medicine or the sleepytime effects of steak and kidney pie.)</p><p>
    
    They also love silly bells-and-whistles-style tracks like ""Dirty"", featuring the first digitized slide whistle in history. (Hold tight MC Harpo.) These are really throwbacks to batshit hardcore bricolage like Hyper-On Experience's ""Imajika"" (""What's Opera, Doc?"" remade by Davy DMX). Grime's dirty little secret is that it's easier to sell column inches presenting East London as Bartertown 2.0 than admit that frothiness, sweetness, and hope are key parts of its experience. (Not that the MCs help destroy the illusion: Yeah, you're Pablo Escobar in a country with the same gun crime rate as Guam.)</p><p>
    
    The problem with <i>Guns &amp; Roses</i> is that there just aren't enough Ruff Sqwad tracks. For a putative calling card from one of the most powerful crews around, this thing is stuffed bow-to-stern (geddit?) with U.S. rap instrumentals. Grime crews have inscrutable taste in U.S. rap: Do they really listen to their own music and hear Ludacris' ""Splash Waterfalls"" or Black Rob's ""Whoa""? I thought grime was supposed to wipe away Brit-rap's presupposed serfdom to <i>Source</i>/<i>Vibe</i> rules. Grime people: The next time you look to our shores, throw on ""Crunk Music"" or ""Put Your Hood Up"" at +8 and go nuts.</p><p>
    
    Alternately, you could just have faith in the spanking quality of your own music and say, ""fuck you very much"" to a country who doesn't know Dirty Danger from Dame Edna. (Also, could I ask for a moratorium on the sex raps? I don't need to know Oliver Twist's skeeting habits.) They could be saving their best stuff (wot, no ""Anna""?) for the always-promised debut album, thereby considerably devaluing the eBay vultures of 2015. (Not that it did Wiley any good: Nine hundred forty copies, you fuckers!) Bottom line is that you need to at least hear this if you're at all interested in grime, aka the most exciting music on the planet right now. (What else do you have to show for yourselves? The Paw Paw Bears playing courtly lute? Your banging fax machine?) Just be prepared for a national crisis of confidence to the sound of Philly's Most Wanted.</p></div>"|6942.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6942-guns-roses/|7.2|Jess Harvell

Early entries included EPs by NoMeansNo, Guv'ner, and June of 44, but soon, the series evolved into a collaborative space, and counterintuitive pairings took over: Tortoise and the Ex, the Black Heart Procession and Solbakken, Low and Dirty Three (okay, that one isn't so counterintuitive).</p><p>
    
    Karate's <em>In the Fishtank</em> EP brings the series full circle: They ""collaborate"" with Billie Holiday, the Band, Mark Hollis, and the Minutemen by covering them on this politically charged karaoke bash. It takes some balls to tackle such iconic songs, especially since Karate's versions of them are so straightforward and faithful. Or we could be cynical and call it stacking the deck: Short of reworking them as ska-punk anthems, is it even possible to make unpleasant versions of ""Strange Fruit"" or ""Tears of Rage""?</p><p>
    
    Without revising the originals, Karate nudges them toward their own style-- a bit anesthetized, with a chilly precision bordering on blandness. The EP's breezy yet solemn demeanor seems to portend <em>Pockets</em>, which this EP was recorded right before, and their political themes would recur on <em>Pockets</em> songs like ""The State I'm in aka Goode Buy From Cobb's Creek Park"".</p><p>
    
    Geoff Farina's singing is winningly elegant, but can be tough to reconcile with the real deals: Like a thick quilt laid across them, it only traces the broadest contours of Holiday's sweetly sinister warble on ""Strange Fruit"", Richard Manuel's soulful, honeyed drawl (or Dylan's magnetic rasp, depending on whether you take your ""Tears of Rage"" from <em>The Basement Tapes</em> or the Band's debut, <em>Music from Big Pink</em>), and Mike Watt's gruff bark on Minutemen covers like ""Bob Dylan Wrote Propaganda Songs"" and ""Only Minority"".</p><p>
    
    But the ominous poignancy of Holiday's lynching lament remains intact, as Farina intones over shimmering chords and a liquid lead: ""Southern trees bear strange fruit/ Blood on the leaves and blood on the root."" And the Minutemen covers break up the dirges with up-tempo, jazzy pep talks for the workin' man. The only real downer is a ponderous cover of Talk Talk singer Mark Hollis's ""New Jerusalem"" that sheds some of the original's fragility in favor of overstated reverb chords and deliberate, melodramatic drums. It's the only song on the EP that eschews concise reproduction, and drives home the soundness of Karate's decision to play the others accurately, even if the end result may have you digging out your copy of <em>What Makes a Man Start Fires</em> for a sip of the source waters after a few spins.</p></div>"|4388.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4388-in-the-fishtank-12-ep/|6.8|Brian Howe

These efforts are often stylistic tangents, 
    and while they can painfully suck-- proving that a good band is more than 
    the sum of parts-- it's occasionally exciting to hear that songwriter's 
    voice in a different context.</p><p>
    
    That's not true here. Marbles was Robert Schneider's original recording 
    moniker before he formed the Apples in Stereo, cranking out 
    sloppy-but-charming four-track Beach Boys tributes that were compiled for 1997's 
    <em>Pyramid Landing and Other Favorites</em>. <em>Expo</em>, however, is a 
    planned and calculated Marbles full-length, recorded in the same room as 
    <em>Pet Sounds</em> was, and mixed by the same engineer as Brian Wilson's 
    revived <em>Smile</em> (Cello Studios and Mark Linnett, respectively). But 
    instead of the <i>Smile</i>-stalking you'd expect from a guy who is known to have obsessively studied Wilson's studio techniques, <em>Expo</em> sounds like ELO via Gary Numan, with 
    anachronistic electronic embellishments applied to inoffensive lite-FM melodies.</p><p>
    
    While 
    criticising the leader of the Apples in Stereo for sounding 
    ""cartoonish"" 
    would be ridiculous, his typically quirkly affectations are unbearable 
    here, outside their usual rock context. ""Out of Zone"" has simple 
    guitar lines and sheets of electronic drums and effects, over 
    which Schneider harmonizes with himself on a breezy melody. It's characterized by 
    meaningless lyrics that seem to exist only for the sake of rhyming, overbearing 
    vocal effects, and outmoded production gimmicks. And this is one of 
    <i>Expo</i>'s catchiest songs.</p><p>
    
    Elsewhere, ""Jewel of India""-- one of the record's three instrumental 
    pieces-- was probably meant to evoke foreign landscapes, but its horn 
    melody sounds more like a Casio PT-10. 
    That and the blissed-out nature boy anthem ""Hello Sun"" sound like 
    incidental music from <em>Cannibal: The Musical</em> without the intended 
    humor. Later songs like ""Cruel Sound"" aren't as cluttered, but 
    recall B-sides from the Apples' later work. At least 
    this album is brief.</p></div>"|5642.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5642-expo/|5.0|Jason Crock

    same station that he wouldn't mind recording with some of 50's sworn enemies (namely Nas and Jadakiss). Shortly
    thereafter, a young man was shot non-fatally in the leg at Hot 97, while 50 was still on-air, and gunfire was
    purportedly heard outside the offices of Violator, 50's management. That he started flexing his godfatherish persona
    mere days before he dropped <i>The Massacre</i> led some to speculate whether the whole thing was one ill-advised
    publicity stunt meant to invigorate his buzz and boost sales. As if to confirm the hunch, according to allhiphop.com,
    a week later, 50 was downplaying the whole ordeal, telling ""106 &amp; Park"", ""A lot of things you hear out there is being
    said for shock value and not really as serious as people make it out to be.""</p><p>
    
    Bullets don't joke. But while the ""publicity stunt"" analysis underestimates code of honor (and overestimates 50's and
    Game's collective rationality), you can't fault a kid for thinking like that. <i>The Massacre</i>, after all, tails
    50's stratospherically successful <i>Get Rich or Die Tryin'</i> (which has thus far sold over 11 million copies); its
    release date had already been pushed back a month, and the two singles prefacing <i>The Massacre</i>-- ""Disco Inferno"" and ""Candy Shop""-- are flaccid reprises of other tracks both in beats and in timbre. (The former, of
    Lloyd Banks' ""On Fire"", beats by Eminem; the latter, 50 and Lil' Kim's ""Magic Stick"".).</p><p>
    
    It's ironic that some of 50's best verses right now are his guest spots on The Game's <i>The Documentary</i> (particularly
    ""Hate It or Love It"" and ""How We Do""). The man's underperforming lyrically on <i>The Massacre</i>, but he stretches and
    croons and assures us a $50-million paycheck and a gigantic mansion in Connecticut have not expired his steely street
    soldiering: He's riding on the narrative and tough-mugging that got him here. And yet, <i>The Massacre</i>'s best tracks
    have 50 dropping club-clatter and gangster lean to show us the mind behind the six-pack, gat, and Teflon.</p><p>
    
    Clued in by an intro skit in which a sweet-sounding young damsel receiving a Valentine gets blasted by bullet-spray, we
    get it: 1) He's rich, and 2) He'll get you first. This is 50's massacre, no mercy. Scarface is in da club. It's followed
    by a series of guttural threats and luggish offerings to snuff anyone to save face-- ""y'all know what I'm about,"" 50
    reminds us more than once.  And in case we don't, he hits us with indelible, existential gloom, especially on ""This
    is 50""'s ominous piano plinking and the funereal low-end synths of ""I'm Supposed to Die Tonight"", where his warnings
    are cut directly from mobster cinema: ""Don't be stupid, find out who you fuckin with, son/ 'Fore we find out where yo'
    bitch get her hair and nails done/ It's elementary, life is but a dream/ You know, row row your boat/ Your blood forms
    a stream.""</p><p>
    
    Delving further into his macabre imagination, the lyrically weak ""Piggy Bank"" lets up for comic relief, poking half-assedly
    at Jadakiss, Nas, Kelis, and Ja Rule, framed in a sort of ""nanny-nanny-boo-boo"" chorus for the ridonkulously wealthy.
    Dissing Fat Joe, he stumbles into the feeble line, ""That fat nigga thought 'Lean Back' was 'In Da Club'/ My shit sold
    11 mil/ His shit was a dud,"" after which the hook bragging ""yeah yeah mo' money mo'money,"" creates a reasonable facsimile
    of oinking. He taunts everyone in the outro: ""Y'all gotta do something now... everybody's watching... rep your hood,
    nigga,"" whilst laughing maniacally; for a minute it's not far-off to think 50 has, in fact, gone bat-crazy, aiming
    groin-level at kids who aren't even trying to pitch on his same baseball diamond. (The ill-advised ""Gatman and Robbin'""
    doesn't help; it imagines 50 and Eminem as impenetrable badass-scrappers but goofs more like an animated comedy skit
    for ""Saturday Night Live"".)</p><p>
    
    As if to temper ""Piggy""'s mouthy smack-starting, he slips into his easy Casanova on tracks like the Jamie Foxx-assisted
    ""Build You Up"" and ""So Amazing""; as many reviewers and 50 himself will tell you, a good majority of <i>The Massacre</i>
    is ""for the ladies"" (and they are, if you're a lady who enjoys being ordered into cars or spoon-fed pretend-niceties in
    order to get in your pants). Starting with ""Ski Mask Way"", though, the tide shifts. Ghettotech impresario Disco D's
    production kicks off a three-track oasis of dynamic soul samples and moody rhythm in a tumultuous sea of gunshot-echoing
    beats; 50's tone softens for a cluster of phenomenal introspective tracks, like the unexpectedly sweet ""God Gave Me
    Style"" and ""A Baltimore Love Thing"". On the excellent, muted ""Ryder Music"", he's rapping about himself, as ever, but
    his tone is intimate and, for once, the man sounds vulnerable. In the final verse, he says, ""In '99 I had a vision and
    made a decision/ Being broke is against my religion/ Now I picked up/ What?"" Defiant, 50 found his win, and damned if
    he's giving it up-- but that he's got an Achilles Heel and willing to show it means he's more powerful than we can even
    fathom. There's your superhero track.</p></div>"|3046.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3046-the-massacre/|7.0|Julianne Shepherd

    Converge are just a bunch of dudes with guitars. Oh, but they're not.
    They're good at deceiving us: What hits the tongue like straight
    blitzkrieg metal leaves a peculiar aftertaste.</p><p>
    It isn't always easy to find the mosh-pulse at the center of <i>You Fail
    Me</i>, Converge's seventh and definitive album, so unless you don't mind
    a stiff neck, you might want to internalize these songs before rushing
    out to the band's live show. Converge are some of the most fearsome
    technicians in metal, but unlike Dillinger Escape Plan, whose songs
    are like feats of 22nd-century civic engineering, they're unusually
    organic. <i>You Fail Me</i> is all hardscrabble local hardcore in its gritty
    viscera.</p><p>
    Ever maturing and honing, Converge have maintained a fairly consistent
    sound over their nearly 15-year career, so how does <i>You Fail Me</i>
    differ from cult classics such as <i>Jane Doe</i> and <i>When Forever Comes
    Crashing</i>? For one, the band have jumped ship from Equal Vision Records-- a veritable subterranean hardcore dynasty and Converge's home for
    the better part of the last half-decade-- to quasi-major Epitaph. <i>You
    Fail Me</i> is a more polished album, but this
    works to their advantage: Not only have Converge retained (even
    sharpened) their razorblade cut, they're now bolstered by a brawny
    low-end. Jacob Bannon's vocals are mixed lower than on previous
    efforts-- a popular metal technique-- and though his sautéed larynx
    is still a distinctive part of the mix, it takes on a comelier, more
    elemental quality.</p><p>
    The real magic of the record lies in its pacing. <i>You Fail Me</i> is
    Converge's first capital-A album. The one-two combo of ""First Light""
    and ""Last Light"" is an auspicious opening. In the former,
    Kurt Ballou's echoey guitar peals are a perfect prelude to one of the
    band's most concussive, exacting and anthemic songs. Ever. ""Last
    Light"" is inestimably great, industrially precise but quaking with
    vitality. Ballou even squeezes in a reprise of his opening cadenza
    before the super-colossal breakdown, which somehow manages to reign in
    the song's momentum without sacrificing velocity.</p><p>
<i>You Fail Me</i> never peters out. Converge are still programmed for
    hyper-speed, but Ballou throws in some artier stuff where he can,
    leveling ""In Her Blood"" and ""Hanging Moon"" with fairer-- if not quite
    huggable-- melodies. Can you spell 5/4 without prog? ""Heartless"" can;
    its jaunty odd-meter intro is almost danceable, in an early
    Dismemberment Plan sort of way. The album's totemic centerpieces--
    the title track and ""In Her Shadow"", which combined account for a
    third of its runtime-- juxtapose the album's densest and most
    pastoral moments without seeming forced.</p><p>
    Fifteen years is a long fucking time. And yet Converge still
    <em>look</em> young, to say nothing of the way they play. There's always
    something to be said for sticktuitiveness, but the unbroken lineal
    ascent of Converge's ouvre is a lesson to those of us who thought we'd
    long outgrown our scene days: Don't judge too soon, for the dudes in
    cuffs may yet return to kick your perfidious ass.</p></div>"|1595.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1595-you-fail-me/|8.0|Sam Ubl

    shadowy entity in comparison to critically lap-danced Big Apple
    ""noise"" acts like Black Dice and No Neck Blues Band. It's an
    unfortunate lapse, especially when considering the trio's newest tour
    de coarse, <i>Arrived in Gold</i>.</p><p>
    
    One of 2004's most overlooked gems, the album's eight 
    tracks
    channel-surf Pussy Galore's murky ""fuck you"" and DNA's angular,
    minimalist tribal scarification. It's Sightings fourth album, and it's a compositional
    breakthrough, upping antes from the scattershot conveyer-belt white
    noise of 2003's <i>Absolutes</i>, 2002's <i>Michigan Haters</i>, and the band's
    self-titled debut, sans appreciable intensity loss. Purists take note:
     The trio's piled their signature feedback drift/burst/smash/crash on top of
    addictive Liquid Liquid-like grooves. The magnetic
    harshness is sometimes reminiscent of the Chromatics, though
    with scrappier, more grating skree bursts and less dependency on
    straight-up rock rhetoric. (Not to belabor, but it'd be safer to stick
    with the P-cat references, especially during <i>Sugarshit Sharp</i>'s dim-lit
    basement strangulation.)</p><p>
    
    Recorded by Brooklyn magnate Samara Lubelski of The Tower
    Recordings/Hall of Fame, who also guests on violin, it's the band's most spic-and-span sounding refuse to
    date. Opener ""One Out of Ten"" offers a nice bridge from <i>Absolutes</i>-- five minutes of plug/unplug patterns, jittery feedback,
    bass blurts, whispered vocals, and pulsations. It picks up
    steam incrementally, ultimately forming a low-level dervish. (And
    buried beneath this collapsing swarm of bee-shells is a fragile,
    perfectly recorded, darning-needle piano.)</p><p>
    
    ""Sugar Sediment"" is assembled over an unending,
    mid-tempo drum roll, smoky but pristine guitar notes, Mark Morgan's
    intermittent whispers, and unidentifiable drilling noises. The guitar
    (hearkening to Sun City Girls' <i>Torch of the Mystics</i>) and gently loping
    drums remain in strict holding pattern(s), but the feedback and
    buzz/smash floats freely, darting into areas not covered by the song's
    entropic core.</p><p>
    
    The album's shiniest moment is ""Internal
    Compass"". Its skronk catchiness re-inscribes a bit of Liars' clockwork
    drum rambling with a guitar-as-percussion and eventual six-string
    turbo launch reification. Through his table-saw fretwork, Morgan
    snarls and growls and sing-talks about who-knows-what, though I kept
    hearing echoes of Mr. Albini and his kerosene.</p><p>
    
    ""Switching To Judgement"" and ""Odds"" are both
    reminiscent of the serious post-SY junkyard sci-fi of San Diego
    rockers, Kill Me Tomorrow. ""The Last Seed"" is a return to fragmentary
    striations; it features bleeps and blonks and the vocal
    effects of Fusetron honcho Chris Freeman, who calls the geometry of
    his slogging, ""vocussion."" Closer ""Arrived in Gold, Arrived In
    Smoke,"" is a 10-minute panorama, blending the collection's strands of
    freeform blazing/lapidary percussive undertow into a resilient draft
    of iron filings. By song's end, the movement is compressed into airy
    swirls of pitter-pat percussion, Morgan's near-silent throat clearing,
    and slow-mo whirlpool action. The piece actually dissipates, implodes,
    and turns to a spray of near-silent dust particles.</p><p>
    
    It's an enjoyable arsenal, but in a scene that surprisingly lacks
    intriguing characters (I can't count the A.R.E Weapons dudes), another engaging Sightings
    detail is aforementioned guitar/vocal cynic, Mark Morgan.</p><p>
    
    Asked about the possible connection to amply referenced NYC art
    rockers Pussy Galore via their <i>Pussy Gold 5000</i> album, Morgan
    responded: ""Definitely no Pussy Galore action. We ain't down with
    band referencing. Man, I can't honestly even remember what the title

    And queried weeks earlier
    about the history of NYC's influence on his output-- brought to mind
    by <i>Kill Your Idols</i>, a 2004 documentary by SA Crary that draws
    parallels and divergences between the original No New York no wave
    scene and the summer of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs circa 2002-- Morgan said,
    ""It sounds like a load of shit to me. I get the impression that just
    because these bands are from the same city, there is some need to
    connect them even though 20 some years separates the post-Seinfeld now
    from the teetering on bankruptcy then. Personally, the historical
    music continuum of NYC has just about zero effect on my thinking and
    playing music (in terms of like, dude, Mars rocked this town too). I
    rocked out more to Mars/DNA when I lived in Michigan than living in
    NYC.""</p><p>
    
    Complicating the charisma, Sightings have frequently been playing live
    with To Live and Shave in LA's Tom Smith, another
    certifiable whip-smart smart-ass and damn-near autistic performance
    maestro. (And in 2003, Sightings/Smith recorded an album, <i>Gardens of
    War</i>.)</p><p>
    
    It might seem a bit daft to offer minute descriptions of the band's
    musicality only to pull back and shit out a two-bit <i>People Magazine</i>
    character study, but today's wimpy,
    too-polite-because-I-want-a-record-deal version of the old-guard needs
    that sort of thing, and it ought to be recognized when it shows up to
    dinner.</p></div>"|7145.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7145-arrived-in-gold/|7.8|Brandon Stosuy

We could lump them in with their countrymen like the Hives, Sahara Hotnights, and International Noise Conspiracy, but we can all leap for the buzzer to see who spots those bands' influences the fastest. You can do the same for Mando Diao who graft British Invasion melodies over garage-rock riffs. It's a simple formula, and one they got plenty of mileage out of on their debut, <i>Bring 'Em In</i>.</p><p>
    Follow-up <i>Hurricane Bar</i> was produced by Richard Rainey, perhaps best known for working on U2's All That You Can't Leave Behind. Their approach hasn't changed much, but the scales have tipped considerably away from garage-rock enthusiasm and towards Anglophile melodies. In doing so, <i>Hurricane Bar</i> has diluted the two things that made Mando Diao's first album distinct: immediacy and a sense of fun.</p><p>
<i>Bring Em In</i> split the songs between two singers, Björn Dixgärd and Gustaf Norén, though the lion's share of memorable melodies went to Dixgärd. Things are inverted this time, with Dixgärd limited to five of 14 tracks and one extra chorus on ""God Knows"". That's unfortunate, because Dixgärd's throaty Vegas crooning sounds effortless and soulful. Norén carries the melodies just fine, but there's a difference between carrying and selling, as evidenced by ""God Knows"", on which Norén plays second banana in the verses and Dixgärd walks away with the album's catchiest melody.</p><p>
    Norén's raspy, nasal voice fits the Brit Invasion-biting melodies better than the band's garage rock tracks, and since this LP has more stuffy ballads and Libertines-aping songs than stompers, perhaps that's why he's taken the lead. But while it's true that on this album the band displays more range-- including new touches such as the piano break in ""You Can't Steal My Love"" or the serene ""Ringing Bells""-- I'd rather take generic revivalism with energy and a charismatic singer over an album that's simply derivative.</p></div>"|5558.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5558-hurricane-bar/|6.9|Jason Crock

His precisely situated historical bildungsromans are rich with period detail and Bunyanesque protagonists who fulfill the wildest promises of their eras, each a larger-than-life manqué whose preternatural abilities (be they in entrepreneurship or the construction of detailed miniature automatons) lead them along the same delirious arc: A meteoric rise to success, a period of virtuosic clarity, and then a flame out as genius shades into unhealthy obsession or is rendered effete by novelty.</p><p>
    It's from such embroidered yet prescient pages that young Wolf-- 6'4"", striking, and outlandishly attired-- seems torn wholesale. He began to dabble in recording at age 11, recording violin, junky analog organs, and homemade theremin on his four-track. He joined the art collective Minty at 14 and impressed Fat Cat Records enough that they gave him a computer and mixer to further his explorations. At 16, he left England to form the raucous Mason Crimineaux in France and won over Capitol K, who would release Wolf's solo debut, the bombastic, uncontained electro-folk grab bag <em>Lycanthropy</em>, in 2003.</p><p>
    Until Wolf's story has been written in full, it's impossible to say whether his sophomore effort, <em>Wind in the Wires</em>, belongs to the rapid upsurge or the crystallization of vision, but there are signs to indicate the latter. Millhauser's characters' zeniths of achievement are often presaged by their returning changed from a long absence-- some outer expression of a burgeoning darkness within them. After <em>Lycanthropy</em> put him on the radar, Wolf absconded from London to a cliff-side chalet in Cornwall. The formerly blond singer returned with a shock of black hair and <em>Wind in the Wires</em>, which boils off the excesses of his debut and simmers in elegant pools of glitchy beats, found sound collages, crackling electrical sounds, and gothic shadows.</p><p>
<em>Wind in the Wires</em> is like Bright Eyes' <em>Digital Ash in a Digital Urn</em> if Nick Cave had made it, a fertile nexus of tradition, technology, and Wolf's powerful pipes, as he romanticizes travel and escape, pines for lost youth at age 21, dreams of domestic pleasures, and takes potshots at a debased culture. ""The Libertine"" opens the album with clip-clopping hooves, a gypsy-disco beat, sawing violins and a spitting electrical undercurrent as Wolf inveighs against duplicitous priests, immoral heroes and other phonies, while the simpler, poppier ""Land's End"" gripes about the music industry's promotional apparatus. The languidly beautiful ""Teignmouth"" longs for release from banality: Over a staticky pulse and angelic choir, Wolf sings, ""So when the birds fly south/ I'll reach up and hold their tails/ Pull up and out of here/ And bridle the autumn gales."" And on the ukulele madrigal ""The Railway House"", Wolf imagines the placid contentment of growing old: ""So wave goodbye to living alone/ I think we've found our home/ Let's paint these walls and pull up the weeds/ And cast our fevers in stone.""</p><p>
    But to focus only on the broader traits is to miss what makes <em>Wind in the Wires</em> so outstanding: Wolf festoons his songs with strange, understated details that ratchet them toward the mysterious. Sputtering electricity, alien frequencies, and sculpted static billow across the record in sparkling clouds. In the midst of the mournful strains of ""Ghost Song"", a perfectly incongruous Bobby Digital-style ""Whoop!"" floats up like a bubble, and the same sound of cycling voltage that opens the first song ends the last one, wrapping the album in a closed circuit. Nothing here has been left to chance.</p><p>
    Wolf's strange blend of postmodernism and antiquity is where he seems to break away from being a Millhauser character and gains an affinity with the author himself: Millhauser honors traditional yarning while being fully aware of its archetypal implications; his characters' failures are the waking at the end of the dream or the bleak ending edited out of the fairy tale. For Wolf's sake, one hopes that with <em>Wind in the Wires</em>, he's caught that southbound bird's tail and escaped from Millhauser's inexorable parabola: To be the dreamer of dreams, rather than the dreamt, is clearly his heart's desire.</p></div>"|8774.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8774-wind-in-the-wires/|8.2|Brian Howe

Norwegians Dag-Are Haugan and Espen Sommer Eide, who record together as Alog, create abstract but accessible instrumental music that neatly stitches sounds birthed inside a computer with live instruments and field recordings. Alog doesn't sound like a <em>band</em>, exactly, but it also feels some ways removed from the bedroom laptop. They seem to be thriving on the spaces that exist between.</p><p>
    On 2001's <i>Duck Rabbit</i>, Alog folded in more beats and experimented with the repetition of techno, but on <i>Miniatures</i>-- their third record on Rune Grammofon-- the duo back once again explores the emotional implications of pure sound. We hear guitars, cut-up synths, indeterminate drones, drum machines, and voices probably captured in a marketplace in their native Tromsø (home of Biosphere, Röyksopp, etc.), but the tracks resist dissection, existing instead as complex interdependent fabric. Opener ""Severe Punishment and Lasting Bliss"", which also led off <i>Runeology 2</i>, one of Rune Grammofon's label compilations, now stands in my mind as a stone drone classic. The structure of the track is highly dramatic; it slowly morphs from tinny guitar distortion into the towering wall of sound of Fennesz' dreams before finishing in a lengthy swirl of dissonant strings. Highly original and utterly transfixing from the first listen, ""Severe Punishment and Lasting Bliss"" is a bold statement of intent that the rest of <i>Miniatures</i> lives up to.</p><p>
    Quieter tracks such as ""Steady Jogging of the Heart"" draw power from small details, judiciously applying the techniques of laptop glitch to a carefully assembled library of sounds. The timbre of the organ chords of ""Steady Jogging of the Heart"" conveys easy warmth, while the unsteady pulse imparted by choppy editing suggest an undercurrent of anxiety. ""Leyden Jar"" digs inside the dirty cracks of music production to find the buried noises, smearing beeps, clicks and percussive scrapes between the speakers in an unpredictable pattern. When more conventional instrumentation is pushed to the fore, we get tracks like ""St. Paul Sessions II"", which combines the machine-steady pulse of a single acoustic guitar chord with clouds of vibraphone. Here Alog take the best ideas of Tortoise-style post-rock, strip away the layer of cerebral remove and the focus on instrumental virtuosity, and let the music drift in more emotional (even sentimental) direction. Which seems precisely what's needed.</p><p>
    It's exciting to know that the same duo created both ""St. Paul Sessions II"" and ""The Youth of Mysterious Conversations"", which sounds like a highly abstracted cover of Derrick May's ""To Be or Not to Be"". Each Alog track is its own small world with its own internal logic, and <i>Miniatures</i> collects nine good ones without a single dud. An excellent record.</p></div>"|461.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/461-miniatures/|8.4|Mark Richardson

On their follow-up EP </em><em>Heaven and Hell, however, the Lawrence, Kan.-based group have instead chosen to draw their fence-posts nearer to home, corralling their unruly sound into something considerably more tamable. And though this should come as happy news to fans of Bright-Eyed Midwestern sincerity, it might also disappoint those on the lookout for further high plains adventure.</em></p><p>
    
    Containing five tracks (plus one odd little spoken word ghost story), <em>Heaven and Hell finds the band cutting back significantly on much of <i>The Captain</i>'s more atypical instrumentation, though it still makes judicious use of the occasional accordion or toy piano. This relatively unadorned approach places increased emphasis on the group's songwriting, as well as on Jordan Geiger's earnest, reedy vocals. Thankfully, all hands are steady enough to bear up under the scrutiny and Minus Story manage to avoid any true calamity, although moments do arise when you may find yourself longing for the introduction of a stray sousaphone or two.</em></p><p>
    
    On songs like ""Suffer by Yourself"", with its cheerfully Dylanesque (e.g. sloppy) blats of harmonica, or the dusty highway lament ""Misery is a Ship"", which benefits from a brief cameo of spaghetti-western cavalry bugle, Minus Story can fleetingly recall the cracked Americana of outfits like Giant Sand or Calexico, whereas ""Time Wastes Itself"" and the title track investigate some of the same downcast bedroom atmospheres well-cornered by Smog. <em>Heaven and Hell also includes a serene, plaintive cover of the Misfits' ""Hybrid Moments"", transforming the raucous punk of the original into a chiming (and actually quite lovely) folkish delicacy that would probably make Glenn Danzig want to crush a light bulb with his teeth.</em></p><p> 
    
    Lyrically, <em>Heaven and Hell makes it sound as though Geiger's been having a rough go of late, with recurrent themes of heartache (and its accompanying sleep disorders) threading through each of these songs. This periodically leads the listener into overly familiar tear-soaked sleeve territory (""</em><em>Heaven and Hell is in your mouth/ Because it's not me you're talking about"") but at other points, particularly on the forlorn ""Misery Is a Ship,"" Geiger's brittle, clear-eyed words (""Time makes dogs of men...and marries us to death and buries us with our mistakes"") are coupled so flawlessly with the music's woozy lurch that it creates the momentary belief that perhaps Minus Story do indeed know where they're heading after all.</em></p></div>"|5589.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5589-heaven-and-hell-ep/|6.9|Matthew Murphy

So when branching from Deerhoof, whose music's predicated on spontaneity, brevity, and ""elements"" of songs rather than complete compositions, how stripped down could a side project get? Try 23 songs in less than 35 minutes, the duration of the Curtains' third LP, <em>Vehicles of Travel. In that time, the band-- which features Deerhoof's Chris Cohen and Greg Saunier along with Open City drummer Andrew Maxwell-- manages to cram a bevy of melodies, drum beats, and sound effects into the album, sacrificing form and repetition for musical exploration.</em></p><p>
    
    For obvious reasons, the songs seldom qualify as ""memorable,"" excepting a few where Maxwell loans his vocals. The entire album feels like the gradual metamorphosis of one giant song rather than a collage of one to two minute tracks. A cherubic mood permeates throughout, as though the band unassembled a child's music box to piece it back together with guitars and synthesizers. ""April Galleons"" and ""Fletcher's Favorite"" come the closest to clean, reconstructed products, drawing inspiration from ""The Rainbow Connection"" and ""Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood"". However, bizarre lyrics deny the album a total PBS feel, like on ""Personal Resources"": ""On top of the Seneca/ The mayor's wife told the senator/ The Fuhrer and me met secretly, yesterday.""</p><p>
    
    Despite these eccentricities, there's a nostalgic quality to the songs, although for what time remains unclear. Although the majority of the album harkens back to 60s television themes, bits of 70s kraut and 80s pop intermittently emerge as well. ""Pagoda Defenders"" and ""Nite Crew"" resemble synth-rockers like Falco and Duran Duran while ""The Gadabouts"" and ""The Bronx Zoobreak"" employ unconventional percussion and horn arrangements reminiscent of Neu! or Can.</p><p>
    
    For what it's worth, the ""idea"" density on this record is very high. Unfortunately, the songwriting lacks the spunk and creativity necessary to trick listeners into believing these 90-second snippets are fully completed songs-- a skill Deerhoof has perfected. Hard as you may try, it's nearly impossible to perceive the Curtains as something more than a sole, albeit critical, cog removed from a larger, better-oiled machine.</p></div>"|1795.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1795-vehicles-of-travel/|6.0|Adam Moerder

How can a city of Banana Republican pencil-pushers even hope to compete in such a heated psych-rock market? Here's how:</p><p>

    * Mk-Ultra<br/>
    * Tranny Hoover<br/>
    * Reflecting Pool</p><p>
    There may not be a stranger city on Earth, which is why a band like Dead Meadow existing in the District is not at all surprising. With their fourth album, <i>Feathers</i>, Dead Meadow add another guitarist and venture further outside their 60s influences to create a spacious, hypnotic album that distinguishes them from their stoner- and psych-rock contemporaries.</p><p>
    Dead Meadow owes considerable debts to Sabbath, Zeppelin, and Blue Cheer, among others, and the band has always provided a reminder that music like theirs ditched reality in favor of vespertine sances and distorted idylls. <i>Feathers</i>, though, takes those same influences and strains them through shoegaze standards like Ride's <i>Nowhere</i> and the Verve's <i>A Storm in Heaven</i>, augmenting the sludge with gauzy melodies.</p><p>
    On previous albums, singer-guitarist Jason Simon seemed to get caught up in his own riffs, a tendency often found in the dubiously conglomerated stoner rock sub-genre. Whether the presence of new guitarist Cory Shane provoked the change or not, Simon is more willing to loose his grip on his guitar, as evidenced on the extended silences on opener ""Let's Jump In"" and the ebb and flow of ""Get Up On Down"". If the riff death grip is what you're into, don't worry. ""Untitled"" is a 13-plus-minute ogre that will stomp the shit out of your crappy computer speakers. Its path is cleared by the curious ""Through The Gates Of The Sleepy Silver Door"", a drum-pummeling of Yoshimi proportions that scrubs any coherent thought you might be having at the time of listening.</p><p>
    The other big change on <i>Feathers</i> is Simon's voice. In the past, his nasal whine could grate if it weren't completely drowned out by a slight turn of the volume. ""At Her Open Door"", a slide guitar ramble that leaves plenty of room for Simon's singing, illustrates the subtle alteration. His relaxed delivery is a about an octave lower than normal, and it actually sounds like he's able to force air through his nostrils. ""Stacy's Song"" is an even greater improvement, slapping a bit of echo on Simon's breathy meanderings, which are downright manly.</p><p>
<i>Feathers</i> may not have the heft of Dead Meadow's other albums, but it's easily its most listenable and satisfying from end to end. Along with the mountaintop bellowing of Comets On Fire and the riverside rollicking of Black Mountain, Dead Meadow have established themselves nicely as the bookish Tolkein fellows wandering the forest of the mystical neo-psych hinterland. Look at all that nature! Comets on the mountains, mountains by the river, and meadows in the forest...so pretty. Dead Meadow may not inspire the kids at Ft. Reno like Fugazi. They probably won't keep white folks clutching their spouses like Bad Brains. But I'll be damned if they don't do a fine job of updating the kind of music that made G-Dubs nauseous as a college student, and that's really all you can ask of a band from D.C.</p></div>"|2215.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2215-feathers/|8.0|Peter Macia

(population: 1,800), the electro-rock (more like rock-electro) Mobius Band have taken a longish path to Urban Outfitters compilation (don't hate!) buzz band-dom. But the slow build has given the three-piece time to grow into their taught and confident current incarnation. After three self-released, self-recorded, increasingly impressive EPs over the past three years, the band recently signed with those progressive beatheads at Ghostly International and this five-song EP is the first fruit of what seems like a healthy if unlikely partnership. Ditching the meandering instrumental post-rock and country leanings of past releases, the band has morphed into a trim, fleshy rock'n'blip cyborg made up of bass-pumping blood, muscular guitars, and an ever-handy sampler-and-keyboard pacemaker that keeps normal bodily functions running oh-so smoothly. Near-flawless in its execution, <em>City vs Country</em> is at once traditional and progressive, easy to listen to, and dificult to ignore.</p><p>
    Not just another group of ax-grinding guys dicking around with annoyingly tacked-on ""electronic elements,"" Mobius Band takes its bleeps seriously and uses them economically and effectively within the intense fabric of their songs. Markedly more precise and three-dimensional than anything they've attempted, the added sonic sheen provided by a professional studio and the mixing talents of Interpol associate Peter Katis fits the band like a snug Powerglove and allows them to indulge in wavy headphone-friendly sonic minutiae. The group shows off its new supped-up sound early with ""Starts Off With a Bang"", which is actually more of a long, winding fuse than an explosion. Chirpy Morse code quickly gives way to group leader Ben Sterling's passive vocals. By now, Sterling has learned how to make his near-monotone drone work within his band's framework as it often adds fragility to the group's airtight arrangements. ""At the start of the century my mind keeps wandering,"" he dreamily sings, succumbing to the futuristic Aphex-on-X bounce surrounding him.</p><p>
    ""Multiply"" slowly creeps to its distorted shoegazer crescendo, picking up all passers-by along the way. ""City vs Country"", the most straight-ahead guitar-rocking number, seemingly combines the excitement of new surroundings (two-thirds of the band recently moved to Brooklyn) with the disappointment of an impending break-up through non-linear observations like ""The lights on the train flicker off across your face."" The same contradictory emotions pop up on the last and best track, ""I Had A Good Year"".</p><p>
    ""When life is so good it hurts,"" muses Sterling, his somber delivery adding an obvious melancholy undercurrent punctuating the hurt rather than the good. ""I will cut you in half and then we'll see who laughs,"" seethes the singer in a rare moment of lyrical clarity, before ringing guitars and panning keyboards take the track into a supersonic stratosphere. Rumbling underneath, crack drummer Noam Schatz's crunching, processed percussion seamlessly morph into a very earthly pummel by the track's crushing dénouement.</p><p>
    On <em>City vs Country</em>, Mobius Band temper the downcast urban hum of studio mates Interpol with a bit of Postal Service machine-bop glee. The newly honed aural slickness only adds to this developing band's potential appeal and instead of getting lost inside a real studio, this rock-electro outfit has found itself-- just in time for their first long-player.</p></div>"|5342.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5342-city-vs-country-ep/|8.0|Ryan Dombal

    was issued last year, but the album has been drawing increasingly more attention since the January release of the self-titled debut from the band's evil vinyl-schooled twin, Black Mountain. Besides sharing personnel, the
    albums have a lot in common. With Vancouver polymath Stephen McBean at
    the helm, both are notable not merely for their rootsy rock
    influences, but the specificity of their stylistic appropriations. In
    a field where bands often consolidate entire decades to achieve a
    generic ""retro"" sound, McBean's geological formations hew away at
    something smaller and more ornately detailed.</p><p>
    
    Clearly, this is the way to go. Why settle for a mass-produced replica
    when you can have the hand-stitched real thing? Of course, no CD comes
    caked in John Bonham's dried sweat, but then, bands don't stand a
    chance of becoming deities themselves unless they hone in, internalize
    their forebears' achievements and conceive something new(ish) from the
    recycled matter. When it's done well, retro isn't biting; it's a novel
    and economical use of widely available ingredients.</p><p>
    
    Perhaps Pink Mountaintops haven't been as warmly received as their
    more ominous-sounding counterparts because their influences are more
    abstract and toyed-with. On ""Modern Music"", Black Mountain came right
    out said it-- they ""can't stand all your modern music""-- and
    proceeded to ride Ozzy's headless bat all up in our grill. Here,
    McBean and his associates are more reserved. ""Bad Boogie Ballin'""
    surpasses the composite weirdness of Black Mountain in its first four
    bars alone: A grimly metallic beat teams with a gas-huffing accordion
    to provide a backdrop for McBean's swarthy blues-trimmed vocal. The
    song seethes with tension, awaiting the melody that never shows up.</p><p>
    
    ""Rock 'n' Roll Fantasy"" is creepy and hollow. Soft solo guitar and
    meditative female back-up hums nuzzle up to the Doors as McBean
    delivers a harrowing vocal, revealing his most sexually-frustrated
    dream-wishes: ""I came all over myself/ Wish I came all over your
    blouse."" ""I [fuck] Mountains"", despite its titular filthiness, is
    actually the album's smoothest cut, letting nothing disrupt the flow
    of its hand drums and wafting-smoke guitars.</p><p>
    
    In general, Pink Mountaintops' music is more provocative when it isn't noisy. Among the louder numbers, only the
    chipper, almost Kinks-y ""Sweet '69"", which finds McBean's head buried
    deep in the feathered glory of his Summer of Love fantasies, truly
    succeeds. Elsewhere, ""Tourist In Your Town"" and ""Atmosphere"" take the
    Velvet Underground's band-of-gypsies plod into the sunset a little too
    far, failing to achieve the aimed-for catharsis of ""Heroin"". It's a
    flawed ending to a promising debut, but I wouldn't call it a letdown:
    Pink Mountaintops still aren't your dad's rock anachronism, because
    chances are they know the terrain better than the old man himself.</p></div>"|6566.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6566-pink-mountaintops/|7.0|Sam Ubl

Together they formed the rhythm section of the Libertines-- Hassall on bass and Powell on drums-- but are better known as the two who aren't Carl Barât and Pete Doherty. They don't make tabloid headlines for self-destructive behavior (as Doherty does on a semiregular basis), nor do Hassall and Powell get their pictures on the covers of the band's albums. On the new <i>What Became of the Likely Lads</i> EP-- which will likely serve as the band's swansong-- they appear on the back cover partially obscured by the tracklist, while the singers/guitarists grace the front.</p><p>
    There is, arguably, nothing uncommon about this separation of rhythm and melody: Barât and Doherty were, after all, the faces of the Libertines, lifelong friends whose deteriorating comraderie fueled the soap opera that fueled the albums <i>Up the Bracket</i> and <i>The Libertines</i>. But <i>What Became of the Likely Lads</i>-- which gathers two versions of the title track, four live cuts, and the UK single ""Don't Look Back Into the Sun""-- makes it clear that Hassall and Powell actually held the band together, if only musically.</p><p>
    On the live tracks, the pair locks into the songs' grooves and keeps them on track, often reining in the guitarists when they stray. ""Skag and Bone Man"" (the B-side to the UK single ""Up the Bracket"") is rough and loose, with Powell breaking into a drum solo as the song falls apart. They do better with the <i>Up the Bracket</i> tracks ""Time for Hero's"" (sic) and ""Boys in the Band"", although they're not too far removed from the originals. But it's the dynamic between the steady rhythm section and the rambunctious guitars and vocals, rather than that between Barât and Doherty, that makes these tracks so tensely compelling. It's like watching a sober guy walk his drunk friend home; just one stumble and they both hit the sidewalk. The drama derives from the band's teetering proximity to chaos, in which lies not rock'n'roll glory but pathetic tragedy, but Hassall and Powell make sure they keep putting one foot in front of the other.</p><p>
    That precarious sound translates as naturally to the studio tracks as it does to the live songs, which is to the considerable credit of producer Mick Jones. ""What Became of the Likely Lads"", a remarkable song from the largely unremarkable <i>The Libertines</i>, gets two treatments: the album version and a ""reworked"" version, which aren't different enough from each other to justify the inclusion of both tracks. The album version may ultimately trump the new one, if only for the interplay between Barât and Doherty. The song is about their harried friendship and their complexity of reconciliation, as Doherty is working with Babyshambles and Barât goes solo. For their troubles, Hassall and Powell at least had the best seats in the house.</p></div>"|4772.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4772-what-became-of-the-likely-lads-ep/|6.8|Stephen M. Deusner

They trade off
    yelping boy/girl vocals in the style of last week's most cherished
    new-wave band! They're better than A.R.E. Weapons! They're almost as
    good as stellastarr*! Their bass lines are fuzzy like adolescents!
    Their drum machine beats leave you with a smile on your face, which is
    better than anyplace else, if not then see a doctor-- results may
    vary!</p><p>
    
    Mommy and Daddy are shouting so loudly because they have nothing
    worthwhile to say. (Note to pop criticism's reigning PC police: not
    that there's anything wrong with that, OMG rockism suxxorz, etc.).
    They're also trying to drown out echoes of past electroclash
    entanglements, apparently a scarlet letter even in the twosome's own
    New York City. Yeah, but have you heard the new Fischerspooner album?</p><p>
    
    First up and last up on Mommy and Daddy's latest EP is ""Confection"",
    chugging Dumpster pop about wanting to take you home, sung by Vivian Sarratt. Then ""uno, dos, tres, cuatro!"" starts track two. Boy, Edmond Hallas must be embarrassed to be less clever than even Bono. After an irritating smoke-detector synth bleep, Hallas shouts something that sounds like ""sodomy,"" but don't get your hopes
    up-- it's probably not.</p><p>
    
    Of course, that means it's back to Sarratt for track three, ""The Now"",
    with a desperately heavy bass riff and faux cowbell! After shouting
    ""confection!"" over and over in her first vocal, here Sarratt cannily
    mixes it up, shouting ""now!"" instead. On ""Run It Off"", Hallas keeps up
    his would-be somebody-else yelps over more drum machines and  more
    fuzzy bass lines, dipping to a bellow for the refrain: ""Run it off!
    Run it off! Run it off! Run it off!"" Needs more faux cowbell. I could
    describe the remaining track, ""Question Marks Followed by Exclamation
    Marks,"" but trust me, you've heard it all before.</p><p>
    
    Apparently Mommy and Daddy are big in Britain. (Bad joke: Your mommy
    would be big anywhere. Haven't seen your daddy, though.) Hopeless
    Google monkeys have compared Mommy and Daddy's 2003 debut--
    favorably!-- to Public Image Ltd. Yeah, we read press releases,
    too and yeah, Hallas wants to be John Lydon. A better parallel,
    philosophically if not sonically: nu-garage nadir the Datsuns (hell,
    even Jet were at least catchy). When Mommy and Daddy shout, it makes
    the baby cry.</p></div>"|5641.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5641-fighting-style-killer-panda-ep/|2.5|Marc Hogan

The Pitchfork brass is currently engaged in a bit of half-serious handwringing behind the scenes: <i>we seem to love every other record these days, just keep that in mind</i>. But they know there's nothing we can do; we're only as cynical as the music we're given, and two months worth of gems probably means karmic retribution in the form of a pitiful summer or a Unicorns reunion or a Robert Pollard anthology or something. In the meantime, there's nothing wrong with a bit of prolonged enthusiasm, even if it has the unfortunate side-effect of effing with the wheat to chaff ratio. I was thinking the other day that between <i>Run the Road</i>, M.I.A., LCD Soundsystem, Mu, Fischerspooner, Antony and the Johnsons, Bloc Party, Out Hud, and a handful of other records I am forgetting or have yet to discover, you could make a very good case for the first quarter of 2005 being as strong as the entirety of 2004 for full-lengths. (Singles is another, much sadder story altogether.)</p><p>
    Anyway, I'll confess, I'm a Kompakt head, but since I've never really cared much for Justus Köhncke's poppier, vocal-based stuff, I wasn't expecting to like this much at all. But then again, given that there's barely been a disappointing record released this year (Daft Punk get off on a technicality 'cause <i>Human After All</i> hasn't actually been released yet), I shouldn't be surprised that I do. So, yeah, this is good, too: Life is but a stage and we are all but French figure skating judges or Leonard Maltins, or something.</p><p>
    So in record-review parlance, this is what you'd call a ""grower,"" which admittedly is another way of saying that if I hadn't been too lazy to get up and change the disc at a certain point, I'd probably still be in favor of keeping Köhncke on a strict diet of house numbers. His second full-length for Kompakt and his third overall, <em>Doppelleben</em> (German for ""double life,"" see) runs the gamut between dancefloor crowd-pleasers like ""Timecode"" (which is included here, albeit egregiously, in a single edit that runs at half the length of the original) and drippy, lovelorn pop like ""Wo Bist Du?""</p><p>
    Köhncke has lots of fun in the space between those two poles. You can tell that he went into <em>Doppelleben</em> without any real mandate because each track just sort of floats from one convention to the next, but rather than sounding like a disparate batch of songs, the end result is like a love note to his favorite music from the past 20 years. Even as it bounces from the clanging industrial of ""Loreley"" to the faithful rendition of Carly Simon's ""Coming Around Again"" (""Alles Nochmal""), it's held together by Köhncke's lush, full-bodied production style, which is as distinctive and as well-articulated as that of any Kompakt artist.</p><p>
    Fittingly, the best two tracks here prove Köhncke to be as adept at the vocal-pop stuff as he is at the Kompakt nerd stuff. With its tick-tock opening and slow-timed releases, the eight-minute long ""Elan"" (a condensed version of which also opens the album) is his obvious attempt to follow up ""Timecode"", and although it doesn't have the same spastic little builds, it's almost as good. Elsewhere, the campy vocoded lead and piercing string stabs of the future-disco confection ""Schwabylon"" sound like Köhncke trying to approximate Daft Punk, which is doubly useful now that Daft Punk no longer wish to approximate Daft Punk. But dammit, I'm buzz harshing a little bit there, aren't I? <i>Human After All</i> isn't released for a couple of weeks-- let's enjoy this incredible little run while we can.</p></div>"|4577.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4577-doppelleben/|8.2|Mark Pytlik

    sound, whether the sticks be wood or strung with catgut or even just 
    triangular pieces of plastic.</em></p><p>
    
    Opener ""Ananda Lahari"" is a traditional Indian hymn, 
    performed here by Padma Newsome, Clogs' primary songwriter. He plays the 
    violin the way one would expect, alternating between legato (connected and 
    smooth) and vibrato (tremulous and pulsating) phrasings to beautiful 
    effect. On other tracks, he and his fellow players (including 
    bandmate Bryce Dessner on guitar, and renowned improvisational cellist 
    Erik Friedlander) take to whacking or plucking or violently bowing their 
    instruments. In ""Pencil Stick"", eerie tinny tones are tapped out while 
    violins are sawed through. This concussive approach is more pronounced 
    on ""Sticks and Nails"", where resonant metallic pings and tongs sound 
    off like broken grandfather clock chimes. And, appropriately, in 
    ""Beating Stick"", the music consists entirely of the players tapping on 
    strings.</p><p>
    
    In case you're unsure, Clogs don't often utilize singers or lyrics. <i>Stick Music</i>'s only vocals are on ""Lady 
    Go"", with Newsome utilizing a well-mannered falsetto against a mournful 
    string section for this brief European folk aside. The rest of the 
    album lets the instruments speak for themselves, whether they chatter and 
    buzz like swarming insects (in ""River Stick""), gently keen and wail (in 
    ""My Mister 'Never Ending Bliss'""), or drunkenly swoon (as on the 
    album's final track, ""Pitasi""). Calling this stuff ""classical"" might work as 
    a quick-and-dirty pigeon hole, but it short shrifts the talents of a 
    group that takes its inspiration and cues from indigenous musics all 
    across Europe and Asia. When trying to describe Clogs' music to other 
    folks, it might be better to forgo any genre distinctions and head 
    straight for the thesaurus so you can find fresh and exciting ways to say 
    ""sublime.""</p></div>"|1789.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1789-stick-music/|8.6|David Raposa

    ourselves enough."" Of course, that was before UK six-piece The Go!
    Team stretched and smooshed up the pop song like so much Silly Putty
    for last year's <em>Thunder, Lightning, Strike</em>. Recent Stevens
    signees Bunky, with their own Saturday morning trumpets and laughable
    sobriquet, hopscotch conventions at a nearby playground.</p><p>
    
    When I was a child, I dreamed of being Joe Montana. This San Diego duo
    strive toward a <em>Vice</em> guestlist of rock ('n') role models:
    singer/drummer Emily Joyce's sultry vocals croon ""Karen O.""; her
    ambiguous relationship with singer/guitarist Rafter Roberts is a
    matching wardrobe shy of the White Stripes; their fuzzy, disjointed
    song structures were left off the Ark while trading pogs with the
    Unicorns. ""Funny Like the Moon"" jackhammers absurdist Magnetic
    Fields-cum-Chet Baker verses with garage-punk choruses, ""Lipstick
    Life"" sips absinthe in outer space with Air's <em>Moon Safari</em>, and
    even failure ""Gotta Pee"" manages to juxtapose fidgety indie rock with
    Wolf Eyes vacuum noise.</p><p>
    
    Such broad ambitions could be a lot to swallow, but <em>Born to Be a
    Motorcycle</em> is as playful as it is high-reaching. It's ""Cute Not
    Beautiful"", as the title to a surprisingly touching ballad explains.
    Amid the lo-fi simian squeaks of avant-garde love song ""Boy/Girl"",
    Roberts intones, ""Girl, you know you look so pretty in that dinosaur
    outfit""-- a line the cool kids will soon be dropping on potential
    amours in place of ""I caught you a delicious bass."" On ""Glass of
    Water"", basic thirst becomes fodder for a screeching speakeasy
    sing-a-long. Even the album's most accessible track, sexily swaggering
    rocker ""Chuy"", keeps its tongue close to its
    cheek.</p><p>
    
    And, uh, the name's Bunky. (Apparently ""Bunny"" and ""Monkey"" were Joyce
    and Roberts' pet names for each other. Aww.)  Members of other San
    Diego bands like Castanets, Rockets From the Crypt, Black Heart
    Procession, and Pinback also lend their support to the recording, but
    it's not clear they're needed. While <em>Born to Be a Motorcycle</em>
    falls just short of the masterpiece the group's core twosome likely
    intended, it pushes pop's boundaries enough to hope Bunky might slip
    its surly bonds by their sophomore outing. ""The future's now,"" Joyce
    demands on burly opener ""Baba"", ""so when the hell's the future?""</p></div>"|1144.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1144-born-to-be-a-motorcycle/|7.7|Marc Hogan

Georgian Liz Durrett was not that kind of teenager. Sounding like a drowsier Chan Marshall, Durrett's quaint, folksy ghost stories seem far more mature than typical young pup fare-- it's difficult to imagine she was around the same age as Avril and Ashlee when she recorded <em>Husk</em>.</p><p>
    
    Then again, most teenagers don't have Vic Chesnutt for a crazy uncle and guiding influence. Produced by the beloved paraplegic southern songwriter, this charmingly backwoods nine-song debut sees the now twentysomething Durrett airing out her spooky mid-90s adolescent material in preparation for an album of more current songs due later this year.</p><p>
<em>Husk</em> is an odd family affair, to say the least. Think Partridge Family but uglier, death-obsessed, and with a sunburnt, junkyard car in place of the fruity schoolbus. Chesnutt, his wife, and Durrett's grandmother all contribute, with Vic steering the album's sparse arrangements and sometimes overbearing funeral-waltz mood. Unfortunately, Durrett's abstract, oddly spiritual lyrical tendencies are a far howl from her uncle's singularly witty narratives. ""There's the ghost of a beast in the woods,"" she sings in a peculiarly calm drawl on the title track, and much of the album features disconnected permutations on such vaguely haunting imagery and little more. The undeveloped facets of Durrett's nascent songwriting skills are often masked by her warm, natural vocals and her uncle's comfy-wooden-chair production but, with too few melodic or lyrical anchors, much of the deathly mystery surrounding <em>Husk</em> quickly evaporates into a hazy, nondescript mist typified by one-word song titles such as ""Slip"", ""Vine"", and ""Net"".</p><p>
    
    Many songs drag and sway without leaving an impression; they fall into some kind of endless folk singer-songwriter purgatory. Even with its nightmarish, echoed-vibrato back-ups, ""Bc"" comes across as a boring, second-rate haunted hay ride. ""Net"" veers dangerously close to Lilith Fair banal acoustic balladry and is barely salvaged by Chesnutt's reliably minimal, resonant recording techniques.</p><p>
    
    It's when Durrett focuses her songwriting that she becomes scarily good, as on the <em>Silence of the Lambs</em>-style murky kidnapping tale ""Captive"". Old-tyme record player pops add to the harrowing theatrics as the deceptively placid singer emotes from a rusty, dripping basement, ""I sit in this corner with my hands bound and my eyes closed."" The juxtaposition of Durrett's assured delivery and the song's prickly subject matter sends uncanny chills.</p><p>
    
    As an introduction to a young talent, <em>Husk</em> shows promise but this early-years compilation doesn't quite hold together as an album on its own. Still, tracks like the relatively upbeat ""Lull"", ""Captive"", and the slow-burning ""Husk"" provide compelling evidence that Durrett should be entered in the next-Cat Power sweepstakes.</p></div>"|2599.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2599-husk/|5.4|Ryan Dombal

His voice, often derided for its slovenliness and liberality with pitch, lends the Manchester trio's songs a coarseness for which they're left to compensate, or not, with more adventurous instrumentals. The band's previous albums, <em>Lost Souls</em> and <em>The Last Broadcast</em>, generally managed to cover the difference, but at times sounded like Doves were trying too hard to be something they're not: Both albums featured their share of anthemic hooks, but it seemed as if the band were struggling to turn in something as aseptically beatific-- and as popular-- as fellow Brit-rock bands such as Coldplay and Travis.</p><p>
    
    In the three years since <em>Last Broadcast</em>, Doves have cultivated a better understanding of their strengths and limitations, and <em>Some Cities</em> beams with a revivified looseness. Like its predecessors, the album arrives just in time for Spring and comes bearing more than a few certifiable vernal jams. <i>Last Broadcast</i>'s ""There Goes the Fear"", one of the bouncin-est seven-minute verse/chorus/verse brit-rock epics with a jungle-percussive outro Radio 1 has ever spun, finds its match in ""Black and White Town"", this album's lead single, which channels Joe Jackson's ""Steppin' Out"" with a plump four-on-the-floor beat and steady-struttin' piano line. But as tender and prissy as they can be, strands of angst and pessimism course through Doves' music, and <em>Some Cities</em> hones this aesthetic push-and-pull, featuring some of the band's darkest and prettiest music to date. Furthermore, those two stylistic extremes aren't always mutually exclusive.</p><p>
    
    The record's first four tracks are downright impregnable. Opener ""Some Cities"" is urgent and yearning. The song is surprisingly tactful in forging a composite order, wedding Bruce Springsteen's arena boot-stomp to the Velvet Underground's driveling, soot-caked guitar yowls. ""Almost Forgot Myself"" is more classic Motown than its rippling atmospherics and surf-echo guitar let on, laying down a rubbery bass line and sturdy boom-chick drumming. It's difficult to tell if ""Snowden""'s deeply cooed, wordless chorus is the work of voice or oscillated guitar or both, but it's sure as hell beautiful.</p><p>
    
    Rounding out the chart-eyeing material is ""One of These Days"", which pegs the platinum-selling populism that has eluded the band. The guitar melody is <em>Some Cities'</em> most chipper, but the song is beefy with details-- a tangential doppler-synth intro and a tasteful effects-laden trim, among them. Again, the drum/bass interplay suggests a Motown affinity-- a dauntingly generic yet fickle ingredient that Doves incorporate pleasantly and organically.</p><p>
    
    It's frustrating when an album feels like it consciously has to embark on some kind of journey-- for instance, the descent from energetic, single-worthy material to slow introspective ballads that's so often just a cover for frontloading. <em>Some Cities</em> traces a similar arc, but Doves aren't pulling the wool over our eyes; the album's second half is nearly as well-executed as its first, if lacking the same galvanizing momentum. ""Shadows of Salford"" is a muffled, herb-slowed piano dirge that sends <i>Magical Mystery Tour</i> its regards. From there, the album acquiesces, staking one last bopper (""Sky Starts Falling"") before bowing out gracefully with the huge, sweeping ""Ambition"", a dignified snares-off dirge. Like many great brit-rock records, <em>Some Cities</em> is plucky and resilient-- it wants badly to show you its hurt but wouldn't dare spill its guts straight; that would be impudent. Doves know better: They hold their breath to the end, until, wheezing and transparent, their hearts shine clear.</p></div>"|2432.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2432-some-cities/|7.8|Sam Ubl

But while some cats are trying to make sense from absurdity by calling a spade a spade, let's be perfectly honest: The rock guitar vs. emcee isn't new. Run DMC did it, Public Enemy did it, even Onyx did it. Fortunately, DJ Ayres and co. skip the semantics: <i>It's the Motherfucking Remix</i>. Known for the innovative sets at the Brooklyn-based Rub parties, <i>The Remix</i> carries all the energy and creativity for BK crowds itchin' to scuff up their dancing shoes.</p><p>
    
    The collection capitalizes on two elements: originality and flow. Listening to Mobb Deep's Prodigy boast about murderous blood splatters on his daughter over the <i>Ghostbusters</i> theme evokes a few chuckles, but succeeds because the synth-tuba perfectly accents the Queensboro duo's spitfire. Nick Catchdub's cross between middle school favorite ""Cannonball"" and ""Party &amp; Fire-Shit"" combines a fiery Rah ""Ima beat that bitch with a bat"" Digga with Lollapalooza. (For all you Phillyheads, it's like Y100 shaking hands with Power 99.)</p><p>
    
    Of course not every single was ever meant for cross-breeding. The Beatles' ""And I Love Her"" and Kelis' ""Milkshake"" is an unholy alliance of a shameful degree. Gregory Isaacs over ""Go DJ"" is wholly cacophonous. And Mark Ronson rides the gimmick pony with ""Bombs Over Baghdad"" and ""Take Me Out"". C'mon duke, I know there's at least <i>one</i> other record in the crate.</p><p>
    
    And, of course, conceptually this doesn't clear any new ground other than offering a new platform for some rising deejays. Nonetheless, <i>The Remix</i> is honest and creative.  ""Culo"" and ""Let's Go to Bed""? Motherfucking brilliant.</p></div>"|2063.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2063-its-the-motherfucking-remix/|8.0|Jamin Warren

    Halloween, their rapturous vocal interplay and loping instrumentation
    turned a clammy taco/burrito establishment into a dense forest teeming
    with overgrown flora and fauna. Partially obscured behind a pile of
    amps and other equipment, Jewelled Antler kingpin Glenn Donaldson and
    Donovan Quinn, aka Verdure, gently explored the sunny Kenneth Patchen
    territory nurtured on last year's <i>One Thousand Bird Ceremony</i>. It was
    an understated and shadowy but assured performance.</p><p>
    
    The duo mines a similar dominion on <i>Life &amp; Love in Sparrow's Meadow</i>
    and the headier, already sold-out companion 12"", <i>Child God in the
    Garden of Idols</i>. Adorned in Donaldson's lovely surrealist collages,
    <i>Life &amp; Love</i>'s moss-covered reel-to-reel rollicks and shakes, mixing a
    seemingly endless supply of instruments (jaw harp, 12-string guitar,
    dulcimer, flutes, banjo, jingle bells, harmonica, etc.), field
    recordings, chirpy pine needle melodies, and lyrics involving Egyptian
    birds, waterside tents, patchwork dream languages, orange blooms on
    fire, ballrooms of glitter and tambourines, hinterland holy places,
    Blakean mythologies, and other strange/beautiful things.</p><p>
    
    On the jubilant ""Minotaur (Burn a Candle for Love)"", Donovan sings of a
    shepherd who ""Wishes he was a prairie bird/ But instead he's a
    butcher's son/ Dreaming of painted, panther-eyed girls"" until Donaldson issues an ecstatic boy-flutes-can-rock
    bridge. But whatever the
    subject, Donaldson's aromatic, pristine falsetto aims for the
    upper branches and baby-faced Quinn's breathier scratch drifts through
    the sage-drenched undergrowth, telling tales of girls who take their
    names from saints.</p><p>
    
    Musically, the pop psychedlia is finely tuned.
    Jaunty opener ""Mother The Sun Makes Me Cry"" ushers in an assortment of
    archetypal sunny Skygreen Leopards sing-a-longs, but the
    standouts here are the four downtrodden pieces,
    especially ""The Supplication of Fireflies"" and ""A Child Adrift"". On
    the former, an ocarina dances with a ringing guitar behind Quinn's libretto (""Fireflies rejoice/ Fireflies send their sparks across the skies/ Heavy words fly up like ashes/ They scatter into lightness/ The blackened walls tumble/ The
    fireflies dance"") and a harmonizing chorus. The track ends with a
    nighttime snippet of what sounds like a frog pond-- croaks, chirps,
    waterlogged crickets. ""A Child Adrift"" is Donaldson's time to shine. He leads a lovely attack with echoing Wordsworth vocalizations that
    coast over Quinn's sighs, and a lonesome guitar accompanied
    by tambourine and the faraway echoes of a ""bleeding
    whippoorwill guitar.""</p><p>
    
    These junkshop questing, alchemical high naturalists don't offer much
    variation in their album-to-album approach, but the gentle insistence
    on a singular aesthetic lends an aura of a protracted ceremony. And
    though recorded humbly in a trailer on a horse ranch, the difference
    between this and past Leopards works is a slightly sharper recording
    quality-- though, fortunately, background hiss/upfront breaths 
    remains-- as well less time given over to unadulterated field recordings, 
    airy instrumental passages, and doses of Thuja/Blithe Sons-style agrarian
    drone.</p><p>
    
    While <i>Life &amp; Love</i> is tighter than previous albums, the tumbledown
    song-by-song feel is anything but constrained. No matter how often
    you spy these Californian versifiers darning their grassy knoll,
    there's a sense of rambling, ad hoc discovery in each new layer,
    fallen leaf, and jubilant pigment, as the two construct a decaying
    tree-fort of silver threads and the most beautiful baubles. Forget the
    band's patron poetic saint Kenneth Patchen: This is the music Keats
    and Shelley could be making if they were astute finger pickers who
    possessed an intimate knowledge of the west-coast landscape, blissful
    psychedelia, and a skyborn Ziploc bag of Coleridge's Edenic opiates.</p></div>"|7760.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7760-life-love-in-sparrows-meadow/|7.8|Brandon Stosuy

But in a way they were never really gone, as they've filled the space in between records as a unit with side projects and collaborations too numerous to detail here, though the best of them-- <i>DOME</i> and Colin Newman's solo work-- have more than held their own in the shadow of the Wire mothership. And Newman's on-the-side vitality hasn't dimmed a bit (though he seems to be running out of good names for his projects-- how awful is Githead?), as this latest EP amply proves.</p><p>
     
    Newman is only the biggest name in the Githead liners-- the band is actually a partnership with Robin Rimbaud, aka Scanner, and Newman's wife Malka Spigel, late of Minimal Compact. Rimbaud features in the unexpected role of guitarist, though he and Newman hardly play anything like a traditional riff. Instead, they fill these songs with watery textural washes reminiscent of Vini Reilly and pointilistic, Belew/Fripp-ish interplay. Spigel's bass thumps and bounces, giving Newman's detached vocal leads a funky underpinning and helping to humanize the rhythms provided by something called the Beat Monster.</p><p>
     
    For his part, on the mic Newman balls his emotions up tightly and shoves them down into his shoe, intoning blankly with loosely connected phrases that conjure fleeting images of clinical death and, um...creativity? The lyrics he's whispering or trading off with his bandmates (each gets at least a couple of verses) are largely incidental, though they fit well within the hospital-clean confines of the music, where any emotional leakage comes out in the guitars and the beats are all sharp and to the point.</p><p>
     
    It's actually not difficult to imagine <i>A Bell Is a Cup</i>-era Wire coming up with something like this, though Spigel's deft funkiness-- especially on ""Profile""-- helps set the two sounds apart some. As such, it's the kind of side record that normal Wire fans are likely to find interesting, and it's even a project I wouldn't mind hearing a full-length album from, if the participants are so inclined.</p></div>"|3662.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3662-headgit-ep/|7.7|Joe Tangari

    they bow. <i>White Light/White Heat</i> is an obvious inspiration for the shambling drums and gritty, basic blues riffs on <i>Sincerely, Black Lipstick</i>, but there's also a hint of peak-era Rolling Stones. On opening track ""B.O.B F.O.S.S.E."", clean lead guitar melodies overlap with crunchy rhythm chords; it's both a throbbing blues vamp and an astonishing imitation of the Stones' tense pop classics. The trouble is, while the Velvet Underground were living their socially irresponsible lyrics-- and the Stones were at least convincing people they were-- Black Lipstick have a long way to go in the believability department.</p><p>
    
    Much of this falls on vocalist Philip Neimeyer, who's doesn't have much range but compensates with clever lyrics and interplay between other vocalists, such as drummer Elizabeth Nottingham. His self-consciously decadent lyrics sound appropriate when sung in a Lou Reed monotone, but he has a hard time belting it out. ""Over the nation/ All the haters/ Bow to thee"" sung in a resigned mumble sounds about right, but underlining lines from ""B.O.B.F.O.S.S.E."" like ""If the world's a stage/ Then the whole damn world should bow to us"" with gusto is something Neimeyer can't pull off.</p><p>
    
    Maybe because the band sounds so impossibly bored, melancholy suits it better than boastfulness. When things slow down, as they do on ""Grandma Airplane"", Black Lipstick manage to sounds even more lethargic than the Strokes; right down to the octave guitar solo, that band is a better reference point than Television or VU. ""Throw Some Money at it"" is a minor-key mid-tempo rocker that, like nearly every track here, ends in a Sonic Youth-esque breakdown of interweaving guitars and steady rhythm. These shifts in structure are proof that Black Lipstick have records at home dating past 1970, and their indie rock touch distances them from formulaic hero-worship. It sounds most captivating on ""Throw Some Money"", twisting and repeating its simple theme to a gradual crescendo. ""Viva Max"" and ""..."" are other somber highlights that navigate the line between disaffected and bored like expert cartographers.</p><p>
    
    Black Lipstick's brand of revivalism is an oddity: Their sound is blatantly derivative, yet they sound the least excited to be playing in that style. Of the bands compared to the Velvet Underground, success often lies in the ability to seem energetic and enthusiastic about the rampant pillaging of the past. Black Lipstick have gone the complete opposite route, which is either really clever, or a complete cop out.</p></div>"|770.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/770-sincerely-black-lipstick/|7.0|Jason Crock

Both are dominated by     apostate wallflowers who act a lot cooler and more self-assured than they really are, and their artists, despite     creating an aura of aloofness, are notoriously defensive.  If you wanna take the psychoanalytic bent, both have     masculinity issues: Prog compensates with double kick drums and the phallic gratification of rabid shrrredding,     while indie prefers to spin its shortcomings into anti-heroism.  This is not to detract from the legacy of either     music-- both have rich and diverse histories-- but the reps of each have been tarnished by generations of feckless     dudes whose spotlight-hogging has rendered the genres unusually susceptible to generalizations.  In fact, the terms     themselves are generalizations, almost always used negatively: These days, bands are most commonly dubbed ""prog"" or     ""indie"" when their music isn't provocative enough to earn a more individually tailored description.</p>

Rather than carrying over     characteristics from the rough-edged indie-esque stylings of their former band, At the Drive-In, or plunging headfirst     into the never-ending math equations of psilocybic canterbury prog, they artfully missed both marks: too sincere for     indie but not quite prolix enough for prog; too melody-driven for prog but not repetitive enough for indie.  Listeners'     initial bemusement enabled the band to transcend genre reducibility, which won <i>De-Loused </i>quick (if hesitant)     points from critics and fans.  But two years later, there are few other recent records for which putatively in-the-know     listeners are so cautious of voicing approval.  If you liked <i>De-Loused</i> (or thought so, at least) but often found     yourself biting your tongue in the company of others, you were probably in the majority.</p>
<p>The Mars Volta drew attention for its technical proficiency, but behind all the meter-changes and 32nd-note polyrhythms,     <i>De-Loused</i> featured some very strong melodies.  The album's best moments registered in part because of the galling     pomposity with which they were delivered, but the tripartite solos and Cedric Bixler Zavala's ornate vocal wallpaper     wouldn't have held up without a backbone.  The band managed to ingratiate themselves with so many who would have     otherwise relegated <i>De-Loused</i> to the realm of ironic pleasures because they had the tact and melodic good sense     to make masturbation acceptable for a deceptively Victorian set of listeners.</p>
<p>Of course, there was always the kid with the green Ibanez who didn't know better and staged impromptu Omar Rodriguez-Lopez     deification rituals.  With no apologies, <i>Frances the Mute</i>-- The Mars Volta's new 77-minute, five-track, gratuitously     subdivided, and feebly narrated album-- is for him.  Call it what you will, but be sure to have finished your homework     before tackling this gnarled swamp thing.</p>
<p>I'm reluctant to say Bixler-Zavala and Rodriguez-Lopez have become better musicians in the two years since <i>De-Loused</i> was released.  Any possible strides in technical proficiency are showcased in brazenly flown-from-the-rafters pandering.     But the Mars Volta are also a band in the truest, bluest sense of the word, and their strong unity actually manages to     temper songs that are premised on lack of temperance.  Solos are kept to a minimum; the band chug full-throttle on the     same set of tires.  Their most sophisticated algorithms are contained within sturdy sonic superstructures.  In this     sense, they're more Mastodon than King Crimson-- only they kick about a third as much ass as a Dream Theater side project.</p>
<p>Predictably monolithic and impossibly huge, <i>Frances</i> never stops chugging.  Its five songs are divvied up in     several, nearly indistinguishable movements, but the album moves wholly, as a gross, plodding, overstuffed mass.     Opener ""Cygnus...Vismund Cygnus""-- which is said to tell the story of an HIV-positive male prostitute and drug addict     born out of rape, but who knows?-- builds to a powerful, string-driven climax at around the eight-minute mark but     never bothers to come back down, staying aloft in a spiral of guitar arpeggios and overeager drumming before eventually     devolving into a chorus of synth textures.  At six minutes, ""Widow""-- a yowling ""November Rain""-style ballad-- is half     the length as the next shortest track, and still at least two minutes too long.  It, too, subdues into a wash of chattering     electronics, as if an envoy to the next, equally inconsequential track.</p>
<p>Despite its long-windedness, <i>Frances the Mute</i> doesn't require a long attention span: It's as mesmeric as it is     mercurial.  Like an effective pop novelist, the Mars Volta manage to convey vast amounts of information in easily     digestible fashion without saying much at all.  Zone out to the closing 30-minute ""Cassandra Gemini"" for proof: Even     at this length, the track seems brief, sailing by in stupefyingly uneventful fashion.  What may at first seem like     extraordinary, ceaseless fluidity gradually sublimates into wah-wah wish-wash.  Smoke a bowl first if you need to, but     nothing short of opium will convince me that there aren't more productive ways to spend 30 minutes trying to fell a     redwood with a plastic spoon than listening to this beast.</p>
<p>At least some things haven't changed.  For instance, <i>Frances</i> largely retains the audacity of <i>De-Loused</i>'s     lyrics. ""Cassandra Gemini"" approaches storytelling with the same breed of macabre circumlocution that pocked the band's     debut.  (A grizzled, possibly vocoded voice delivers this bracing narrative: ""There was a frail syrup dripping off his     lap-danced lapel, punctuated by her decrepit prowl/ She washed down the hatching, gizzard soft as a mane of needles."")     But no matter what your feelings for <i>De-Loused</i>, at least the band had a mind to curtail their most capricious     jams before they lost all context.  Here, they seem hellbent on making an album that's as contiguous as possible, and     the result is a homogeneous shitheap of stream-of-consciousness turgidity.</p></div>"|5118.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5118-frances-the-mute/|2.0|Sam Ubl

Like a lot of kids, it was one of things kept hidden from me by my parents, along with my dad's <i>Playboy</i>s and the truth about unicorns. And just as I proudly tried to convince my kindergarten colleagues about the existence of strange, horned horses, a significant part of my life has been under the impression that music made specifically for dancing was inherently crappy. Laugh now, but there are still many who believe this. My mother, for one-- of course, she also tends to say things like, ""the 70s were the worst decade ever."" She grew up in a different era, with different values, but she isn't the only one. We all know people who still shudder at the mention of disco (or prog or jazz or new age or any other suspiciously, popularly maligned genre of music), and for the most part, we give them their space. After all, different strokes, right?</p><p>
    
    My mother's contempt for disco has mostly to do with the fact that it (just like the decade of the 70s in general) usurped her generation's idea of ""fun,"" transforming her into an outsider almost overnight. Sixties kids thought that having fun meant getting together with people you loved, listening to music that meant something to everyone there and looking forward to a world where a peaceful, open-minded community would have their day. To them, disco was just another reminder that materialism and obsession with self would never really go away, that their dreams weren't necessarily the way the rest of the world thought about things (even though, ironically, polyester-donned boomers were hugely responsible for disco's mainstream success).</p><p>
    
    However, I think this is different for today's kids. We grew up hearing about how bad disco was, but because we weren't actually there to decide for ourselves, most of the wisdom is second-hand. Thus, claims like ""they don't even write their own songs"" or ""it's fake music,"" which were arguably valid prejudices (misguided though they sound to me) for a generation hopeful that peace, love, and understanding were universal values, mean something slightly different for us. When I say that uber-producer Giorgio Moroder was the first person to produce an entirely digital LP, it doesn't necessarily mean that his music was ""fake""-- in fact, if anything, in light of most of what we listen to, it's a feather in his cap. Today's ""rockists"" (which is really just a fancy distinction for people who hold onto any particular set of values re: music at the expense of everything else) don't generally bring up truly interesting dichotomies of community versus self or majority versus minority. To them, music has a more abstract relationship to identity, one obscured by inherited judgments and not as easily penetrated.</p><p>
    
    Moroder is an interesting case because he sidesteps most ""disco sucks"" arguments due to the fact that he <i>did</i> write his own stuff, <i>did</i> produce it, and even went to so far as to design much of his studio. Like Kraftwerk, he had long been interested in the possibilities of electronic music in pop, and with partner Pete Bellotte, used his background in pop songwriting and arranging to forge one of the most successful production partnerships of the 70s. At their Musicland studios in Munich, Germany, the pair made their greatest claim to fame making records for Donna Summer, though Moroder also worked with Sparks, Blondie, and Japan, among dozens of others. His method, though behind-the-scenes as were most of the great disco producers, was hardly ""fake"" or dismissive of the history of recorded pop up until then; rather, like ABBA, Lee Perry, or the aforementioned Kraftwerk, he used available technology and his own ingenuity to make music as suited to its era (and beyond) as any artist could.</p><p>
<i>From Here to Eternity</i> was Moroder's third solo LP (after 1972's underrated, if redundantly titled <i>Son of My Father</i>, and 1976's <i>Knights in White Satin</i>), and is a marvel for disco historians, and a perfect nugget of dance music for anyone else. Its opening sidelong mix predates house by almost a decade, yet would (and did) fit perfectly in the set of DJ aiming to keep people happy via Euro-centric electro beats and angelic vocoder-ized choruses. And that's the trick: there really aren't any choruses (or verses for that matter) on the first side of this record, it's a constantly evolving, perpetually changing suite of music-- which begs the question, ""is this pop?"" Maybe not. Or, maybe it's just one of the first visions of what pop would become for a generation of listeners who didn't necessarily need messages or refrains or catchy hooks to have fun.</p><p>
    
    Of course, given that the album opens with such a lengthy mix of music, you're better off diving in with the intention of getting lost for a while. The title track and its reprise mix now-classic Euro-house 4/4 pump (via digital kick-drum, I might add) with Moroder's distinctive, double-tracked tenor and a backing chorus of disembodied sopranos. Disembodiment was probably one of the reasons disco was supposed to suck for my parents, yet in the context of a decade when the boundless optimism and idealism of the 60s seemed suddenly, woefully inadequate, it-- along with punk's related undercurrent of disillusion-- was perfect. It was more than perfect; it was danceable! ""Faster than the Speed of Love"" brings the mood down from the opening track, segueing into the minimalist, ominous ""Los Angeles"", using a simple synth motif and striking harmony vocals to impart its momentum. ""Utopia-- Me Giorgio"" is more lush, with a percolating bass line and long, wistful backing vocals.</p><p>
    
    The second half of <i>From Here to Eternity</i> loses some of the charge, if only due to its comparatively conventional, disconnected structure. Still, the dark vocoder intro and rising intensity of soprano harmonies during the chorus of ""I'm Left, You're Right, She's Gone"" is a interestingly compact specimen of Moroder's way with a pop song, and only suffers when you compare it to his work with Summer from the same period. I don't believe there's much point in doing that though, and if the ""disco sucks"" brigade taught me anything, it's that using pre-formed biases and ideals to judge this music usually misses the point. Different strokes and our own ideals, right? Sounds good to me.</p></div>"|5639.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5639-from-here-to-eternity/|8.6|Dominique Leone

Which is not to say that Hanson's a fey moonchild in the style of a Marc Bolan or Devendra Banhart, nor does he channel the powerhouse androgyny of Boy George or Antony and the Johnsons.</p><p>
    
    Nevertheless, when his voice first emerges nearly a minute into the ravishing slow-burn of the opening ""Losing a Year"", its tone is breathy and angelic enough to make Art Garfunkel sound like Bon Scott, and so startlingly feminine that you might jump to verify that you haven't cued up a lost Cat Power record by mistake. Once the initial shock of his vocal timbre subsides, however, Hanson's meditative arrangements and skillful pop craftsmanship come to the fore, and underpin the album with artful, dazzling folk-rock that recalls the heady, early-70s L.A. orchestrations of Joni Mitchell or Judee Sill.</p><p>
    
    Expanding ambitiously on the expressive sincerity of his 2003 solo debut <i>Son</i>, Hanson has here decked his songs out in full chamber-pop regalia. With assistance from co-producer and arranger A.J. Mogis-- who has previously lent his various talents to such acts as Bright Eyes, Rilo Kiley, and the Faint-- most of the tracks on <i>Jeff Hanson</i> veritably drip with vibrant layers of piano, violin, accordion, and cello, giving the album a sumptuous breadth of detail. The most obvious recent touchstone is Elliott Smith's <i>XO</i>, but throughout the album Hanson displays the exquisite patience and subtlety to allow his songs to blossom gradually which, coupled with his extraordinary voice, should help establish him wholly as an artist of distinction.</p><p>
    
    Built on a base of fiercely strummed acoustic guitar, the aforementioned ""Losing a Year"" climbs methodically over the course of nearly eight minutes before cresting in a spirited full-group swell, while tracks like ""Welcome Here"" and ""Long Overdue"" are constructed around lush, two-fisted piano chords that carry the snap and jangle of vintage AM gold. Hanson showcases some deft folk picking on quieter cuts like ""Now We Know"" or ""Let You Out"" that, though they wouldn't have sounded out of place on <i>Son</i>, still possess an animated <i>Rubber Soul</i> appeal. And on ""This Time It Will"" he even takes a pass at sprightly alt-country, its breezy twang clipping along briskly like a colt out for its morning run.</p><p>
    
    As with his previous work, seemingly every song here sets about the gentle archeology of brushing the sand from past relationships to re-examine every minute detail, with each track addressed to some nameless ""you."" At times this can give <i>Jeff Hanson</i> a certain uncomfortable sense of personal invasion, but perhaps this feeling is just a natural effect of Hanson's entrancing voice, an otherworldly instrument likely able to make nearly anything sound as intimate as a lover's whisper.</p></div>"|3733.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3733-jeff-hanson/|7.8|Matthew Murphy

Besides the indie-folk bent and ostentatious titles, the primary affinity is logistical-- both groups are actually solo singer/songwriters supported by a revolving cast of musician friends. Succinctly put, Conor Oberst is to Bright Eyes as Perry Wright is to Prayers and Tears.</p><p>
    
    Like Pedro the Lion or Sufjan Stevens, Wright's music has a solemn, prayerful aura and an oblique religious bent. On <em>Mother of Love</em>, he's surrounded himself with friends from bands like Sixpence None the Richer, the Polyphonic Spree, and Ester Drang to flesh out his meticulously sculpted ephemera, a haunting synthesis of folk, rock, country, and electro.</p><p>
    
    ""Concerning Lessons Learned from the Aliens"" shuffles through various permutations of drifting acoustic arpeggios and chimes, ballasted by an elementary chord progression and a vocal turn reminiscent of Grandaddy's simplistic, easygoing sonority and Oberst's sustained metaphorical thrust <em>sans</em> melodrama or self-pity. Wright's skillful arrangements are a large part of the record's appeal, and here the various melodic snippets come together with a winsome string section for muted closing climax. By the time the husky, intense inflections and folk-rock exclamations of ""Cannot Eat Better Not Sleep"" roll around, it's hard not to imagine that Wright is the sort of restrained, concise singer that Oberst might one day grow into.</p><p>
    
    Wright wrings a lot of mileage out of songs that move in incremental dynamic shifts between whispery bedroom music and crashing electro-rock pile drivers-- the mordant hush and theatrical stomp of ""The Eventual Intimate of So Much Nostalgia (Hutchinson Effect)"", the distended piano and dark dirge of ""Above the Waves (Pluripotency)"", and the languid, demented choral inflections of ""The Slow Decay of Some Radio Afterglows"" all adhere to this template. Others don't: ""Rotation of Crops"" and ""Archaeopteryx"" are laden with staticky, off-kilter beats and ominous drones. ""Ammunition for a Bolt-Action Heart"" is driven by sharp pokes of bass and sleek rhythm guitars punctured by drum machine salvos; the pronounced loud/soft dynamic and direct lyrics mark it as the album's only unabashed rocker.</p><p>
    
    The record revolves around the theme of lost love, but Wright sets up a series of imbricate, evocative images that submerge us in the feelings while sparing us the pathos. Every time I say I never want to hear another concept record about somebody's failed marriage, one comes along that's lovely enough to make me to eat crow. But I swear to God, this is the <em>last one</em>. Now will someone pass me a steak knife? This crow is fucking tough.</p></div>"|6564.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6564-the-mother-of-love-emulates-the-shapes-of-cynthia/|7.5|Brian Howe

Ida's spare, mostly acoustic songs move with the slow yet ineluctable flow of a river; there are no rapids and few eddies, just the steady motion of currents and occasional crosscurrents. The band members are slow moving as well: this is their first album since 2000's <em>Will You Find Me</em> (and its same-session partner <em>The Braille Night</em>), which seemed to portend something like a career. After five years and countless solo and side projects, the band has reconvened as a trio: Daniel Littleton, Elizabeth Mitchell, and Karla Schickele. <em>Heart Like a River</em> features numerous guests-- including Cecilia Littleton, original member Rick Lassiter, Jean Cook, and Dominique Davison-- but these three form the core, and their voices combine as elegantly and dreamily as ever. ""I'm so lucky to be here/ Just to have you near,"" Littleton sings on ""599"", a sentiment clearly addressed to his bandmates.</p><p>
<em>Heart Like a River</em> wastes no time picking up more or less where <em>Will You Find Me</em> and <em>The Braille Night</em> left off. ""Laurel Blues"" wakes up with a gently plucked guitar and Mitchell's caress of a voice, eventually joined by Littleton and Schickele. There's a squall of guitar feedback, but nothing breaks the shimmering surface. While they feature piano, strings, drums, and even a little radio static, these eleven songs that follow rarely stray from this acoustic folk template, even as they set Ida's gentle eddies against a musical geometry of shoegazer spirals and lines of droning feedback. These songs are, unsurprisingly, understated in the vein of Low or Mojave 3, but their quietness too often works against them: The lull of the music occasionally dampers the melodies and mutes the songs' immediacy, rendering them politely unobtrusive and undemanding.</p><p>
    
    Likewise, the songwriting possesses a hushed timidity that can be intriguing, matched as it is to the evocation of people who are mere observers in their own lives. In ""The Details"", Mitchell sings, ""You could just take my hand/ You could stand up for me,"" leaving it to the song's subject to take action. But this passive-aggressive tendency becomes frustrating as the lyrics begin to sound apologetic, as on Schickele's ""What Else Could I Do"". In a descending melody reminiscent of Aimee Mann, she sings, ""If this is your idea of love/ What else could I do?"" even though the point is that she is doing absolutely nothing and doing it very patiently. What could have been a kaleidoscope of conflicting emotions-- anger, dread, self-loathing-- instead settles for a monochrome of resignation. If Ida's sound is like a river, the emotions the band conveys are simply stagnant.</p></div>"|4055.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4055-heart-like-a-river/|6.4|Stephen M. Deusner

Once you know you're getting long tones and gradual changes, you focus on the sort of details. The timbre is what provides the mood, and is what separates the <em>Tired Sounds of Stars of the Lid</em> from the very, very awake sounds of <em>Aube</em>. The best stuff finds that crucial edge between ""too pretty"" and ""too noisy"" and rides it like a water-skier pushed along by the lip of the boat's wake.</p><p>
    Matthew Cooper's Eluvium project has on occasion found this edge. I'm thinking in particular of the 15-minute ""Zerthis Was a Shivering Human Image""-- the closing track on his debut LP, <em>Lambent Material</em>-- which throbs with damaged energy even as a layer of drone buried deep in the center hints at a ultimate serenity. Perhaps thinking that he'd said his piece with the held tones, the next Eluvium album, <em>An Accidental Memory in the Case of Death</em> was a collection of short piano pieces. Heard by some as kin to the impressionistic minimalism of Harold Budd, <em>An Accidental Memory</em> strikes me as a riff on some of the dramatic cues from the soundtrack to <em>On Golden Pond</em>. Nice enough, I suppose, but insubstantial.</p><p>
    With <em>Talk Amongst the Trees</em>, Eluvium returns to drone with a renewed sense of purpose. While there's nothing here anywhere near the intensity of ""Zerthis"", the album provides enough tension and variety to keep things interesting. The exquisite 10-minute opener ""New Animals from the Air""-- with its billowy mass of backward guitar seeded with overdriven guitar patterns-- is the sort of thick sonic blanket which Windy &amp; Carl used to tuck us under. In a similar vein, ""Calm of the Light Cloud"" delivers on the promise of its title, filling available space with layers glowing harmonics. Throughout <em>Talk Amongst the Trees</em>, Cooper has it down when he aims for immersive warmth. Slightly darker tracks such as the quiet ""Show Us Our Homes"", which has two separate metallic seesaw patterns swaying lazily and falling out of sync, and ""Everything to Come"", with its anxious, distorted whine, retain a sense of relaxed contemplation.
    </p><p>
    As with Eluvium's debut, this album's peak comes on an extended centerpiece. This time the boost isn't provided by a threat of noise, but by a sense of cinematic grandeur. The 17-minute ""Taken"" is built from a series of strummed guitar chords that seem to be continually climbing upward on an Escher staircase. As it marches along ""Taken"" becomes almost heroic, even after you realize that it actually changes little with each passing minute. It's a big effect on an album consisting mostly of smaller, quieter ones. But still, it holds together. That prickliness that pushes my favorite drone tracks over the top is lacking, but it's clear that Cooper had other ideas that happened to turn out quite well.

I was poking around in Boston's Newbury Comics, as I often did in college, and that album was playing on the store sound system. When it came to ""Like Herod"" I positioned myself in a corner so I could watch everyone in the entire store jump about three feet in the air when the song made its abrupt shift from meditative quiescence to ear-splitting guitar squall, and I have to admit I jumped a bit myself-- even though I knew it was coming. At their best, Mogwai are a band with the power to move people-- emotionally as well as viscerally-- and Mogwai did both on that album, triggering a crushing avalanche of praise they've been trying to dig out from ever since.</p><p> 
     
    The end result of all that praise was that the band couldn't stay the same without being called one-trick ponies and couldn't move on without being labeled charlatans, but they moved on anyway and survived the feeding frenzy, not to mention plenty of critical indifference. None of their subsequent albums have been as good as <i>Young Team</i>, but each has held its own, and <i>Government Commissions</i>-- a cleverly-named new career-spanning compilation of BBC sessions mostly curated by the late John Peel-- makes this case better than perhaps the albums themselves. Revolving around a crushing, intensely visceral 18-minute performance of ""Like Herod"" that blows the already amazing original album version to kingdom come, the non-chronological tracklist emphasizes the consistency of the band's output and gives Mogwai a chance to show that the quality of later tracks like <i>Come on Die Young</i>'s ""Cody"" or <i>Rock Action</i>'s ""Secret Pint"" compare favorably to earlier, more widely acclaimed songs like <i>Young Team</i>'s ""R U Still In 2 It"" and the <i>4 Satin</i> EP's ""Superheroes of BMX.""</p><p>
     
    The versions of the songs the band floats through (unlike a lot of post-rock bands, Mogwai don't plod, they float) differ enough from the originals that fans will feel rewarded listening to them, but not so much that the record couldn't serve as a decent introduction to the band. Selections range generously across the group's discography, pulling from each full-length and a few EPs. John Peel's comforting voice (he truly was amazing) introduces Mogwai as the disc kicks off-- the band dedicates the album to him in the liners-- and they shuffle in with a bobbing take on ""Hunted by a Freak"", which also opened their latest studio effort.</p><p>
     
    From there, the album follows a well-sequenced arc that reaches an early peak on ""R U Still In 2 It"", and builds tension again through <i>EP</i> and <i>Come on Die Young</i> material-- including a mellifluous reading of that album's ""Cody"", one of the few vocal tracks present. The whole thing climaxes with ""Like Herod"", and as I said earlier, this version takes the cake and eats it too, rolling through its complex, low-key intro before bursting into a rage. The second burst is even more powerful and they draw it out into a crazed, 10-minute freakout that dumps you nicely into the hovering beauty of ""Secret Pint"".</p><p>
     
    Bottom line is that Mogwai are an insanely powerful live band, and these sharp recordings play like a unified set rather than a scraped-together compendium of disparate sessions. And though it's impossible to call this a proper ""Best of Mogwai"" disc, owing mostly to the absence of a version of ""Mogwai Fear Satan"", it's both a fine introduction to the band and a definite must for any fan, especially anyone who's seen them in person and wanted something that came close to capturing the experience.</p></div>"|5370.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5370-government-commissions-bbc-sessions-1996-2003/|8.0|Joe Tangari

It seems every hotshot Hollywood sci-fi writer prophesizes this. And, hey, after scientists recently unveiled robots capable of walking on varying terrain, I was a tad spooked. So how dangerous are machines in music? Are IDM sweethearts like the Postal Service and the Notwist in fact mankind's first casualties in this apocalyptic war? Okay, let's not kid ourselves, the stakes in music aren't <i>that</i> high. Yet, throughout <i>One Ten Hundred Thousand Million</i>, the second full-length from Austin instrumental trio the Octopus Project, the ongoing tension between acoustic and electronic instruments is pervasive. Guitars strain to be heard over effects-laden keyboards, basslines desperately pulse before chunky synth-lines supplant them, and at the center of this struggle is percussionist Tito Miranda.</p><p>
    
    Miranda plays the Dr. Octopus-- hee-hee-- to these unruly machines, simultaneously providing the songs with a strong rhythmic backbone while trying to maintain control of the music's electronic parts. Rather than using a drum machine, the band frequently opts to let Miranda pound away, even on the album's most rhythmically furious numbers. Opener ""Exit Counselor"" is a cyborg of a song composed of Miranda's measly human arms flailing to keep pace with bionic, stop-start synth blasts. Even when backing a guitar riff on ""Six Feet Up"", Miranda busts out thirty-second note fills, and even quicker crashes, relentlessly. As a result, these up-tempo rockers exude a plethora of energy, albeit with a fatiguing amount of fury.</p><p>
    
    Fortunately, most of the tracks don't inflict this level of strain on the listener. ""Responsible Stu"" and ""Malaria Codes"" are therapeutic laptop pop ballads amidst the industrial clangor of the album. The former especially soothes with a dulcet keyboard line so tender it almost breathes above an electronic beat as harmless as a crinkling candy wrapper. The true highlights, though, occur in the band's most balanced numbers. ""Tuxedo Hat"" bobs on a bassline innocent enough to be from a <i>Mega Man</i> stage while a modulated keyboard and fuzzed up guitar somehow harmonize with each other. With its atmospheric and strangely sad reverb-guitar/synthesizer interplay, ""The Adjustor"", the prize track here, showcases the ultimate potential of this electronic/acoustic union. Each instrument shares at least a piece of the simple melody before willingly handing it off to the next, and Miranda doesn't have to fracture his wrists to provide the rhythm. In other words, make more <i>Bicentennial Man</i>s than <i>Terminator</i>s, and everyone's happy.</p></div>"|6108.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6108-one-ten-hundred-thousand-million/|7.3|Adam Moerder

But his insights are filtered through a very personal perspective and come out his mouth as lyrics that are skewed, surreal, and often humorous. On Clem Snide's fifth album, <em>End of Love, he sings about the nature of love and the mysterious doings of God. On the title track, love becomes just another hipster trend, a comparison that gives Barzalay the opportunity to scold a fickle trend-follower (""You're the first to know when a movement's come and gone"") and observe that ""no one will survive the </em><em>End of Love."" On ""Jews for Jesus Blues"", he peruses the promises of Christianity and realizes ""now that I'm saved I miss being lost."" And he tries to answer the age-old question, Why do bad things happen to good people?, on ""God Answers Back"", and comes up with something much better than, say, ""God Shuffled His Feet"": ""Your blood will color every sunset/ Your tears will help Me grow some trees.""</em></p><p>
    
    These are big big issues (are there any bigger?), inspired by the deaths of his mother and his mother-in-law. But Barzalay works better with small moments, things that everyone experiences but few actually take time to consider. Through these instances (as on ""Joan Jett of Arc"" from <i>The Ghost of Fashion</i> and ""Made for TV Movie"" from <em>End of Love) he catches brief glimpses of life and death but only hints at their dwarfing magnitude. When he faces them head-on, they ironically become smaller in scale-- less daunting and therefore less affecting.</em></p><p>
    
    So <em>End of Love isn't Barzalay's best collection of songs, and the production tends to gloss over the instruments so songs like ""Collapse"" and ""When We Become"" sound subdued and blandly unobtrusive. Still, the album has some unaffected gems, including closer ""Weird"", which sounds like it was recorded during a party and effortlessly pops the bubbles of the self-proclaimed oddballs who ""aren't as weird as you'd like me to think."" Best of all is the quiet ""Made for TV Movie"", in which a Lucille Ball biopic inspired a Tolstoyian revelation: ""They would never make a movie if everything was great/ Because happiness is boring.""</em></p><p>
    
    What makes ""Made for TV Movie"" so sublime (in the sense of both overwhelming and mortally terrifying) isn't the playful songwriting, but the sound. An unidentified young girl, no more than four or five, sings on the bridge, a couple of measures of wordless la la las. But she's utterly charming, not only in her innocently arhythmic delivery but in the reaction she solicits from Barzalay. He turns his attention from the microphone to the child, and the world closes in around them. It's maybe the most intimate moment captured on a Clem Snide album-- completely unrehearsed, unaffected, and endearing.</p></div>"|1503.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1503-end-of-love/|6.7|Stephen M.

    were long and white.</p><p>
    I say: On this, their third plate (oops, Babelfish again), Logh have
    created yet another sparse, precise slowcore epic with colossally
    imbecilic Swedish-into-English lyrics. On ""Destinymanifesto"" (yes, one
    word), singer/guitarist Mattias Friberg whispers, emo-wise,
    ""Destiny's dead/ I cut its head off."" On ""The Big Sleep"" (nothing
    like Chandler's L.A.!) he adds, ""Beauty hides in your eyes"" and ""I'm
    heavier than a broken heart."" No, really. On aptly titled ""Bring on
    the Ether"": ""Time is the enemy,"" which was my 12th-grade mantra thanks
    to MxPx. On ""Asymmetric Twins"": ""I wrote a letter to the king and

    There is a song-- notable because it's a song and not one average
    guitar lick repeated over and over and turned into an instrumental,
    like the album's opening and closing tracks-- called ""Trace Back the

    The album comes with a DVD of the band recording the album (live),

That's not a backhanded compliment either: <i>High Society is one of the best straight-up indie rock albums of the past decade, and Enon's last one, </i><i>Hocus Pocus</i>, wasn't nearly as bad or disappointing as everyone made it out to be. ""The Power of Yawning"" and ""Candy"" yucked it up, sure, but John Schmersal and Toko Yasuda really were just starting to write together, and when the two did jive, Enon gave us ""Starcastic"" and ""Disposable Parts""-- as unyuck as songs get.</p><p>
<i>Lost Marbles And Exploded Evidence</i>-- playing off seven-inches entitled ""Evidence"" and ""Marbles Explode"", both included-- collects Enon's non-LP material released on wax, as mag promos, and web exclusives from as early as April 1998, when Enon was just Schmersal, some synths, and a sampler. In fact, the comp covers all four of Enon's line-ups, an understandable red flag for ""inconsistency"" and ""grab-bagginess"" and ""fans only, non-fans!"" as crits who are anxious to pounce on these guys have lazily pointed out. Weeeee.</p><p>
    
    Thing is, guys, the comp's way less about caulking Enon's cracks and way more about jocking Schmersal. He deserves the love, frankly. He's one of indie rock's most consistently compelling songwriters; this comp shows Schmersal can also take the band in more experimental directions, indulging his whims but only for our pleasure. Drum machine/gristly saxophone face-off ""Genie's Got Her Bag"" throbs like a jazz-funk great; crooked lullabies ""Blow Infinite Ways"", ""Making Merry! Merry!"", and ""Fly South"" posterkid DIY lo-fi way better than that Ariel Pink guy; ""Party Favor"" wants to be <em>Odelay</em>, and to the song's credit, it pretty much is.</p><p>
    
    So that's the experimental stuff. As for the rest of <em>Lost Marbles</em>, Enon stumble a bit on schmaltzy Toko triphoppers ""Drowning Appointments"" and ""Evidence"", and lap-pop number ""Kanon"" is just OK. Most other songs are rockers though, on par with the band's best moments on <em>High Society</em> and <em>Hocus Pocus</em>. Schmersal and Yasuda meet halfway on opener ""Knock That Door"", a sunnier, sillier ""In This City"". ""Marbles Explode"", released in 2001 but recorded two years before that, remains my favorite Enon song, though. It has plenty of vocoder and herk-and-jerk and bonsai synth lines, noise that's obedient to song and not vice versa, and my favorite Pygmalionism: ""There's a girl inside my heart that's only four beats old/ I'm facing forward or so I am told/ Now fluxuating with a kiss into another mode/ And now she's dressing up her dolls before the marbles explode.""</p><p>

    haven't heard one note of the Slits' music: This is the first time the 
    album's been released domestically in the U.S. on CD (with the 
    obligatory bonus tracks). The album cover features three members of the 
    group wearing nothing but mud and loincloths. When the group first 
    formed, they couldn't play their instruments for shit. The songs on the 
    album offer an amalgam of punk's abrasive DIY WTF-ness and the spacious 
    relaxed rhythms of dub reggae. This album is a keystone for any and 
    all punk-based grrrl movements. And-- though it goes without saying, 
    it's often said anyway-- this album is terribly, terribly important in 
    the history of the rock music and the grand scheme of canonical flippity 
    floo flap.</p><p>
    
    Funny thing is, for all its import, <i>Cut</i> is actually a lot of fun. Fun 
    in the way Ari Up trills and coos and yelps across the songs like a 
    precocious schoolgirl taunting all the boys and teachers. Fun in the way 
    Viv Albertine scratches and waxes her guitar. Fun in the way Tessa's 
    bass and Budgie's drums slip in and out of grooves like lovers 
    test-driving the Kama Sutra. Fun in the way the group turns every subject it 
    touches into a giddy playground sing-a-long, whether it be a diatribe 
    against pre-set gender roles (""Typical Girls""), a story about Sid Vicious 
    and Johnny Rotten butting heads (""So Tough""), a cautionary tale about 
    PiL's Keith Levene's drug use (""Instant Hit""), or songs tackling other 
    didactic topics like invasive media propaganda, shoplifting and the 
    idealized love of a new purchase. Fun in the way producer Dennis Bovell 
    employees spoons and matchboxes as beat accents (in ""Newtown""), centers the 
    group's meanderings with a little piano or more traditional percussion, 
    and allows the band to occupy both punk and dub at the same time. The Slits don't destroy passerby: They stop them, dance around them, sing songs to and about them, 
    playfully taunt and tease them, and then pass them the dutchie.</p><p>
    
    The bonus tracks are OK add-ons-- the group's version of ""I Heard It 
    Through the Grapevine"" was slated to be the record's first single 
    way back in the day, and would have served fine as another 
    respectfully disrespectful punk cover, but appropriately ended up as the B-side 
    to the actual first single, ""Typical Girls"". ""Liebe and Romanze (Slow 
    Version)"" is an instrumental version of ""Love Und Romance"" bathing in 
    the hot and welcome tropical sun outside of Lee Perry's studio, and 
    serves as a pleasant cool down after the frenetic shenanigans that 
    preceded. But, of course, if you're giving this album a spin, it's for the 
    first 10 tracks, and if you're coming to them for the very first time, 
    then I envy you. Yes, this is an important document, and part of any 
    balanced popular musical diet, but this isn't a multi-vitamin-- this is 
    skipping school as spring turns to summer to spend an extra-long lunch 
    with friends driving to the not-so-local Jamaican bakery for a few beef 
    patties and some much-needed fresh air. Take a long, deep breath, and 
    enjoy the moment while it lasts.</p></div>"|7803.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7803-cut/|9.3|David Raposa

    America in the 1960s was clearly not hungry for nuance-- in looking abroad for a musical craze, it wholeheartedly latched on to the pragmatic soulfulness of Brits like the Beatles and the Kinks, but failed to chart the romantic abstraction of French pop stars like Serge Gainsbourg and Francoise Hardy. But in a different, more subtle America, one unsaddled with a desperate need to constantly prove its vitality to itself, a French Invasion might have replaced the British one, a mirror world where mobs of cool, calculating teens calmly adored Belgium's French-speaking Jacques Brel as he disembarked from an ocean liner.</p><p>
    
    Many American listeners are familiar with Gainsbourg, and there's a subtle contradiction you may have noticed in his songs that also typified those of his contemporaries-- they were light, lacy confections, all sweeping acoustic melodies and mannered <em>joie de vivre</em>, but the pristine, precise inflections of the singers also had an aloofness to them, a sense of distance alien to the American preference for ""soulful"" singing. It's no surprise, then, that the advent of digital technology has also seen a rejuvenation of the '60s French pop style: Digitally sampling analog instruments allows composers to capture this dichotomy of warmth and sterility more strikingly than ever before, and the genre is being not so much revisited as transformed.</p><p>
    
    Montag inhabits the aesthetic more fully than many of his counterparts-- M83, for whose albums Montag composed string arrangements, traffics in outsized versions of classic French pop's minimal melodic phrases, but lacks the slightly ironic remove; Air plays up the kitschy qualities; Stereolab emphasizes elegance and detachment but lacks warmth. On <em>Alone, Not Alone</em>, Montag has achieved a cunning equilibrium between distance and immediacy by covering the range between elastic, swooning electro-pop and concise, considered standoffishness.</p><p>
    
    While the latter category is pleasurable-- the digital clockwork of ""Le Temps d'Observer les Voles Ouvertes"" and the chiming serenity of ""Motif"" spring to mind-- it's in the former that <em>Alone, Not Alone</em> really shines. Amy Milan of Stars turns in charming duets on the fluid, clattering ""Angles, Country &amp; Terrain Connu"" and the Stars-style neon orgasm of ""Perfect Vision"", her mobile melodies darting around Bedard's whispery, deadpan baritone. James Cargill of Broadcast lends bass and electronics to ""Figures of a New Color"", a staticky suite of celestial strings and muttering samples. Ariel Eagle weaves her angelic, staccato syllables through twinkling chimes and Bedard's lackadaisical croon on ""Grand Luxe"", and on tracks like ""All I See""-- where Bedard provides the sole vocal presence-- he concocts jazzy chill-out that suits his limited range.</p><p>
    
    Montag pulls off the neat trick of being strikingly modern by way of chicly old-fashioned-- his droll lyrics and gorgeous, slightly icy melodies expand upon the traditions of the '60s French pop icons while honoring them, as he emotes with precision, restraint, and a sardonic eye. Let the French (-Canadian electro-) Invasion commence!</p></div>"|5625.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5625-alone-not-alone/|7.8|Brian Howe

    And though the Thievery Corp.'s trademark confluence of chilled trip-hop, time-stretched dub, and casual musical globetrotting initially appears as tranquil as ever, beneath this false serenity churns an undercurrent of political anger, disillusionment and alienation that helps charge the album with enhanced fervor and vitality.</p><p>
    
    ""Let's start by making it clear who is the enemy here,"" sings the Flaming Lips' Wayne Coyne, opening the album with ""Marching the Hate Machines (Into the Sun)"" a title that everyone should be able to get behind, regardless of political persuasion. (Unless you're one of those pro-Hate Machine nutcases.) Though Coyne never does actually get around to informing us who the real enemy is, the track is nevertheless an appropriately melted stunner of tripped-out, progressive <em>Dark Side of the Moon</em> dub.</p><p>
    
    Babylon continues to come under fire on tracks like the sternum-rattling throb of ""Warning Shots"" or the driving roots reggae of ""Wires and Watchtowers"", on which the sultry Sista Pat asks, ""How can the wicked smile while the world is burning?"" as acres of humid, Black Ark horns surround her with their insistent reverberations. Perhaps most astonishing of all is Perry Farrell's echo-saturated performance on the turbulent ""Revolution Solution"". Delivering what is almost certainly his most appealing and least mannered (read: irritating) vocal on record, Farrell here shows remarkable restraint, repeating ""I hope for comfort but I never felt too safe"" with a disarmingly genuine sense of vulnerability.</p><p>
    
    Less successful is David Byrne's contribution on ""Heart Is a Lonely Hunter"". Although the track features the bug-eyed paranoid isolation Byrne is famous for (with lines like ""Save bottles of water and flour and sugar/ Turn off the AC and hang up the bedsheets"" nodding politely to the Talking Heads' ""Life During Wartime""), the backing Latin rhythms and shimmer of keys never really congeal into anything memorable.</p><p>
    
    On this track, as well as during such brief instrumental numbers as ""Holographic Universe"", Thievery Corp. fall victim to their lazier, more antiseptic tendencies and their sound drifts dangerously close to the type of innocuous, Latin-whiffed wallpaper that Pottery Barn compiles to sell to your sister. Garza and Hilton thankfully recover quickly, however, and <em>The Cosmic Game's final five tracks constitute a veritable tour-de-force of trance-inducing fusionist bliss, carrying the listener from Jamaica to Rio to India with magic carpet ease before the quiet, hookah-puffing ""A Gentle Dissolve"" ends the game with a sigh rather than a scream.</em></p></div>"|8006.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8006-the-cosmic-game/|7.6|Matthew Murphy

The demos are lo-fi recordings of their first songs, recorded with a revolving cast of musicians around vocalist Lux Interior and guitarist Poison Ivy Rorschach. Only diehard fans will want crude recordings of already-crude Cramps originals and covers-- not many people need four versions of ""Rumble Blues"". These early recordings are a blueprint for the Cramps' sound, but Interior is a long way from finding his manic persona, sounding detached and mumbly through many of them.</p><p>
    
    The liner notes-- written by Lux and Ivy themselves-- are full of record-geek comparisons like ""Carl Perkins meets the Shadows of Knight"" or ""Link Wray meets Dwight Pullens."" The booklet essay describes trips to various records stores as much as the actual recording process. That's appropriate for a band who purposefully inspired punk's embrace of rockabilly-- their amalgamation of 1950s pop culture and obscure vintage rock was the careful and calculated construct of two crate-digging scenesters.</p><p>
    
    The second disc, comprised of two live sets-- one each from 1977 and 1978-- is more worthwhile, although there's a world of difference between the two shows. The first is the group's third-ever performance, a set at Max's Kansas City that sees the struggling band playing a handful of tunes to a cold and sometimes heckling audience. The longer second set, recorded at CBGB in '78, is a huge leap in sound quality, in the Cramps' confidence, and in crowd reaction. Lux Interior comes into his own as a frontman here, taunting and baiting the audience between songs, who respond with near-unbelievable squealing throughout opener ""The Way I Walk"" and songs like ""I Was a Teenage Werewolf "" and ""Love Me"" (which sunk like a cannonball in water in the earlier set). In one short year, the band apparently got a grip on their distinctive mix of garage rock, rockabilly, and crude humor-- and crowds were apparently taking notice.</p></div>"|1659.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1659-how-to-make-a-monster/|6.6|Jason Crock

    light-pop window treatments for yuppie denizens of the new Nashville.
    His latest is his second titular nod to Music City, USA-- 2000's
    <em>Home</em> was recorded shortly after Rouse moved there-- and
    arrives following the itinerant Nebraska native's move to Spain, where
    fragile Tweedy/Adams vocals are presumably less ubiquitous.</p><p>
    Rouse's 2003 soft-rock concept album <em>1972</em> bared his Bread
    fetish; <em>Nashville</em> returns to the 80s pop undercurrents that
    emerged on his 2002 breakthrough, <em>Under Cold Blue Stars</em>. The
    album's finest track, ""Winter in the Hamptons"", hews closely to the
    Smiths classic ""Bigmouth Strikes Again"", placing handclaps and an
    infectious ""ba ba"" chorus atop chiming acoustic guitars and a bass
    line that nearly quotes the vocal hook from Edwyn Collins' ""A Girl Like
    You"". But the most Rouse does lyrically with his urgent-sounding
    arrangement is: ""Put on your hat, because the forecast is rain
    clouds.""</p><p>
    If there's a single reason Rouse has never broken the David Gray
    barrier, it's his often-inconsequential observations. Sleepy acoustic
    closer ""Life"", harmonicas aspiring toward Saint Neil, will erase only
    the most superficial post-breakup hangovers with ""Just sing a song and
    let love shine/ 'Cause that's just life."" Try Love's ""Everybody's Got
    to Live"" instead.</p><p>
    As with past Rouse efforts, <em>Nashville</em> is always pleasant, if
    unexceptional. On pedal steel-drenched opener ""It's the Nighttime"",
    his awkward school/fool rhyme is only grating upon close listens, and
    his playful come-on about wanting to ""try on your clothes"" would be
    kinda cute even in the Bible Belt. While today's best-publicized mtvU
    acts act like imitating the early '80s is revolutionary,
    Manilow-tinged ballad ""Middle School Frown"" mentions ""new wavers"" and
    ""punk rock stars"" in the curmudgeonly context they deserve.</p><p>
    With a Pernice Brothers-sharp melody and swooning strings,
    ""Streetlights"" will please fans of <em>1972</em> (the album or the
    year). ""My Love Has Gone"", which opens ""Side B"", echoes the bitterest
    <em>Rumours</em>-era Fleetwood Mac. It's all nice, but give me New York
    or Hotlanta, thanks.</p></div>"|6843.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6843-nashville/|6.6|Marc Hogan

    age 11, ""Jesu"" was a term spit by the trashiest of neighbors whenever
    they were even mildly surprised, i.e. ""Jesu, this ACME Pineapple
    Soda's a mighty motherfucker."" To this day, when I hear ""Jesu,"" it's hard not
    thinking of those wiry South Jersey NASCAR-o-lytes and their
    puffy-haired, horribly accented girlfriends, uttering the off-key
    syllables, trailed by wafts of chaw or chewing gum. Even in the context of
    stuffy Bach's ""Jesu, The Joy of Man's Desiring"", I immediately think
    of Sebastian B of Skid Row telling me about his new pyramid scheme, his trick for spotting
    dear, and his forever-toppling prized stack of ""porns.""</p><p>
    In this sense, Jesu-- ex-Godflesh/Napalm Death/Techno Animal
    maestro Justin K. Broadrick's most recent stab at weighty brooding--
    has offered some much needed psychic distance.
    Though I don't act like it, I want to live to 100, and to do so I
    likely shouldn't carry around adolescent detritus ad infinitum.
    Fortunately, Jesu's self-titled debut is such an epic dollop of gloomy
    molasses abrasions that retools the word so entirely, I can already feel Wilbur, Fuzzy, and the rest of
    the gang slipping away like so many
    contestants at the annual greased pig chase.</p><p>
    Founded on poky dynamics, densely crunchy instrumentation and often
    surprising electronic accents and submerged melodies, throughout the
    record, Broadrick continually exhibits the most disciplined, slowdive
    patience before implanting a metallic backbone. <i>Jesu</i>'s eight tracks
    sound so uniformly thick-- and issue such an inexorable grind-- that
    it's easy to slip-slide inside the sludge and drown. Metaphysical
    volleys aside, the environment sustained is so submerged that its
    tones become habitual, disappearing into the fabric of the landscape
    as they continue to ring. Unlike the <i>Heart Ache</i> EP, Broadrick is
    appropriately backed here by the heavy Codeine beats of Ted
    Parsons (Prong, Swans, Godflesh), whose slowcore ascension make this
    record even more gigantic than its predecessor.</p><p>
    A stellar opener, the quite moving ""Your Path to Divinity"", gently
    eviscerates a heavy bass line, spotty drums, and airborne feedback
    bolts. Vocals materialize four minutes later, with an accompaniment of
    ringing notes that double the human voice. As with many of the LP's
    compositions, the drums fall out towards the end, generously leaving
    room for synth/organ and what sounds like an accordion, though is
    more likely something electronic. With pieces this long, codas can
    sprout new beginnings. Here, when the pounding returns-- as if
    captured with a different, booming microphone-- Broadrick's vocal
    notes hit a magical sustain.</p><p>
    That sedate flowering is quickly replaced with the crunchy Helmet
    dynamics of ""Friends Are Evil"", a distorted wire feed/assembly line
    leaking sparks across a concrete floor. Details are increasingly piled
    upon its solid base until everything blends into a net of ring-tones
    and locked grooves. These explosive repetitions bring to mind Hydra
    Head proprietor Aaron Turner's Isis, but the whispered vocal
    accompaniment and downer vibe are closer in tone to shoegazing.
    Whatever the
    touchstones are, Jesu mixes these ingredients into a dozy, dense 
    amalgam.</p><p>
    ""Tired Of Me"" should strike a note with
    those Ride/Venus Bead fans of old: It's a suck-face tune,
    even if the libretto ends with a murky parade of muddied marching-band
    drums. ""Walk on Water""-- the most totally protracted piece-- grabs
    hold of an upfront high hat, pitch-shift vocals, and waves of guitar
    angularity, and follows their wake for 11-plus minutes.</p><p>
    If this all sounds monotonous...well, that's partially the point. But
    for impatient ears, when it seems a tune might fall into tedium,
    Broadrick adds a buzzing guitar or shiny keyboard or some other
    not-so-obvious hook that expands it all over again in a cloudburst.
    His sense of space and three-dimensionality is at times uncanny. And
    for those of us who admire the patient beauty of a grimy Luxurious
    Bags or incandescent Jóhann Jóhansson,
    there ought to be more than enough intense, flat-lined passages of
    untouched drone to escape the rushed feeling of a pop beeline.</p><p>
    Now if only I could stumble upon some Slint-y dronecore band called ""Youse""...</p></div>"|4352.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4352-jesu/|7.9|Brandon Stosuy

Encoded CDs, planted mp3 loops, and early release dates are their security tactics de rigueur, but there is no way to stop me. I just traded the new Beck album for a brick of Afghani hash and a pair of Dunks made of kitten pelts and human skin. A Pegasus and the Ferrari it's hitched to both came courtesy of a really insane Fischerspooner fan in Belgium. If it weren't for file-sharing, I wouldn't have half the Coogi sweaters in my closet or the overwhelming female attention that comes along with them.</p><p> 
    
    On the other hand, independent labels play it coy. They don't do much to mask the content or stymie the transfer, instead encouraging purchase with elaborate packaging, enhanced cd's, and various other golden ticket bonuses. With Aesop Rock's latest release, not only is Def Jux offering seven brand new tracks but a limited edition 88-page lyric book spanning Aes' catalog <em>Float</em> to <em>Fast Cars</em>. The book is a downtown <em>Finnegan's Wake</em> translated by Travis Bickle, presenting in black-and-white the emcee's dense urban loquacity, and the EP is a welcome back Jukie party compared to the hermetic epic of his last album.</p><p>
    
    If you're looking at the book as some magic decoder of the Brooklyn wordsmith's lyrical mazes, no such luck. He's saying exactly what you thought he was. From ""Freeze"" off 2003's conceptual <em>Bazooka Tooth</em>: ""The robo-komodo promo Zen patience a-alike to this jittery drooling mess. Bitterly unruly on mud hugger alert, he usher dirt to the kick circus."" Fuck what it means, the transcription alone must have been about as fun as a colonoscopy. Sideshow is proof of Aesop Rock as a verbal collagist, clipping slang and pasting it next to bastardized movie dialogue and sideways references to current affairs. If nothing else, the book illustrates his evolution from abstract storyteller to abstruse social commentator. Throw in some stylized photography and Edwardian clip-art, and you got yourself hip-hop's answer to <i>McSweeney's</i>.</p><p>
<em>Fast Cars, Danger, Fire and Knives</em> furthers the template formulated on <em>Bazooka Tooth</em>. Aesop Rock produces three of the seven himself, longtime collaborator Blockhead handles three, and Rob Sonic cleans up with one. Aesop's takes are the standouts, future blends of Bomb Squad bulk and mid-tempo Eric. B rumble, that complement his cadence and intensity. ""Zodiaccupuncture"" matches funhouse organ with synth/guitar funk while Aes spews staccato indictments against the establishment and manages an Occam's Razor reference that actually makes sense within the context of a bunch of shit that doesn't. Camu Tao and El Producto join in on the one-upsmanship of ""Rickety Rackety"", a Mach-9 valentine to NYC, with each paying paranoid tribute to the Rotten Apple. Following along is exhausting as each emcee rips off speed-freak syllabic riffs on apathy, dishonesty, and escapism. ""Food, Clothes, Medicine"" stomps around like Mecha Sly Stone while Aes spits venom at either the homeless situation, or neglected veterans, or corrupt politicians. I really couldn't tell you which, and the lyric book didn't help much.</p><p>
    
    Blockhead and Rob Sonic's production is not as lively, but both provide enough of their usual sparse future funk to keep it interesting. The instrumental value of Aesop Rock's voice automatically fills any gaps left by a lazy production or rehash of an old idea. A lot of people cried foul after <em>Bazooka Tooth</em>, demanding more Blockhead less Aesop on the boards, but <em>Fast Cars</em> should silence some of that trash talk. Aesop's production here is clearly more confident, able and welcome, possibly indicating that his beatmaking may prove as idiosyncratic as his lyrical style.</p><p> 
    
    With the quality and effort put into this release, Def Jux and Aesop Rock have done what every EP should do, provide something of unique value and create anticipation for future releases. <em>Fast Cars</em> is more than filler material between albums, and <em>The Living Human Curiosity Sideshow</em> is a thoughtfully packaged, worthwhile memento for fans. The question is, how much can I get for it on eBay? Jesus pieces don't pay for themselves.</p></div>"|67.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/67-fast-cars-danger-fire-and-knives-ep/|7.9|Peter Macia

Comedy is when you walk into an open sewer and die.""<br/>
    -Mel Brooks</p><p>
    Negativland and David Brom's ax murder of the latter's family is an example of Mr. Brooks' argument. Brom's frequent arguments with his piously Catholic parents over what music he was allowed to listen to as a teen possibly led to his deed. After reading about the February 1988 murder that took place in Rochester, Minn., musique concrete-rockers Negativland decided to make the best of their financially doomed and cancelled tour. They submitted a bogus press release that claimed the feds placed the Bay Area band under house arrest until the investigation of the Brom murders begins. Negativland's college radio chart-topper ""Christianity Is Stupid"" possibly caused the fateful argument in the Brom household, the band implied. Once the virus was released, the news media banged on their door-- with the band usually declining to comment and the reporters too lazy to fact check. Whatever band interviews commenced were sexed up and edited to fit the news. Somehow, Negativland's recontextualized sample of Rev. Estus W. Pirkle's sermon where he sarcastically declares, ""Christianity is stew-pid; communism is good!"" was responsible for the ax murder. In short, the media fell into an open sewer.</p><p>
    Did Negativland fall in the sewer as well? ""Our act of creating a false association with such a tragedy will remain open to ethical interpretation,"" the band concluded in its liner notes for the 15th anniversary reissue of the <em>Helter Stupid</em>, their document of the Brom case. This reissue now makes the case rather quaint in our time when musicians immediately deny influencing tragedies (i.e. Marilyn Manson and Columbine).</p><p>
    Is the band offering the album as a lesson in the mass media's vulnerability to manipulation or are they laughing at the past? It is difficult take <em>Helter</em>'s two tracks seriously as one moment finds a <i>Rolling Stone</i> reporter calling to ask a band member (off the record) if subliminal messages are planted in their music-- ""NOW IT BEGINS!"" someone shouts. In the 18-minute title track, the infamous ""Christianity is stew-pid!"" becomes a happenin' break for a disco-schmaltz number that can teach elderly couples the Hustle at the rec center.</p><p>
    A deftly edited collage of newsbites and an advertising producer battling with his engineer, saying, ""Doesn't it bother you that evil messages creep into our commercials when you play them backwards?"" then follows. Corpses pulled out of the sewer are the props here. It is difficult to determine if Negativland deserves acclaim for displaying a mirror to the crassness of ratings-driven news or dismissal for enjoying that same decadence. If an artist were to pull the same gimmick today, to the wolves that person goes. Negativland could be rewarded for their bravery,\xCAbut publicity stunts can only go so far.</p><p>
    Included with the <em>Helter</em> EP is <em>The Perfect Cut</em>, the band's satire of 70s pop music reduced to disposable commercial dreck. Pastor Dick Vaughn, host of Negativland's long-running ""Over the Edge"" radio show, presents his ""Moribund Sounds of the 70s"" as interjected with sampled audio sales pitches for the most marketable music to reap millions with. The music gets the typical ""Over the Edge"" treatment-- media soundbites all orchestrated like a Carl Stalling Looney Tunes score. <em>The Perfect Cut</em> is more of an amusement than a critique as the loud horn blasts and the irritating choirs attest; yet, the satirical target is peanuts compared to our age where music is only believed to be made popular by what the test marketing and focus group data suggested. A finger cut.</p></div>"|5739.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5739-helter-stupid/|7.2|Cameron Macdonald

Blame it on garage rock revivalists like the Vines or Kings of Leon who've garbled and staggered their way to fame, or music magazines overly eager to publish which drugs Jet or ex-Libertines members take, but one thing's for sure-- sounding wasted is mod. Take <em>The Article</em>'s opener ""Daffodils For My Mother"": While someone literally starts eating a daffodil for money, singer Derek Meins giggles idiotically at his own jokes: ""Are daffodils edible?...Does your daffodil taste good? Two bass drums if your daffodil tastes good!"" Then, as instructed, two beats cue the stomping 60-second Toadies-via-Pixies rip-off.</p><p>
    Maybe Meins is merely compensating for Eastern Lane's ho-hum Berwick-upon-Tweed roots, but his contrived recklessness isn't working. If you're going to tug at heartstrings on the mushy piano ballad ""I Feel Liberated"", don't expect to pass for Johnny Rotten and not give a fuck on single ""I Said Pig on Friday"", which contains the album's most unapologetically gauche lyrics: ""Love is a glove that does not fit/ The pussy, the folly, the tit."" Come on, how do you not then snicker when the band puts their gear away on ""Goodbye Rose Garden"" and Meins grabs an acoustic to whisper ""I'll be waitin' till the big hand meets the small one/ And I'll be longing on my own/ I'll be waiting 'til the morning brings me 'round.""</p><p>
    Between these two extremes, Meins employs an over-the-top blues-punk wail, often clashing with the band's sober, comprehensive playing. In this case ""comprehensive"" means mixing post-punk with anything from Gin Blossoms riffing to Foo Fighters power-pop. The best result of this fusion is ""No. 5"", which grinds on a pretty seven chord before smoothing out into a sunny, delicate chorus where-- shhh!-- Meins finally sings with his ""inside voice."" ""For the Sun"" falls a little short of these expectations, but Meins' fieriness buoys the song despite its sing-along chorus and radio-friendly veneer.</p><p>
    Saying Eastern Lane have an identity crisis would be misleading; these guys simply don't know how intoxicated they actually are. What the band assumes is balls-out intensity on <em>The Article</em> is instead a self-conscious impulse to offset innocuous songwriting. You all know the type: The guy at the party wearing a lampshade on his head, screaming drunken obscenities, and chugging Tabasco sauce only to be found 30 minutes later serenading girls with his acoustic and some DMB.</p></div>"|2919.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2919-the-article/|5.0|Adam Moerder

He holds a mic to his lips to emit a noise that is a cross between a mosquito dazedly banging into a porch light and a junior high video class sound effect of a crashing UFO. It's potentially tragicomic, but there is nothing else to do or think about-- just to watch. One's ears can seem like they're bleeding with tinnitus until the camera shifts to the right. John Zorn blows half of his saxophone into a pitcher of water as if on life support, his shoulders high and face shrunken. Zorn is convulsing with each squeal while his comrade adjusts his noise-box for another fix. Eye's electricity now hums into a wail-- leading to a climax where Zorn re-attaches his brass to end the argument with the tone of a drill sergeant's face hit by a recruit's spat. Eye rips the tube out of his mouth and undergoes an epileptic kabuki fit. He almost screeches in key and rhythm to Zorn's blats; ending right on the beat. Their audience at NYC's Tonic applauds as if being on <i>Maury Povich</i>.</p>
<p>That QuickTime video clip of ""M.S.T.G.L. (moneysextripgodlove)""-- filmed during one of Zorn's 30-odd birthday party concerts he threw for his 50-year-old self at Tonic in September 2003-- could be another case of testosterone poisoning art. It could also be noise as the phantasmagoric possession of the human soul. Both Zorn and Eye embody the latter-- exposing the tension and sheer camp of the human body's barely domesticated noises. Eye's work with the enigmatic Boredoms often sounded like a rehearsal space with three bands screaming and out-drumming each other just to hear themselves. And then there is Zorn, who could fill libraries with translations of Attention Deficit Disordered-jazz into episodes of Ornette Coleman's America, grindcore metal dirges, and the genre-damming Cobra game-- the rules of which I still can't fathom after the 20th read-through. Both gentlemen can make listeners laugh, flinch, squint, cup their mouths, or walk outside for fresh air. The past few months saw two releases where Eye 'n' Zorn broke bread: <i>50th Birthday Celebration documents their Sept. 15 gig, while </i><i>Naninani II is a sequel to their '95 zoo animal revolt.</i></p>
<p>Listening to their new work was masochistic for me. High-pitched tones disturb me, and Zorn cleared my sinuses with one of the more horrific squeals caught live on tape in the 50th Birthday closer, ""Choronzone"". He out-guns Eye after his techie Sawai Taeji deliver a slippery cathedral organ drone that falls into a hole. In the opener, ""Postivia,"" Zorn berates a broken TV, courtesy of Eye's garbled static. The freak show element both entices and repels. In ""Microwavable Empty Highway"", Eye mimics a howler monkey's mating call to Zorn's balladry that places an arm around a stranger in a subway train and tells of modeling (prostitution) opportunities in Hong Kong. ""Sun See Soon"" is an old-fashioned dick around with avant-guitar legend Fred Frith squeaking along with Eye's microphone feedback and Zorn's vile birdsong.</p>
<p><i>Naninani II is stronger with finer studio attention to detail and ambient atmospherics. Echoes of the Boredoms are heard, as ""Espimo""'s rhythms of a pink-elephant chasing-woodblock and the saxophone riffs that tell it to shut up because it's trying to sleep, loosely recall the Osaka band's oldie, ""Your Name is Limitless."" More arresting is ""Fat Anarchy on Airtube"", where Eye's whooshed breaths and rollicking koto noodlings lead to a hymnal drone that seems to make it difficult for someone to breathe, causing him or her to steadily pound the walls. ""Shiso Baba"" revamps the same electronic drone but oddly finds a sort of pantheistic awe in the temple bell tones and Eye's infantile utterances. Elsewhere, ""Kiri Taki"" resembles a mystic chanting a raga and pounding tablas to the tune of a nearby Pole Position arcade machine.

    Bachmann has now issued as many albums under the Crooked Fingers moniker
    as with his celebrated indie rock band. During the heady 90s, all
    Bachmann ever wanted was to be your spine. And now? He's Neil Diamond
    as hard-luck piano matador. Give him some candy.</p><p>
    The title track of Archers' 1998 swan song, <em>White Trash Heroes</em>,
    hinted at the direction Bachmann's next project would take: ominous,
    back-porch Americana, centered on his brassy ""Cracklin' Rosie"" vocals
    rather than spastic punk noise. Bachmann's literate songwriting and
    (college) radio-ready pop melodicism survived the transition,
    particularly on orchestra-laden masterpieces like ""New Drink for the
    Old Drunk"" or ""Angelina"". At a bar, those tracks would be ordering
    whiskey shot-for-shot with W.C. Fields while most of <em>Dignity and
    Shame</em> was in the bathroom spewing its second sangria.</p><p>
    The latest from Bachmann and his rotating cast of accompanists is a
    loosely conceptual Iberian love epic. ""Loosely,"" because only three or
    four songs really relate to the cover art's red-devil bullfighter and
    the lusty flamenco dancers on the back (the soused narrator of
    <em>Graceland</em>-bouncy ""Valerie"" probably isn't serenading a
    señorita). Early reviews invoking the album's ""Southwestern""
    influences should be forgiven; surely they meant southwestern
    <em>Spain</em>, home to the Andalucia province and its many bullrings.</p><p>
    Slow-building instrumental opener ""Islero"" sets the scene with
    Sevillana guitar flourishes, wistful Latin trumpets, and faraway
    congas. The piece takes its name from the bull that gored
    the famous matador Manolete to death in 1947. Yet at the song's apex,
    where a Gipsy Kings dance number might have emerged had Bachmann
    rolled a strike, instead there's just ""Weary Arms"", a preachy (if
    catchy) series of cavernous bromides. ""You've been waiting your whole
    life to make your move/ So make your move,"" we're told.</p><p>
    ""Andalucia"" sheds more light on Bachmann's Spanish
    theme. Pitter-patter drums and a numbing guitar riff square off with
    wide-open choruses about a girl named Antonita and the album's most
    allusive lyrics. The summer of 1917 was ""splendid"" in Andalucia, the
    song asserts, presumably due to romance. This was a few years before
    Ernest Hemingway's arrival, and Spain was wracked with workers'
    strikes inspired by the Bolshevik Revolution. It's also the summer
    Manolete was born. The narrator, a matador himself, boldly challenges
    the ""Miuras"" -- Islero's breed of bull, and the most feared. But his
    prayers to Saint Veronica, who is credited with giving Jesus a kerchief 
    to wipe his brow on the road to Golgotha, apparently go unanswered. For some reason (a wound, most likely), the young bullfighter must leave 
    behind Antonita and his homeland for one year. ""Andalucia"" is a farewell 
    love song.</p><p>
    Regrettably, no other song here has a lyric nearly as compelling as ""Andalucia""-- 
    a major flaw for what is essentially a pedal steel-enhanced
    singer/songwriter album. ""Call to Love"" offers an awkward metaphor and
    one of a few duets with Australian singer Lara Meyerratken. ""How am I
    supposed to hear or take heed to this call to love?"" is among
    the stilted lines Bachmann gives her, while the verse melody
    unflatteringly meshes with Tom Petty's ""American Girl"". As male-female
    back-and-forth goes, this is no ""You Don't Bring Me Flowers"" (or
    ""Nothing Better"", or ""I Got a Man"", or...).</p><p>
<em>Dignity and Shame</em> also sheds blood from its chosen genre's
    double-edged sword: This kind of rootsy, ruminative pop inevitably
    teeters on the brink of the AAA abyss-- a place where songs are served in tall,
    grande, and venti. If you thought the previous Crooked Fingers albums
    showcased Bachmann's softer side, you haven't heard ""Twilight Creeps"",
    in which he muses, ""Why does everybody act so tough/ When all anybody
    wants is to find a friend?""</p><p>
    One of the disc's
    most instantly memorable songs is, for better or worse, ""Twilight Creeps""
    is also the first of several where Bachmann's falsetto sounds
    uncannily like the dude from Five for Fighting. Well, it's not easy to
    be Bachmann, either: ""Where are you, love?"" he laments on acoustic
    weeper ""You Must Build a Fire"". And where are you, the subtle genius
    behind ""Andalucia"" and <em>Vs. the Greatest of All Time</em>?</p><p>
    On ""Destroyer"", Bachmann's narrator seems to confuse the
    intimate/violent man-bull relationship with the interpersonal kind,
    telling a lover to ""lay down, let it come"" and ""resign your heart
    today to get blown away."" All of which may or may not be a coded
    message to Dan Bejar. At least there's a raucous jam at the coda,
    which the otherwise-forgettable ""Coldways"" also provides.</p><p>
    By the album-closing title track, Bachmann's matador-narrator is
    presumably dead, covered in mud and leaves. He's also back in
    advice-column mode, tossing out a few rhymes Jimmy Eat World would
    kill for: ""You've got to carry your heart like a torch in the night/
    Little keeper of light/ Burning deep, burning bright."" Dignified? I
    guess. But this kind of just-good-enough song-manufacturing coming
    from Bachmann, on a record that glimmers with underdeveloped artistry,
    is a crying shame. As he explains on ""Sleep All Summer"": ""I would
    change for you, but babe, that doesn't mean I'm gonna be a better
    man.""</p></div>"|1673.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1673-dignity-and-shame/|6.5|Marc Hogan

It's just the kind of scene, in fact, that'll give you a record like Final Fantasy's-- a solo-type project from Owen Pallett, who spends the bulk of his music-time playing and arranging strings for acts like the Hidden Cameras and the Rory Gilmore-approved Arcade Fire.</p><p>
<i>Has a Good Home</i>, though, turns out to be a perfectly charming thing all on its own-- a slight little thing, maybe, but an awfully friendly one. Pallett's a bit of a classicist and a decent writer of low-key pop songs, which he's arranged here with a pleasantly minimal, umm, palette: Mostly just the pizzicato pluck and bowed harmonies of his violin, visited here and there by acoustic guitars, horns, or whatever else seems useful. The setup starts off in a losing battle with Andrew Bird, who's already taken the man/violin/tapeloop triad to incredible levels of elegance. Then you realize that Pallett's songwriting agenda is a little simpler than that--full of enough straight lines and sappy hooks to leave some of these tracks sounding more like the Kings of Convenience are trying to impress a cellist.</p><p>
    
    Somewhere between those poles, Pallett finds enough good moves to make me wish I could follow more of the Canadian references sprinkled through his lyrics. Most immediately winsome is ""This Is the Dream of Win and Regine"", which makes good on its dual namecheck (Dntel/Postal Service, Arcade Fire) with a terrifically sprightly pop number, all stirring 80s melody and delicate violin harmonies. More impressive are the moments where Pallett plays to his strengths and arranges himself like a chamber group: ""That's when the Audience Died"", surely the most gorgeous thing here, starts off with his best vocal performance, then lets the strings well up enough to script some leads. Mix in some gems of genuine Canadian lyricism-- ""she has not been able to sleep/ Since the days of Trudeau""-- and it's all of the album's strengths in four minutes.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately for us, hits like that lie a little sparse over these sixteen brief tracks. Sometimes it's Pallett's pinched-up voice that falters; sometimes it's that the songs are too rote, sophisticated in form but lacking in flavor. The sedate form, the variations in sound, and the easy-on-the-ears violin tone all keep it pleasant enough company, but a lot of these tracks aren't likely to really grab anyone who hasn't already spent the winter wishing Joanna Newsom were a guy with a normal voice and a more easygoing disposition. For the time being, then, it's just cheers for the good ones: four or five tracks you'd be hard pressed not to wind up charmed by.</p></div>"|3334.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3334-has-a-good-home/|6.6|Nitsuh Abebe

Their pastoral music is a smoothie-laden jaunt through the Illini prairie grasslands with your feet listlessly dangling from the passenger side window of your Toureg as you head to the state fair or garage sale or marshmallow sunflower festival.   At least that used to be the case.</p><p>
    
    It seems Nick Franglen and Fred Deakin have changed tonal locales, aligning their temperances with the metropolitan.  If <i>Lost Horizons</i> was a tryst through a glorious, luminescent countryside, then <i>'64-'95</i> is the shiftless subway car careening through midtown streets and echoing throughout forgotten, bi-tonal alleys.  The country mouse pawns his acoustic guitar for an Ibanez and ditches his walking stick for a Zipcar.</p><p>
    
    With little more than the forgetful ramblings of an elderly man on the intro, ""'88 aka Come Down on Me"" sounds like the background music for mid-90s airplane crime dramas like <i>ConAir</i> or <i>Turbulence</i>-- the ones that always have that squealing White Zombie song in the background.  Fortunately, this piece is an anomaly.</p><p>
<i>'64-'95</i> succeeds when Lemon Jelly stick to their bread and butter: pleasant and facile ambience.  ""Make Things Right"" carries a wistful, dignified elegance with its melodious guitar track.  When they embark on other journeys, the results feel forced.  Tracks like ""Don't Stop Now"" and dance-y ""Stay With You"" feel as sensual as silk-shirted muscleman at overpriced bar whispering in your ear. And ""The Shouty Track"" is as annoying as the five-minute training tape for irritable parents on my desk from National Center on Shaken Baby Syndrome.</p><p>
    
    Lemon Jelly stood out from the Thievery Corporations and Amon Tobins by creating something wonderful and energetic.  They excelled at painting beauty but apparently have become victims of the city's stealth and sloth.  Having discarded layering and complication for realms more well-rehearsed, <i>'64-'95</i> feels like a postcard from a tourist rather than the urban autobiographies that DJ Shadow and RjD2 are able to so masterfully cohere.</p><p>
    
    Fortunately, there is considerable significance in the album's final track ""Go"". Flighty and driving, Lemon Jelly perhaps will take all they've learned from the metropolis to embark for higher ground, maybe walking tall like Bunyan's Christian from <i>Vanity Fair</i>, wiser and bolder from the knowledge of the city.</p></div>"|4728.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4728-65-95/|6.5|Jamin Warren

Small-label releases from this world are dominated by techno-fetishists (derived from Autechre, fond of track names like ""Fuut98[c-1]"") and back-to-the-womb pastoralists (from whom you might find a song called ""Glazed Tricycle""). There's not enough irony, laughter, and just plain goofiness. San Francisco's Sagan-- a project combining the sound talents of J. Lesser, Blevin Blechtom, and Wobbly with the visuals of director Ryan Junell-- seems intent on correcting this balance.</p><p>
    
    A deep-70s rusty-hued painting on the inside of the double digipack (audio CD + DVD containing short films and six hours of live shows) sets the tone with Carl Sagan's warm and knowing grin. Popular science and the cosmos are undercurrents throughout <i>Unseen Forces</i>, serving as a conceptual launching pad for a project designed as a unified whole. Track titles like ""18,000 B.C. - Figurines of Vulva and Waterbird"" and ""Rosetta Stoned"" hint at Sagan's fondness for the ridiculous, and the music holds up its thematic end by subliminally referencing early ancient planetarium kitsch and possible musics from beyond the stars.</p><p>
    
    The opening ""Theme from Unseen Forces"" is a retro zero-gravity fanfare with an almost painfully affecting melody-- the sort of thing you could see playing when Leon Theremin ascended into heaven. From there, however, <i>Unseen Forces</i> takes a decidedly abstract turn. As sometimes happens with Blechtom-related projects, Sagan seems intent on creating an entirely new music vocabulary on each track. Most of <i>Unseen Forces</i> is admirably non-referential, layering various muffled drums and alien synths with various squeaks, static washes and machine groans.</p><p>
    
    Though the music is certainly original, much of <i>Unseen Forces</i> is harsh and unpleasant-- loaded down with frequencies designed to cause headaches. Tracks like ""JabPunPlus (OnePlusTwo)"" and ""Fixed Eyes (Slight Return)"" often sound like high-pitched spinning machines thrown off their axis, cycling through patterns that seem to be slipping a gear. The awkwardness and imbalance seems essential to what Sagan is trying to do, but that doesn't make a headphone listen any more pleasurable. More engaging are ""Rosetta Stoned""-- which has a nicely propulsive parallel-universe electro vibe-- and ""Closest Living Relations"". Something of a Krautrock tribute, ""Closest""'s nimble and spacious bass and drum grooves occasionally gives way to powerful mega-distortion riffing.</p><p>
    
    Sagan would prefer to see itself as a multimedia project, and the DVD is ultimately more of an attraction. Absurd short films by Ryan Junell reenact great moments in science with a cast that includes the guys from Matmos and members of Sagan. The acting may be student-film caliber, but the direction is strong, and the DVD's Viewmaster navigation interface has a few of entertaining Easter eggs tucked in corners. In the end it seems that Sagan's music sounds better with something to look at.</p></div>"|7798.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7798-unseen-forces/|5.5|Mark Richardson

We make references to babies and jokes about his beard, launching sweeping comparisons to bedroom poets past, yapping happily about Beam's ""quietude"" and ""grace."" And now, for the very first time, ""loud"" can be added to that arsenal of adjectives: the six-song <em>Woman King EP</em>, a follow-up to 2004's <em>Our Endless Numbered Days</em>, opens with relentlessly click-clacking pieces of wood and a brash slide riff, booming out in all directions. And we haven't even gotten to the electric guitar yet-- or the distortion.</p><p>
    
    Over the course of two full-lengths (and their accompanying EPs), Sam Beam has tweaked and re-imagined Iron &amp; Wine's whisper-folk imprint to include a much broader palette of sound-- anxious and intense, <em>Woman King</em> inches Beam even farther away from his scratchy lo-fi origins without sacrificing any of the microphone-eating intimacy that made his work so appealing to begin with. <em>Woman King</em> was recorded at producer Brian Deck's Engine Music Studios in Chicago (under identical circumstances, but separate from the <em>Our Endless Numbered Days</em> sessions) and features Deck's trademark mix of grainy, untreated percussion and spare-but-layered production (not atypically, Deck is also credited as a band member). Somehow, each step Beam takes feels organic, proper, true-- <em>Woman King</em> (much like <em>Our Endless Numbered Days</em>) is different, but fundamentally linked to its predecessors.</p><p>
    
    Iron &amp; Wine's album titles are almost always prophetic (2002's <em>The Creek Drank the Cradle</em> dealt with fizzled innocence, 2004's <em>Our Endless Numbered Days</em> tackled human mortality) and 
    <em>Woman King</em> is, for the most part, about girls-- fallen, absent, beloved, virginal, and nefarious.</p><p>
    
    Thwarted religion has always provided prime lyric fodder for Beam, and the stunning ""Jezebel"" recounts the rise and fall of the Bible's most infamous Phoenician princess, a pagan follower who becomes involved in a political marriage to Ahab, the crown prince of Israel. According to the Bible, Jezebel caused loads of trouble for Israel until Jehu, the head of a company formed to overthrow the house of Ahab, has her snatched and tossed from a window. Her blood splatters the palace wall; Jehu, on horse and chariot, charges across the body. Later, when palace servants return to recover Jezebel's corpse for burial, all that's left is her skull, her feet, and the palms of her hands. Jehu announces that Jezebel was chewed up by a pack of dogs, fulfilling the divine prophet Elijah's earlier prediction that ""the dogs shall eat Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel.""</p><p>
    
    Beam gently acknowledges Jezebel's brutal end (""The window was wide/ She could see the dogs come running""), but doesn't necessarily swallow the Bible's cautionary bent: Jezebel is typically read as villainous (with decent reason: she falsely accuses citizens of blasphemy and treason, and orders them stoned to death), but recent feminist re-interpretations of her story have questioned whether or not that vilification can simply be chalked up to the threat she posed to ancient patriarchal orders. Beam plays with his words (a glance at the lyric sheet reveals that he's actually singing ""wholly Jezebel,"" but, you know, say it out loud), and laments how Jezebel was ""gone"" before he ever got to say ""Lay here my love/ You're the only shape I'll pray to, Jezebel."" Ultimately, Beam casts Jezebel as more of a heroine (or an object of worship, even) than a righteously fallen pagan, turning ""Jezebel"" into a perfectly chilling ode to potentially misunderstood women.</p><p>
    
    A stripped-down version of ""Jezebel"" can be heard on the officially unreleased (but slipped under many pillows) bootleg <em>9/20/02 Home Recordings</em>, a collection of demos largely believed to be the Iron &amp; Wine songs Sub Pop opted not to use for Beam's debut. Still, the studio take of ""Jezebel"" is far fleshier, with Beam's classic guitar and banjo strums backed up by tinkling piano and tiny dulcimer swats-- a dizzying, wispy haze of strings and high, falsetto-coos that hold up well against Beam's very best work.</p><p>
    
    ""Freedom Hangs Like Heaven"", while no less religiously charged (""Ain't nobody knows what the newborn holds/ But his mama says he'll walk on water and wander back home""), is a boisterous, slide-fueled throwdown, perfectly acceptable for barn-dancing or open-armed room stomping. ""Gray Stables"" shows off Beam's knack for harmony (while singing with sister Sarah), ""My Lady's House"" is vintage Iron &amp; Wine, all acoustic guitar, slight piano, and lovelorn laments, while closer ""Evening on the Ground (Lilith's Song)"" is a tense, distorted ode to dark garden trysts (interpret ""We were born to fuck each other/ One way or another"" however you like), complete with spider bites and broken locks and urgent, throaty vocals.</p><p>
<em>Woman King</em> will provide eager Iron &amp; Wine fans a welcome holdover between proper albums, but the EP also serves a larger developmental purpose, marking one more evolutionary hop for Sam Beam, and christening a new genre-- post-basement.</p></div>"|4128.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4128-woman-king-ep/|8.5|Amanda Petrusich

Singers, whether live or sampled, take the chorus. That's the prevalent formula when combining hip-hop elements with other styles like rock or R&amp;B;, from most of the <i>Judgment Night</i> soundtrack to the Jay-Z/Link Park mashup to almost every Ashanti cameo. There are many ways to circumvent this reliance on dividing style by structural anchors, the most extreme-- and perhaps the most interesting-- of which is to disregard traditional song structures altogether. That's what a collective named A Gun Called Tension do on their self-titled debut, resulting in a highly organic blend of underground hip-hop and indie-rock elements.</p><p>
    
    A Gun Called Tension consists primarily of two musicians: Bay Area rapper Sean Reveron, who collaborated with the Beta Band on their reinterpretation of Three Dog Night's ""One"", and Dann Gallucci, one-time Murder City Devil guitarist and part-time Modest Mouse member. Each corrals a roster of guests: Roots Manuva, Airborne Audio, DJs Andy Sells and Monesa Yamakawa, Coady Willis and Spencer Moody of Murder City Devils, Blood Brother Morgan Henderson, Pretty Girls Make Graves singer Andrea Zollo, and producer Phil Ek.</p><p>
    
    As its name suggests, this project defines itself by tense outrage-- over political realities like the President's ""immaculate deception"" (""5+1""), and over lamentable music trends like the dominance of ""early 80s punk"" in indie music (""Gold Fronts""). While that dissatisfaction injects the lyrics with angry, restless energy, the real tension in the group's name comes from its music, which contrasts blaring rock rhythms with jumbled hip-hop beats and plays up the resultant friction on tracks like ""Treason"", a punk shoutalong that sets Moody's guttural vocals against Gallucci's grinding guitar and Reveron's upbeat flow. While the rock rhythms inform Reveron's delivery, making his flow more singsongy, he remains cool and eerily imperturbable on the intense ""Thelonious"", which beats like the heart of the album's bristling rage. Closing the album proper (before an acceptable ""Thelonious"" remix by Airborne Audio), ""Document"" unleashes that rage in an explosion of indie-rock momentum and urban/nocturnal atmosphere.</p><p>
    
    But the album's high-point is a sung/spoken duet between Reveron and Zollo on ""Electric Chair"", which has all the calm, swaying steadiness of a subway car, even as the uncertainties it documents threaten the singers' self-contemplation. Toward the end Zollo breaks off and sings wordless notes behind his vocals, and the effect is both bracing and haunting.</p><p>
    
    ""Electric Chair"", like so much of this sturdy album, works an understated contrast between calm and frantic, between ethereal and earthy, between confident and conflicted, between rock and rap. The album loses a little of its steam toward the end, when too many songs play up the rap side of the equation over the rock, but on the whole A Gun Called Tension is surprisingly balanced and beholden to no preconceptions of how these two styles should mix. Ultimately, the album cannot redefine these genres (what album could, especially without the benefit of time and hindsight?), but it does expand the possibilities of both, which is no small feat.</p></div>"|3668.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3668-a-gun-called-tension/|8.4|Stephen M.

    better than anyone else could have dared: ""I'm Big Baby Huey, and I'm 400 pounds 
    of soul."" In the 1960s, he and his band, the Babysitters, played everywhere from the 
    clubs of New York to private parties in Paris, but 
    Chicago was where they were best known-- and where they called home. The 
    band would play any gig that would have them during that time, from tiny 
    blues clubs to cruise ships. As a frontman, Baby Huey was talented, 
    flamboyant, and enormous-- anywhere from 350-400 pounds, topped off by a 
    giant afro. Unfortunately, Huey died of a heart attack at 26 in 1970, and never saw his debut album released the following year. 
    Since then, <em>Living Legend</em> has remained an obscurity, though its 
    songs have long been embraced by hip-hop, having been sampled 
    by everyone from Kool Herc to Eric B and Rakim to Ghostface.</p><p>
    
    This Water Records reissue keeps the album's original running 
    order intact, and adds no extras. <em>Living Legend</em> is a spare 
    effort by today's standards: eight songs, two of them covers-- one of 
    which is among the record's three instrumentals. However, <em>Living 
    Legend</em> showed Huey and the Babysitters stretching themselves in ways few 
    soul artists of the time did.</p><p>
    
    The Babysitters were a full band with a horn section that could take psychedelic detours without losing their 
    tightness or funky feel. They were the perfect foil for Huey, 
    who brought it all together with undeniable stage presence and an 
    earnest tenor that was compared to Otis Redding (which rings true if only for 
    their powerful delivery). Listen closely, and you can hear the ravage of 
    excess in his raspy crooning, before he leaps into the highest 
    registers with a squeal that's equal parts James and Arthur Brown.</p><p>
     
    Produced by the legendary Curtis Mayfield, three songs he also penned 
    make up the meat of the album. ""Mighty Mighty"" is a raucous funk shuffle, 
    including handclaps and crowd noise that give it the feel of a backyard 
    throwdown, with little girls piping in at Huey's invitation while he 
    praises Walgreen's turkeys and Thunderbird in his proto-rapping. Its gaiety 
    is infectious and almost overwhelming. The ""Hard 
    Times"" arrangement seems almost restricting for Huey's voice and 
    character, but we have to thank Mayfield for handing him the tune-- it's the 
    record's most memorable melody, and Huey's version 
    is superior to Mayfield's own. ""Running"" adds warbling electric piano and 
    guitar to Mayfield's melodic funk, the most lamentable example of what 
    the Babysitters could have achieved if Huey had lived to record another 
    LP.</p><p>
    
    And while the band out-performing Mayfield on his own songs is no small 
    feat, the two covers on <em>Living Legend</em> are, for lack of a better 
    phrase, utterly bonkers. Sam Cooke's ""A Change Is Going to Come"" begins 
    clunkier than Cooke's version, but one inhuman screech from 
    Huey and the horns kick in and the band dials it up. When the song passes 
    the seven-minute mark (and it eventually stretches past nine), Huey breaks it down 
    and channels the experimentation of his youth into a sermon on ""space 
    odysseys"" and ""funny-lookin' cigarettes."" The other cover is an 
    instrumental version of the Mamas and Papas' ""California Dreamin'"", which 
    straddles the line between smooth flute jazz and <em>The Funky 16 
    Corners</em>.</p><p>
    
    With very few original songs, Baby Huey and the Babysitters might come 
    off as nothing more than hired guns. Even if that's so, their lone LP 
    proved them versatile and talented as hell. It's a shame that no 
    reissue has rounded up Huey's extraneous 1960s singles, but soul 
    fans will be overjoyed that this record is finding wide release.</p></div>"|1151.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1151-the-baby-huey-story-the-living-legend/|8.0|Jason Crock

It's unnerving that this hypothetical machine would eventually achieve philosophical and scientific breakthroughs simply by chancing across the correct combination of words.</p><p>
    After spending too much time in <em>Live from Rome</em>'s claustrophobic ruins, it's tempting to imagine the remarkably prolix Sole as this engine of pure linguistic potential. Of course, this machine would produce everything between gibberish and eloquent treatises on ethics; following suit, Sole's apparent need to say <em>everything</em> produces songs of varied coherence.</p><p>
    Sole's style is meant to be jarring, and to express the clash of impassioned ideology and over-self-consciousness in its author. Many of us uncomfortably recognize the urge to dismiss our own passionately held political beliefs as clichéd, but Sole misfires when he captures this zeitgeist with too much fidelity. When his puns are intentionally bad, his flow intentionally torpid, his polemics intentionally ham-fisted, it raises questions about how intellectual intent mitigates aesthetic effect when gauging artistic value, but can still seem hokey, lazy, or pedantic. How close can a satire come to what it satirizes without becoming it?</p><p>
    Sole squanders several of Odd Nosdam's and Alias' polished beats by overstating his case. ""Predictions"" is one example, beginning with a series of groaners-- ""Debbie Gibson will make an electronica comeback/ Ice Cube will go feminist""-- that morph into a caricatured anti-capitalist worst-case scenario. It feels dishonest and artificial, which is unfortunate, because Sole in general seems neither of these. These missteps smack of a visionary who's wandered into an unsound region of his imagination.</p><p>
    But there are plenty of winners here as well. ""Self-Inflicted Wounds"", with the comparatively laconic poetry of its lyrics, a liquid flow, and ethereal beat, weaves enchantment from pithy declarations: ""I am to rap what Christian is to Indian,"" Sole spits with fanged poignancy. And in a typically contrary move, he's hidden his four best tracks at the end of the album, as if he were ashamed of their immediate, intuitive appeal.</p><p>
    On ""Imsotired"", a piano phrase subtly distends as Sole's distorted flow unapologetically straddles the twitchy drums. ""On Martyrdom"" finds him wreaking havoc on an elaborate 8-bit bounce track. The wafting spoken word of ""Theme"" and the straightforward crunk of ""Drive by Detournment"" ram the point home-- Sole's socialist screeds work well when he raps them like he means them instead of couching them in layers of affected irony. These songs prove him capable of focusing more on visceral appeal and less on stagy esotericism while maintaining his intellectual ambition, and one hopes this album is a steppingstone toward cementing this vision.</p></div>"|7320.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7320-live-from-rome/|6.9|Brian Howe

Charting all the way back to his days in Pussy Galore and straight through his chaotic decade-plus tenure as one half of Royal Trux, Hagerty has always stubbornly concealed the brilliant peaks of his unruly, willfully discordant soul, R&amp;B;, and classic rock refractions beneath a maddening amount of dead-end, solipsistic rubbish.</p><p> 
    
    Though Hagerty is too talented to write off completely (during Royal Trux's early-to-mid 90s heyday I would've counted him as one of the most underrated guitar stylists in rock), even the most sympathetic listeners may have grown impatient trying to follow the plot of his oft-rudderless meandering-- particularly in the time since Royal Trux's dissolution. Although the past few years have been among the most productive of Hagerty's career, his work during this period has been scattershot even by his permissive standards, veering incautiously between double-jointed folk, Canned Heat boogie, and half-assed cosmic country without truly excelling at any station.</p><p>
    
    All of which brings us to <em>All-Night Fox, an album credited to Hagerty's new combo, the Howling Hex. Some may recognize the band name from 2003's little-heard <i>Neil Michael Hagerty &amp; the Howling Hex</i>. </em><em>All-Night Fox is actually the fourth release issued by this mysterious new combo, although the first three were all released in 2004 as limited edition vinyl-only documents. So this record is, for all practical purposes, the group's debut, and happily it illustrates that Hagerty has again, at long last, decided upon a sound to craft as his own.</em></p><p>
    
    Containing eight tracks, <em>All-Night Fox clocks in at just under 40 minutes, a length that many contemporary acts might call an EP. Opening with the spacious, reverb-laden ""Now, We're Gonna Sing"", the record hits the pavement with all cylinders steaming, as Hagerty's squawking, curve-hugging guitar anticipates every corner, and the group as a whole resembles what might've occurred had Phil Spector ever corralled a teenage Captain Beefheart. The Hex even launches ""Cast Aside the False"" with an near-direct cop of the ""Be My Baby"" beat, a tactic you'd have to be crazy to fault anybody for.</em></p><p>
    
    Throughout the album, traditional song structures are forsaken for acreage of Hagerty's bleating, harmolodic guitar, neck-snapping male/female vocal tag-teams, and frantic, inscrutable lyrics I couldn't even hope to transcribe. And although it's all delivered with an uncharacteristic degree of focus, one can't help but escape with the belief that <em>All-Night Fox is merely laying the groundwork for a more full-realized colossus to follow, and the hope that Hagerty has come to the same realization as well.</em></p></div>"|4003.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4003-all-night-fox/|6.8|Matthew Murphy

Ward who make me contemplate why I write about 
    music. I get my skin tingling to the acoustic guitars and I'm just thinking 
    ""Jesus, is this what it's about?"" I'm trying to put the feeling this music gives me 
    into words in an attempt to understand it, to convey how great it 
    is and why, and maybe convince you that it's worth your cash or your bandwidth, and it occurs to me that I'm unsure why I do 
    it-- why I need to do it-- and that, in the end, it's because I'm enjoying this and I want you to enjoy it, too.</p><p>
    
    Heaven knows you don't build cred or a reputation as a trend-breaker 
    boosting a guy like M. Ward to the rafters with acclaim, because he's 
    not 
    one of those musicians who bothers with belonging to a movement or a 
    trend. He's 
    just going on with that beautifully flawed voice of his (a high, hollow 
    tenor with a fringe of grit) spinning melodies that remind you 
    that, though you're weary of the world, you're not alone. His last 
    record, 
    2004's magnificent <i>Transfiguration of Vincent</i> is at once sprawling and 
    intimate. It's grown on me like strangling vines in the last year and 
    I can 
    play it anytime around anybody without a worry. This one is just a little 
    tiny bit less perfectly imperfect than that album, but it's still got 
    all 
    the warmth and gentle disorganization of its predecessor-- with a 
    few more oomphy tracks standing in for <i>Tranfiguration</i>'s most 
    introspective 
    meditations.</p><p>
    
    For a study of Ward's songwriting ingenuity, just dive into ""Paul's 
    Song"" 
    and listen to the way he leads the verse through a countryish backing, 
    steel 
    guitar straddling the line between Nashville and Honolulu. You figure 
    the 
    melody has to go down at the end of the first verse, but instead he 
    takes it 
    higher and draws it out into a totally unexpected, twisting refrain. 
    Forget 
    verse/chorus/verse, though, because it goes where it has to, just like 
    the 
    traveling character in Ward's lyrics, who laments ""Seems like 
    everywhere I 
    go the sky is falling/ When I come to town, I ain't gonna' lie to 
    you/well, every town is all the same."" It flows so swiftly into the 
    half-time strumming of ""Radio Campaign"" that they could be parts of a 
    suite; taking in the whole album, it occurs to me that maybe they are.</p><p>
<i>Transistor Radio</i>, like his other albums, is stuffed with over a dozen 
    short 
    songs that each reflect a different side of the same shape, glistening 
    facets of a rough-cut Americana diamond-- one crafted not simply from folk and bluegrass but also 50s AM radio, the saloon cabaret of studio-era Hollywood, and good old-fashioned indie rock. Closer ""Well-Tempered Clavier"" extends further 
    afield, a sad, enveloping baroque guitar reverie-- let it be noted that Ward is one helluva guitarist, even if he 
    doesn't 
    often play it up.</p><p>
    
    By now, I remember exactly why I'm writing about this stuff. Because 
    it's 
    fun to get shamelessly giddy and lose yourself in the attempt to 
    articulate 
    your love for a piece of music, if describing it adequately bears the 
    whiff 
    of futility. Seriously, words will often inadequately describe 
    great music, so let's be direct: Listen to this. You will not 
    regret 
    it.</p></div>"|8581.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8581-transistor-radio/|8.2|Joe Tangari

    Taschens, $1,000 VHS TV Party bootlegs, $10,000 graffiti, and way
    pricier feti-aestheti-fetishized gear they say I have the choice of
    wearing or marrying or snorting up my butt-- seriously, designer leg
    warmers? Come on-- I can't help but resent this latest 80s punk-funk
    pillaging. The LES/EV spirit is stamping ART on poverty and selling it to suckers like me as ""the influential underground"" whose influence today is, if anything is to their credit, masterful self-prophecy. Now America's one-stop thugged-out sweats shop is handing out this most killerest cheatsheet to the 80s mutant music underground for free!-- robbing the shit of its most fundamental irony, trading the weathered taxi driver confessions of Clinton Street gang wars and permanent arson for kewl in-store disco beats and a people's history glorified unwittingly and out of context. My mouth, therefore an error.</p><p>
    
    So what if they're a bit late to the fray, Hollertronix's Diplo and Low B make up for their unshocking entrance with perfect fascism and a generous, well-mixed tracklist. The disc's We Were There liners and cutesy CDDB joke (the mix dates back to 1985 hardy har) could have been throwaways; instead Hollertronix make good on the conceit, geniusing the mix levels for uncanny vinyl reproduction fidelity and never exceeding the technical capabilities contemporary to the music they're handling. Maybe not the most compelling MO for new bands, kids hawking ESG riffs without a hitch, etc., but Hollertronix's coroner hand presentation is the mix's biggest feather-- no bright white spotlights, no museum lines, all chalk and putrefaction.</p><p>
    
    At this point my sense of what's 80s underground/what's not is pretty damn skewed, but Siouxsee's ""Happy House"" is on here, so is that Sexual Harrassment song ""If I Gave You A Party"" that Syrup covered for 2003's <i></i><i>Sound Of Young New York</i> comp, so is Arthur Russell's ""Bang"", and for whatever reason there's a Konk song on the mix too (though thankfully it's the least worthless Konk song). Since the mix never purports to be a best of punk-funk or even a punk-funk primer, Hollertronix do indulge themselves on both sides of the blur (Talking Heads, and later, apparently, Landslide's ""It's A Party""). 11 tracks, 29 actual songs, no tracklisting-- the mix aims for mood where others have aimed for completism, probably the biggest and most important indulgence of them all here. Legwarmers: that means fewer annoying iPod track turnovers on your way to Atrium.</p></div>"|4001.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4001-t5-soul-sessions-volume-2/|7.8|Nick Sylvester

He almost never made it this far: He was so unhappy with this earliest records-- 1996's <i>Songs Wearing Clothes</i> and 1997's <i>Eventide</i>, both released by Swedish label Telegram-- that he contemplated quitting music altogether. A chance meeting with members of the Soundtrack of Our Lives persuaded him otherwise, and he made <i>This Cloud Is Learning</i> with them in 1999.</p><p>
    It was Dunger's two subsequent albums, <i>Soul Rush</i> (with the Esbjorn Svensson Trio) and <i>Tranquil Isolation</i> (with Will Oldham, among others), that were released in the United States-- in 2001 and 2003, respectively-- but <i>This Cloud Is Learning</i>, now released with two negligible bonus tracks, was his first true artistic statement. Despite its flaws, it is the root of everything that has come after/before.</p><p>
<i>This Cloud Is Learning</i> is not far removed from <i>Soul Rush</i> or <i>Tranquil Isolation</i>, yet it sounds more soulful than the former and more dynamic than the latter, which was at once too tranquil and too isolated. The Soundtrack of Our Lives (which I refuse to abbreviate to the common SOOL, as it suggests they live in penthouse refrigerators, possess Sigourney Weaver, and transmogrify into giant marshmallow men) provide nicely understated accompaniment to Dunger's mannered vocals. Kalle Gustafsson's bowed double bass adds an eerie j-horror rumble to ""Father"", and Martin Hederos' harpsichord stitches spookily through ""If I Were a Little Star"", which contains a disarming major-key melody embedded in its minor-key gloominess. The members of Soundtrack understand their sidemen roles, providing measured back-up without distracting from or overshadowing Dunger's lyrics or vocals.</p><p>
    That rightfully makes Dunger the focal point. More so than on his more recently recorded albums, his voice often disregards consonants as it ranges from mewling to drunkenly garbled and hints at future comparisons to Van Morrison, Thom Yorke, and Jeff Buckley. He sounds best when he slows the tempo and creates a subdued, gelid atmosphere in songs like ""Independence"" and ""Songbegging"", whose spectral simmer sets the mood for the album and compensates for the lyrics' occasional dips into sentimental smudginess.</p><p>
    However, when Dunger speeds up the tempo and attempts to rise from the gloom, <i>This Cloud Is Learning</i> becomes almost insufferably precious, especially on ""Butterflyin' Friend"" and ""Something in the Way"" (which is neither a Beatles nor a Nirvana cover). Only ""What Tomorrow"", a Kinksy number set apart by mariachi horns and Dunger's emphatic delivery, manages to sustain a faster tempo and capture the Piteå Hillbilly pop aesthetic he's after. That album title, ultimately, is significant: Not only is <i>This Cloud Is Learning</i> a reassertion of Dunger's musical principles, but it sounds like an openly instructive experience for him as he explores the dynamics of collaboration and the range of his voice and lyrics.</p></div>"|2481.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2481-this-cloud-is-learning/|7.3|Stephen M.

But while these newcomers were living it up in the house scene that Garnier built, the veteran DJ pressed on with several commendable, although modestly received, full-lengths.</p><p>
    
    What Garnier can lack in feeling, he makes up for with years of technical know-how, on <i>The Cloud Making Machine</i> as before. Songs like ""Huis Clos"" and ""Act 1 Minotaure Ex."" are dark and colossal, as if recorded in some massive sub-aquatic lair. ""Barbiturik Blues"" clearly sprouts from the same mind that flavored his late 1980s house and techno with refreshing amounts of jazz. The song showcases casino-cool mellotron improv over an impeccably modulated drum beat. Between the two instruments, Garnier drops space-age blips and beeps, just to top it all off.</p><p>
    
    Garnier's logged many years in this biz spinning Madchester, penning books, and curating compilations-- he's heard a lot and his palate is wide. That said, Garnier's genre-hopping tendency costs him his personality, a common sacrifice for DJs. ""9.01-9.06"" drips with Richard D. James envy; its ominous bassline sounds like a mere video game score compared to Aphex Twin's more menacing bass patterns. ""(I Wanna Be) Waiting For My Plane"" sounds like an electronic mutation of The Stooges' ""I Wanna Be Your Dog"" with a shitty Iggy Pop, restored by scratchy digital sheen. All in all, despite failing to live up to their originals, the tracks change up the album's pace nicely and allow Garnier to show off more electro toys.</p><p>
    
    Garnier's idea for a more cerebral, emotional album is wise; 2000's <i>Unreasonable Behaviour</i>, with its vocoders and pretentious lyrics, begged too hard for attention. At the risk of sounding cold, the only thing about <i>The Cloud Making Machine</i> that could be considered pretentious is that it has a concept-- in this case, the Parisian homeless. Come on, Laurent, how am I supposed to help the homeless when I can't stop digging these beats?!</p></div>"|3401.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3401-the-cloud-making-machine/|7.2|Adam Moerder

It was bloated with 42 tracks of NYC's finest-- including Interpol, the Walkmen, and French Kicks-- alongside some damn fine songs from bands that ended up going nowhere. Their debuts would all come within a year of the compilation's release. Earlier in 2001, Britt Daniel's impeccable pop urbanities poured forth from the heart of Dub's <i>Country</i> on Spoon's <i>Girls Can Tell</i>. And of course, autumn birthed the unholy hell of Strokes hype/backlash.</p><p>
    
    Over the next year or four, it seemed like every band on earth had a brooding frontman, clever get-ups, and catchy, 80s-inspired hooks. Even an ""American Idol"" champ is churning out moody guitar pop these days, and it, uh, isn't that bad (cough). Into this already exploded, declared dead, re-imagined, and revived pop scene sprouts Robbers On High Street's <i>Tree City</i>, full of songs that could have easily fit or faded into the mix on many of those 2001 releases. Someone should tell them to borrow from older, or at least more obscure, sources.</p><p>
    
    Most of <i>Tree City</i> sounds lifted from Britt Daniel's songbook. By that, I don't mean it sounds somewhat like it. I mean, it sounds like they stole the tapes from Britt's house and scribbled their name over his. Does Daniel live on High Street? That would make sense. Otherwise, it's hard to believe that a band, even relative newcomers, would be so blatant about borrowing ideas. Aren't New Yorkers cagier than that? But they present a pretty striking facsimile, albeit with the expected loss of definition and detail.</p><p>
    
    Singer Ben Trokan <i>Single White Female</i>'s it throughout, knocking the dust off Daniel's weary loverboy rasp and cribbing notes from scratched-out lyric sheets. Trokan and his mates do such a fine rendition that, at first, it's easy to pretend it is a new Spoon record. Their Stella-soaked piano pop bounces and shakes where it should, with a few idiosyncratic touches that keep things interesting on certain numbers, like the horn section on ""Spanish Teeth"" or dancy-slappyhands on ""Amanda Green"". ""Beneath the Trees"" even threatens to carve out a unique path with its breathy ooh's and la's and Trokan's thrusts into falsetto. It's the clearest indication that ROHS have a chance if they're willing to trust their songwriting and ability a bit more the next time out.</p><p>
    
    Elsewhere, the boys make sure to let you know that they like other New York bands, too. ""Love Underground"" is the Strokes sans a lifetime of listless entitlement, except that's what everyone loves to hate about the Strokes. The Walkmen get doppelganged on ""Killer Bees"", on which Trokan lets his couplets trail off like he's about to fall over a la Leithauser, while the band swings away at their instruments in the middle of an empty concert hall.</p><p>
<i>Tree City</i> is a highly listenable album a couple times through, and I'm sure there are a few fellows in Brooklyn, or Manhattan, blushing at its imitations. But, in a city stacked to the exposed rafters with talented bands, Robbers On High Street will not have long to figure out whether they want to be footnotes or headlines. If they decide on footnotes, here's a suggestion for the title to their follow-up, <i>Kill The Room On Fire With Arrows</i>.</p></div>"|6941.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6941-tree-city/|6.0|Peter Macia

Whereas many modern hip-hop albums spill over with infectious beats and sci-fi sounds, and draw variety from a wide array of hired-in producers and guest spots, this does the opposite: It's the product of just three guys-- Dälek, Oktopus, and Still-- and the entire record is built around essentially a couple of simple beats with slight yet important variations.</p><p>
    Dälek have a knack for taking basic elements and sculpting them differently every time, a controlled, deliberate attack designed for pinpoint destruction and insight. They can turn a sheet of blistering, white-hot skree into a convincing hook simply by attaching it to the right part of the beat and controlling the volume and density of the noise, allowing Dälek's complex, considered rhymes to weave their way through the tangle. Here, the harsh, cavernous textures coating the songs are ostensibly all dissonant, droning walls of noise cut through with scratches and samples.</p><p>
    The templates of Dälek's tracks are augmented by an incredible wealth of detail in both their beats and backdrops. Cascading flumes of gutter noise torment the edges of ""Asylum (Permanent Underclass)"": They heave and bend, wavering in pitch and contorting into snatches of tortured melody. Close listening reveals that the squall is actually a tight cluster of dozens of drones, added and subtracted to mold the music into grit-teethed crescendos and dizzying passages of spiraling, exquisitely controlled chaos.</p><p>
    Dälek the MC spits head-spinning verses like ""Who trades his culture for dollars/ The fool or the scholar/ Griot, poet, or white collar"" (""Culture for Dollars"") and ""Seen your movements through peripheral/ Remain same individual/ When a man's viewed as criminal to act animal is logical"" (""Distorted Prose""). There's nary a nod to sex or personal enrichment, and in fact he opens the album by rapping, a cappela, ""Broke stride as last of men realized their deep deceit/ This troubling advance of half-assed crews crowd these streets,"" a broad and open indictment of what he seems to see as hip-hop straying from its early ideals.</p><p>
    In ""Eyes to Form Shadows"", he speeds up his flow as melody is forcibly wrenched from queasy, metallic tones, before culminating with ""Addicts move in slow increments within granite/ Hands bound and damaged are weapons we brandish/ Deemed savage by masses/ When this anger's just average."" Dälek's unsatisfied with nearly everything-- and politics are no exception. On ""Asylum"", he skewer administration arrogance and fear-mongering with clear-eyed and direct lyrics that avoid the tendency toward opaque abstraction that bogs down so much underground hip-hop.</p><p>
    Crunching along in an endlessly innovative fashion, <em>Absence seems old-school in its simplicity, clarity and forthrightness, but sounds futuristic. And although the album is full of abstract noise and painstaking sound sculpture, the no-nonsense approach to beat-making and Dälek's modest flow make this album more accessible than its presecessor, 2002's <i>From Filthy Tongue of Gods and Griots</i>. That album had higher peaks than this one, but </em><em>Absence is more consistently engaging-- and another powerful statement from one of modern hip-hop's greatest crews.</em></p></div>"|2149.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2149-absence/|8.3|Joe Tangari

But to understand the origins of their whirring melodic arithmetic, spastic disco-punk, and art-damaged pop, it's more helpful to examine three bands who took Ian McKaye's post-punk vision in a new direction-- Dismemberment Plan, Q and Not U, and Les Savy Fav-- at their respective turning points. These can be located between Les Savy Fav's 1999 album <em>The Cat and the Cobra</em> and their 2000 EP <em>Emor</em>; between Q and Not U's 2000 album <em>No Kill Beep Beep</em> and 2002's <em>Different Damage</em>; and between Dismemberment Plan's 1997 album <em>Is Terrified</em> and 1999's <em>Emergency and I</em>.</p><p>
    
    In each case, the departure involved a paring away of excesses. Les Savy Fav lost a guitarist, Q and Not U lost a bassist, and Dismemberment Plan lost all their inhibitions about what you could do in the context of a punk rock song. Each began to rely less on hardcore conventions, more on textural minimalism and innovative structures. Each began to plumb disco and new wave for their kinetic exhortations, essentially becoming experimental pop bands while maintaining their post-punk foundations. In doing so, each produced a record so far ahead of its predecessor that it seemed a step on the evolutionary ladder had been bypassed.</p><p>
    
    It's this ghost interim that We Versus the Shark, a temporally displaced missing link, occupies. With three singers, two guitarists, and a rhythm section that doesn't live up to the otherworldly precision of the Plan but is nevertheless solid and promising, We Versus the Shark has turned out a nervous, twitchy, hooky, disjointed dance-punk rave-up. It's too bad the term ""angular"" has been abused into meaninglessness, since the Shark's guitar attack really <em>is</em> all knees and elbows and sharp corners. <em>Ruin Everything!</em> is a flurry of sparkling detail and fragmentary hooks that somehow accrue into cohesive songs.</p><p>
    
    From the splintering, streamlined funk and hoarse exhortations of ""You Don't Have to Kick It"", to the syncopated percussion and clustered freak-outs of the chameleonic ""Ten Uh Clock Heart Uh Tack"", to the side winding, snake charming shimmy of ""This Graceless Planet"", this record refuses to hold still long enough to draw a bead on it. ""I am at the Mercy of an Ambulance Driver"" combines the quirky vocal fillips Q and Not U deployed with such success on ""Soft Pyramids"" with the paradoxically inert yet gliding micro-disco of the best Dismemberment Plan songs.</p><p>
<em>Ruin Everything!</em> augers a more ""mature"" record in We Versus the Shark's future, but as is, it's perfect for blowing up basements rather than packing mid-sized venues. While I'm sure we'll applaud their more polished efforts, we'll also miss the unfettered energy of their debut, the same way you sometimes pine for the rawness of <em>The Cat and the Cobra</em> or <em>Is Terrified</em> while enjoying <em>Go Forth</em> or <em>Change</em>.</p></div>"|8785.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8785-ruin-everything/|7.8|Brian Howe

And yet, the album's cover displays a mishmash of Christian or Muslim hands clasped in prayer, an upside-down star with funky characters on it, palmistry lines on the creepy hand, astrological symbols, crosses, some sort of masonic/Egyptian eye, devil horns, and the sun and moon. What's all that supposed to mean? It's like Douglas Adams' electric monk or something, programmed to believe up to 17 contradictory ideas at once.</p><p>
    Electric monkism follows the band into its music-- cowpunk/psychobilly that deals in quasi-religious/sacreligious vagaries but only hints at a connection to the group's ironic Southern Baptist image. Clearly, they're not theologists, and they seem to think Satan's kinda neat in a noncommital way, so don't come for the preaching-- come for a shit-kicking good time. Th' Legendary Shack-Shakers could be considered style over substance but their music is so much fuxD1and, besides, they do style very well.</p><p>
    They open the album with its high point-- a badass klezmer/rockabilly hoedown called ""Agony Wagon"", which kicks off with clarinet and accordion riffing, sweet shuffling drums, and fired-up vocal. They seem to realize how good it is, reprising it in the album's closing instrumental. In between, there's plenty of swaggering and stomping about, with big-reverb cowpunk like ""Bible Cyst"" and ""Where's the Devil...When You Need Him?"" rubbing up against the ramshackle acoustic waltz ballad ""The Pony to Bet On"" and distorted hard rock(abilly) numbers like ""Cussin' in Tongues"" and the Sonny Boy Williamson/Willie Dixon cover ""Help Me"". The mouth harp gets plenty of action, especially on ""Fistwhistle Boogie"", where vocalist Col. J.D. Wilkes lets loose on the thing like an Old Western mob on a prisoner.</p><p>
<i>Believe</i> is the second album from the Shack-Shakers (they had the gall to name the first one <i>Cock-a-Doodle-Don't</i>), and by the sound of things they've grown quite comfortable with their spiritually ambiguous ways and more importantly with their brand of wild, raving psychobilly. I actually wish they'd extended the klezmer tip through the whole album, because it's their most interesting card to play, but the chicken shack rock they came up with instead is full of enough piss and vinegar for a plenty good time.</p></div>"|4979.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4979-believe/|7.2|Joe Tangari

In addition to the Strap's umpteen releases, in 2002 Moffat also introduced his solo project Lucky Pierre, debuting with the entrancing <i>Hypnogogia</i> album. In this alter ego (whose name has since been shortened to the more polite L Pierre) Moffat creates deeply chilled, evocative instrumentals utilizing little more than manipulated loops of scratchy orchestral samples and languid programmed beats. But despite the humbleness of these tools, <i>Hypnogogia</i> managed to wordlessly plumb the same murky depths of emotion that Moffat explores behind the mic at his regular gig, which isn't bad considering that he reportedly first created the album to help put himself to sleep.</p><p>
<i>Touchpool</i> picks up where <i>Hypnogogia</i> nodded off, with the vibrant strings of opener ""Crush"" inviting listeners back under the blankets. While its predecessor was recorded in dribs and drabs over a period of years, all of the tracks here were conceived and recorded as one unified piece, giving <i>Touchpool</i> a more dynamic, thoughtful structure.</p><p>
    Also helping to stir these waters is the strategic addition of live instrumentation to several tracks. Moffat's Arab Strap partner Malcolm Middleton provides guitar and bass, giving the lazy shimmer of ""Baby Breeze"" a hypnotic shoegaze swirl. And Dave McGowan's lilting pedal steel lends ""Jim Dodge Dines at the Penguin Café"" an exotic, Morricone-gone-tropical flavor as his playing glides effortlessly from wide-open prairie C&amp;W; to Hawaiian-inflected palm tree sway.</p><p>
    Other highlights include ""Velbon"", which gently stretches a sample of Beethoven's ""Pathetique"" Piano Sonata to its ambient limits (its title is a mash-up of Ludwig Van's initials and Brian Eno's last name) and the epic closer ""Total Horizontal"", the serenity of which is enhanced by Allan Wylie's melodious trumpet contributions.</p><p>
    In fact if there's a major complaint to be leveled against <i>Touchpool</i> it's that it perhaps contains an overabundance of such serenity. Moffat's lo-tech, limpid beats can occasionally seem like something of an afterthought, and there's certainly little here more uptempo than the BPM at which you might sip a glass of top-shelf whiskey. However, if you've been searching for companionship during those sleepless, after-hour vigils for the approaching dawn, L Pierre has here kindly supplied a handsome flock of sheep for you to count.</p></div>"|4975.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4975-touchpool/|7.1|Matthew Murphy

    Collin and Olivier Libaux, bringing in various female vocalists who had no knowledge of the songs they'd be covering. Then, hoping to ""forget 
    the initial punk or new wave background of each song,"" they tackled 1980s faves from the likes of the Cure, the 
    Clash, and Joy Division.</p><p>
    
    The supposed ignorance of the singers plays well for this record's lack 
    of irony, a big part of what makes it succeed as a well-meaning, 
    well-executed novelty. Nouvelle Vague 
    put their most sacrilegious foot forward, opening the album with a 
    cover of ""Love Will Tear Us Apart"". With the sounds of the tide heard behind 
    the strums of a nylon-string guitar and vocalist Eloise adding playful, bouncy accents to Ian Curtis' weighty lyric, this is frothy, effervescent pop with a touristy feel but no trace of the 
    original's weight.</p><p>
    
    And that's pretty much the MO for the rest of the record, too: The vocalist on ""Guns of Brixton"" sounds like she's never been near a gun, nor to
    Brixton, and the singer of the playful romp taken through ""Too Drunk to 
    Fuck"" sounds as if she learned the operative word the day of recording, 
    her voice veering from coquettish to near-hysterical.</p><p>
    
    However, the most effective songs re-interpret the originals while 
    maintaining their mood.  The Specials' ""Friday Night Saturday Morning"" starts 
    out with ""Space Oddity"" acoustic panache and turns the partying ennui of 
    the original into palpable melancholy, making it the stunning highlight 
    of this disc. Tracks like ""Marian"" and ""A Forest"" retain bits of their 
    original foreboding and hold up better to repeated listening, as does 
    as the smiling rumble-pop of ""Just Can't Get Enough"". 
    Nouvelle Vague certainly treat genre with the same casual respect as their 
    source material-- they're unafraid to add French pop, cocktail jazz, or 
    trip-hop overtones to their bossa nova template.</p><p>
    
    But if Nouvelle Vague intended these versions to be enjoyed without 
    context, doesn't the choice of songs limit their audience? I'm sure 
    there's a small crossover, but there can't be many fans of French bossa nova could 
    possibly be clamoring for covers of Tuxedomoon or Killing Joke.</p></div>"|5913.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5913-nouvelle-vague/|7.0|Jason Crock

If anything, it's just as likely that you can put on this CD, listen to it, and not remember anything about it once it's finished. Even when paying close attention, it has a drunken dreamlike quality that can make even the firmest grip slip. Tara Jane O'Neil's songs are much like her singing voice-- understated, quiet but not timid, pretty but shaded with a wearying sadness. She sings the way people talk to themselves when asleep. These qualities work for and against her on this record.</p>
<p>From the first moments of opening instrumental ""Take the Waking"", the tone is set-- pretty stretches of wordless singing collide with loud hesitant amplified guitars. When it works-- as on gorgeous lullabies like ""Without Push"" or ""The Poisoned Mine""-- O'Neil's plaintive whispers and words meld perfectly with the electro-acoustic backdrops. When things falter-- as on a rusting creaky track like ""Howl"" or the stumbling ""Love Song Long""-- the effect is less enchanting than disorienting and disconcerting. More successful is the rustic crawl of ""Known Perils"" and the insistent wet echoes of ""Famous Yellow Belly"". Interspersed between the actual songs are brief interludes running the gamut from shy and introspective (the electronic burbling of ""Tracer"") to pensive and ominous (the banjo-flecked ""I Call You"").</p>
<p>Even on the less successful tracks, there are moments to savor, such as the off-center harmonies of ""Howl"", and the looped violins transformed into buzzing songbirds on ""Love Song Long"". It's a credit to O'Neil's skills that such moments of transparent studio manipulation actually help in establishing the provincial atmosphere of this album, a mood reinforced by repeating a melodic phrase from ""The Poisoned Mine"" in the final track. This mixture of technology and rustic elements gels into an organic whole, approximating the creak of a porch swing through relays and circuits. For those interested in getting a closer look at the stitches, you'll want to listen to <i>Bones</i>, a odds and ends collection released around the time of <i>You Sound, Reflect</i>.</p>
<p>Given that <i>Bones</i> is a collection of disparate tracks, there is a interesting sense of cohesion, as if this is a more haphazard sibling to the unerring consistency of <i>You Sound, Reflect</i>. Conveniently enough, three of the better tracks from the parent album (""Without Push"", ""Famous Yellow Belly"", ""The Poisoned Mine"") are available in versions that don't differ much from their final state, excepting a lack of bells and whistles (and, in some cases, violin). Joining them are efforts that would seemingly slot in just fine on the official record, like the tremulous ""Highwire"" and the queasy ""Another Sunday Saint"". On the other end of the spectrum are out-of-character offerings such as a trip-hop re-engineering of ""Bullhorn Moon"" (a track from Tara's first album, <i>Peregrine</i>), and the drum-machine driven ""Enter This House"". For a woman that's on record singing, ""my desires put me to sleep"", Tara Jane O'Neil proves to be quite the restless spirit.

The past month has been one of feeling caught up in the flow of people, work, and events just hoping to come out on the other end: Day job's a mess, the train rides are long, my poor wife is being dragged all over the country by her job, there are cats to feed and bills to pay and too much e-mail, and it's all enough to make one quite sleepy, but at the same time too agitated to fall asleep easily.</p>
<p>So. Everybody feels this way now and then, but what the crap does this have to do with William Basinski? Well, everything and nothing. Basinski has really nothing to do with fast or the too-quickness of life and everything to do with the antidote. I'm not even going to skirt around it: Lately, I've been listening to basically nothing but Afrobeat and drone-based ambient music. It's a strange combination, but this month that's what I'm in the mood for. Basinski's records, of course, falls in the latter camp (I've yet to find anything that falls into both camps-- if anyone out there has a tip, drop me a line).</p>
<p>Basinski has his own unique ambient voice. Slowness is the thing with Basinski-- well, not the only thing, but one thing, and an important one-- and as if to drive home the point, his most celebrated work, <i>The Disintegration Loops</i>, took a couple of decades to make. Not by design, mind you, as he had no way of knowing how his stored tapes would decay over time, but it's nice to think about a piece of music incubating before finally being offered to the world at large. But more broadly, his music is unhurried and develops very slowly, rather unlike the information-soaked world it's meant to enrich. His two most recent releases are not things you just listen to in dribs and drabs. You need to actually have a seat and take them in; you need to put aside time to be alone with the music, which is marvelous, I think, because it forces you to realize just how much you're rushing in your daily comings and goings.</p>
<p><i>Silent Night</i> is the shorter of the two pieces and can be succinctly described as an ambient excursion built of soft, humming drones that swell and recede under and over a hissing, bug-like drone. For an hour. That's all it is, superficially, but there's so much more going on here, manifested in the irregular intervals between swells, the way a rapid succession of hums play off of the drones, and the alternately melancholy and joyous manner in which the sounds recede and return. And the sound. Ooh, such timbres. These are sounds you can really dig into-- rounded, water-smooth sounds with palpable surface tension and mile-thick bass whale calls that seem to have a soul. Unfortunately, the bugs get the last ten or so minutes to themselves, but up 'til then it's magic.</p>
<p><i>Variations</i>, like <i>The Disintegration Loops</i>, was originally created in 1981, remained unreleased for ages, and involves metamorphosis through reiteration. It sprawls, to say the least, over two discs-- each split courteously into four sections for listening ease-- all made of the same elements: piano loops played against each other in endless variations. The piano recordings aren't laid straight out in front of you, though-- they're coated in a layer of thick, pillowy muffling, which not only takes away the sharpness of the piano's attack, but also makes it sound alien and wombed in from the world. On the first piece, the loops dance around the stereo spectrum in a disorienting ballet; on the second, they build ever outward as more loops are added and echoed and set randomly against each other, creating heaving, oscillating waves of liquid piano.</p>
<p>Basinski's liners refer to the process of setting the loops against each other and multiplying the sound as allowing the sounds to ""breed,"" and that's basically what they do. A short, melodic piano figure is the basis for each piece, and the breeding of the loops makes for moments of both startling beauty and dense, opaque numbness, much more the former than the latter. There's a terrible kind of sadness in these loops as they waver and repeat, clouding themselves over and generating swells of feedback-- the sepia piano tone and the choice of notes play like a hazy memory of loss.</p>
<p>This is part of what separates Basinski from other minimalists and experimental composers. There's an obvious process, even a theory, operating in his work, but it never sounds scientific or cold-- the human element of emotion comes first and is multiplied by the process. As such, Basinski's work has the potential to appeal to many listeners who otherwise wouldn't care to listen to hours of slow, incrementally changing tape loops.  And, of course, sometimes the slowness of the music itself can be all the justification needed for setting aside an hour to get outside of our up-to-the-minute existence and really, truly listen.</p></div>"|11663.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11663-silent-night-variations-a-movement-in-chrome-primitive/|7.7|Joe Tangari

Basinski's records, of course, falls in the latter camp (I've yet to find anything that falls into both camps-- if anyone out there has a tip, drop me a line).</p>
<p>Basinski has his own unique ambient voice. Slowness is the thing with Basinski-- well, not the only thing, but one thing, and an important one-- and as if to drive home the point, his most celebrated work, <i>The Disintegration Loops</i>, took a couple of decades to make. Not by design, mind you, as he had no way of knowing how his stored tapes would decay over time, but it's nice to think about a piece of music incubating before finally being offered to the world at large. But more broadly, his music is unhurried and develops very slowly, rather unlike the information-soaked world it's meant to enrich. His two most recent releases are not things you just listen to in dribs and drabs. You need to actually have a seat and take them in; you need to put aside time to be alone with the music, which is marvelous, I think, because it forces you to realize just how much you're rushing in your daily comings and goings.</p>
<p><i>Silent Night</i> is the shorter of the two pieces and can be succinctly described as an ambient excursion built of soft, humming drones that swell and recede under and over a hissing, bug-like drone. For an hour. That's all it is, superficially, but there's so much more going on here, manifested in the irregular intervals between swells, the way a rapid succession of hums play off of the drones, and the alternately melancholy and joyous manner in which the sounds recede and return. And the sound. Ooh, such timbres. These are sounds you can really dig into-- rounded, water-smooth sounds with palpable surface tension and mile-thick bass whale calls that seem to have a soul. Unfortunately, the bugs get the last ten or so minutes to themselves, but up 'til then it's magic.</p>
<p><i>Variations</i>, like <i>The Disintegration Loops</i>, was originally created in 1981, remained unreleased for ages, and involves metamorphosis through reiteration. It sprawls, to say the least, over two discs-- each split courteously into four sections for listening ease-- all made of the same elements: piano loops played against each other in endless variations. The piano recordings aren't laid straight out in front of you, though-- they're coated in a layer of thick, pillowy muffling, which not only takes away the sharpness of the piano's attack, but also makes it sound alien and wombed in from the world. On the first piece, the loops dance around the stereo spectrum in a disorienting ballet; on the second, they build ever outward as more loops are added and echoed and set randomly against each other, creating heaving, oscillating waves of liquid piano.</p>
<p>Basinski's liners refer to the process of setting the loops against each other and multiplying the sound as allowing the sounds to ""breed,"" and that's basically what they do. A short, melodic piano figure is the basis for each piece, and the breeding of the loops makes for moments of both startling beauty and dense, opaque numbness, much more the former than the latter. There's a terrible kind of sadness in these loops as they waver and repeat, clouding themselves over and generating swells of feedback-- the sepia piano tone and the choice of notes play like a hazy memory of loss.</p>
<p>This is part of what separates Basinski from other minimalists and experimental composers. There's an obvious process, even a theory, operating in his work, but it never sounds scientific or cold-- the human element of emotion comes first and is multiplied by the process. As such, Basinski's work has the potential to appeal to many listeners who otherwise wouldn't care to listen to hours of slow, incrementally changing tape loops.  And, of course, sometimes the slowness of the music itself can be all the justification needed for setting aside an hour to get outside of our up-to-the-minute existence and really, truly listen.</p></div>"|11663.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11663-silent-night-variations-a-movement-in-chrome-primitive/|8.0|Joe Tangari

These guys are Huck Finns dropping the n-word before they're neo-Nazis pushing an F&amp;F; agenda. They're four San Diego Dada-dudes with trad hardcore beefs-- macho guys, stupid girls, and authority figures-- and when singer Brandon Welchez shrieks, ""We French-kissed in a holding cell and licked our flames in birthday Hell,"" he's only describing love using the terms of the twisted metalcore realm he dwells in.</p><p>
    
    The Plot deftly navigate through jazz, punk, and metal with pinpoint precision, willfully mangling their songs while still retaining a sense of structure. Opener ""Reichstag Rock"" collapses from Tourette's before a steady, colossal metal riff restores order and brings the song home. Midway through ""Lipstick SS"", everyone forgets how to play their instruments for almost a minute when suddenly the band stumbles across a dance-punk groove.</p><p>
    
    The energy's huge, but the Plot's key strength is guitar melodies. ""Vulture Kontrol"" churns on a cheeky bassline until it's interrupted by-- am I about to say this?-- a nasty riff reminiscent of Castlevania 3 for NES. Before the song unwinds into a collage of piano pounding, ""Angry, Young, and Rich"" packs plenty of guitar arpeggios and a staccato, drama-charged pre-chorus.</p><p>
    
    Complaining about unintelligible hardcore vocals is a lost cause, but it's a shame here: lines like ""You want a reaper that's handsome and abusive,"" believe it or not, would add a lot more personality to the Plot's already proactive songs. Then again, maybe Welchez intended to conceal lines like ""Kisses sweet as heroin yet cold like teenage sex"" because he thought the metaphor was too sappy. Whatever the reason, Welchez's lack of clarity only increases the role of the other members, which is perfectly fine. On ""Failure on Vain Street"", the derisive guitar parody of ""Pomp and Circumstance"" and tongue-in-cheek cowbells manage to convey the same fuck-the-system attitude of Welchez's garbled voice: ""Nail any uniform coffin black/ Want my hair as short as nails/ March, march, march."" With personification like this, it won't be long before the FCC starts handing out ""Warning: Explicit Instruments"" stickers and kids can't buy a saxophone without showing some ID.</p></div>"|6563.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6563-love-in-the-fascist-brothel/|7.5|Adam Moerder

With all eyes fixed on the Land of Poutine, Vancouver knew it could do better and went woodshedding. If 2003 was the year Quebec vied with Brooklyn for crown jewel status in the fiefdom of hep, 2005 might be the year the western Canucks seize the throne from the peaks of Whistler/Blackcomb on high. Which means bands like Black Mountain, the Organ, and Readymade should earn their mainstream pittance 'round 2007?</p><p>
    
    Readymade must feel like they've waited long enough. <i>All the Plans Resting</i>, the band's third album, marks its 10th anniversary. Until now, the British Columbia quintet have sported arresting, slightly precious dream pop. <i>All the Plans Resting</i> sees them focusing their sound and futzing around with an acoustic guitar. Kevin Hilts is a Christo of MIDI pads, guilelessly wrapping Readymade's sonic superstructures in bright billowy fabric.</p><p>
    
    I wasn't lying when I said precious. Readymade sing fuzzy-wuzzy-- if less flagellant-- high school idylls (""Venetian light stripes the room/ Faded by highball perfume""), which are thankfully offset by the often breathtaking instrumentals. ""The Fake But No Finish"", from which that prolix nugget was drawn, is a jangly echo-fried nod to <i>Electr-O-Pura</i>-era Yo La Tengo. The band share lyric-writing responsibilities; three out of five members penned verses for <i>All the Plans Resting</i>, with Hilts' six vocal sheets leading the way. The keyboardist likes to romanticize his efforts as a penman: On ""Nightsky of Exit Signs"", atop soft swelling synths and pirouetting acoustic guitar, the verse (as sung by vocalist Arch) goes, ""Writing lyrics on the back of a magazine by my bed in the light of computer screen, as if I'm the drama, as if I'm cinema."" The MIDI pads ring of shlock, but the song is lent an edge by the swift emergence of a keening oscillated guitar melody.</p><p>
<i>All the Plans Resting</i> is a headphones record. Don't even try bumping it in your Jeep, it won't make sense. Over 13 tracks, the record stays its course, but it can be a long and arduous trek. Readymade work within consistent dynamics and tempi; after 10 years, they know what they do well, and are almost too comfortable resting on their strengths. As such, <i>All the Plans Resting</i> can seem a slog-- a pretty one, yes-- but any monotony is redeemed by the catchiness of ""The Fake But No Finish"" and ""Outlast By Rain"". A decade into their career, Readymade have realized their best record, and the band's shear endurance should be an inspiration to a burgeoning scene awaiting wider recognition.</p></div>"|6940.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6940-all-the-plans-resting/|7.0|Sam Ubl

They sound just like For Stars. If you need more than that, read on.</p><p>
    
    The pun in Decibully's band name implies both extreme volume and aggression, yet <em>Sing Out America!</em>, Decibully's third record, is all about undistorted shimmer and twang, foppish vocals, and geniality. It's more of a chummy handshake than the middle finger you might expect, unless you know the Milwaukee septet's claim to fame is that singer William Seidel spent some time as an auxiliary nice-guy in the Promise Ring. Plus, some folks seem excited that it includes members of Camden.</p><p>
    
    There's something very heartland about <em>Sing Out America!</em>; something wide-eyed and candid. Besides the usual rock equipment, Decibully doesn't scrimp on the lap steel, banjo, and Rhodes organ, and Seidel's singing is accomplished in that anonymous, androgynous way. It falls somewhere between Thom Yorke and Geoff Farina, and bears no trace of indie rock's trademarked slacker sneer. <em>Sing Out America!</em> is a turbo-Anglo heartstring tug-o'-war; it's unabashedly rootsy and aimed squarely at the Barnes and Noble listening station. </p><p>
    
    The record begins with ""I'm Gonna Tell You"", an approximate waltz that blossoms with sweetly psychedelic swirls and slabs of buzzing bass, restlessly bustling up and down the octave, then diminishing until only the percussion remains. It rolls into ""Megan and Magill"", a foot-stomping barn dance brimming with banjo, hand claps, martial drum rolls, and gigantic vocals. ""Rid of Me at Last"" is an easygoing country-rock ballad dripping with weepy bent strings and luau chords. </p><p>
<em>Sing Out America!</em> is a solid spin, well played and competently sequenced, with a few moments of genuine interest: ""Temptation"", the a capella number, is engaging, despite its ponderous lyrics. But the record as a whole is too glassy and frictionless for it to have much long-term replay value; instead, it's an amiable surface for the ear to skim along. </p></div>"|2595.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2595-sing-out-america/|6.8|Brian Howe

As a result, they're less embarrassed than Americans to dream of indie guitar bands commanding decent audiences. That's part of what Bloc Party frontman Kele Okerere seems to have in mind when he describes this album as ""Technicolor."" He means it has big sound, big hooks, energetic performances, ambition-- all the things that make rock bands sound skilled and confident. He means no messing around, no interludes or experiments. He means the kind of guitar record where every song wants to be as tight as the singles; the kind that wants to be worth every penny any lawn-mowing pre-teen might spend on it. Because according to him, nobody makes that kind of record anymore.</p><p>  That isn't true-- and the last thing anyone wants is for U2 to try harder-- but he has a point; it's no accident that there are people who think Radiohead haven't really delivered since <em>The Bends</em>. Put it like that, and what Bloc Party actually <em>sound</em> like drops pretty low on the list of things you need to know about <em>Silent Alarm</em>. What perhaps matters most is that they're trying to make one of those clean, consistent, ambitious Popular Guitar Rock albums-- and depending on how much stock you put in that kind of thing, they've done a great job of it. This is a solid, intelligent album that a lot of people will love-- one that'll slot onto indie-crossover CD racks right beside the debuts from Interpol, Franz Ferdinand, and the Futureheads.</p><p>  Lead single ""Banquet"" is wonderfully tight and energetic-- the same kind of spiffy half-dancing rock as Franz Ferdinand's ""Take Me Out"" or Duran Duran's ""Planet Earth"".  That's easy to pull off when you've got a drummer this good, and a bassist that locks in with him so neatly, whether it's for rock charge or disco hustle.  That, in fact, has been Bloc Party's main selling point, apart from the whole Remarkably Competent thing: When the rhythm section stretches its limbs, they leap a good distance away from the straight-ahead eighth-note riffing of the others in this game.  Filter in their timely post-punk moves, Bunnymen gestures, and pop ambitions, and you start to feel like this is what it might have been like to listen to the Police or XTC in the early 80s; the sound of a straight-up rock band just a shade more sophisticated, and a little more interested in rhythm, than most of their peers.</p><p>  And of course the opener, ""Like Eating Glass"", is even grander and snappier than ""Banquet"", as if to promise from the start that these guys take your purchase seriously. The songwriting is simple in style (forward rhythm, tidy hooks, guitars) but smart in detail-- all stops and starts, bridges and breakdowns, firework flourishes and tasteful studio tweaks. Even more striking are the precision and sheer good taste of the performances: It's not so easy to show off within the confines of songs this focused, but these guys seem to manage just fine.</p><p>  So you get all the usual scrubbed-up gifts: the slower song, the slower song that turns into a faster one, the one with the studio effects, the one with the handclaps. A lot of this material is surprisingly scripted, as if someone spent whole nights in the practice space trying to get a two-bar guitar transition to work Just So. Okerere has a voice that's weirdly similar to the singer from the long-forgotten Adorable, with whom Bloc Party share a hell of a lot more than an appreciation for the Bunnymen: It's a vaguely-strangled back-of-throat thing that lets him moan and shout with refreshing gusto when the band gets going. (Typically ambitious topics of moaning: other people, culture war, girls and society and stuff.) The voice weakens a bit when he needs to croon, but crooning isn't really the point here. Bloc Party can be pretty, even sappy, but they're never looking to be atmospheric; they can rock, but they're never looking to whip up dark drama. This album charges happily down the center-- it shakes its hips now and then, and it whispers here and there, but it always seems to come back to tight and bouncy.</p><p>  People will love this record. And so, inevitably, the people who don't love it will start complaining. And when they complain, they'll point out that this is just a regular-old rock album, full of all the current stylish rock-album tricks. And they'll be absolutely right; at worst, Bloc Party are like one of those people who are so well-groomed that it's hard to remember exactly what they look like. But really, a complaint like that misses something: Being a good ol' unchallenging rock band is this outfit's whole point-- and their biggest strength.</p><p> </p></div>"|1130.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1130-silent-alarm/|8.9|Nitsuh Abebe

On Hood's ""Bulldozers and Dirt"", which opens <i>Pizza Deliverance</i>, the narrator hits on his girlfriend's underage daughter, knowing all the while it's wrong but giving into his fixation all the same: ""something comes over me when you come near/so won't you come over and sip on this beer."" ""Margo and Harold"" contains enough grim humor and great lines for a Barry Hannah short story, as another Hood narrator confesses his fear of the couple of the title: ""Margo and Harold, feeling no pain, fifty and crazy, big hair and cocaine.""</p>
<p>None of their stories would have much resonance, however, if the Drive-By Truckers didn't sound so raw and immediate.

There are excursions into Black Oak Arkansas and Lynyrd Skynyrd territory on ""One of These Days"" and ""Sandwiches for the Road"" but songs like ""Wife Beater"" and ""Box of Spiders"" have the unrehearsed casualness of country and alt-country, while ""The Tough Sell"" and ""Buttholeville"" experiment with heavy-riffing blues rock.</p>
<p>Despite former Trucker Rob Malone's relatively quaint and characterless contributions and the obsolete joke of Hood's crass ""The President's Penis Is Missing"", these two albums are sturdy and solid.

The former is a barrage of cutting guitar jangle, with Gedge growling and beaming all over it. The latter is a grander, murkier, fiercer affair, wherein Gedge playacts all the bitterness, frustration, and sheer craven meanness of the jilted, dating male; it's catharsis and black comedy in one package. After those career peaks, Gedge and his Wedding Present released a string of reliably snappy records, and then he formed Cinerama.</p><p>
    
    The difference between the Wedding Present and Cinerama is the difference between (a) getting drunk alone, calling your ex, hanging up on her new boyfriend, and breaking stuff, and (b) sipping a glass of merlot and gazing out at the park where the two of you picnicked. Cinerama is all adult pop classicism; suddenly the guy's bite is working around duets and string arrangements and 60s pop swing. And that's how things have been since roughly 1997.</p><p>
    
    So when Gedge regroups the Wedding Present for this album, certain expectations are raised: Has our man gotten sick of being classy? Is he itching to play guitar too fast and growl again?</p><p>
    
    The answer is: not really. Sure, this is more of a guitar record than anything Cinerama will ever make-- and some songs pull off noise-squall tricks running all the way back to <i>Seamonsters</i>. But Gedge has grown up, chilled out, and learned new chords; there's no point in turning back the clock. The band may be as in love as ever with the sound of their own amplifiers, but when it comes to songs, there's no changing course. The result is a lot like Elvis Costello's periodic returns to rock territory: snappy genre exercises from a reliable songwriter, but not much more.</p><p>
    
    There are moments that seem rote. You get the sense that the guy could sit down and toss off one of these songs at any moment-- some nice riffs, some well-arranged chord changes, and everything he wishes he'd said to his last girlfriend. And there are moments when that charming adulthood seems a bit easy: There's a certain thrill to hearing a classy break-up number reminisce about ""the day we bought that weird pornography,"" but there's also a sense that Stephin Merritt has already beaten that horse dead.</p><p>
    
    The good news, though, is that Gedge just gets better and better at casting himself as an upscale songwriter, even outside the ""sophisticated"" confines of Cinerama. Who, back in 1991, would have guessed that his clenched-teeth complaining-voice came along with such an expressive croon? Who'd have guessed that fierce crabby Gedge--like Costello before him--would ride pop classicism to such a comfortable place? It's an unglamorous, underrated role, but it fits him beautifully. And here, beneath the obligatory vintage-Weddoes guitar snap, that's what you'll find: our older, wiser Gedge, still endlessly negotiating with girls.</p></div>"|8600.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8600-take-fountain/|6.9|Nitsuh Abebe

Unvarnished chords 'n' lyrics are like tax code to describe, and worse to read about. Disco-punk was interesting no matter how weak a given Radio 4 song might be, and anything psychedelic lends itself to late-night prose ego trippin' fueled by THC and past-date ephedra. Even recent Pitchfork singer-songwriting heroes boast an extra something: Iron &amp; Wine's antebellum intimacy, M. Ward's California surrealism, freak-folk's freak-folk.</p><p>
    
    Then there's Josh Ritter, who sings and writes songs with ultra-trad folk-rock arrangements and eschews the band-like stage names of hipster convention. Rooted in the Americana of Woody Guthrie and Townes Van Zandt, Ritter's songs stand naked, conjuring the landscape and musical vernacular of his native Northwest. <em>Hello Starling</em> is the Idaho troubadour's third album-- first for a non-folk label-- and it's past time Ritter received the treatment daily papers currently lavish on another flyover-state kid with a recently released record (or two).</p><p>
    
    Yawn, right? OK, the songs: ""You Don't Make It Easy Babe"" makes Dylan comparisons easy babe with sprightly finger-picking, creaky railroad-over-a-Rocky-Mountain-pass vocals, wounded-lover wordplay,
    use of the word ""babe."" Full-band ""Snow Is Gone"" rejoices like Dylan's unjustly maligned <em>New Morning</em>, sharing its spring gospel even with the Hitchcockian starlings that shat on sidewalks all winter. ""Wings"" sets a panoramic narrative over soft arpeggios: ""I stole a mule from Anthony-- I helped Anne up upon it/ And we rode to Coeur d'Alene-- through Harrison and Wallace/ They were blasting out the tunnels-- making way for the light of learning/ When Jesus comes a'calling, she said, he's coming round the mountain on a train.""</p><p>
    
    Ritter's prowess extends to rollicking rock 'n' roll self-immolation fables (""Man Burning""), heartland Nick Drake (""Bright Smile""), and whirling Wurlitzer valentines (""Kathleen""). Sure, I'd prefer organ tones less reminiscent of Dylan's son's band and more sonic experimentation-- the gentle late-period Yo La Tengo sprawl of ""Baby That's Not All"" is a good start-- but as a storyteller, Ritter is matched only by his lofty influences.</p><p>
    
    For all that, <em>Starling</em> doesn't even include Ritter's best compositions, which can be found on <em>Golden Age of Radio</em>. That record's title track, usually a country-rock barnstormer, recurs as a ballad on the <em>Starling</em> reissue's four-song live bonus disc. There's still time to unearth earlier gems like ""Harrisburg"" and ""Me &amp; Jiggs""; it took critical opinion years to coalesce behind Leonard Cohen and Tom Waits, too. Ritter again: ""Inside this gilded cage, a songbird always looks so plain.""</p></div>"|6939.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6939-hello-starling/|8.3|Marc Hogan

The article mentioned that our man described himself as a ""Times Square drifter who can shine in the Broadway arcades."" Hughes added, ""When you start to think you're a loser, you come here and get 4,000 at Space Invaders, and you ain't a loser anymore.""</p><p>
    
    I'll drink to that. Maybe there is a connection between losing half of my childhood to my Nintendo systems plus the local corner shop's arcade and my present affection for mutated techno. The dinner jazz for a barbarian movie juxtaposed with swords slashing metal as heard in stage two of Strider engrosses me in a daze as much as how Autechre exploits my skull as a punching bag in their number, ""Surripere"". However, I could also blame most of my future health problems and failures to bearably socialize on the ungodly video game, if so many child shrinks and Senators Joseph Lieberman and Herb Kohl would tell me. If anything, there is no worse hangover than the one from playing a game like Advance Wars for 10 hours straight-- the eye strain, the purples and red visages burned into your retinas, and the impulse to run back and forth into a trance to resuscitate that buzz.</p><p>
    
    Traces of such bygone anxiety and bliss awake whenever I hear Secede's remix of an Ilkae tune. Someone is first overheard playing a Nintendo Gameboy Advance game as its erratic rings and squelched ""power-up"" noises attest. A dazed department-store lobby Muzak organ then kicks in to lead a rousing techno-pop jaunt akin to a game's victory music when the planner beats a level. The melody remains faithful to video-game synthesizers, and it's simultaneously elating and queasy. On Ilkae's 2001 album, <i>Pistachio Island</i>, Canadian and Polish teenagers Aaron Munson and Krystian Lubiszewski wore their deficient attention spans and zest for what seemed like imaginary video game soundtracks on an IDM tip. The elements were all there in its 45 tracks: rhythms that could accelerate or die off in a moment, 8-bit synth melodies, and the nagging feeling that you should feel guilty for playing with children's toys.</p><p>
    
    For <i>Bovine Rearrangement</i>, Pistachio gets remixed by Ilkae's brethren in the post-techno underground, namely from the Merck stable. The 19 results mostly score pointers for enhancing what were typically one to two minute sketches on the original album. No specific remixed tracks were named on the CD cover. Explicitly furthering the Nintendo vibe is Vim! who throws together an erratic medley of accurate Gameboy Advance-level jingles that seemingly change whenever the artist is bored with a level. Daedelus deepens Ilkae's melancholia with drifting organ drones and laundry dryer-like percussion. Even stronger are Machine Drum's fountainhead washed synths and broken hip-hop beats, and Octopus Inc.'s psychosomatic flashbacks.</p><p>
    
    The rest of <i>Bovine</i> dwells in the music box fetish or downtempo meditations that drift with a head hanging down through the spotless, glass-domed megapolises that so much post-techno/armchair techno/IDM has indulged in for so many years. While it's not progress, these blues can still make losers feel like winners, however the natural light burns their eyes as they stagger out of the arcades.</p></div>"|4160.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4160-bovine-rearrangement/|7.4|Cameron Macdonald

Frusciane himself has copped to <i>White Light/White Heat</i> and <i>Lust for Life</i> being his inspiration here, but that's already apparent from the first track: ""What I Saw"" is all fuzzbox guitars, cavernous, minimal drums, and a snarling hard-rock melody, all of it pushed into the red. <em>Emptiness</em> is far more guitar-oriented than it's predecessors, <em>Will to Death</em> and Ataxia's <em>Automatic Writing</em>, and rocks harder and more consistently than any of his other solo releases.</p><p>
    
    But for a guy whose previous solo work can be uncompromisingly experimental and usually miles away from the sound of RHCP, it's surprising that the best moments of this album are when Frusciante's simply a 
    guitarist, and the best songs are reminiscent of <em>Cailfornication</em>. The fleet-fingered solo that closes ""What I Saw"", the psychedelic tones of ""Inside a Break"", the extended riffing of ""Look On"", and the feedback screech preceeding the chorus of ""Emptiness"" are the most memorable parts of otherwise unexceptional tunes, showing Frusciante's gift for impeccably appropriate guitar lines that swooped in and saved the day for the Chili Peppers not so long ago. That said, songs like ""Emptiness"" and ""The Worlds' Edge"" borrow heavily from the more melodic moments on <em>Californication</em>.</p><p> 
    
    It's one thing to be upfront about your influences, but to imitate them without adding something-- convincing vocals, unique lyrics, clever songwriting-- leaves these songs sounding unremarkable at best. Frusciante is so dedicated to classic production tone, his songwriting suffers. Any variation is welcome here, and that's what makes the double bass-drum battle cry of ""666"" and the calm falsetto of closer ""Scratches"" stand out so far from the rest. If this was to be Frusciante's take on hard rock, then it's unfortunate that there's none of his avant-garde spirit or experimentation to be found here, because a record like this sorely needs it.</p></div>"|3235.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3235-inside-of-emptiness/|6.0|Jason Crock

    the ghosts of rock's past. With the Concretes, Eriksson's guitar and Haapalainen's
    production helped build tracks reminiscent of a coupling between
    the Velvet Underground and the Ronettes. By the sound of Heikki,
    Ronnie Bennett musta been Lee Hazlewood's baby on the side.</p><p>
    Heikki's second full-length-- the first released in the U.S. by Magic
    Marker-- adds the twang of Hazlewood's mid-60s productions and
    looser, more improvisational arrangements to the Concretes' stylized indie
    pop. Eriksson's vocals are more Neko Case than Nancy Sinatra, and
    sound only a little like Concretes singer Victoria Bergman's winningly
    weak-nosed Nico. Together with Haapalainen's primarily acoustic guitar
    and a smattering of melodica, Heikki somehow end up sounding like a
    rougher Aislers Set.</p><p>
    Opener ""Former Hero"" hula-hoops through sticky Oklahoma summers as shown in a Scandinavian
    cinema, cleverly adding extra beats beneath the word ""exaggerate""
    and sumptuous girl-group harmonies drawing apart over the words
    ""again and again and again and <i>again</i>."" Stiff-lipped ""Election Day""
    kisses an old friend farewell, then ""Still You Don't Know Me""
    dramatically confronts a familiar stranger who, like Jimmy Stewart in
    <em>Vertigo</em>, sees in the narrator only someone else he once knew.
    The best song, ""Give It Back to You"", revels in close female harmonies
    as it triumphantly rejects another unfeeling lover.</p><p>
    Still, these songs often fall short of similarly inclined efforts by
    groups like Camera Obscura. The lyrics often dwell too long in the
    realm of pop cliché (""all this time you kept it all inside""), which
    works better in the in-quotes music of The Concretes, where tracks
    like ""You Can't Hurry Love"" are both referential and satisfyingly
    irreverent. Covers of ""Nothing Lasts"" by overlooked 60s folkie Karen
    Beth and 80s Australian folk-pop group The Triffids' ""Tender Is the
    Night (The Long Fidelity)"" are somewhat draggy bonus tracks. The album isn't likely to win many fans
    who aren't already predisposed toward retro indie pop, but until the
    next Concretes outing, these boots will have to walk.</p></div>"|4000.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4000-2/|7.1|Marc Hogan

What was his deal? How did people relate to his music during his heyday? In the 60s he was a ""folky,"" sorta, but read his funny and weird liner notes from those records and he seems cut from a different cloth. Fahey later crossed paths with pianist George Winston (producing Winston's first album for his Takoma label) and and Windham Hill founder William Ackerman, and thus came dangerously close to being branded New Age. His best-selling record (and the only way most people would know his name) was a Christmas album. Then in the 90s we knew him through his Drag City association, working backwards from Jim O'Rourke's <i>Bad Timing</i> to see where it all started, and Fahey was canonized the patron saint of avant-garde folk. With all the new weird stuff from the past couple of years, he casts a longer shadow than ever.</p><p>
    
    It took me a long time to warm to the man's music. Years before I actually heard him, I would notice him being mentioned by other musicians, usually acoustic guitarists driving the road Fahey paved. In my mind Fahey developed an aura as a musician's musician, the dude with the chops and the idiosyncratic style that needed years of training to appreciate. Once I started becoming familiar with his records, the icy ""musician's music"" layer that had kept me from fully appreciating what he was doing began to thaw, and I began to understand the towering strength of his compositions. The songwriting hooked me.</p><p>
    
    Fahey was hitting on all cylinders throughout the 60s, stuffing great songs into more than a dozen albums. This prime era is well represented on this CD of previously unreleased live recordings, pulled from two shows in 1968 and 1969. It's only his third official live album, and the first from the 60s, so obviously <i>The Great Santa Barbara Oil Slick</i> is an important release. Glenn Jones of Cul de Sac oversaw the preparation of the old tapes for release and contributes witty and personal liner notes, and the sharp packaging is a suitably tactile experience in honor of the man who founded the Revenant label.</p><p>
    
    Nothing is ever quite what it seems in Fahey's songs. ""Requiem for Mississippi John Hurt"" finds the pivot point between country blues and bluegrass, moving between a light, bouncing verse and sheets of furious picking on the chorus that manage to evoke both the hills of Kentucky and 20th Century minimalism. The stately ""When the Catfish are in Bloom"" sounds about 200 years old and parts of it probably are, as references to marching spirituals slowly pile up into a ringing cluster of notes. The slow opening of ""In Christ There is No East or West"" shows how easily melodic Fahey could be when so inclined, and ""The Death of the Clayton Peacock,"" with its graceful slide notes hanging in the air like long curls of smoke, is pure atmosphere. With its strong selection of songs and impressive fidelity, <i>The Great Santa Barbara Oil Slick</i> is a worthy summary of where Fahey was at this high point.</p><p>
    
    Musicians complain that critics like to pigeonhole. We're always straining to ""stick you into a box"" by scene, sound, or genre, summing up a life's passion in a single turn of phrase. Is it a fair complaint? Possibly. It's sort of an OCD thing, where we slip into thinking of music as a field of discrete categories, and expect artists to come to rest in their allotted slot (the record collection as coin sorting machine). It's normally a subconscious process, but it happens. There are exceptions, though, these initially puzzling artists that demand a more determined approach and, not coincidentally, rarely grow tiresome. Guys like John Fahey.</p></div>"|2947.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2947-the-great-santa-barbara-oil-slick/|8.2|Mark Richardson

    And now with <em>The Earth Is Blue, released on their new 20/20/20 imprint, they can also scratch ""start record label"" off their shrinking to-do list, and their timing couldn't be better. Thanks to the recent explosion of variously mutating forms of psych-folk, the duo's literate, atmospheric music is sounding more prescient than ever, and they operate at top form on this, their first album of new material in five years.</em></p><p>
    
    Damon and Naomi have always had the spot-on taste, working with such first-rate collaborators as Dean Wareham in Galaxie 500, Wayne Rogers in the short-lived combo Magic Hour, and acid-folk pioneer Tom Rapp. These partnerships have often seemed unduly crucial to the success of their music, since their technical limitations as vocalists (both have gentle, unassuming voices that qualify more as pretty than powerful) and players have sometimes made their purely duo work seem constrained and repetitive.</p><p>
    
    Particularly fruitful has been the pair's recent coalition with the members of Japanese psych leviathan Ghost, beginning with the ambitious, elegiac <i>Damon and Naomi With Ghost</i>. Although that 2000 album contained several peaks of sublime grace, there were also points where Ghost's expansive arrangements had an unbalanced, grafted-on quality, likely due to the fact that the musicians were composing their ideas on two separate continents. On <em>The Earth Is Blue, however, Ghost guitarist Michio Kurihara appears as a virtual third group member, and his impeccable electric guitar contributions are here fully integrated into the immovable foundation of Damon and Naomi's earthy, intimate folk, creating the most satisfying and sheerly transfixing work of the twosome's career.</em></p><p>
    
    Also helping to fill out these songs are trumpeter Greg Kelley and saxophonist Bhob Rainey, and it's their effusive playing that allows tracks like the opening ""Beautiful Close Double"" or the evocative ""Malibran"" to truly achieve liftoff. Throughout the album Kurihara's playing is the model of tasteful restraint, best illustrated by his subtle, jazzy riffing on Naomi's wistfully sung cover of ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps"", an invitation for overwrought fretboard histrionics if ever there was one. Instead, he contents himself by laying back in the wildflowers, examining every note carefully as though it were an exotic leaf in his hands, such as on utterly gorgeous coda of the title track which closes the album with a worldly, passionate whisper. As Naomi sings on the perfectly crafted Mellow Candle-like folk-rock of ""Sometimes"", ""Not everything need be in doubt. Sometimes the right thing comes along.""</p></div>"|2159.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2159-the-earth-is-blue/|8.0|Matthew Murphy

Their lap-pop micro landscapes are intricately detailed, beaming with uncharacteristic expansiveness in a genre that's often precious and diminutive. <i>Different Days</i>, the band's first album in three years, is verily a headphones record. No strangers to hard panning, L'Altra are cleanly and delicately mixed; on <i>Different Days</i>, Rhodes pianos, wobbly-legged guitars, and sluicing strings roam freely within seemingly infinite dreamspace.</p><p>
    
    Listeners familiar with the Notwist, Ms. John Soda, and Psapp are likely to hear strains of those bands, as well as more ambient, texture-oriented groups likes Hood and Bark Psychosis. But unlike Hood, who prefer a consolidated, unified approach, L'Altra are more inscrutable. Their songs are heavily fragmented, stitching together melody from seemingly arbitrary sources. And, hailing from Chicago, they're above all less European; L'Altra may rely on computers, but <i>Different Days</i> aches with a punchy midwestern twang, from the power line-shaded prairie captured on the album's cover to the tremolo-juiced guitars and bucolic strings contained within.</p><p>
    
    Curiously, Amazon.com suggests pairing <i>Different Days</i> with Keren Ann's sensational 2003 album, <i>Not Going Anywhere</i>. Aesthetically, the albums have little in common other than spindly female vocal. But like Keren Ann, L'Altra make music that's almost too soft to matter, with an alluring, slightly sexual pull. Their songs burst open upon inspection; you must first shrink to their size, but once you do, you'll probably want to stick around for awhile.</p><p>
    
    Opener ""Sleepless Night"" starts with a chorus of ringing telephones-- chopped, muted, and processed-- and slowly incorporates acoustic elements as it wiggles into focus. ""It Follows Me Around"", an easy standout, is more immediate: The track opens with an alighting guitar loop, pinioned by ringing bell tones, and blossoms early, reserving only a grandiloquent post-breakdown crescendo. By and large, the album avoids glitch-kitsch, preferring a more natural form of fracture. When the title track opens with a chopped breathy beat, it's quickly reinforced by unobstructed vocals and Rhodes piano.</p><p>
<i>Different Days</i> is notable for its consistency; a collection of primarily lovelorn ballads, each song flickers with detail while retaining many common characteristics. Polymath Lindsay Anderson (she's collaborated with Telefon Tel Aviv, Slicker, and Will Oldham) and Joseph Costa divvy up the vocal sheet, seldom locking in harmony. On ""So Surprise"", however, they join together, rendering an a cappella chorus-- ""If you leave, right back to me/ Like every man, you don't matter/ To every man you don't matter""-- poignant through its implicit gender ironies. And though <i>Different Days</i> is full of sodden slow jams, L'Altra aren't entirely incapable of levity: Closing instrumental ""A Day Between"" packs its suitcase and steals away on a beam of hope, capping this weighty collection with a pounding new-new-wave beat that would make even Braxe and Falke blush.</p></div>"|4652.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4652-different-days/|7.6|Sam Ubl

A ridiculous visual in retrospect-- iLife in Bow E3!-- but it's interesting that someone somewhere thought it made more sense to tight-focus on Rascal's tools rather than his environment. His environment, after all, was the real story; first in the parentless, concrete battleground that he narrated to lucid detail on <em>Boy In Da Corner</em> and later, in the incredible roster of talent that turned out to be lurking just off Dizzee's camera all along.</p><p>  Part of the reason <em>Boy In Da Corner</em> sounded so immediate was because you could sense the friction of Dizzee's story rubbing up against the as-yet-untold stories of those around him. In his lone voice, he always sounded defensive, like someone who'd broken away from the pack and might have to spend the rest of his life running from it. ""MCs better start chattin' about what's really happening,"" he spat on ""Brand New Day"", ""Because if you ain't chattin' about what's happening, then where you living, what you talking about?"" That was Dizzee's dare to grime: exist. Now, 18 months later there's Kano, Terror Danjah, Goodz, Target, D Double E, Lady Sovereign-- it's hard to imagine that grime's viability was ever in question.</p><p>  In fact, as a genre, grime has probably never felt as exciting, vibrant, and promising as it does right now. Its surprising malleability has made it possible for producers to splinter off and pursue different strains-- some adorn their tracks with East Oriental timbres and scales; others go for frosty, brittle sounds; others prefer homemade noises with anxious, scattershot qualities. Sonically, it seems like no idea is too strange right now, just as long as it's fresh. It doesn't hurt that hunger is woven into grime's DNA, either-- a competitive bloodflow only guarantees movement.</p><p>  And yet, for all of that, I can't say I'm surprised that the only grime to register with the record-buying mainstream so far has been Rascal's. Yeah, Wiley's record was slept-on, but Shystie's was a dog, and the jury's still out on a half-dozen full-lengths yet to come. Grime needs confrontation and a mix of personalities to properly assert itself-- it lends perfectly to the compilation format. And yet, underground mix tapes excepted, there hasn't been a single decent comp until now.</p><p>  Luckily, <em>Run the Road</em> is so fucking good that none of that really matters. A collection of ""greatest hits,"" some of which are close to a year old, it should rightfully become the de facto entry point for anyone with even a passing interest in this music. Not only does it provide a sweeping survey of the genre's biggest figures, it strikes to the heart of grime's maneuverability by constantly changing gears without ever sounding anything less than massive. It is also full of more wonderful single moments than you would reasonably expect from an ensemble cast. There's a new sound, a new voice, and a new idea at every turn-- I can't remember the last time a compilation had me this excited for a genre.</p><p>  Hunger is the glue here. Despite the varying production aesthetics and emceeing styles, nearly everything on <em>Run the Road</em> sounds in danger of burning through the speakers. Frantic opener ""Cock Back (v1.2)"" has Terror Danjah, Riko, Bruza, D Double E, and Hyper getting rowdy over plink-plinks and an emptying clip; Roll Deep gushes Oriental synths out its slashed-open stomach on ""Let It Out""; Kano gets streetwise and skittery on the reptilian ""P's and Q's""; remixer Terror Danjah turns the ""Cleaning Out My Closet""-soundalike of Shystie's ""One Wish"" into a universe-swallowing epic. Imagine a single voice toppling a chorus of screams, and then another voice shouting down that racket, and then another-- that's the net effect.</p><p>  I have no idea whether this is going to have the impact that it should. It's certainly too ""British"" to slot in with American hip-hop, but it was a pipedream to think that this incarnation of grime ever could. The sad truth is that I can easily envision a scenario where this does absolutely nothing, short of maybe sneaking into a few record stores through the back door. If that's the way things play out, fine, whatever, I give up. At least it'll be the most incredible failure I've ever heard.</p><p> </p></div>"|2058.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2058-run-the-road/|9.1|Mark Pytlik

A melancholy but arrestingly beautiful image, it depicts Darling on her deathbed; bright flowers float behind her upturned arm like a cluster of soft, pale moons radiating light onto the bleached sea of sheets in which she's drowning.</p>
<p>Besides being a tight aesthetic move, the image also links Antony to the early fabulousness of downtown New York, reminding the informed viewer not only of Darling's too-early death from leukemia, but the AIDS-related passing of the photographer himself, Peter Hujar in 1987 (the same year Warhol died, following routine gall bladder surgery). Klaus Nomi was already buried by then, and the Downtown scene was getting too close to saying goodbye to Cookie Mueller, Keith Haring, David Wojnarowicz, and Antony's sometime doppelganger Leigh Bowery (the subject of Boy George's musical <i>Taboo</i>), among others-- all victims of the AIDS virus.</p>
<p>This visual meditation on death and radical history smoothly conjures the family tree upon which pale, angelic Antony perches. The vocalist/pianist moved from California to NYC after seeing the documentary <i>Mondo New York</i>, lured by the 1980s cabaret scene it depicted. Quite fittingly, his first performance came with a musical troupe called Blacklips at the famed Downtown venue, the Pyramid. Jump now to 2003, when Antony opened for Lou Reed and sang the Velvet Underground classic ""Candy Says"" (yes, for Candy Darling) as an encore after most performances. Knowing all of this-- the very important history in that cover-- helps to understand the melancholy, sense of loss, and rapturous joy in these 10 tracks.</p>
<p>But however aesthetically intriguing and complex that history may be, the ultimate draw is Antony's voice, and within the first two seconds of the album, it should be very clear to even the most unaware newbies that Antony has an amazing Nina Simone/Brian Ferry/Jimmy Scott vibrato, a multi-octave siren that would sound painfully lovely no matter what he was saying. Lucky for us, he fills that promise with worthy syllables. The greatness of this downcast crooner is the melding of that otherworldly trill with a dark, powerful aesthetic. Looking past his sad eye make-up and kewpie-doll features are these mesmerizing songs about loving dead boys, plaintive letters from hermaphroditic children, the fear of dark lonesome purgatories, breast amputation, the fluidity of gender. The first words of ""Hope There's Someone"" and of the album ""Hope there's someone who'll take care of me/ When I die"" feel more lonesome than just about anything and then there's the rapturous promise of ""For Today I Am A Boy""' that ""One day I'll grow up and be a beautiful woman/ One day I'll grow up and be a beautiful girl"".</p>
<p><i>I Am a Bird Now</i>'s majesty didn't come easily: Antony's self-titled debut was released five years ago on David Tibet's Durtro label, but only now has he found the perfect mix between style and substance. More stripped down than earlier offerings-- most of the focus is on piano and voice, although violin, viola, cello, sax, and flute are also heard-- there's no missing Antony's thoughtful words.</p>
<p>There are a number of guest vocal spots-- Devendra Banhart (gypsy incantations in the beginning of ""Spiralling""), Boy George (""You Are My Sister""), Rufus Wainwright (""What Can I Do?""). All of these powerful singers are overshadowed by Antony's angelic chops, though Boy George ends up turning in a surprisingly moving performance. His duet with Antony explores private memory, brotherhood/sisterhood (regardless of gender), relationships, empowerment (""I was so afraid of the night/ You seem to move to places/ That I feared""), and wish fulfillment. (Really, grab the hankies.)</p>
<p>For his part, longtime Antony fan/champion Lou Reed does a little spoken ""I was lying in my bed last night"" intro and some chunky guitar chords on the doo-wop horn swagger of standout ""Fistful of Love"", which works itself up to a frothy Otis Redding devotional to love's bruises and the comfort of a familiar fist: ""I accept and I collect the memories of your devotion on my body"".</p>
<p>The mingling of friends is a treat but, heart in his hand, Antony can more than ably go it alone-- even though he spends so much of <i>I Am A Bird Now</i> fearing solitude and celebrating those rare perfect connections. Then again, in this carefully laid out record, the final track, ""Bird Gurl"", leads quite dramatically to full-fledged climax as our hero searches for and finds wings, finally taking a solo flight. Contrast this with the pathos of the opener's fear of falling asleep and that ""middle place"" between light/life and darkness/death. Of course, when the album begins again, so does the reality of perhaps having nobody to hold an aching dying head. But then, so does Antony's riveting trip towards his airborne epiphany. And on the cover, Candy's flowers remain in bloom.</p>

This is not a new idea, regardless of whether you view the trend as toxic or innocuous.</p><p>
    
    Possibly the last interesting facet of this phenomenon is how people with staunchly progressive politics and who countenance no hate speech in their everyday lives can switch these precepts off like a faucet when confronted with the hypnotic strains of the latest 50 Cent single. Maybe we're too postmodern to apprehend values so contrary to the ones we profess as anything but satirical cultural criticism. Or maybe we've just been lulled into compliance, taught that the small voice of the conscience is the priggish influence of Tipper Gore, to be suppressed and disregarded.</p><p>
    
    In our neoconservative political environment, all dissent is treason. Rap eerily echoes this conservatism; all dissent is player-hating. Talib Kweli was onto this years ago: ""Reverse psychology got 'em scared to say when shit is whack/ Out of fear of being called a hater, imagine that!"" Sage Francis can be truthfully called a lot of not-necessarily-nice things: Self-absorbed, condescending, solipsistic, and heavy handed. But he could never be accused of docility. Francis never mastered the shoulder shrug that's become so natural a defense mechanism for many of us; his stockpile of moral outrage is limitless, and whether you agree with his renunciation of mainstream rap as repetitive, poisonous filler (on ""Dance Monkey"": ""She likes the repetitive songs that keep playin'/ You know the repetitive songs that keep playin'?"") or think he's a self-aggrandizing prick, it's fascinating to observe how strangely he rubs against the culture, turning its own weapons against it and criticizing its assumptions.</p><p>
    
    On <em>A Healthy Distrust</em>, Francis continues to refine his contradictory blend of trash talk and activism, political polemic and introspection, pedantic bluster and profound insecurity. He's always emphasized substance above style: If you have something to say, you say it, even if it means losing the beat for a minute. But here his style has finally caught up with his intellect, and while his beats are passable but unexceptional, his voice locks onto and scans over them so ferociously they're almost obliterated. He's a Bizzarro-world Eminem, his voice low instead of high; using his ramifying metaphors and serpentine rhyming schemes to decry cultural decline instead of celebrating it.</p><p>
    
    Ever the realist, Francis doesn't seem to hold any hope of closing these wounds, political or personal--his invective is depressive and irate, imbued with a sense of determined futility. ""The Buzz Kill"", erupting with antsy strings and explosive drums, laments the decadence and celebrity-worship of rap culture. ""Sea Lion"", all skittering drums and hypnotic melody, is equally pessimistic about the prospects of healing childhood injuries: ""Ma, look what I did to my hands, I broke 'em/ You gave me the stone, gave me the chisel, didn't say how to hold them"". And ""Gunz Yo"" is strikingly brave, taking on rap's firearm fetish with all of the stridency of what it attacks.</p><p>
    
    Fire with fire. ""Gunz Yo"" isn't a plea for non-violence, it's a bald-faced threat. ""It might remind you of a mic the way I hold it to the grill of a homophobic rapper/ Unaware of the graphic nature of phallic symbols/ Tragically ironic, sucking off each others gats and pistols"". This isn't the first time Francis has overtly spoken out against homophobia, and it's lines like this-- and his classic turn from Non-Prophets's <em>Hope</em>, ""I attended candlelight vigils for Matthew Shepard while you put out another 'fuck you faggot' record""-- that best exemplify the bipolar, counterintuitive nature of his style.</p><p>
    
    Of course, I don't think Sage Francis is going to make anyone change their minds or behavior, and he doesn't seem to think so either. But he expresses an especially distinct, heartfelt worldview, and serves as a galvanic reminder to reevaluate your politics and morals on a personal level. The vast majority of hip-hop isn't harmful or hurtful, but that doesn't mean we should open wide for whatever they want to shove down our gullets. Amid such adverse circumstances of unclear implication, a bit of distrust seems healthy indeed.</p></div>"|3181.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3181-a-healthy-distrust/|8.0|Brian Howe

But <i>Horn of Plenty</i> proves that categorization would be neither fair nor accurate. The gentlemen of Grizzly Bear paw around in wholly distinct regions of gentle, nocturnal psych-folk, conjuring visions of an imagined bedroom collaboration between the Doug Yule-era Velvet Underground, Nick Drake, and a pajama-clad Pooh with his head jammed in a honey jar.</p><p>
    
    Originally conceived by multi-talented singer-songwriter Edward Droste as solo demos, the recordings that became <i>Horn of Plenty</i> were later augmented by the additional vocals and instrumentation of Christopher Bear, and after hearing the off-handed cohesion of the duo's dreamy harmonies and their seemingly effortless musical interplay it's difficult to imagine these songs achieving such heights of hushed majesty in any other format. And the extra set of hands ensures the flow of enough fresh oxygen to allow the album to avoid complete descent into the troubled, myopic solitude of such similarly toned homespun constructions as Skip Spence's <i>Oar</i> or Syd Barrett's <i>The Madcap Laughs</i>.</p><p>
    
    The album opens with the appropriately submerged sounds of ""Deep Sea Diver"", which gradually climbs through currents of chiming, bell-like keys and guitars before finally surfacing into golden falsetto rays of sunlight. ""Disappearing Act"" marries its autumnal folk choruses to gauzy smears of vinyl hiss, handbells, and remote martial snares, while the clattering pocket symphony of ""Showcase"" eventually dissolves into the wordless vocalizing of felines on distant fire escapes. On nearly every track a previously unheard element, such as the mournful violin that shivers up the spine of ""Eavesdropping"", makes a brief spectral appearance before once again vanishing, leaving the listener to wonder at what hidden treasures further scrutiny might unearth.</p><p>
    
    Given the heady depth of <i>Horn of Plenty</i>'s hazy musical swoon, Grizzly Bear's lyrics somewhat surprisingly strike a pleasant counterbalance by residing more often than not in the familiar realm of day-to-day reality. It's not unusual to hear Droste and Bear singing relatively mundane pronouncements like ""My chest hurts a lot tonight"" or ""It's amazing I can still sing this song so simply about you,"" with such matter-of-fact nonchalance that as a result these songs collectively sound as unforced and natural as a series of quiet exhalations, capable of transferring the beguiling, intoxicating atmospheres of Grizzly Bear's bedroom directly into your own.</p></div>"|3666.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3666-horn-of-plenty/|7.7|Matthew Murphy

Of course, some unattainable love interest haunts him at each of these locations, but for the most part Bramwell's lyrical scope remains incredibly narrow. With that in mind, I Am Kloot are a three-piece Mancunian outfit unsure if they want to be the next Blur or the next Keane. For every clever or cynical piece of songwriting on their debut <i>Natural History</i>, there was an equally unappealing moment of staleness. On their self-titled second album-- released 18 months ago in their native England-- I Am Kloot take baby steps to reduce this ratio and distinguish themselves from the rest of Britain's rock fodder.</p><p>
    
    To be fair, I Am Kloot will never actually become Keane. Bramwell's nasally voice is too biting to pull off sappy sing-along anthems, and he wisely avoids them here. Additionally, the band exhibits significant instrumental growth compared to the monotonous debut. Opener ""Untitled #1"" shows off Andy Hargreaves' savvy drumming while on ""Life in a Day"", the album's standout track, Peter Jobson's smug bassline charges Bramwell's otherwise dejected tone.</p><p> 
    
    However, while the band is smart enough to avoid egregious indie rock pitfalls, the album still suffers from a lack of ingenuity. Bramwell uses the pub/apartment/pastoral trifecta ad nauseam, as demonstrated by this I Am Kloot lyrics mash-up I have prepared: ""Loneliness...it drinks but never leaves ('3 Feet Tall')/ You stand like a rock, on top of the mountain ('Cuckoo')/ Swell, we're living in a hotel ('Proof')/ You say you're like a tree or a bus stop ('Untitled #1')"". Although the songs generally steer clear of predictability, Bramwell's melodies are limited by his narrow singing range. As a result, most of the hooks fall flat, which isn't a total loss considering who would actually want the phrase ""you say you're like a tree or a bus stop"" stuck in his head.</p><p>
    
    Fortunately, Bramwell's bandmates do a decent job of covering his snarky ass on most songs, though stripped-down ballads like ""Proof"" and ""Not a Reasonable Man"" still expose him as an unattractive, hungover malcontent. I Am Kloot comb over their weaknesses, avoiding the schmaltz that eventually doomed bands like Athlete and Badly Drawn Boy, but barely differentiating themselves from them in the process.</p></div>"|4159.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4159-i-am-kloot/|5.1|Adam Moerder

Let me show you my scars. For nearly 17 months, I went to bed to the unison of clickity-clacks and PHOOM-PHOOM-PHOOD-THUNK-SNAP-SNAP-PHOOM-PHOOM-PHOOM. My college roommate at San Francisco State enjoyed the after-hours pastime of updating his stock market report to the strains of gabber techno wrecking his PC's tiny speakers beat by beat. Now gabber is typically acclaimed as the ""metal"" of electronica with its gas-huffed, buzzsaw synths and jackhammered, acid-bass beats that don't so much thud as purr. Snippets of trash culture-- from  Marilyn Manson bragging about being stranded on an island made of cocaine sand and marijuana forests to video game-esque threats of violence-- often serve as garnish.</p><p> 
    
    The noise could soundtrack 'ole-timey, escapist abandon for a good five minutes, but when someone loops the same damn rhythms over and over for months on end, it digs a fingernail into your soul and tears inch by inch. Plus, listening to drum machines cranked at 300 beats-per-minute can numb the senses into sheer boredom. Perhaps my roommate was responsible for my brief bouts of sleepwalking.</p><p> 
    
    Now, here comes Aaron Funk. This lad from Winnipeg is a fine swordsman on the breakcore tip, often improving the formula of dandy, music-box harmonies razor-slashed with beats that shatter in 12,000 pieces when blown upon. This prankster releases what seems like a dozen records a years, but it can get a bit much when he leaves it to you to clean his mess. He's delivered some memorable gimmicks-- especially <i>Nymphomatriarch</i>, a self-titled collaboration with Hecate on which they sample their own mating sounds. It's one of the most detached, asexual, and alien pieces of dance music ever.</p><p>
<i>Winnipeg Is a Frozen Shithole</i> is witty by name only. The EP's song titles are various declarations of revolt ballpoint-penned on 7th grade desks, (ex. ""Winnipeg Is a Dogshit Dildo"", ""Die Winnipeg Die Die Die Fuckers Die""). Nothing much is said about the Canadian hamlet other than fragments of folks telling how cold and dreary it is, like a newsclip telling of a high school coach accused of sexually assaulting a student. Yet, wishing your hometown would burn in a blue corner of Hell is a rite for many fellas who are never, never, never understood.</p><p> 
    
    The music is almost straight-up gabber, which is great for purists but a chore for others. PHOOM-PHOOM-PHOOD-THUNK-SNAP-SNAP-PHOOM-PHOOM-PHOOM is the general rhythm here. ""Winnipeg Is Steven Stapleton's Armpit"" thankfully breaks the monotony with a couple mindlessly ribbeting the syllables in the word, Winnipeg. Fanny's remix of ""Winnipeg Is a Boiling Pot of Cranberries"" also sticks out for its beats that almost slip from Funk's hands. The most remarkable sample stems from the title track, on which Isabella Rossellini coos, ""Listen to the sounds of Winnipeg"" and ""If you are sad and like beer...I am your lady."" Both lines are sampled from a great fever dream of celluloid, <i>The Saddest Music in the World</i>.</p><p> 
    
    But it's difficult to think of Rossellini, her hand cupped under your jaw, and her proposition amidst the PHOOM-PHOOM-PHOOD-THUNK-SNAP-SNAP-PHOOM-PHOOM PHOOM-PHOOM-PHOOD-THUNK-SNAP-SNAP</p></div>"|8444.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8444-winnipeg-is-a-frozen-shithole/|5.1|Cameron Macdonald

For starters, Chasny overlaps his Six Organs of Admittance moniker's Buddhist origins with paganism, astral projections, prophetic dreams, surrealism, and a reverence for outsider folk masters. Then, of course, there's his day job as a psych monster in Comets on Fire, his craggy partnership with Deerhoof co-founder Rob Fisk in backwoods experimenters Badgerlore, a touring/recording relationship with Current 93's David Tibet, and a brief European tour with Joanna Newsom this April. As lazy as it is to pin Banhart to one specific scene or motif, Chasny proves even more difficult to jam within the confines of the ""New Weird America"" tag. It's like pigeonholing John Fahey's ghost.</p><p>  Now add to all of that an obvious knowledge and love of Southern Lord metal/drone and early 1990s noise. Unlike those who list Vashti Bunyan and Harry Smith as forebears, Chasny cites Ghost, Dead C, Keiji Haino, the Japanese noise label PSF Records, and the vastly underrated contemporary avant guitarist Loren Conners. In the same breath, he talks about the importance of complimenting your Incredible String Band forays with Fushitsusha, Sunn 0))), the radio on white noise, and Skullflower. So while there's no doubt he works within a folk tradition on some level, instead of tagging Chasny with the full-on f-word, it makes more sense to link him with Supreme Dicks or Tower Recordings or other acoustic-minded experimenters.</p><p>  Either way, Chasny's incredibly prolific by any standard. In 2004, his Six Organs ouput alone included <em>For Octavio Paz</em>-- a shadowy collection of mostly instrumental steel and nylon guitar pieces (with lovely bells and chimes)-- along with the reissues of 2000's <em>Manifestation</em> and 1999's <em>Nightly Trembling</em>. The year before he turned Nikki Sudden with <em>Compathia</em> and his self-titled 1998 debut received the reissue treatment. As Lou Barlow once taught by example, being so prolific can present a dud-heavy obstacle course, but thus far Chasny's yet to lay an overcooked egg. Better yet, his newest foray (the first for Drag City) is his strongest, most satisfying effort to date.</p><p>  Though his past home-recorded output never felt thin, <em>School of the Flower</em> is his first recorded in a studio (gone is the borrowed cassette 4-track) and the result is a dense, more three-dimensional sound. It's also his most tightly composed effort, a Zen balance between <em>Compathia</em>'s lullabies, <em>For Octavio Paz</em>'s melancholy six-string intricacies, and <em>Dark Noontide</em>'s drifting, fractured downer psych universe. If you haven't heard Six Organs yet, this is where to start.</p><p>  The album begins with the raucous ""Eighth Cognition"", wherein Sunburned Hand of the Man/Cold Bleak Heat drummer Chris Corsano does what he does best, sluicing up an elegant dust storm part tornado/part precision rap. The churning, cymbal crash lasts for a little over a minute before suddenly dissipating and blending into the fragile ""All You've Left"", one of Chasny's gorgeous falsetto ballads.</p><p>  Taking the whirlpool of ""Eighth Cognition"" whirlpool a bit further, the 13-and-a-half-minute title track is a guitar/drum meltdown Chasny says was inspired by John Cale and Terry Riley's seminal 1971 collaboration, <em>Church of Anthrax</em>. On it, Chasny's guitar turns into an infinite loop under which Corsano's free to blow to and fro. Inititating a different sense of motion, ""Saint Cloud"" drifts patiently along Chasny's soft chants and dense ""Ohm""'s, some sort of droning, increasingly spiraled feedback, and crisp repetitious strings.</p><p>  The spare ""Words For Two"" and ""Home"" (the later with a star-kiss, Loren Connors-style guitar launch) are Chasny's tightest, most affecting vocal-and-guitar pieces to come gliding 'round the holy mountain. There's also a thoughtful cover of Gary Higgins' folk classic, ""Thicker Than a Smokey"" from the 1973 album, <em>Red Hash</em>, which was recorded briefly before he went to prison on a two-year, nine-month sentence for possession of marijuana. Chasny's take perhaps lacks the distant small-town melancholia of the original, but when he sings its haunting opening-- ""What do you intend to do young man? Where do you intend to go?""-- there are still chills. Chasny has often covered it live and decided to ""throw it on the record to put the word out so we could find Gary Higgins."" In fact, Zach Cowie at Drag City started writing all the Gary Higgins' he could find and eventually located the red-haired folkie, who just signed a contract with Drag City to reissue his lost 1973 masterpiece. (Like the best records, <em>School of the Flower</em>'s legacy extends beyond just its songs.)</p><p>  As intimated earlier, <em>School of the Flower</em> blooms and dies rather quickly. Put more prosaically, the whole thing runs its course in just under 40 minutes. This might seem like a minimalist shame for amped-up drone junkies, but really it's a tasteful (and very very  welcome)  gesture. More practically speaking, when Chasny reaches the final  jangling sustain of the guitar coda lullaby ""Lisbon,"" he still hasn't  made a misstep or tapped a wrong note, so who can blame him for achieving  something so sublime and not wanting to fuck it up? Whatever its duration, <em>School of the Flower</em> is one of those rare, understated but compulsive collections you'll want to listen to on repeat until it's time to blow out the incense, dump the wine in the sink, and step fuzzy-headed into the imperfect sunlight of the prosaic, but suddenly potentially transcendent world.</p><p> </p></div>"|7203.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7203-school-of-the-flower/|8.3|Brandon Stosuy

It's here that the Anomoanon's <i>Joji</i> seems destined to be found, burrowed out from the wet earth, caked in clay, beloved by ants.</p><p>
    
    There's something unsettlingly familiar about <i>Joji</i>, the Anomoanon's seventh full-length-- it might be because the six-piece resuscitates and revises a variety of classic rock gestures, or because their sound is so oddly, eerily organic, or because vocalist/guitarist Ned Oldham's high, throaty, Kentucky-born warble can sound disconcertingly similar to younger brother Will's. But mostly, it's how <i>Joji</i> sounds like above-ground pools and paper cups full of lemonade, like fireflies in mayonnaise jars and rusty sprinklers, country cottages and snap peas: it's Americana without the pre-packaged kitsch-- all ground and sky and precious American ritual. <i>Joji</i> sounds like a record made by mountains.</p><p>
    
    For the most part, <i>Joji</i> eschews the light, snappy melodies and traditional lyrics of its predecessor, <i>The Derby Ram</i>, in favor of woodsy, instantly addictive country-folk dirges. Given Oldham and guitarist Aram Stith's fondness for scrappy electric solos, it's not particularly surprising that the Anomoanon are routinely compared to <i>On the Beach</i>-era Neil Young and/or the Grateful Dead circa <i>American Beauty</i>-- but keyboardist Dave Heumann's psych-infused squiggles lend <i>Joji</i> a dark, celestial swagger that's more Floydian than anything else (see, especially, mesmerizing opener ""Down and Brown""). <i>Joji</i> has its share of folkier moments, too-- the instrumental ""After Than Before"" features 12-string noodling, puttering bass, and minimal percussion, while the plucky, Stith-penned ""Green Sea"" is singalong-ready, anchored around a honky guitar melody, six-man harmonizing, and Oldham's shrugging vocals (""Your socks and shoes are filled with sand/ Your heart is beating for another man"").</p><p>
<i>Joji</i> confidently follows its own ebbs and flows, and, consequently, can occasionally feel a bit jammy-- but before you conjure drum circles, handmade pants, and Birkenstock clogs, know that the Anomoanon are always, always purposeful about their wankery, and some of the extended instrumentation included here (see the excellent ""Wedding Song"", which flits, over the course of its 10 staggering minutes, from waltz to 4/4 and back to waltz) is genuinely impressive. <i>Joji</i> may periodically flirt with gothic undertones, but it ultimately plays like a warm, comforting slice of deep American rock-- recognizable and exciting all at once.</p></div>"|205.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/205-joji/|7.9|Amanda Petrusich

After two 7"" singles, the loss of their original drummer, and a call from the lawyers, they reconvened under the less-imaginative-- albeit less litigious-- Four Volts. As befits a band who found inspiration in a Muppet, Four Volts sound extremely spirited, sometimes goofy, and occasionally hilarious. On their full-length debut, <i>Triple Your Work Force</i>, they play pop songs in the punk manner: loud, brash, and often sloppy, closer to the wildness of Animal than the scientist's bumbling nerdiness. That doesn't make them unique, but their relentless energy and sense of fun serve them much better than an undue emphasis on innovation.</p><p>
<i>Triple Your Work Force</i> displays the band's penchant for rowdy verses and big choruses: ""Didn't You Used to Be Invisible?"" kicks the album off with a pogoing beat closer to Big Audio Dynamite than the Clash. ""Rearranged"" is their frenetic explosion of 70s New York punk. ""Mary Said"" is a rousing anthem for bored newlyweds. The insanely catchy ""Heartworm (Ooh Ooh Song)"" contrasts Danny Tieman's increasingly manic delivery with an urgent guitar, handclaps, and Lisa Cuomo's harmonizing ooh oohs. Four Volts play up this contrast between abrasive lead vocals and calmer, almost cooing backing vocals, which enlivens ""Bedlam on the Beat"" and adds hefty tension to ""She Muddied the Water"".</p><p>
    
    Songs like ""Andy Likes His Gravy"" and ""I'm Not a Psyche-o-Path"" (16 seconds of insistently chanting the title) prove that Four Volts aren't afraid of silliness in pursuit of searing lyrics and catchy choruses, but they pull a fast one and turn their gaze shoeward on late-in-the-album songs like ""Hat Trick"" and ""Sunday Night"". The songs aren't bad, just relatively dull, and they trade punchy and raw for Deep and Meaningful, ending the album on a self-serious note. Had those tracks been interspersed throughout the album, they perhaps wouldn't seem like genre exercises aping currently fashionable influences, a sour move for a band whose specialty is combustible spontaneity. On the other hand, this proclivity toward range-expanding experimentation helps Four Volts live up to their previous name.</p></div>"|3332.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3332-triple-your-work-force/|7.7|Stephen M.

Comparisons to the Elephant 6 Collective were apt not only because of the Shapes' psychedelic influences but because they were equally prolific: In addition to several IS albums (they released two full-lengths in 2003 alone), Peter King and primary songwriters Chris Barth and Aaron Deer have released solo projects, and three members of the Shapes moonlight in the band John Wilkes Booze.</p><p>
    
    On <i>Horus</i>, they're still indebted to sounds of the 1960s (sounding less ""lo-fi"" here than ever), both in their British folk-influenced melodies and psychedelic textures. But compared to their previous work, <i>Horus</i> is tighter and more focused, and the songs are static in tone rather than the dynamic shifts that fans may expect. The whimsy of their previous efforts has been flattened in favor of a consistent, melancholy mood.</p><p>
    
    The album isn't necessarily dark, though its lyrics might suggest otherwise. When not singing about demons and princesses, Chris Barth grounds the fantasy elements of his lyrics with heavy thoughts of loneliness. You can hear it in ""Putrefaction"", featuring lines like ""You will drown down below/ While ever onward I roll"" and ""Now go off on your own/ I feel better alone/ I turn seaweed to stone/ I make music alone."" But the words sound lighter on record than they do on paper thanks to Barth's boyish delivery. ""Forever Alone"" even sounds oddly triumphant, with a horn section backing the chorus of ""I am alone/ Tonight and forever.""</p><p>
    
    The pair of ""Demon"" songs are the most memorable tracks. ""Demon Child"" sets the bar early, moving from warm organ tones into one of the record's few rock riffs. ""Demon Love"", on the other hand, is the lone curveball of the record: It begins as a prodding dirge, but when in the chorus swells with a choir of backing vocals, it's the closest to real despair the album gets-- but it's also its most gorgeous moment.</p><p>
    
    The melodies take time to grow, but the brevity and unresolved air of these songs make many of them feel like fragments. I hate to sound foreboding, but the record that <i>Horus most reminds me of is Pavement's <em>Terror Twilight</em>. It's a worthwhile record with some minor peaks, but I hope the band finds their way out from under </i><i>Horus's grey cloud.</i></p></div>"|4087.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4087-horus/|6.9|Jason Crock

The first is when someone asks, and you think about it, and you say something boring and realistic like the Clash. The other is when the music is actually playing, live or recorded, and it just comes out: This is the greatest thing ever.</p><p>
    At their best, Stereo Total are that second type of band. Writing about this duo makes them sound complicated-- part synth kitsch, part garage band, part Gainsbourg/Bardot revivalists-- but the truth is that most everything they write is simple enough for the two of them to play on their own. The music's like a cross between a thrift shop and the Apple store: Just a jumble of ""amateurish"" pop-song trinkets, stylish cast-offs, and entertaining gadgets. They're like Saint Etienne, except French and German and funny and horny and trapped in your garage with a case of cheap beer and a shitty drum kit.</p><p>
<i>Do the Bambi</i> is their sixth full-length, and it's as much a turning point as a drop-off in quality. Toy with anything-goes aesthetics for long enough and you're going to develop some ambition. That's what you hear on this one: a slinkier, more sophisticated duo, one that makes little motions out into complexity instead of coasting on sheer verve.</p><p>
    Over the course of 19 tracks, results are maddeningly mixed. This album, even more than their others, is like a cheap pinata: A lot of candies come out, and a few of them are bound to be stale yellowish things that don't taste like butterscotch. The treats, though, are fascinating. ""Babystrich"" has Brezel Göring singing noir falsetto disco that nudges toward Scissor Sisters territory; ""Hungry!"" goes back to FraxE7oise Cactus for the old pop charge, an addictive chipmunk hook, and a lyric that conflates hunger and loneliness (extra points for ""me so hungry""). And it's there, around the center of the album, that some of the old verve returns-- like on the terrific ""Tas de Tôle"", which gets together some of the cut-and-paste ""dance music"" euphoria of their last few records.</p><p>
    So more slink, less chirpy pop; decent highs and throw-away lows. There are surely 15 minutes of Terrific in here, and maybe 30 of Okay, all capped off by an acidic synth-and-vocal cover of ""Chelsea Girls"". Nothing to get excited about, but they just might be inching their way someplace interesting-- Stereo Total less as stylish curiosities and more as contenders.</p></div>"|7491.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7491-do-the-bambi/|6.4|Nitsuh Abebe

Indeed, the groups mentioned as sonic antecedents of      Urbain's music-- most notably the Jesus &amp; Mary Chain and Big Black-- make      the oft-abused claim of wrongful neglect justifiable in this instance.      And then you realize what probably kept Metal Urbain from getting the      same reverential treatment of their hallowed peers or their      recently-exhumed brethren are probably the very things that attracted folks like      the Reid Bros. &amp; Steve Albini to their work: Their groundbreaking (as in      pulverizing) drum-machine assault, their distorted crash-and-burn      guitars, the metronomic noise clicks, and their shouted vocals (in French, as the group didn't set up enough      obstacles      between themselves and any potential English-speaking fans).</p>
<p>Listening to <i>Anarchy In Paris!</i> in short bursts, the      coulda-been-a-contender gnashing is intermittently justified. ""Panik"" (the A-side to the aforementioned Rough Trade single) constructs a primitive and monstrous      wall of fuzz, and pelts the wall with a drum machine, some synth      splatter, and cavernous martial barks. Even if the nuance of the message is lost in translation, the back-and-forth shouts of ""Panik!"" coupled with      the incendiary guitar solo at the halfway mark make clear the group's intent. Unfortunately, most of the remaining 23 tracks feature      minor variations and refinements on this Wall Of Industrialized Sound,      turning the bulk of this album into indistinguishable mush.</p>
<p>While some wrinkles in the formula emerge-- ""Pop Poubelle"" features      some surf-guitar, ""Lady Coca Cola"" is Metal Urbain sans drums--      they're blanded out after the TommyRamonatron is triggered and the vocalist      gets the bit removed from his mouth. It takes until Track 19, the      Kentucky-fried ""Colt 45"", for some real variety to spice up Metal      Urbain's cuisine, and that's mostly courtesy of a minor tweak in      guitar tone and a singing style that shies away from the usual Cookie      Monsterisms. The next track, ""Train"", is even more of a screwball-- it's blues standard ""Train Kept A-Rollin'"" done with drum machine and      guitar. The trick here is that the drum machine keeps perfect time--      after all, it is a machine-- while the guitar and vocals decide to      derail themselves every so often. The friction between the oblivious drum      track and the stumbling meat turns out to be charming.      Following that there are two slabs of mechanized heavy breathing (""Sweet      Marilyn"" and ""Little Girl of Love""), a tango-not-tango, and an instrumental      reprise of ""Panik"" that takes a Sunday drive on Gary Numan's Autobahn,      but chances are most folk will get bogged down by the murky middle      section of this disc and never get to the goodies at the end.</p>
<p>For those looking for a little more variation in their neglected French      new-wave retrospectives, try <i>Tokio Airport</i>, a 19-track Metal Boys      compendium. The Metal Boys features two parts Metal Urbain (Eric Débris and Charlie Hurbier) and one part English-speaking Nico clone (China).      It's on these tracks that <i>Anarchy In      Paris!</i>' flights of fancy soar. For one, the group's learned how to program their drum machine to do more than play poom-tish at different speeds, which allows for excursions into bossanova (""He's Shaken Up"") and stray cat strutting      (""Parlez Moi D'Argent""), in addition to the expected sci-fi damage. Also,      China proves to be a flexible vocalist. She's willing to do the pop      robot on bip boppy tracks like ""Be Bop Dee Zee Pop"", ""Wah Lee Bomp Dee      Bomp"", and the less onomatopoetic ""Discount Bill"", but China's equally at      home playing such disparate roles as the Strangelovian porn star (in      ""Suspenders in the Park""-- feel free to quote either ""Fuck my ass in      World War III"" or ""Napalm, you're so good in bed"" in your valedictorian      speech) and the semi-detached quotidian raconteur (in the oddly affecting      ""X-Mas Day"").</p>
<p>Of course, since the Metal Urbain disc ended on a high note, the Metal      Boys disc backs into the finish line, ending with 21 minutes of dubby      warbling (""Un Petit Peu D'Amour""), repetitive oscillations (""Disco      Future""), and some unseemly middle ground between these two poles (""Outer      Space""). But, then, these discs are meant to be historical documents,      not succinct statements of intent. As such, they might not guarantee      Metal Urbain a notable place in music history, but it's not as if Metal      Urbain is ready for carbon-dating just yet, either. Twenty-four years      after breaking up, they've reunited, and are in the process of recording      a new album while simultaneously looking for a label to release this      record.

The answer is no. Oddly, for a state that signed the Declaration of Independence even before reading it, it must have waited to pick all of its official state ""things"" after everyone else had their turn. Delaware's state bird is the blue hen. And their state marine animal is the horseshoe crab. State soil? Greenwich loam. (Port silt was already taken I guess.) The state beverage? Wait for it...it's milk.</p><p>
    
    But if Delaware statesmen put up nominations for state emcee, Hezekiah has to be on the ballot. The First State native son has played the backdrop for the likes of Musiq and Bilal, in addition to catalyzing the producers' open forum, the Beat Society. And although I've never met him, I bet he's got one of those neckbeards the kids are clamoring for, as well as a lot of knit hats.</p><p>
    
    Hezekiah released this album's lead single, ""Gypsy Slang"", back in 2003, so <i>Hurry Up and Wait</i> is an appropriate title for his proper career jump-off. Drawing heavily from the Philadelphia hip-hop sound creeping across the Delaware River, Hezekiah adheres to a strict diet of hi-hat/snare combinations and chest-rattling bass that cover his missteps as an emcee. (""How you gonna bust with an umbrella up your in butt opening up?"") ""Right On"", for example, pulls straight from the Time-Life hip-hop collection circa 1998 with a propulsive soul clatter that mimics a keyboard courting the bass drum.</p><p>
    
    But without a watermarked sound, Hezekiah only builds on the backs of others. At this point, the baby Jay Dee comparisons are obvious and tracks like ""You"", with its bass-pause-clap staccato, would fit nicely somewhere in Slum Vil's <i>Fantastic</i> collection. Of course, Hezekiah also inherited Detroit's juvenile and utterly uncreative approach to female relations. (I think there are Cliffs Notes on romantic subtlety from Zalman King that never made it Hezekiah's home studio.) Demonstration? See ""Photograph"". ""She half nude, exposin' her fallopian tubes."" Pretty sexy, eh? After all, nothing says I love you like ""Put 'em on the glass/ Lemme take a photograph.""</p><p> 
    
    Despite its lightly veiled homages and patent immaturity, <i>Hurry Up and Wait</i> is a solid debut. And I can honestly say it's the best hip-hop album from Delaware in the past decade.</p></div>"|3999.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3999-hurry-up-and-wait/|7.1|Jamin Warren

It's a dub of a dub given to her by the boyfriend pre-me who got it from a trollop he dated for a minute who stole it from a kid she made out with in some car that wasn't his. Where the owner of that car got it is, I'm sure, quite fascinating, and somehow the backseat genealogy leads to a 4-track in Minneapolis. By the time the tape got to me, it sounded like a dude with a mouthful of toilet paper rhyming over trunk-beats of passing cars-- but that shit was ill, son! From what I gather, that tape was cobbled bits of Atmosphere's original <i>Headshots</i> mixes. I'm not going to bullshit and say that I listened to it until my cassette deck jammed, nor did I pass it on like a mild burning sensation to my next ladyfriend. Nope, I dumped it in a box along with the hope of ever loving again, and the sad, lascivious story of that little tape came to an end. Rhymesayers obviously had this fate in mind when they decided to remaster the final installment of Atmosphere's <i>Headshots</i> mixtapes along with a bonus disc of highlights from <i>Volumes 1-6</i>.</p><p> 
    
    Originally released in the interim between the group's debut LP, <i>Overcast!</i>, and its successor, <i>Lucy Ford</i>, <i>Headshots: Se7en</i> is little more than a vaguely interesting document of Slug's progression from shit-talker (""Tracksmart"") to hip-hop's Conor Oberst (""The Abusing of the Rib""). Recent efforts were praised for the introspective, self-deprecating lyrical spin, although the Native Tongues did it better ten years previous. Shit, Biz Markie is the king of emo-rap! Always willing to turn a verbose phrase, Slug undermines his cleverness with what appears to be an unfortunate case of Van Horton's Syndrome. His inability to modulate the volume or pitch of his voice by any noticeable degree makes sitting through the entire 21 songs, not to mention the additional 10 tracks on the bonus disc, feel a tad bit tedious. Guest spots from a young Eyedea, Musab, and Gene Poole don't add much to the party, though Eyedea's track, ""The Stick Up"", should erase any notions that Slug respects women.</p><p>
    
    Ant's production is slightly impressive considering his tools, but I'm not convinced he would have used any additional tracks had they been available. He only seems hampered on a few tracks and does an admirable job of mixing things up, but somebody needs to hook dude up with a new drum machine. After two hours of his choppy snare scraping my eardrums, I'm ready for some Enya on quiet storm.</p><p> 
    
    For rabid Atmosphere completists, the lure of <i>Headshots: Se7en</i> is either the improvement in sound quality over the old cassette recordings or the fulfillment of a dream. Like Red Sox fans and Democrats, getting what you wish for can be confusing though, resulting in temporary loss of identity. All of the sudden, that eBay bidwar with the Korean kid seems like a waste of time. Here it is, the golden chalice, all polished up and ready to behold. But you didn't really want it. It was the hunt. You were the Indy Jones of file-sharing. Now what? <i>Headshots</i> is a generous treat from a label and artist to his committed fans; as such, it is a worthwhile release. For those who collect other things like TV memorabilia, it will be a hard sell to put funds from my, I mean, their Seth And Summer Savings towards a gift that was meant for someone else.</p></div>"|343.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/343-headshots-se7en/|5.0|Peter Macia

After their 1992 breakout album <i>Palomine</i>, Bettie Serveert's popularity steadily declined, necessitating these career moves on 2003's frustrating <i>Log 22</i>. <i>Attagirl</i>, the band's sixth full-length, doesn't buck the trend as Bettie Serveert try to convince listeners-- and apparently themselves-- that these tropes are proof of some sort of musical development.</p><p>
    Never the most controversial or cynical songwriters, here vocalist Carol van Dyk and guitarist Peter Visser fully embrace the conservatism of adulthood and domesticity. Most of Bettie Serveert's material is written and recorded in Visser's cozy living room studio, and his once-mighty axe now sticks strictly to background noise and texture. Despite kicking off ""Greyhound Song"" with a <i>Physical Graffiti</i>-inspired slide riff, Visser plays slave to van Dyk's vocals and remains surprisingly inconspicuous. Instead, rudimentary sampling, piano, and acoustic guitar back Van Dyk's notoriously slight lyrics, as on the title track: ""Don't say luck/ Is somewhere in the middle/ You've paid for your place in this world/ Attagirl.""</p><p>
    On yawn yawn yawns ""Don't Touch That Dial!"" and ""Hands Off"", the band hopelessly goes after their <i>Palomine</i>-era intensity, like a thirtysomething woman trying to squeeze into her prom dress. Even sadder is the act-of-desperation cover of Bright Eyes' ""Lover I Don't Have To Love"". Former Matador labelmates of Pavement and Yo La Tengo shouldn't have to rely on the popularity of Bright Eyes to attract listeners, yet what is one to do when they've lost their edge? Suddenly, I understand why my father, an old rocker, used to sing along to rap songs in the car.</p></div>"|676.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/676-attagirl/|4.0|Adam Moerder

Yep, welcome to Mu World, with open arms, broken English, and some pretty fucked-up ""programming"" (though I suspect Maurice Fulton is having a field day playing keyboard drums in real time). If you didn't get enough of that leftfield house the first time around, you're in the right place. Of course, <i>Out of Breach (Manchester's Revenge)</i>, the American-Japanese-by-way-of-Sheffield duo's second full-length, doesn't sound like house most of the time-- but any genre name would fail to accurately describe this music. The only tag that's consistently useful is ""six-minute,"" which roughly applies to the minimum amount of time Mu need to complete a great track-- ""Paris Hilton"" being the five-and-half-minute exception that just barely proves the rule. And I'm already exhausted trying to finish an intro paragraph about this record.</p><p>
    
    Unlike 2003's <i>Afro Finger and Gel</i>-- which seems even better now than when it was released-- <i>Out of Breach</i> is less suited for a fucked-up dance party than just for being fucked up. Fulton's tracks veer wildly-- from hard funk-rock, hi-speed go-go blast, and mutant disco to dominatrix electro-performance art soundtrack and what sounds like damaged Japanese game show music. And that has to be good, right? Well, it is, but I can't honestly say it has more great stuff than <i>Afro Finger</i>; rather, it's a tangential breed. Where that album might have been described as ""weird"" or ""quirky,"" this one is ""kind of disturbing"" and ""dark."" These are hardly criticisms: <i>Out of Breach</i> is a different flavor of Mu, one that may very well make more sense to the experimental-centric listener, or even just the rock-centric listener. And there <i>are</i> jams here, but they're  abstract and expressionist rather than weird and quirky.</p><p>
    
    Of course, you'd be forgiven for getting lost in the shuffle of said jams. I did, and while it lasts, it's a mother. After the confrontational (even for Mu) opener ""Haters""-- punctuated by Psycho strings and big, fat rock drums-- <i>Out of Breach</i> runs through about half an hour of nonstop awesomeness. The title track is their best straight house foray, though with the horrific (read: perfect and amazing) echo-chamber ambience, android-monster vocals, and electronic gamelan backdrop, it's difficult to call it ""straight"" anything. Seriously, let this play for a while on repeat and watch the images blur. To pull themselves together, Mu unleash ""Stop Bothering Michael Jackson"" on me, with whirlwind bass line, brush-heavy (emphasis on heavy) drums and Mutsumi Kanamori's request to the stupid, dumb bitch who wants to make a fake story and won't leave MJ alone, ""suck a dick!"" And hmm, the drums just got all machine gun on me, and where did this wind machine come from?</p><p>
    
    ""Tiger Bastard"", ""Throwing Up"", and ""Extreme"" are all variants on Mu's secret weapon: mid-tempo funk-rock bordering on disco like DFA does disco-- think ""Tell You Something"" from <i>Afro Finger</i>. The first one brings out the congas and growling bass line to underscore Kanamori's string of curses, both at regular speed and drastically slowed down for added queasiness. In fact, ""Tiger Bastard"" reminds me of a song that should have been on the LCD Soundsystem album were it equipped to push as many buttons as <i>Out of Breach</i>. ""Throwing Up"", opening chorus of heaves notwithstanding, is a masterful hybrid of post-Stubblefield drum(-machine) acrobatics and house pump-- Fulton had to have been a drummer in his pre-Mu days. ""We Love Guys Names Luke"" doubles the tempo and invites the punk guitars and handclaps to make things a little bit more hectic, as if Kanamori's array of shrieks and vocoder-ized pronouncements weren't enough.</p><p>
    
    Maybe it's asking too much to keep up such a pace, but I could have done without relative ""throwaways"" like ""So Weak People"" and ""Like A Little Bitch""-- the former being a bizarre, tic-tac take on a ""Fever""-style jazz tune, and the latter being that short game show thing I alluded to earlier, all dadaist and retro-futuristic. That's also known as ""goofy"" in less verbose circles, and though I'm all for goofiness in doses, it kind of wrecks the apocalyptic flow on <i>Out of Breach</i>. Maybe that was the point, and it's not as if Mu come up short where nightmare jams are concerned. In any case, it's still easy to be fascinated by these people, and even easier to let the best parts of this record do what they will to me. If that makes me Mu's bitch, so be it.</p></div>"|5562.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5562-out-of-breach-manchesters-revenge/|8.2|Dominique Leone

    York City. Nothing fancy: just three pre-polyphonic chirps, like a car
    alarm arming. Rhys, rather than castigate the hapless technology
    victim, merely quipped: ""That's a good song!""</p><p>
    
    Such is the aesthetic of the Super Furry Animals' self-deprecating
    chief prankster, a grinning Wonka for absurdist pop candy and
    whiz-bang noise-making. The title track to <i>Yr Atal Genhedlaeth</i>
    (an untranslatable p-p-pun that means ""The Stuttering Generation"") is
    just nine seconds that, y'know, stutter as if to teach iPod Nation how
    scratched CDs used to sound. From there follow 10 songs about the
    Euro, rival MCs who drown their Corn Flakes in beer, and a dying lover
    endearingly nicknamed ""Pwdin Wy"", which means ""Egg Pudding"".</p><p>
    
    All that, and it's <i>less</i> psychedelic than your average Super Furries'
    album, emphasizing songcraft and melody, and framed by Rhys' upside-down
    left-handed Velcro-enhanced acoustic guitar and thriftstore Yamaha
    beats. De facto opener ""Gwyn Mi Wn"" eschews even the guitar, opting
    for airy overlapped vocals atop clanging cymbal 'n' drum samples. ""Ni
    Yw Y Byd"" flips through keys like your humble rock scribbler through
    Ffa Coffi Pawb 12-inches he can't pay for, yet remains sing-songy
    enough for its title (trans., ""We Are the World""). Those demanding
    still-greater quirkiness are directed to wistful ""Ambell Waith"", which
    rocks both car-noise synths and village-green trumpets.</p><p>
    
    Then there's the straightforward power-pop of ""Pwdin Wy 1"", ""Epynt"",
    and ""Y Gwybodusion"", which guarantee uncomprehending elevator-ride
    sing-a-longs. I mentioned this is all in Welsh, right? The language
    barrier is easy to forget, despite Rhys's occasionally harsh Brithonic
    consonants, because much like the Super Furry Animals' 2000
    Welsh-language excursion, <em>Mwng</em>, this album strings together so
    much surface-level pop magnificence-- what Nietzsche called "" the
    whole Olympus of appearance""-- that its lyrics are, to
    English-speaking listeners, beside the point. Thus Rhys can cover a
    Celine Dion-worthy Welsh power ballad, ""Chwarae'n Troi'n Chwerw"" and
    we can raise our lighters none the wiser.</p><p>
    
    All <i>Yr Atal Genhedlaeth</i> lacks is the unifying ambition of the
    great SFA records. That's understandable, given this album's casual
    nature. But the solo disc's off-the-cuff jollity befits Rhys's concert
    opener/closer: a pre-programmed elevator-synth rendition of ""Just the
    Way You Are"".</p></div>"|6938.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6938-yr-atal-genhedlaeth/|7.8|Marc Hogan

I've never listened to an Albini-produced band and not thought my ears were clogged. Sure, the man's 'nuff-said production credits go on and on, but I often wonder if a band like Mclusky would sound even more punishing if they were left out in the open, free of the silo 'verb and guitar strangulation.</p><p>
    
    Still, Albini remains the preferred penis pump of underground rock acts of all stripes. He's on the speed dials of bands looking to get huge in that <i>other</i> sense. High on Fire already own one of the burliest sounds in metal, so what they were hoping to gain by phoning Albini isn't clear. The two seem an unlikely marriage anyway: High of Fire unleash a competent fury that thrives on warm-ish, tube amp'd guitars, and mainlined adrenal essence-- a far cry from Albini's balled-fist, hyper-compressed sludge treatments. 2002's <i>Surrounded By Thieves</i> was a tight-wound stoned-dead masterpiece; if the band were aching for change, they sure didn't play like it.</p><p>
    
    High on Fire fans rejoice: <i>Blessed Black Wings</i> is the band you know and fear. Albini's influence is discreet, serving only to calcify the band's laser-cut attack. My only complaint with the sound is that Matt Pike's vocals-- more tuneful and comprehensible than the genre protocol-- are mixed down, so only the most glottal elements seep through. But perched atop Albini's distended low end, High on Fire are as toothy as they are flesh-searing. Previously, the band's raw energy was trapped in a self-imposed oubliette of standard gloom-n-doom; on <i>Blessed Black Wings</i>, they've busted out, terrorizing the masses with a sharper, more agile sound that will appeal to fans of Mastodon's <i>Leviathan</i>. But unlike Mastodon or prog-metal clairvoyants Converge, High on Fire don't seem the slightest bit preoccupied with the future; they're content to do what they do best as long as there are subtle unexplored pockets of terrain to be squatted on.</p><p>
<i>Blessed Black Wings</i> catapults full-throttle from the gate and scorches at 11 for nearly an hour, halting only for the occasional full-band kick. Avoiding polyrhythmic arabesques, High on Fire are almost antigravity: Their energy seems like it could last forever. Opener ""Devilution"" (now there's a subtle pun) splits the earth and stitches it back together, sending tom-bashing tremors through a landscape of bilious chugging and Voice of God vocals. ""The Face of Oblivion"" is less incendiary but no smaller, steering through a slow sooty opening before turning around in a smooth, economical breakdown that's grandiose sans bravado.</p><p>
    
    Other highlights include ""To Cross the Bridge""-- a seven-minute epic that does the acoustic/electric guitar duel better than Converge or erstwhile Metallica by combining traits of both-- and ""Anointing of Seer"", whose gelatinous plunder gives way to a resplendent, fleeting riff around the 2:30 mark. Up in the elevated mercury of these six- and seven-minute sculptures, things can get muggy, but in terms of shear bombast, Albini has seldom worked with a more independently powerful group of musicians.</p></div>"|3864.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3864-blessed-black-wings/|7.3|Sam Ubl

Rowlands, an accomplished actress, has never been an especially big star, but she's developed something of a cult fanbase for her work in TV drama and films-- particularly those of her late husband, John Cassavetes.</p><p>
    
    Washington, D.C.'s Bob Massey apparently thinks highly enough of Rowlands to name his latest band after her, and it makes sense I suppose. The former Telegraph Melts member has pointed his latest project's arrows at Hollywood and the way movies cause us to perceive the world and our place in it, and choosing the name of an actress who often worked resolutely outside of Hollywood conventions lines up pretty well with his lyrical swipes at Eisner and Spielberg. And the mood of the album also bears more than a passing affinity for American Music Club's tear-in-beeriest moments, so that Eitzel quote isn't up there for nothing.</p><p>
<i>La Merde et Les Etoiles</i> (French for ""Shit and the Stars"", if I read it correctly) is so unified a work of brooding ghost cabaret miserablism you could practically call it a concept album, though the term is a little strong for a record with no overarching narrative. The music could qualify as chamber pop if it had any pretense of wanting to be pop-- instead the violas, vibes, clarinets, and cellos drift along behind Massey's wine-stained baritone, forming a sort of stream-of-consciousness backdrop that drifts in and out of dissonance, occasionally dissolving to a minimalist wisp.</p><p>
    
    In fact, on a few songs in the middle of the record, the minimalism and lack of solid structure is a bit overbearing. ""Pilot for a Situation Tragedy"" is cleverly titled, but the arrhythmic electric guitar strumming and barely there accompaniment just die without anywhere to go, and the song dies with them. Much better is closer ""Power, Lies, Helena's Lips"", one of the few tracks with an actual drum beat. The arrangement is no more solid than anywhere else, though, so the effect is one of chaotic elements being stuffed in a box and escaping again, like a Lucy skit for insomniac depressives.</p><p>
    
    Elsewhere, Massey appropriates the melody of the national anthem for a break-up meditation and wraps the album up with ""The Last Words of Lesley Gore"", an excellent song that plays again with barely structured chamber-pop texture, featuring a great breakdown where he slips into a dejected take on Lesley Gore's ""It's My Party"", morphing it into a startling one-sided conversation about a girl. The moment is perhaps most indicative of the potential of the Gena Rowlands Band, potential that's about three-quarters realized on <i>La Merde et Les Etoiles</i>.</p></div>"|3665.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3665-la-merde-et-les-etoiles/|7.1|Joe Tangari

His piece detailed how during the 70s and early 80s, assorted misfits, art students, and punks concocted an alien disco music, yet his umbrella did not quite shade his honorable mentions, which were as scattered as Smokey Robinson, Public Image Ltd., Material, and James White and the Blacks. There is an argument that a scientific theory is meaningless if it cannot be explained to a 10-year-old. As for ""mutant disco,"" well...let's just consider it disco or a trace of disco that is more likely to halt the dancefloor than continue narcotizing it.</p><p>
    
    The recently resurrected ZE label first cut its teeth releasing examples of ""mutant disco"" on its 1981 comp of the same name. Perhaps because of Shapiro's piece, ZE reissued and doubled the size of <i>Mutant Disco: A Subtle Discolation of the Norm</i> in 2003. Now the label issues <i>Volume 3: Garage Sale</i>, a supposed shoebox of Reagan-era snapshots from when disco evolved into ""garage"" or the beginnings of house music on the turntables of DJ Larry Levan at the Paradise Garage in New York.</p><p>
    
    While ZE's connection with mutant disco and house is rather forced, I just have to ask this question: Where has Junie Morrison been all my life? He planted one of the most vivid images in my mind with his 1983 electro-funk tune sold in the <i>Garage Sale</i>, ""Techno-Freqs"". The Funkadelic vet seemingly hosts a lunchtime performance for a teen science-fair; pondering video game addiction with a broken tape-loop machine and a robot that parrots idiot-box catchphrases. ""Are we man or machine? We have to make the choice tonight/ (Insert the robot sidekick): 'I pity the fool who doesn't make the choice tonight!'/ Remember how to freak and everything will be alright,"" goes a few verses carefully crooned as to not upset each face in the front row. This is camp as a reason for living-- no matter how many friends, co-workers, and clergymen laugh at you. However, Don Armando's ""I'm an Indian, Too"" troubles me. His Broadway-disco number, complete with a full orchestra backing, is up there with Cher's ""Half Breed""-- the legacy of indigenous America bastardized into the Star's egotistical grace. But then again, one cannot take a song too seriously that demands choreography and a diva who tells you with a hand on hip, ""I am Chipo-WA, Iro-QWA, Omo-HA, like those Indians, well I'm an Indian too!"" You get the idea.</p><p>
    
    Another curiosity is Daisy Chain's after-school special rock, ""No Time to Stop Believing in Love"", which delivers raps in Spanish and Japanese to vaguely suicidal adolescents in assembly. Detroit's great Was (Not Was) delivers an oddly melancholic, open-shirted, and jeri-curled disco number, ""Dance or Die"", and an idea that ceases to be clever after about five seconds, ""Read My Lips""-- a Contempo Casuals house tune with Caesar I's wondrous promise, broken even after swearing on the King James version of the Bible. More faithful to the gospel and its blessings upon man is Suicide's ""Dream Baby Dream"", where frontman Alan Vega prays in tongues over wheatlands swaying in keyboardist Martin Rev's organs. Vega fares worse in August ""Kid Creole"" Darnell's remix of ""Outlaw"", a rockabilly jaunt that goes nowhere. Larry Levan's fingerprints on Kid Creole &amp; the Coconuts' ""Something Wrong in Paradise"" are stronger, exploding a Latin-funk block party into a million colors.</p><p>
    
    Most of <i>Garage Sale</i> seems to be novelties more than anything else. While that essence is the comp's selling point, it could unfortunately lead many to believe that mutant disco itself is nothing more.</p></div>"|2030.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2030-mutant-disco-vol-3-garage-sale/|7.1|Cameron Macdonald

Okay, in the past five
    years.  Three years.  In the genre of indie rock.  In the sub-genre of indie rock with laptops.  In the sub-genre of indie rock with
    laptops featuring Ben Gibbard.  On Sub Pop.</p><p>
    
    Okay, maybe they're not so important in the grand scheme of things, but for a group of their size and funding, the Postal Service
    have been surprisingly ubiquitous.  Thanks to that ""Scrubs"" guy, ""Such Great Heights"" has been added to Hollywood's palette of
    trailer music, perfectly expressing that ""dramedy about quarter-life crisis"" sensation.  The friendly resolution to the band's
    mini-spat with the actual United States Postal Service earned them national coverage, and a choice gig at the influential Postmaster
    General National Executive Conference (which, as you may remember, launched the career of the Beatles).  And the duo's brand of
    point-click indie-pop has begun to inspire their peers to follow suit: Rather than find his own tech support for his recent digital
    wanderings, Conor Oberst merely picked up his phone and growled (quaveringly) to his secretary, ""Get me Tamborello!""</p><p>
    
    All of which is good reason for Ben Gibbard and Jimmy Tamborello to celebrate with a few cold-brewed Coors Lights-- but <i>not</i>
    a reasonable justification to shake the last few shards of pocket change out of two-year-old <i>Give Up</i>.  ""We Will Become
    Silhouettes"" is one of the flatter tracks from that album's saggy middle, an unsettlingly chipper song about living through the
    aftermath of a nuclear holocaust.  Christmas carol backing vocals, accordion samples, and the climactic New Order keyboards can't
    distract from lyrics about fallout shelters and uncontrollable mitosis-induced body explosions. It's difficult to think of a movie
    looking for that lap-pop Hiroshimal sound... maybe it could be the love theme from <i>56 Days Later</i>.</p><p>
    
    The single's lone new track is ""Be Still My Heart"", which-- as its title might imply-- is typical Postal Service heart-meet-sleeve
    territory.  Sadly, it seems only <i>half</i>-hearted: Built around dreary old guitars and live drums, it sounds more or less like a
    Death Cab demo with a few anxious clicking noises added to it.</p><p>
    
    Clicking noises are also the weapon of choice on the single's two remixes, Morr Music producer Styrofoam's take on ""Nothing Better"",
    and Matthew Dear's reworking of the A-side.  The Human League-biting medical terminology duet of ""Nothing Better"" is much more
    deserving of promotion to single status than ""Silhouettes"", but sometime-Notwist (and Gibbard) collaborator Styrofoam doesn't add
    much to the original, oddly choosing to make it more rockier while adding a rhythm track that sort of sounds like a guy making the
    O-face and flicking his cheeks.</p><p>
    
    Ghostly International tech-house wunderkind Matthew Dear takes a few more liberties with ""Silhouettes"", giving it the old
    separate-the-elements treatment and spiking the track's drink with a handful of Ambien.  The swirling ambient loops alter the music
    to fit the lyrical creepiness a little better, but it still doesn't quite nail the mood, perhaps due to Gibbard's incorruptibly
    saccharine delivery.  Someone should've been a bit more willing to goth it up, or maybe just have given the song over to another
    band, a la the Postal Service's ""Such Great Heights"" single.  Anybody death metal would do (though I guess it'd be hard to find
    one with a Sub Pop contract).</p><p>
    
    So in the end, <i>We Will Become Silhouettes</i> does little more than advertise for a revisitation of <i>Give Up</i>.  One wonders
    if the protracted flogging of that album means that new product from the band is far off-- especially since Gibbard is busy riding

Or, possibly, it's a slight to the band's diehard fans who regularly turned up at shows to lend their shouts and applause to the background of this live recording.</p><p>
    
    Despite the title's tongue-in-cheek bitterness, we should at least give the Pernice Brothers the benefit of the doubt-- and not just because they thank their fans in the liner notes. The band, lead by real-life Pernice brothers Joe and Bob, has been creating letter-perfect pop since 1997, manufacturing three albums of songs wherein each lyric, each harmony, each bridge was precisely calibrated to elicit a particular listener response. As a result, albums like <i>Overcome By Happiness</i> and <i>Yours, Mine &amp; Ours</i> sound so pristine, polished, and practiced that they can tend toward unexciting.</p><p>
    
    By definition, a live album like <i>Nobody's Listening</i>-- recorded at the Mercury Lounge in New York-- cures part of that problem in that no matter how much a band practices, each performance is affected by uncontrollable variables from crowd reaction to venue temperature to PA differences. <i>Nobody's Listening</i> adds a few much-needed blemishes to Joe Pernice's songwriting gems: Engineered and mixed by bass player Thom Monahan, the sound is rougher and more ragged but livelier and more dynamic than their studio albums. Joe Pernice's vocals are low in the mix, and sometimes he sounds like he's straining alternately to hit notes and to be heard. The keyboards on ""Sometimes I Remember"" sound dissonant and sub-Casiotone, and elsewhere instruments sometimes get lost in the mix.</p><p>
    
    In some cases, these factors might be considered flaws; on <i>Nobody's Listening</i> they lend the songs a sense of spontaneity. ""Working Girls"" now sounds as gritty as its subject matter. ""Crestfallen"" drips with disdain as Joe remarks ""it's hard to read her simple mind."" The raw guitars bring out the desperation and deprecation on ""Grudge Fuck"", a song from the Pernice brothers' previous band, the Scud Mountain Boys. Their cover of the Pretenders' ""Talk of the Town""-- which is the only non-album track on <i>Nobody's Listening</i>-- rumbles along thanks to James Walbourne's piano and Patrick Berkery's drums. And ""Flaming Wreck"" ends with a noisy barrage of instruments that closes the show perfectly.</p><p>
    
    As documented on the <i>Nobody's Watching</i> DVD tour diary, the Pernice Brothers have spent most of the past seven years on the road, playing small clubs for varying audiences. That experience has made them a better live than studio band, as <i>Nobody's Listening</i> amply displays.</p></div>"|6240.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6240-nobodys-listeningnobodys-watching/|7.4|Stephen M.

Jon De Rosa meshed somnolent ambient soundscapes and shoegazer melodies, drawling dolorous, just-shoot-yourself-already vocals that belied the richly melancholic instrumentals. As part of Darla's <i>Bliss Out</i> series, the album showed an uncharacteristic devotion to acoustic instrumentation, often layering brass, orchestral percussion and warbling tremolo-sodden guitars atop wooly electronic textures. In the end, pop won out; well-structured songs like ""Aura Lee"" and ""Nostalgia = Distortion"" trumped the album's more nebulous sections with wan, intimate melodies.</p><p>
    
    The common thread running through De Rosa's compositions, both catchy and inchoate, was sadness, and that thread continues on <i>Bleeding Light</i>, Aarktica's fourth and least confused album. Staking ground between Johann Johannson's cool meditative drones and Stars Like Fleas' flailing electro free jazz, the album is tonally consistent, shuffling between heavy-hearted melodic ephemera and perambulating instrumental passages.</p><p>
    
    The best example of the latter is ""A Shadow Knife (Draws Bleeding Light)"", which is underpinned by slow-pulsing guitar drones as it ventures on an eight-minute expedition led by horns and drums. Followed by the ringing doppler swells of ""We're Like Two Drops Separated By a Drowning"", the pairing cuts a tidy architectural swath across the album, bisecting its eight tracks and setting up a taut finale. ""A Wash a Sea Goodbye It's Me"" reinstates the acoustic elements; summoning Do Make Say Think with lulling guitars, soft horns and hard-driven drums, the song is as close as De Rosa gets to an all-out rocker.</p><p>
    
    Hardly disrupting the album's swooping flow, ""A Wash a Sea Goodbye"" gives way to a pair of drone-saturated epics. The climactic title track licks a twangy middle eastern drone, spreading a murmured, meditative vocal over the slow-moving mass. The song's finale is a rare bit of populist hopefulness (""Everyone of us is lost in our own way""), offering tenuous yet satisfying circularity: In contrast with the oppressively grim chords of opener ""Depression Modern"", its cautious optimism rings of victory. It seems De Rosa has finally reconciled himself with unhappiness-- and it's that flowering that makes <i>Bleeding Light</i>, at times gruesome and hard to stomach, a compelling listen.</p></div>"|8.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8-bleeding-light/|7.2|Sam Ubl

Though his techniques have typically resulted in music that is both wildly unpredictable and compulsively listenable, the continual evolution of his productions has left him with few distinctively recognizable sonic trademarks. Perhaps that's beginning to change, however, with the release of <i>Silizium</i>, an unusually refined and focused five-song mini-suite that finds Ring and his collaborators satisfyingly integrating classical elements into melancholic electronica.</p><p>
    Originally recorded for a John Peel session at BBC in 2004, <i>Silizium</i> (the German translation for ""Silicon"") features extensive contributions from a string section known as Complexácord, comprised of cellist Lisa Stepf and violinist Kathrin Pfänder. Several tracks also include chilled vocals from electro-soul crooner Raz Ohara, as well as some fiery jazz licks from clarinetist/sax player Hormel Eastwood. Apparat binds these disparate elements together with agitated, frayed beats and spellbinding electronic drones, providing these five uneasy pieces an intense, cohesive urgency.</p><p>
    With Ohara's voice carrying its pensive melody, the driving clatter of ""Komponent"" emerges following the brief instrumental ""Introduction"" like an emergency vehicle weaving its way through commuter traffic, while Stepf's spine-tingling, attenuated cello notes sound a siren over the din. On the subsequent title track, Eastwood's blaring reeds gradually give way to a simple, repetitive melodic motif from the strings, before Ring huffs and puffs trying to blow the house in with his termite-ridden beats. Ohara takes over again on the cinematically taut, insistent ""Not a Good Place"", defiantly keeping his choruses afloat upon a surging tide of fractured keys and strings, before everything finally drains out into the quiet pools of the chamber-like ""It's Gonna Be a Long Walk"".</p><p>
    Those five tracks sound like an extended composition, and are further augmented by an adventurous (if somewhat redundant) quartet of remixes. Bus' remix of ""Silizium"" enthusiastically chews everything down to unrecognizably tiny pieces, while Telefon Tel Aviv's take on ""Komponent"" adds enough swirling indie-pop texture that it almost resembles a long-lost Talk Talk single. Apparat closes things up himself, giving ""Not a Good Place"" one final, yearning spin as its concluding microscopic violin notes flutter off like drowsy fireflies, allowing <i>Silizium</i> at last a hard-won interlude of peace.</p></div>"|418.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/418-silizium-ep/|7.2|Matthew Murphy

It seemed like Oberst was assisting a band he admired, one that would earn exposure and credibility by sharing an EP with him. Neva Dinova actually outshone Bright Eyes on the EP, as Jake Bellows's weary voice oozed over sepia-toned Americana that was clear and concise if occasionally a bit murky. Now that the group has become known outside of Omaha, here's its proper coming-out party, <em>The Hate Yourself Change</em>.</p><p>
    
    Neva Dinova has crafted a dreamy, slow-burning lament that is consistently pleasant, occasionally exceptional, and-- in inspired spurts-- aimed squarely at the FM band. This newfound directness from a band that used to play triple-guitar slowcore jumps out from the first track, ""Hat O'er Eyes"", which is comprised solely of treacly vocals and a folksy acoustic strum. Bellows has a rich, aching voice, like a rough-around-the-edges Jeff Buckley, yet refrains from the affected drama of Omaha heavy hitters like Oberst or Son, Ambulance's Joe Knapp. The sultry ""Ahh"" blossoms with angelic harmonies as Bellows switches between winsome emoting and a deadpan drawl; with its delicate phrasing, subtle shimmer, and steady increase in intensity, it wouldn't be out of place next to Coldplay. One of the few upbeat songs on the album, ""She Can't Change"", follows suit-- it's a steady build around a pristinely simple and poppy guitar figure.</p><p>
    
    But in the end, this same consistency may be what keeps Neva Dinova breaking out of Omaha. Too many of their songs are agreeable but interchangeable. ""The Champion"", Can't Wait to See You"", ""Blackest Heart"", ""Cold Calls"", and ""On/Off"" have little to recommend one over the others: They're all depressive ballads that build to radiant peaks, tinged with gentle psychedelia, recessed harmonies, and Bellows's able but unvaried vocal presence. But there are bright flashes of deviation on <em>The Hate Yourself Change</em> that indicate Bellows is struggling out of his perennial mode. ""A Picture in Pocket"", with its lean, repetitive throb and tightly reverberating guitars, sounds a lot like Franz Ferdinand, especially the fey vocal chorus. And ""I've Got a Feeling"", the album's closer, trades in Bellows's lovelorn aphorisms for a more caustic vocal and lyrical turn, a weary, expletive-riddled screed that mounts toward the choral refrain, ""The world's a shitty place and I want to die."" Barring these aberrations, <em>The Hate Yourself Change</em> works best as an innocuous bedtime record; including them, it's a snapshot of a band taking a tentative step toward the next echelon of recognition and accomplishment. </p></div>"|5912.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5912-the-hate-yourself-change/|7.0|Brian Howe

They are     dogged by the death of rave culture and bloated media expectations, and many consider their previous successes as major mainstream     players in the states to have had a big hand in the perceived failure of electronic music.  In some cases, the derision is justified--     the Prodigy and Fatboy Slim each recently issued albums that fell far short of their ambitious goals-- but usually, artists have     simply gone through the same growing pains suffered by veterans in any genre.</p>
<p>Of all the mid-90s dance crossovers, few are as vilified by the cult of progression as the Chemical Brothers, who never seemed     particularly invested in electronic music's cult of progression in the first place.  When they did act as pacesetters, it was for     the oft-derided big beat (on their earliest recordings and debut album, <i>Exit Planet Dust</i>) or the prescient ""back to the     future"" of the underrated <i>Surrender</i>, which predated and perhaps put in motion an eventual acid house revival.  What the     Chemical Brothers <i>were</i> interested in was bridging the gap between techno, house, and hip-hop by marrying the most immediately     pleasing elements of all three.  And incidentally, they weren't bad at it.</p>
<p>On their day, they're still quite good, but superstardom also landed them in the precarious and potentially lazy pattern of presenting     albums with what seemed like a preconceived template-- a handful of breakbeat- or acid-inspired tracks, a comedown psych-rock crossover,     a female-vocaled comedown track, and contributions from Britrock's reigning royalty.  The band seemed fenced in by these expectations,     eventually crafting collaborative tracks that seemed to have the guest's talents in mind more than the Chemicals' themselves.     Unsurprisingly, the duo's fifth album, <i>Push the Button</i>, is at its best when it avoids these now-familiar pitfalls.  Unfortunately,     it's mostly front-loaded with these high-profile collaborations, one of which (the tepid ""Left Right"", featuring Anwar Superstar) is     a career low.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Brothers have come full-circle on working with Northern England's most 60s-obsessed vocalists-- they're teamed here     again with Charlatans and ""Life Is Sweet"" vocalist Tim Burgess.  The result, ""The Boxer"", harks back to the duo's early B-Boy/techno     days, as does the album's first single ""Galvanize"", recorded with Q-Tip.  In both cases, however, the tracks are missing the ferocity     and sub-bass rattlings of their earlier cousins, and here play second fiddle to unremarkable verses and nasally vocals.  Far better     is ""Believe"", on which Bloc Party singer Kele Okereke's rich, warm baritone serves as texture for the track while he provides a     minimalist, almost mantra-like lyrical contribution rather than trying to crowbar a verse/chorus/verse structure onto a floorfiller.     Elsewhere, rising indie pop group the Magic Numbers and Anna-Lynne Williams ably combine to fill Beth Orton's drony, narcotic role     on ""Close Your Eyes"" and ""Hold Tight London"", respectively.</p>
<p>Of course, as they were on 2002's <i>Come With Us</i>, the Chemical Brothers tend to find the best results when they focus on     atmospheric, buzzing instrumentals.  That 2002 record hit greater peaks-- nothing here is as engaging as ""Star Guitar"" or ""My     Elastic Eye""-- but more than a few tracks come close, including the playful, old-school hop of ""The Big Jump"", the     post-punk-meets-breakbeats collision of ""Come Inside"", and ""Surface to Air"", which recalls the astral, rave-quoting ""Star     Guitar"" and ends the album on its highest note.</p>
<p>And yeah, like the whole of <i>Surrender</i> and the best of <i>Come With Us</i>, these tracks are effective, delightful exercises     in cultivating dance's past, but the Chemical Brothers have <i>always</i> been best when cherrypicking from others and creating     highlight reels.  If I were in a selfish mood, it would be tempting to wish a continued retreat from the spotlight for the Brothers,     granting them the freedom to focus on creating the dynamic dance tracks they're still clearly capable of, rather than the merely     decent pop songs that others are increasingly coming to expect from them.</p></div>"|1419.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1419-push-the-button/|7.0|Scott Plagenhoef

Someone suggested Piano Magic, which made some sense. No matter what cast of characters surrounds Piano Magic's Glen Johnson on a given record, he has a knack for organically incorporating technology and sound processing to compliment the songs, which are typically gentle, sometimes ethereal, and always dour.</p><p>
    If that BoC + Sundays idea once felt vaguely true, the four-song <i>Opencast Heart</i> EP confirms it. A sticker on the outside of the CD quotes Johnson as saying this the most electronic record  has made, and who am I to argue? I certainly don't hear identifiable guitars or other conventional instruments. Actually, I don't hear much of anything-- this is an unusually subtle and quiet record, with most tracks consisting of some ghostly synth drifts and perhaps one or two slow percussion sounds. The lone exception is ""The Heart Machinery"", which-- while not exactly a burner-- rises to mid-tempo and has Johnson doing a neu-romantic croon at the upper end of his range, suggesting a contemporary affinity with Junior Boys or Styrofoam. Beyond that, you'll need snowshoes to negotiate one of Piano Magic's most wintry landscapes.</p><p>
    ""Echoes on Ice"" sets the mercury falling, with some barely-there chord wisps and slight crackles of static to back the hushed whispers of rotating member Angéle David-Gillou. ""Echoes on ice on a blue winter night,"" she sings, ""from the spikes of your bike in sub-Fahrenheit."" Brrrrr. Her voice is suddenly thrown into reverse for the last couplet, ending the song on a haunting note. ""The Journal of a Disappointed Man"" is one of Johnson's spoken-word-over-soundscape pieces, and not a bad one as those go, though these ultimately have little replay value. Lines like ""I took a position at the Natural History Museum, but left after only three months due to allergies"" show he can have a chuckle at himself, at least.</p><p>
    Best of all is the dry, minimal, and lovely ""I Didn't Get Where I Am Today"", which starts with David-Gillou saying she ""stayed home, snowed in"" and ends with ""the only light's a cigarette, the bed feels cold as ice."" Appropriately, she harmonizes with herself, alone to the end. After so much inconsistency, Piano Magic sounds best in small doses, and this tight unified EP shows that Johnson is still capable of creating interesting records.</p></div>"|6286.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6286-opencast-heart-ep/|7.2|Mark Richardson

Rock remains shackled to the discrete packets of the album and single, a format that isolates bands and individual works like eggs in a carton. But electronic music is a bowl of commingled yolks, spread over a broad communal surface area comprised of incestuous alliances, plentiful compilations, and proliferating remixes. This collaborative, revisionist sensibility refreshes the genre's vitality.</p><p>
    
    Boom Bip, like many of his peers, has insinuated himself into electronic music by scattered, piecemeal degrees, a process antithetical to indie rock's perception of album-as-ultimate-statement. Many electronic albums seem like mere fodder, blocks of digital marble to be collectively sculpted and re-sculpted. As soon as Boom Bip's first LP for Lex, <em>Seed to Sun</em>, was in the can, it was remixed into two EPs-- <em>Morning and a Day</em> and <em>From Left to Right</em>-- which were packaged together as <em>Corymb</em>. While Boom Bip's third LP is primed for the same sort of viral mutation as his debut, it finds him working coherently within the album format by pursuing his themes to their logical conclusions.</p><p>
    
    Built from analog instruments, Bryan Hollan's opus (<em>groan</em>) is more firmly rooted in pop than you'd expect-- especially if you know Boom Bip from the splintering night terrors he created with Doseone on <em>Circle</em>. You're more likely to find understatedly triumphant, New-Order-in-miniature synth leads (on the elastically melodic ""The Move"") than cluttered collages and fragmentary ideas. A couple vocal cameos further widen the album's stance: Super Furry Animals' Gruff Rhys lays a hypnotic, layered incantation over the lean, peristaltic drone and clatter of ""Do's and Don't's"", while Nina Nastasia, a gifted vocalist who sounds like a less piercing Joanna Newsom, sings a gorgeous torch song over billowing melodic clouds on ""The Matter (of Our Discussion)"".</p><p>
<em>Blue Eyed in the Red Room</em> is a restful wash of clean, simple lines, unfractured beats, and neon-tinted melodies. The songs are multi-phased and elegantly phrased. Opening track ""Cimple"" deliberately alternates between broad swathes of guitar remindful of M83's latest single, and winnowing, hiccupping sections that are one Ben Gibbard shy of a Postal Service. The dewy electroacoustic progression of ""Dumb Day"" evokes the tumbledown pastorals on Bibio's recently excellent album <em>Fi</em>. I'm sure the remixes of <em>Blue Eyed in a Red Room</em> will be profligate and terrific; but in this instance, the source material itself is well worth your while.</p></div>"|860.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/860-blue-eyed-in-the-red-room/|7.5|Brian Howe

Say it's boring, no melody, too long, doesn't really go anywhere, how come no sound's coming out my left speaker, and dude man you've totally missed the point. After Tubs etc., snatched dub for dub, no longer toasted but doing its own thing-- stylized, atmospheric, art, and shit-- later acts from Neu! to Maurizio to Tortoise to Prefuse 73 could get away with songs that, at their core, are incomplete. Try your hardest, but so you know: can't knock the Tussle.</p><p>
    
    Half done, <i>Kling Klang</i>'s not half bad. The band has one guy steady on the traps and two more on pan-knockers, so they can't help but stumble upon the occasional sweet beat. Big pressure is on the bass, since it provides Tussle's sole groove and melody. That's balls on the scale like few out there, but the kid rarely misfires. If anything, he's too good, the licks like cute Florida blondes: sorta indistinguishable.</p><p>
    
    Turns out personality does count for something, and camp-jobs ""Ghost Barber"" and ""Moon Tempo"" win for <i>Kling Klang</i>'s most lovable nerds. While the rest of Tussle basslines get stuck straddling groove and hook pretty safely, the line on ""Ghost Barber"" alternates duties: verse is pretty, chorus is rhythmic. The song has some tension; it almost sounds like a song. ""Moon Tempo"" makes the same distinction without even modulating. ""Eye Contact"" is still cooler than both, and probably better, expect the track came out two fucking years ago, then <i>again</i> on last year's <i>Don't Stop</i> EP. Maybe this is an East Coast thing, but ""Three's a charm"" is just something married people say when they're figuring out how many babies to have.</p><p>
    
    Recall the pan-knockers of yestergraph: when the bass goes faceless on <i>Kling Klang</i>, these guys pick up the slack. ""Disco D'Oro"" taps the fractal noise vein Dom spotted in recent Brooklyn noise records such as Black Dice's <i>Creature Comforts</i> and Excepter's <i>KA</i>, but Tussle beat both out with four-four on top and more noise to boot. This is a patient man's game, <i>Kling Klang</i>, unclear at all times whether it's worth playing the regulation forty minutes, but another so you know: the last minute of last song ""Tight Jeans"" is motorik bliss and the best fake Neu! you'll hear this year.</p></div>"|8250.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8250-kling-klang/|6.7|Nick Sylvester

Less than two years after their debut <i>Vehicles &amp; Animals</i>, the band have dropped the sunny guitars, quirky vocals, and Coldplay comparisons for keyboards, strings, and mini-series melodrama. On <i>Tourist</i>, Athlete become radical neo-Britpop fundamentalists according to the gospel of ""Trouble"" and ""The Scientist"". At times they tell sob stories so terrifically upsetting that even their detractors have trouble keeping tears from jerking.</p><p>
    
    The catalyst for this transformation was lead single ""Wires"", the stringy super-ballad leadman Joel Pott penned after his prematurely born daughter suffered from epileptic attacks. ""You got wires, goin' in/ You got wires, comin' out of your skin/ You got tears, making tracks/ I got tears, that are scared of the facts,"" he whispers. It's the best song about childbirth since Creed's ""With Arms Wide Open"", though considering that song can't even hold a candle to Live's ""Lightning Crashes"", that's not saying much.</p><p>
    
    Drama in music works perfectly fine in mediated, tactical doses, but for <i>Tourist</i>, the stakes are unrealistically high. Every song aspires for that movie scene where the guy, after finding his estranged father and kicking his drug habit, is reunited with his girlfriend...in an airport. Athlete abuse the soft verse/loud chorus trick to no end, leadoff track ""Chances"" being the biggest culprit. After Potts sings, ""Maybe there's a chance our walls might fall,"" a flurry of strings swiped from The Flaming Lips' ""Race for the Prize"" are formulaically cued. Potts then repeats the refrain until he's squeezed every drop of sentimentality from the line ""Take me over."" The final result is a safe cry-by-number, reproducible for a full album.</p><p>
    
    Here's the kicker: For a band that tries so hard lyrically, Athlete feel no pressure to experiment with their songwriting. Potts' best attempt at a hook here is to hold a note over swelling strings. Athlete were never a particularly innovative band, but even <i>Vehicles &amp; Animals</i>'s flimsy IDM preferred to <i>Tourist</i>'s homophonous gloom. Athlete, you have my deepest condolences.</p></div>"|445.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/445-tourist/|3.6|Adam Moerder

He isolates cowbells and places the microphone at just the right distance from the hi-hat so you get the analog-crisp sound post-punk bands took for granted because they didn't know how good they had it with engineers like Paul Hardiman and Rick Walton. Murphy, obsessed with Can and Liquid Liquid, has the right influences at the right time in the right city-- which is to say, if he couldn't be French, New York is the best place for LCD Soundsystem. Like Parisian duo Daft Punk (who get their second Murphy shout-out on this album), LCD makes substance from style, content from form, something from nothing. That's a rockist attitude, of course, but then LCD Soundsystem is a rockist fantasy: full command of the history with none of the high-caloric obligation to ""meaning"" or purity. Murphy even puts together a live show that out-pummels the noise bands a borough over.</p><p> <em>LCD Soundsystem</em> has been anticipated since Murphy's 2002 splash ""Losing My Edge""/""Beat Connection"", and like it, makes clear that although his musical reference points (Suicide, Eno, Can, ESG, Talking Heads, the Fall, and on and on and on) are upfront enough to be conspicuous, they never quite cross the line into hipster-wallpaper. In fact, if anything, Murphy has a given a good name to cooler-than-thou poses, presenting his music, if not irony-free, then as earnestly as can be expected from someone emulating Mark E. Smith's pronunciation-uh. And yes, his flare for singles is pretty amazing: ""Losing My Edge""/""Beat Connection"" and ""Yeah"" are two of the most ubiquitous 12-inches released in the last 20 years-- at least in the neck of the woods where folks are likely to get the Fall and Suicide references. Heck, even ""Give It Up"" rises near the top of DFA's crop of punky dance anthems, and that the second disc appending <em>LCD Soundsystem</em> contains all of this music shows both generosity and considerable foresight on the part of Murphy and DFA.</p><p>  However, it's still debatable whether or not Murphy makes great records. Where the singles emphasize his strengths-- impeccable arrangements (especially his signature drums-plus-drum machine attack), pacing (the dynamic expansion of ""Yeah (Stupid Version)"" is almost unchartable) and the gift of less-is-more-- his debut full-length lacks similar allure for almost the exact same reasons. It doesn't so much have a pace, per se, as nine distinct flavors of the LCD Soundsystem agenda, be it cowbell-ridden dancepunk, homages to any number of 70s and 80s hip rock icons, or rubbery would-be house jams just sloppy enough not to qualify as house. The production is as you would expect-- and therein lies the letdown: There aren't very many surprises here, either in the bank of sounds Murphy pulls out, or in how he uses them. Still, that wouldn't be bad if the songs lived up to the promise of his singles. The worst I can say about <em>LCD Soundsystem</em> is that there are precious few moments that stand up next to his most lauded singles.</p><p>  But we'll start with the best-- which is to say, he'll end with the best: ""Great Release"" is a very non-dancefloor number pulled out of the Big Book of Ambient Pop. Beginning with soft, pulsating drum machine pliff, the song glides for more than two minutes using only a stately chord progression on piano before Murphy's distant, obviously Eno-cribbed vocal enters. The song builds and builds, in a manner typical of many other LCD Soundsystem songs, but does so via lush echo, like ocean waves, watercolored synthesizers and Murphy's ""dat-da-da-da"" harmony vocals near the end. And where ""Great Release"" shines with a symphonic glimmer, ""Daft Punk Is Playing At My House"" and ""Disco Infiltrator"" stick to bare-basic LCD pump; yet, they're just as rewarding. (In fact, ""Disco Infiltrator"" should really have been this album's first single, rather than the comparatively indistinct Fall rip ""Movement"").</p><p>  ""Never As Tired As When I'm Waking Up"" is a near-brilliant pastiche of both <em>White Album</em> Beatles and <em>Dark Side</em> Floyd, with only its telegraphed George Harrison lead-guitar riff at the end and chord progression ripped from ""Dear Prudence"" keeping it from making as grand an emotional impact as it might. Likewise, ""Too Much Love"" seems just a bit too close to Talking Heads for comfort, though as with all things Murphy, the imitation is masterful. House-centric songs like ""On Repeat"" (a low key take on the structure of ""Yeah"", right down to the disco explosion near the end) and the excellent ""Tribulations"" (which prudent fans will know leaked months ago) should sate the danceheads, though they might have wished for more songs like the latter and some of the fat trimmed from the former. Ultimately, <em>LCD Soundsystem</em> suffers a similar fate: plenty of good-not-great stuff, and a tad unfocused.</p><p> </p></div>"|4978.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4978-lcd-soundsystem/|8.2|Dominique Leone

Originally credited to Chris Stamey &amp; Yo la Tengo and titled <i>V.O.T.E.</i> (Shorthand, Stamey claims, for Very Obvious Total Emergency), it was released in a very limited run in October 2004 during the get-out-the-vote drive. This new version consists of the same recordings, with a new intro track (the voting PSA that lead off the original <i>V.O.T.E.</i> is converted into a bonus track at the tail end of the album, no longer urgently relevant but still charming), and an amusing whistling-and-marimba-driven instrumental called ""Dr. Strangelove's Assistant"". Otherwise, everything's the same: The Chris Stamey ""Experience"" is really just Yo la Tengo plus wayfaring keyboard wrangler Tyson Rogers. Stamey's old dB's bandmate Gene Holder handles the boards, and the set has the spontaneity you might expect from a bunch of friendly veterans playing together for three days.</p><p>
    
    Discounting the incidental new intro track ""Conspiracy Theory"", the first five full songs are covers of old favorites, including the Yardbirds' ""Shapes of Things"" and Cream's ""Politician""-- both of which reflect Stamey's political mood-- a ravishing version of Television's already too-beautiful ""Venus"" and a rip-snorting take on Les McCann's ""Compared to What"" that takes the Brian Auger version to the cleaners. They even cover Stamey's own decades-old single ""Summer Sun""...twice. The funky version tucked away on <i>V.O.T.E.</i> as a hidden track is in the place here, while the version in the tracklist is janglier, stuffed with backing harmonies and Byrds-y guitar leads. That both versions are great is a testament to the quality of Stamey's writing.</p><p>
    
    Stamey's other tunes are all pretty good in their own right, generally much punchier than the songs on last year's solo album <i>Travels in the South</i>. Yo la Tengo are obviously part of the extra kick, operating like the band they are instead of an assemblage of studio cats. The five-minute freakout that swallows the middle of ""MacCauley Street (Let's Go Downtown)"" comes complete with a crazy Ira Kaplan e-bow sojourn that the liners take pains to specify isn't a flute. In fact-- even though Stamey wrote all the original songs-- the double-billing once given Yo la Tengo makes plenty of sense because their input is central to the sound and success of the album.</p><p>
<i>A Question of Temperature</i> ultimately comes out a very solid if not revelatory record. The covers are well-chosen, the steps back into Stamey's old songbook are enjoyable, and the band are loose and obviously enjoying themselves. Obviously, the original intention of the record-- helping to get out the (non-Bush) voters-- didn't pan out well, but the final result is one of Stamey's best solo joints and a fun, solid record, so the ancillary benefits make it more than worthwhile.</p></div>"|7802.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7802-a-question-of-temperature/|7.7|Joe Tangari

Now, for the benefit of the vinyl-challenged, <i>Close Selections</i> gathers a generous sampling of highlights from his Echocord plates along with several tracks of new material. The cumulative gravity of this entrancing collection of miniature collapsed stars should be enough to draw you blissfully into its molten core.</p><p>
    
    With his grainy, narcotic beats and fluent swells of crackly dub, Mikkel Metal can call to mind the best of Stefan Betke's work as Pole, particularly on earlier tracks like ""Eight"". Unlike Betke, however, Mikkel never allows himself to get so preoccupied with process that his compositions are consumed by stylistic tics or glitches. Despite their minimal construction, there is a refined, measured sturdiness to the melodic structures of these tracks, as well as enough variation of instrumental texture to enable Mikkel to keep his repetitions hypnotic rather than formulaic.</p><p>
    
    Mixing tracks from throughout his short career without regard for chronology, <i>Close Selections</i> accentuates the consistency of Mikkel's aesthetic, yet still one can discern his maturation as a composer. Several of the best tracks here are among his most recent (including four which first appeared on 2004's <i>Sorano</i> EP) and each demonstrates a variant hue of Mikkel's transfixing approach. ""Larkin"" operates as straight somnambulant minimalist dub, with its pulsating keyboards providing all forward momentum before gradually disintegrating into aerosol haze, whereas ""Luomi"" builds its fragile castle out of a mass of polished, pebble-sized beats. By comparison, the 4/4 dancefloor throb of ""Image"" sounds positively locomotive-- its brief interludes of phased guitar providing a satisfying Lee Perry touch-- while the chilled slo-mo electro of ""Clora"" hangs in the air like smoke from a caterpillar's hookah.</p><p>
    
    Of the previously unreleased material, only the set-opening ""Rollin"", with its anxious beats emerging like footsteps in the fog, adds anything beyond connective tissue, with the new, vocoder-enhanced ""Larkin (Reprise)"" counting as one of the set's only real misfires. Nevertheless, <i>Close Selections</i> not only proves Mikkel Metal to be one of the rare electronic singles artists capable of sustaining his captivating atmospheres over the entire length of an album, but that the impact of his spacious, icy-veined ambient dub is felt even more acutely in this full-length dosage.</p></div>"|5633.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5633-close-selections/|7.6|Matthew Murphy

Well, maybe I'm a little ashamed.</p><p>
    
    All: <em>How ashamed are you?</em> Me: If I were I carrying a ladder, I'd look like a fire engine. If I placed a leaf on my head, a child might polish me and place me on his teacher's desk. A salivating man with a boiling pot of water, a pair of tongs, a stick of butter, and a plastic bib is circling me menacingly <em>right now</em>. If you get my drift.</p><p>
    
    Video games still aren't quite cool, but the arrival of Amon Tobin's noirish, cinematic  soundtrack for the third installment in Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell video game series, <em>Chaos Theory</em>, proves that they're at least getting cooler. It also illuminates how far video games have come since my mom picked me up from school brandishing <em>The Legend of Zelda</em> and just blew my mind (""Sweet heaven, it's <em>gold</em>. Not gray-- gold!"").</p><p>
    
    As video games become more like interactive films, the ante is upped for their soundtracks as well. The canned, wobbly synth melodies that once cheerily bounced our 8-bit, pixilated heroes through their 2-D side-scrollers no longer suffice, and while this is the first video game soundtrack by a respected underground musician that I can recall, I seriously doubt it will be the last.</p><p>
    
    Scoring a video game presents a different set of problems than scoring a film. The latter's structure is fixed, but the former's is variable. <em>Splinter Cell</em> is an espionage game with numerous environments, some revolving around tension and stealth, others around hectic chases and high-octane shootouts. The music needs to follow suit, and flow seamlessly from one mood to the next.</p><p>
    
    Tobin handles this problem by making all the songs sound...well, rather similar. He takes full advantage of this opportunity to be as over the top as he wants to be, and his soundtrack is busy, dark, percussive, and abrasive. There are ""running"" songs (""CHUGGA-CHUGGA-CHUGGA-CHUGGA"") and ""sneaking"" songs (""chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga""). There are lots of sonar blips, modem crackles, alarms, and detonations. There are howling digital winds and fluttery textural embellishments (imagine the horror movie staple: ""Ooh Ooh ooh ooh...Ah Ah ah ah...""). While the tracks complexly evolve in Tobin's usual fashion, they generally begin with cacophonous, atmospheric noise to which lean, fleet polyrhythms are subsequently applied.</p><p>
    
    The <em>Chaos Theory</em> soundtrack is James Bond panache meets dystopian nightmare. Sure, it's no <em>Supermodified</em>, but <em>Supermodified</em> wasn't created to be endlessly looped behind onscreen spy ops. This isn't a revolutionary album for Tobin but it's a lot of fun, and works surprisingly well on its own, given the stringent requirements it had to meet.</p></div>"|8089.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8089-tom-clancys-splinter-cell-chaos-theory-ost/|7.2|Brian Howe

    Jones and David Gray albums (and venti nonfat caramel macchiatos by the gallon, extra whip), yet oddly, whenever I recommend
    new voices in Americana or world-weary indie pop to a friend who works there, he's already heard 'em.  It should therefore
    surprise no one (or at least, not me) that the second annual compilation of amour-absorbed covers from Starbucks' Hear Music
    affiliate features a handful of artists from the less challenging, safer side of indie music, each giving performances that
    even Pitchfork grandparents could deem inoffensive.</p><p>
    
    It's all bound by a theme, of course: On <em>Sweetheart 2005</em>, love isn't just blind; it's also morbid, disjunctive, self-abnegating,
    strangely fearful, and all-important.  Plus, it lasts forever.  Just in time for Valentine's Day!</p><p>
    
    Neko Case gives the album's most exceptional performance, sashaying through a faithful rendition of Bob Dylan's <em>Blood on the
    Tracks</em> classic ""Buckets of Rain"" with her usual aplomb.  ""Life is sad, life is a bust,"" she sings, and it's this awareness that
    makes the narrator's miserable adoration particularly affecting.  Calexico tackles an even darker masterpiece, ""Love Will Tear Us
    Apart"", though their stately alt-country leanings inevitably lack Joy Division's urgency.</p><p>
    
    Joseph Arthur tries his hand at The Smiths' ""There Is a Light That Never Goes Out"", but his slowing of the tempo and Americanization
    of the melody just mires Morrissey's blithely maudlin lyrics in unnecessary bathos.  Meanwhile, Jim White's ""Use Me"", originally by
    Bill Withers, celebrates a love of the unhealthy variety (""keep on usin' me till you use me up"").  Gary Jules adds unnecessary drums
    and synths to Cat Stevens' tongue-tied acoustic beauty ""How Can I Tell You""; another <em>Teaser and the Firecat</em> track, the mournful
    ""If I Laugh"", might have been a better fit.</p><p>
<em>Sweetheart</em> includes a few more traditional love songs, too.  M. Ward demonstrates his gift for crafting earthy indie folk out
    of 80s excess, this time giving the ""Let's Dance"" treatment to Pete Townshend's cheesy but endearing ""Let My Love Open the Door"".
    Simply put, it's excellent.  And frequent collaborators Dean Wareham and Britta Phillips turn in an arguably better ""Forever"" than
    <em>Full House</em>'s Uncle Jesse, even if theirs somehow evokes ""Pomp and Circumstance"" more than the Beach Boys' <em>Sunflower</em>
    original did.</p><p>
    
    Martina Topley-Bird, Rufus Wainwright, Milton Mapes, Sondre Lerche, and Old 97's add a few unremarkable stabs at standards (""My
    Funny Valentine"") and possible future standards (the Kinks' ""She's Got Everything"", Matthew Sweet's ""Your Sweet Voice"").  Of course,
    if, as Lisa Simpson once observed, romance has been acquired in a hostile takeover by Hallmark and Disney, it was only a matter of
    time before Starbucks got in on the act as well.</p></div>"|2062.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2062-sweetheart-2005/|6.7|Marc Hogan

You can try to persuade me that tech-house is all in the details, but in a genre rife with strict guiding principles, Cologne-based singer-producer Michaela Dippel (aka Ada) is defiantly preoccupied with melody, a priority she uses to her iconoclastic advantage. She might be tech-house's version of the Strokes: Her new album <em>Blondie</em> is simple but slyly detailed, and exudes a self-assured cosmopolitan vibe.</p><p>
    Part of <em>Blondie</em>'s success is due to Dippel's preference for a soft, steady kick drum, which gives her beaming melodies a lot of wiggle room. And she uses it: Like the works of many of her Cologne cohorts, everything gets chopped and transmogrified before being spit out. But Dippel is generally more direct than her peers; <em>Blondie</em> throbs with classic hooks, laid out in gushing aurora synths and purring vocals.</p><p>
    ""Eve"" carries the album in on a wave of smooching synth beams, incorporating vocals before closing with a chirpy, fragmented faux-guitar solo. The song's approximation of a vocal hook is a slinky bit of bait: ""Close your eyes and wet your lips,"" Dippel sings, slipping in and out of various filters and harmonizations. ""The Red Shoes"" features a distorted animal cry, which-- along with a thumping bass line and shimmying dot-matrix squelches-- pins the song nearer Boards of Canada than Luomo. The track even delivers a chorus-- a set of pulsing, ""Drop It Like It's Hot""-style synth changes that explode out of the bare, steely beat.
    </p><p>
    If you're impatient, the album's middle third may seem bleak. But <em>Blondie</em> thrives on delayed pleasure, consistently turning hazy, going-nowhere beats into radiant climaxes. Most of the songs take a good four or five minutes to flower, but the finished product is almost always gratifying. Even the erratic seven-minute ""Our Love Never Dies"" recovers from a turbulent, tempo-less synth solo to find a viscous beat, which is slowly set aglow by a layered melody. ""Each and Everyone"", a remix of 2002's sensational A-side ""Blindhouse"", is the album's sparest, most orthodox moment; deriving clarity from Dippel's vocal and an icy bell-like melody, the track sounds like a decaffeinated Junior Boys.
    </p>
<p>
    Ada ends <em>Blondie</em> with a whirl of dizzying pop-- her cover of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs' ""Maps"". Stretching and slowing the song's already austere melody, Ada proves the power of blushing sustained synth notes. Atop a more deliberate, broken-down melodic foundation instead of the original's bulldozer drumming and glowstik guitar line, the song's beautiful vocal takes on even greater tenderness. Karen O might be a hipster dream, but Ada is all dark sophistication. Her coy vocals and supple melodic sensibilities make it hard to hear <em>Blondie</em> and not walk away woozy and a little weak-kneed.

Maybe it's the cleaner air, the relatively liberal culture, the cold, the hockey, or the feeling that you're really better than your southern neighbor who gets all the attention-- sort of a younger sibling overachiever syndrome. Whatever it is, both Toronto and its thriving, consistent indie rock scene and Montreal's bundles of post-rock par excellence and really corking pop have produced a number of worthwhile bands in recent years.</p><p>
    
    Magneta Lane can be filed under ""corking pop"", albeit with a bit o' punk-- mostly manifested in their incredible efficiency and high tempos-- thrown in for good measure. Guitar, bass, drums, vox and the occasional tambourine are all they bother with and all they need, and the three women who form this trio give you only the necessary material to drive the songs home. Guitarist/vocalist Lexi Valentine sings in a high alto range with a velvety, sassy tone-- and while the melodies are strong, it's the way the band pushes them through clever rhythmic shifts and dynamic alterations that raise them to a whole different level.</p><p>
    
    The opening title track is their blueprint, laying out both their approach to tension and release and their sense of kinetic motion-- although that dry description doesn't half describe what a ridiculously great song it is. Valentine is up front (Uncut's Jon Drew gives them a punchy, clean sound with just enough grit to keep them honest) cooing over a jumpy, fractious beat, but as the verse progresses, bassist French and drummer Nadia King slide into an urgent rhythm. From there the song is pure exuberant pop fizz grounded by the emotionally confused subject matter of the lyrics: ""She could never find real love/ She was a constant lover"" goes the setup, ringing guitar arpeggios mingling with the vocals to coalesce into a gooey mega-hook.</p><p>
    
    ""Ugly Socialite"" and ""Kissing Is Easy"" are even more tightly coiled, moving along like a coiled spring, stretching out through effervescent choruses and winding back up in the choppy verses. The only song that sacrifices this economy is ""Mare of the Night"", which gets louder and more distorted than necessary, sacrificing streamlined flow for noisy guitar excursions and featuring verses that aren't as neatly formed as the ones around it. All told, though, <i>Constant Lover</i> is an impressive, memorable debut by a band with a great instinct for developing songs for maximum impact.</p></div>"|5635.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5635-constant-lover-ep/|7.9|Joe Tangari

And much of their early work (at least in the trace amounts I've actually been able to track down) is as inscrutable as their discography is unwieldy, consisting of a formidable series of opaque post-industrial ambient dronescapes.</p><p>
    
    With their 2002 album <i>Ownliness</i>, however, the twosome made an abrupt (relatively speaking) break with their past as they cracked open their heavy shutters just enough to allow in some stray melodic sunrays, even making use of polite trip-hop beats and ringing indie-rock guitars. Picking up from where the more accessible fibers of <i>Ownliness</i> led them, <i>The Bodyshop</i> is Beequeen's most musically expansive work yet, incorporating elements of shadowy folk and Faustian prog into their microsound tableaus. And though Beequeen's combination of electronics and folk elements is hardly an unprecedented (or untrendy) maneuver, few acts this side of Current 93 have so managed to lace their surface pastoralism with such unsettling, sinister nuance.</p><p>
    
    Painstakingly recorded by Legendary Pink Dots guitarist Erik Drost, every sound on The Bodyshop has been audibly fretted over down to the tiniest electronic mote, giving these pieces an effectively claustrophobic feel that never permits the listener to become overly comfortable, quietly demanding the album receive unbroken attention.</p><p>
    
    After opening with the Yo La Tengo-like guitar instrumental of ""Swag Cave,"" (one of the few unambiguously pretty tracks here) the gentle folksy arpeggios of ""Sad Sheep"" are soon overrun by itchy, drill-like electronic whines, segueing into ""The Dream-O-Phone"" where the microscopic mandibles of carpenter ants patiently consume the lush scenery. Elsewhere, as on the percussive ""Blackburn"" or swirling psych of ""One Road to Everywhere"", Beequeen begin to resemble the spacious avant-rock of groups like Cul De Sac or Dirty Three.</p><p>
    
    Perhaps the track most illustrative of The Bodyshop's peculiar allure is their cover of Nick Drake's ""Black-Eyed Dog"", which features exquisite, double-tracked vocals by Marie-Louise Munck. Beginning as a near a cappella folk tune, Beequeen allow Drake's troubling lyric (""A black-eyed dog he called at my door...a black-eyed dog he knew my name"") room to gather depressive momentum before slowly adding layers of disquieting, clacking electronics which carry the groans of an antique winding wheel spinning gold back into straw. It's a mesmerizing, haunting performance, and it exemplifies Beequeen's skill for creating beguiling music whose tranquil surfaces mask treacherous, churning depths.</p></div>"|1150.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1150-the-bodyshop/|7.4|Matthew Murphy

The record itself was a winner too-- an unforgiving, tinfoil-toned broken blues howl-- and only the latest addictive salve for followers of head Whip and Pink &amp; Brown veteran John Dwyer.<i> Peanut Butter and Jelly Live at the Ginger Minge</i> is another goddamn home run, a reminder to bad livers and un-showered dancers everywhere that looking's free, but touching's gonna cost you something.</p><p>
    
    It's not really live-- that's a joke. (Go ahead, try and find ""The Ginger Minge"" in a club listing.) But the record crackles with the flinty immediacy of a Coachwhips live show, where the trio sets up on the venue's floor and launches into a condensed marathon of feedback and foot stomp heroics. On <i>Peanut Butter</i>, Dwyer's consumptive wheeze and chaotic electric guitar spew lead his drums and keys accompaniment through 10 tracks in 20 minutes. Organist (well, Casio player) Val-Tronic and drum set attendant Matt Hartman have more to offer than their instrumental counterparts did on <i>Bangers</i>. Openers ""Body and Brains"" and ""I Made a Bomb"" establish Hartman's drumming as more than a flailing, pounding mess-- there's a discernable blues rhythm amidst the noise, and Tronic's keys tinge the ends of the notes like a headache in search of Excedrin.</p><p>
    
    Now, Coachwhips aren't trying out for Fat Possum's stable of new traditionalists. They're just obsessed with creating an X-rated boogie machine (""Did You Cum?"", one song title asks), and patching into Hasil Adkins' amp provides more than enough stamina for the operation. There's blister pack noise (""Human Skin""), death ray reverb (""I Made a Bomb"" again), and even the occasional chord progression of more than two notes (""PB + J""). Val-Tronic steps up again for ""Letter 2 London"", where her organ plays off the rhythmic crash of Dwyer's guitar for a sound that fires wildly from a dark Memphis alley.</p><p>
    
    Dwyer still stands at the center of the Coachwhips fever party. Though the occasional song title or ""I wanna!"" exclamation bleeds through the hiss, for the most part his vocals are a slot above functional jibberish. And this is perfect for Ginger Minge, since comprehension would cause the brain to consider the rest of this tingling, piking, base pleasure mess.</p></div>"|1794.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1794-peanut-butter-and-jelly-live-at-the-ginger-minge/|7.3|Johnny Loftus

Unfortunately, on their latest release, <em>Burn the Maps</em>, they're far more ambitious. The tracks here frequently sounds as intimate as those on
    <em>For the Birds</em>, but don't stay that way for long, often ballooning into sweeping arrangements and choruses that find singer Glen Hansard screaming to the cheap seats. It can make for awkward listening.</p><p>
    
    Lost amidst the large-scale production, Hansard sounds particularly bare. On the earnest ""Finally""-- the record's best tune-- the Frames strike the right balance between strangled, melodramatic notes and Hansard's sincere vocals. But most other songs on <em>Burn the Maps</em> 
    suffer from bloated arrangements: The delicate folk of ""Trying"" gives 
    way to U2 stadium-scraping guitar, and ""Fake"" leaps from 
    three-week-overdue pauses in its verse into a swaggering chorus. ""Dream Awake"" and ""Keepsake"" also reach overwrought climaxes they never deserved. Please, guys, 
    please-- one song without strings in the chorus! Just one. I know you have a violinist in your midst, but there has to be 
    another way to bring the bombastitude.</p><p>
    
    ""Ship Caught in the Bay"" is an interesting experiment, with an 
    Eastern-tinged drum loop and whispered, suspenseful lyrics. Like every track on the LP, it loudens and widens, but this time it's into a hard drum loop and 
    electronic soundscapes rather than stadium rock. ""Underglass""-- the 
    only track that sounds like a rocker from beginning to end-- provides some well-needed catharsis.</p><p>
     
    The Frames could have used more tracks with consistent, engaging tones. Instead <em>Burn the Maps</em> often sounds like simplicity transformed into bloat in an attempt to 
    sound interesting. It rarely works: Most of these tracks simply move from captivating to frustrating to regrettable.</p></div>"|3175.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3175-burn-the-maps/|4.7|Jason Crock

By
    day, mild-mannered Mr Kidwell leads a typical adolescent lifestyle, attending
    college classes, interacting with his peers, and exhibiting a healthy level of
    comfort with members of the opposite sex.  Ryan earns good grades, gets along
    with his parents and enjoys making music.  Weird music.  Enter the alter-ego,
    Cex.</p><p>
    
    Cex is a trash-talking IDM superstar who does funny dances.  Cex is the
    self-proclaimed Number One Electronic Musician in the world.  Cex removes his
    clothes on stage.  Cex once remixed the Dismemberment Plan.  Cex writes battle
    raps for the haters that criticize his style.  Cex posts MP3s of these raps on
    his website.  Cex co-runs his own label, Tigerbeat6.  Cex flames other labels
    on their own bulletin boards.  Cex once appeared in an <i>Urb</i> magazine
    article profiling America's best new electronic artists.  Cex takes every
    available opportunity to remind others of his appearance in <i>Urb</i>
    magazine.  Cex has been quoted as saying, ""Snoop Dogg has his shit together.
    I think he and I would get along really well if we hung out at the MTV Beach
    House.""  Cex is pronounced ""sex.""  And the list goes on.</p><p>
    
    It's a strange duality, indeed.  At times, Kidwell comes off as a
    quintessential bedroom composer-- the alienated, frail-looking but lovable
    nerd we see pictured against a backdrop of flames on the cover of his latest
    EP, <i>Starship Galactica</i>.  Cex's early records took on a similar
    personality: reserved, cerebral and typically inaccessible.</p><p>
    
    These days it's different.  Catch him at one of his live shows, in which he
    scarcely plays any of his released material, and he's a raving savage.  He
    spends most of his airtime at the mic, either freestyling to the crowd, or
    decrying the pretenses of the IDM scene.  Cex accuses other musicians of
    cloaking their music in a false sense of mysticism-- building up a cult of
    personality by shutting themselves off from their fans, keeping their
    interviews terse and periodically issuing press photos of themselves in
    cryptic chin-stroking postures.</p><p>
    
    On a mission to subvert the scene that spawned him, Cex lays himself bare on
    his website, recording his thoughts in a daily journal that he keeps on public
    display.  This diary has grown into a 12-month catalog of Cex's preposterous
    bragging and Ryan's self-aware, insecure rants; it often feels as if the two
    are fighting for control of the same body.  It's juvenile, humorous, endearing
    and admirable all at once.  It also leads me to conclude that Cex has
    established a unique persona of his own.  He's a geeky teenager with an ear
    for music and an identity crisis; he's been thrust into the spotlight and
    doesn't quite know how to cope.</p><p>
    
    A departure from his previous studio efforts, the latest Cex release sees
    Kidwell reconciling some of the disparities between his various selves.
    <i>Starship Galactica</i> presents us with his most accessible yet accomplished
    output to date, interspersed with amateurish comedy skits that take cues from
    Big Pun and Outkast.</p><p>
    
    The musical offerings on this platter run the stylistic gamut, from the
    squelchy electro of ""Cal and Brady Style,"" to the organic and acoustic
    Kraut-rock leanings of ""Get in Yr Squads.""  The pieces never stray too far
    from their influences; and though no individual song pushes the envelope,
    it's uncommon to find such a motley array of mastered styles on the same
    album.</p><p>
<i>Starship Galactica</i> matches the instant, flamboyant appeal of Cex's
    live show with the quirkiness and complexity of his early releases.  The
    charm of his new material reaches beyond novelty, and the sublime innocence
    of songs like ""Your Handwriting When You Were a Child in the Winter"" profits
    from each successive listen.</p><p>
    
    ""Tattoo of a Barcode"" and ""Cex Can Kiss My Soft Sensuous Lips"" (the name is a
    play on the infamously titled Kid606 song ""Luke Vibert Can Kiss My Indiepunk
    Whiteboy Ass"") hearken back to the Cex sound of old, breaking from the
    conventional pop logic that the rest of the record follows.  Both are
    brilliant, and their presence on this release indicates that Kidwell might
    think twice before he abandons his upbringing as an avant-garde laptop jockey.
    Cex maintains that he's an entertainer, not an artist.  But the rounded feel
    of <i>Starship Galactica</i> suggests that, against all his protestations,
    he's thankfully still a bit of both.</p></div>"|1389.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1389-starship-galactica/|8.3|Malcolm Seymour III

Sardonic or not, this kind of belly-speak marks a rare moment of self-revelation for Will Oldham, who skewers accepted notions of static identity nearly every time he lowers his big, bearded jaw.  Still, Oldham (appearing here as contemporary alter-ego Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy) is, ultimately, exactly what he says he is-- smart and tough and weird, an awkward, oddly charismatic songwriter just as well-suited to coughing up death-ballads as he is to giggling out ditties about his penis.  Witness, again, the bitter joy of loyal Oldham-hood: He is simultaneously quiet and loud, both crushing and absurd, and filed in seven different places at the record store.</p>
<p><i>Superwolf</i>, a new collaboration with guitar freelancer Matt Sweeney, sees Oldham at his squirrely best, squeaking out his finest songs since 1999's <i>I See a Darkness</i>.  <i>Superwolf</i> marks Oldham's first official partnership with Sweeney, whose credits include a predictably brief stint axe-grinding in Billy Corgan's Zwan (alongside longtime Oldham buddy and Slint-forefather Dave Pajo), occasionally playing guitar in Guided by Voices, and fronting the long-departed Chavez (who released two revered full-lengths on Matador in the mid-90s).</p>
<p>Sweeney's participation in <i>Superwolf</i> was supposedly a response to a songwriting ""challenge"" from Oldham, and in addition to songwriting, Sweeney contributes backing vocals and guitar figures that echo Oldham's own blows, sometimes with eerie accuracy.  But despite all that buddying up, <i>Superwolf</i> is still at times unnervingly spare-- Oldham and Sweeney's pauses can be devastating, and some of <i>Superwolf</i>'s most powerfully convincing bits pop up between notes.</p>
<p>Opener ""My Home Is the Sea"" may sound an awful lot like late Grateful Dead (or, perhaps more specifically, like a slightly less raucous version of brother Ned Oldham's Anomoanon, who regularly employ Garcia-brand noodling and wild, space-rock somersaults), but most of <i>Superwolf</i> is quiet and intensely meditative, despite Sweeney's significant rock-inflections. Still, Oldham has always had a funny habit of inserting perverse, quasi-sexual shouts into otherwise-staid songs (see brutally confessional couplets rubbing up against phrases like ""my horny horn""), and at least thematically, <i>Superwolf</i>'s eleven tracks are predictably shifty-- ""My Home Is the Sea"" is rife with snarky lyric tricks (watch Oldham follow the momentarily devastating ""I have often said/ That I would like to be dead"" with a tiny pause and silent giggle, finally finishing with: ""In a shark's mouth"").</p>
<p>No matter who or what he calls himself, Will Oldham has always been uniquely capable of making colossal leaps in tone between breaths, and from track to track <i>Superwolf</i> nobly maintains that practice, drifting gracefully from classic-rock stomps to whispery dirges.  Consequently, Oldham followers may recognize <i>Superwolf</i> as a welcome midway point between Oldham's past aliases, as it hops from shambling, <i>Viva Last Blues</i>-ish, <i>Palace Music</i>-era shakes to dark, <i>Master and Everyone</i> haunts. ""Beast for Thee"" matches a gorgeous, barely-there melody with self-deflating lyrics (""Why are you kind to me?/ You could so easily take me in your arms and see/ A donkey""), Oldham's quivering pipes and Sweeney's fragile guitar coalescing into a soft, droning, and tremendously pretty whole.  The equally excellent ""Blood Embrace"" features some of Oldham's heartiest vocals, each word strong and full, floating above dark electric guitar swirls, dodging film samples of a faithless woman whispering to an unnamed lover, crafting an atmosphere so tense and ominous that you almost can't help twisting your face around to peep over your shoulder.</p>
<p>Soft and subtle, <i>Superwolf</i> is the kind of record that unwinds slowly, and is best enjoyed over multiple listens and, unsurprisingly, many glasses of wine.  Oldham and Sweeney mew coquettishly, stroking their guitars, cawing bizarre stories about love, death, and body parts: theirs is a rancid and beautiful landscape.</p>

It seemed like they had so much in common: nasal voices, a taste for writing long, slow, acoustic dirges, and a closet full of flannel. Sometimes they just stayed up into the wee hours of the morning talking about the apocalypse, and coming up with hundreds of song names that incorporate the word ""blues."" But all that changed after Jason grew out his mutton chops, bought a straw hat, and started <i>sleeping with Neil's girlfriend</i>! Truly, living with a roommate can be murder...</p><p>
    
    Jason Molina has never exactly hidden his Neil Young influence; most of his work under the now-defunct Songs: Ohia nametag paternity tested right back to the dire epics of <i>On the Beach</i>'s Side B. But after masterfully realizing and updating his idol's bleak, folk side on 2002's <i>Didn't It Rain</i>, Molina has spent the past two years dutifully understudying Young's plugged-in half-- first on Ohia's swansong <i>Magnolia Electric Co.</i>, and then on the road with a band called, confusingly, Magnolia Electric Co. Got all that? If I could I'd draw a diagram.</p><p>
    
    Now, for the first album released under his new alias, Molina rips another page out of Neil Young's playbook, releasing a set of sorta-new and mostly-unheard songs recorded live in front of an audience looking to drink a few beers and hear songs about Midwestern lonesomeness. In the spirit of <i>Time Fades Away</i> or <i>Rust Never Sleeps</i>, Molina lets road-testing and spontaneity trump studio polish, giving us his new material raw and solo-laden. Of course, Songs: Ohia fans are mostly just about the hits, so a few recent album cuts make the setlist as well.</p><p>
    
    The tone of <i>Trials &amp; Errors</i> recalls the final Songs:Ohia album's shift into country-rock territory, although this record's four-piece lineup can't recreate mechanical bull/chicken-wire stage stomp of <i>Magnolia Electric Co.</i>. As a substitute for bombast, the band provides generous doses of good old-fashioned jamming; no track runs shorter than 5:50, and that's mostly due to lengthy dual guitar dialogues between Molina and sideman Jason Groth. Yet, it's all a bit much for me, and I'm the staffer who <i>likes</i> jambands.</p><p>
    
    Nowhere is this new penchant for jamming more apparent than on the reproduction of the two-song suite ""Ring that Bell"" and ""Cross the Road, Molina"" from <i>Didn't It Rain</i>. Where silence and empty space used to be Molina's most appropriate and effective accompanist, the full-band versions presented here fill every nook and cranny with excessive noodling. Words and melodies get trampled in the melee, as Molina's usually haunting lyrical obsessions with darkness, astrology, and serpents are suffocated by the arrangements.</p><p> 
    
    Things loosen up a bit when Mike Kapinus moves from bass to trumpet for ""Leave the City"" and ""The Last 3 Human Words"", but only the most devoted listeners will get that far. If you make it all the way to the finale, ""The Big Beast"", you're treated to Jason Molina screwing up my whole brilliant intro idea by just flat out directly quoting the Neil Young songbook, touching upon ""Tonight's the Night"" and ""Walk On"". I swear I came up with the comparison before I heard that part, scout's honor!</p><p>
    
    If anything, that final homage suggests that Molina would be better off releasing an entire album of Neil Young covers while he tries to find a way to apply his strengths to the new, fuller sound he currently favors. The album <i>Magnolia Electric Co.</i> contained a few glimpses of how that could be realized, particularly in the use of Ben Keith-like slide guitar to provide a narrative moan through thunderous epics like ""Farewell Transmission"". But the band Magnolia Electric Co. is no Crazy Horse, and Molina's vocabulary on the guitar doesn't yet have the presence to carry such extended interpretations of his material. With his talent for musically mythologizing a bleak worldview, Jason Molina is the closest thing Neil Young has to a modern heir. But, for now, with his electric efforts, he's still just playing dress-up.</p></div>"|5630.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5630-trials-errors/|5.7|Rob Mitchum

    behind-the-music tabloid tale, but a genuine tragedy: In February 2004, the members of Chin Up Chin Up had just 
    finished mixing demos for <i>We Should Have Never Lived Like We Were Skyscrapers</i>, their first full-length, and attended a show at 
    Chicago venue the Empty Bottle. A little after 1 a.m. on Valentine's Day morning, 
    bassist Chris Saathoff ducked out of the club with his girlfriend. The couple crossed a neighboring intersection as an 
    SUV sped toward them, striking Saathoff as he pushed his girlfriend to safety. The driver never stopped, and Saathoff 
    was dragged for nearly two blocks. The 26-year-old was pronounced dead 
    at the scene.</p><p>
    
    After that, the band ""all hung out together more than we hung out as a 
    band,"" according to singer Jeremy Bolen. ""We didn't think about music 
    for a long time."" However, after some encouraging from Saathoff's own 
    parents and a few benefit shows at the Empty Bottle, the band were ready 
    to continue, and completed the album while keeping as much of 
    Saathoff's bass parts on it as possible. The only track recorded afterward, 
    album closer ""All My Hammocks are Dying"", has no bass at all.</p><p>
    
    Chin Up Chin Up's sound owes much to artists like 90 Day Men, June of 
    44, Slint, and Tortoise; the album's busy guitar parts, xylophones, and 
    unwieldy song titles all scream math-rock. Yet on this record, the band sound like they're growing 
    out of and beyond that scene. You can hear it clearly on the title track, 
    which opens with swirling keyboards and an acapella vocal before the 
    fastest rhythm of the album takes hold, which the band stops and starts 
    around moody interludes and strange group harmonies.</p><p>
    
    Elsewhere, a 
    thumping post-rock intro falls away while the band gets all Rapture on the 
    verses of ""Collide the Tide"" (re-recorded from their self-titled EP, this 
    version has busier production and is a little stiffer) with phased 
    synthesizers and hand-muted guitar scrapes. The band's 
    kitchen-sink approach its arrangements threatens to overcome its 
    melodies, but the tracks are saved by CUCU's grasp of tension and release as well as their memorable hooks. And tracks like ""Collide the Tide"" and the 
    Modest-Mouse-ish rave-up ""All My Hammocks Are Dying,"" <em>We Should Have 
    Never...</em> reveal a band with its eyes looking in a few different directions.</p><p>
     
    The record's big obstacle is Bolen's vocal delivery. His voice doesn't sound 
    ""bad"" so much ""forced,"" with vocals sung in hushed, scratchy tone that 
    seems either insecure or like a misguided attempt at sounding cool. 
    Fortunately, he doesn't always sing in such an affected whisper. There are 
    occasions, like on the album's other big stand-out ""Virginia Don't Drown"", 
    where Bolen reaches for the notes in a normal voice while the band 
    breaks into a note-perfect Cure imitation behind him. Moments like this 
    feel like cracking a window on the album's claustrophobic arrangements, 
    and give a glimpse of how much more Chin Up Chin Up are capable of.</p></div>"|1792.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1792-we-should-have-never-lived-like-we-were-skyscrapers/|7.6|Jason Crock

Mason's lo-fi blues/folk blend is refreshingly humble and unostentatious. Instead of using these standards as a springboard for modern adventures in composition, he sticks to their rawboned essence. Unlike some of his peers, Mason doesn't play up that rawness; instead he allows those old progressions to work their magic rather than forcing catharsis. The result is a more immediate, less cerebral album than you'd expect from such a green musician.</p><p>
<em>Nylon</em> opined that Mason's songwriting is ""on par, arguably, with lyrical mastermind Leonard Cohen..."" Cough! Cough! Excuse me, I swallowed my gum. Mason does evoke Cohen in lyrical style and vocal timbre, but in skill and substance? Let's not get ahead of ourselves, <em>Nylon</em>; the dude's not even out of his teens and you're comparing him to one of our greatest living songwriters. It's too much pressure. Mason displays admirable insight and humility for a 19-year-old, but this is still a teenager's record. ""All You Can Do"" is the product of a young man moving to the big city and being struck for the first time by the tragedy of homelessness. ""Still a Fly"" gets a little lyrically precocious (""But still, you're just a kid, you shouldn't read Dostoevsky at your age""), but displays Mason's charming melody and casual delivery. And the title track's gentle lullaby is belied by its petulant lyrics (""Why don't you listen when I stamp my feet?/ You don't belong where the humans eat"").</p><p>
    
    ""Oxygen""-- comprised mainly of an ominous, one-note acoustic guitar rhythm-- is the clear stand-out. This is Mason's protest song, a procession of declarations, consolations and encouragements, each line a self-contained crescendo. ""We can be richer than industry as long as we know there are things that we don't really need,"" Mason intones, then slips in Holden Caulfieldisms like, ""I wanna see through all the lies of society, to the reality; happiness is at stake."" But these shallower invocations of dreaded Society only reveal Mason's tender age and amplify the song's impact. It seems to stem from a well of deep feeling and genuine concern. ""Oxygen"" displays a moral clarity that's easier to attain when you're young, but which makes for truly uplifting music, even to jaded moral relativists like me.

Flying solo, these artists are thrust into the spotlight alone, where each lyric, song title, and liner note is assumed to be a window into the songwriter's life. On <i>PREfection</i>-- Cass McCombs's second album and first on 4AD-- the Baltimore songwriter welcomes this attention, feeling free enough not only to flash his emotions but to fictionalize them as well. From the song titles of ""City of Brotherly Love"" and ""Tourist Woman"" to the southern rockabilly of ""Bury Mary"" and Motown bounce of ""Subtraction"", McCombs sheds controlled amounts of light onto his travel diary-like life story. In the tradition of wandering American writers like Hemingway and Steinbeck, McCombs's goal is to weave fact and fiction, a goal he expresses with his own mantra: ""I don't actually want my biography to contain much in the way of actual biographical information.""</p><p>
    
    While McCombs the lyricist roams geographically and emotionally, McCombs the songwriter meanders through musical periods. The fuzz-bass pattern and tense organ chords of ""Tourist Woman"" recall the dark psychedelic jams of the Doors, while lead single ""Sacred Heart"" borrows heavily from the Cure and the Smiths. Despite that genre-dabbling, <i>PREfection</i> sounds cohesive thanks to McCombs's arching use of slowcore-inspired repetition, organs and keyboards to provide the LP's texture, and prevalence to end tracks with their chorus fading out on repeat.</p><p>
    
    McCombs hits a snag by spreading his creative juices too thin across the vocals and instrumentation. The result is a scanty ""wall of sound"" consisting solely of bass, guitar and organ/keyboard with little variation or build. On ""Multiple Suns"" and ""City of Brotherly Love"", the instruments are fixed in unison, diverging only briefly in the former for a lead guitar bend. It's pretty but it grows tiresome.</p><p>
    
    McCombs does manage his own brand of boiled-down shoegazing when instruments play more independently. First track ""Equinox"", probably the strongest of the album, opens with a subtle, ringing guitar pattern as keyboards dramatically swell above steady, syncopated bass notes. McCombs adheres to standard song structure, but cleverly gives each instrument a run at carrying the melody. Midway through, the composition has already taken precedence over whatever lyrical labyrinth McCombs may have constructed. Instead of repeating verses for the apparent sole purpose of delivering more riddles, McCombs lets the music do the talking on ""Equinox"". For now, this is how the relatively unknown McCombs should aim to captivate listeners-- with his crafty songwriting. Then, once his celebrity grows to ""Cass is dating who???"" proportions, he can start throwing some lyrical knuckleballs.</p></div>"|5179.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5179-prefection/|7.4|Adam Moerder

    More than a decade after these blissfully genre-bending Welsh popsters
    burst through a rip in the space-time continuum with all the
    self-assured ambition of five guys in a (soon literal) armored tank,
    Super Furry Animals are presenting symptoms of a band about to
    re-enter the ether: a suddenly human album, 2003's <em>Phantom
    Power</em>; a solo project, singer Gruff Rhys's just-released <em>Yr
    Atal Genhedlaeth</em>; and now a career-spanning singles compilation.
    Marrying a Japanese avant-garde artist can't be far off.</p><p>
    For those of you just joining us: Super Furry Animals were the most
    life-affirming British pop group of the late 1990s, retaining their
    yen for sunny melodies even as Radiohead perfected gloomy computer-age
    ennui and Blur's buoyant choruses sank into heartbreakingly dissonant
    sad bastard music. Since landing on this watery, sun-scorched planet,
    SFA have gleefully mish-mashed influences that include the Beach Boys, the
    Beatles, David Bowie, and Chemical Brothers. With 2001's <em>Rings
    Around the World</em> came 70s soul and widespread acclaim. Even
    <em>Phantom Power</em> added a touch of Byrdsian country-rock.</p><p>
<em>Songbook</em> spans all those sounds and more, cramming 21
    perception-twisting singles on one disc. Yes, that means the band's
    plentiful instrumentals are absent, as are some of keyboardist Cian
    Ciárán's electronic contributions. But while <em>Songbook</em> contains
    a few sops to obscurity-seekers (the non-album gem ""Ice Hockey Hair""
    and ""Blerwytirhwng"", from the band's pre-Creation debut EP), the disc
    aims more toward awing neophytes with the group's unbridled pop
    prowess than sating completists. The management is not responsible for
    hats, purses, or hipster poses lost during the ride.</p><p>
    My sources assure me that Wales is a real place, but I prefer to think
    of it as an imaginary kingdom, like Oz or Narnia or a sovereign Iraq.
    Its national anthem would be this album's irrepressible opener, 1996's
    ""Something 4 the Weekend"", which somersaults down puffy cloudscapes
    like ""Mr. Blue Sky"" for the eclectic decade. ""The Man Don't Give a
    Fuck"" is Supergrass's ""Pumpin' on Your Stereo"" armed with 52 f-bombs,
    a Steely Dan sample,and leftist politics; the proggy quasi-Britpop of
    ""Do or Die"" very nearly cops its guitar line from the Allman Brothers'
    ""Jessica"". Quoting ""Juxtapozed With U"" might not get the girl from
    Poli Sci class out of that halter top, but its goofy vocoder come-ons
    will give you something to smile about as you stumble home wearing her
    Long Island iced tea.</p><p>
    As with 1998 b-sides and rarities compilation <em>Outspaced</em>,
    <em>Songbook</em> is built like an album, not a retrospective. In other
    words, forget anything resembling chronological order. Thus the
    voluptuous bombast of 2002's ""It's Not the End of the World"" (which,
    to confuse matters further, wouldn't sound out of place on Blur's
    <em>The Great Escape</em>) fades into the ""Deadweight""-era Beck
    tropicalia of ""Northern Lites"", from 1999's <em>Guerilla</em>.
    Fortunately, the art-punky ""Hermann Loves Pauline"" and flange-laden
    ""Play It Cool""-- two of the most weirdly inventive songs from 1997's
    <em>Radiator</em>-- show up consecutively, albeit in reverse order from
    their original appearance. Wales has ways of making you think.</p><p>
    Yeah, Super Furry Animals sure were a great band. Maybe you can catch
    them in 10 years when they go on their reunion cash-in tour and get
    the hype they deserve. Wait, what's that? You say the title is
    portentously denoted <em>Volume One</em>? That the Super Furries have
    already recorded much of their next album, due for release later this
    year? Shit, this could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship. TO
    BE CONTINUED...</p></div>"|7604.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7604-songbook-the-singles-volume-one/|8.9|Marc Hogan

And like any good scientist-- especially any good biologist-- Meiburg is obsessed with the particulars of life and death as well as the precarious border between them.</p><p>
    
    The same can be said of his musical partner, Will Sheff, who acts the Lennon to Meiburg's McCartney. Both are the principles in Okkervil River as well as Shearwater, and both specialize in a brand of haunted, folksy, story-oriented rock that falls somewhere between the Shins' upbeat observations and Pinetop Seven's eerie Americana. While Sheff seems to be the more prolific of the pair, writing almost all of Okkervil River's material and even two of the five songs on Shearwater's new <i>Thieves</i> EP, Meiburg proves his match and his complement.</p><p>
    
    Meiburg's ""Mountain Laurel"" is a bracing banjo stomp, with Scott Danbom's abrasive fiddle adding palpable tension to Meiburg's ruminations on the failings of the human body. Opener ""I Can't Wait"" begins with a plaintive guitar strum, then gradually builds to a caterwauling climax before returning again to that hushed acoustic guitar theme. ""There's Bark Where You Were Breathing"" creeps along on a quietly sung melody that at times is barely audible, as if the notes travel by breeze.</p><p>
    
    Even so, it's Sheff's ""Near the Garden"" that proves to be the EP's best track and perhaps the most affecting song either of them has written. Set at the funeral of a friend, the song tries to locate some meaning in death, but finds nothing instructive or satisfying. ""You used to be a live body,"" Sheff sings (or it could be ""You used to be alive, body""), ""then you died."" He knows that the corpse in the casket is not the person he knew, just the empty casing of a snuffed life, and on the plane ride home, he laments how much life is inescapably wasted: ""The movie on the plane says life is for the living, as I sit slowly living, paralyzed with boredom.""</p><p>
    
    It's a stark, unsentimental moment in an EP-- as well as in an ongoing collaboration-- that plumbs the mysteries of mortality without resorting to comforting platitudes or naive proclamations. Instead, Meiburg and Sheff both sound scientific, but never cold or clinical.</p></div>"|7104.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7104-thieves-ep/|7.7|Stephen M. Deusner

He has a warm, versatile voice, and impressive flow, but more importantly, he has a lot of ideas. There are times when Ladd's vision and reach are so broad that his music can't quite keep up with it, but he's skilled enough to consistently produce satisfying albums-- twice creating absolutely brilliant ones: <i>Welcome to the Afterfuture</i> and Majesticons' <i>Beauty Party</i>.</p><p>
    Listening to Ladd, it's clear that unifying concepts-- such as the underground vs. mainstream rivalry/soap opera of the Infesticons and Majesticons projects-- are important to him, and his first entry in Thirsty Ear's Blue Series is no exception. <i>Negrophilia</i> takes its title from and is inspired by the writings of Petrine Archer-Straw, who wrote a boom with the same name (subtitled <i>Avant-Garde Paris and Black Culture in the 1920s</i>). Her tome expounded upon the Paris art world's embrace of black American and African ex-pats-- and its co-option of their art and culture, which played heavily into Art Deco, cubism (earlier in the century), and Euro-jazz.</p><p>
    Now, if most artists were to say their album was influenced by a particular work of non-fiction, you might notice the influence in one song or a title or the cover art, but Ladd is serious. He weaves examinations of the book's themes-- as well as civil rights-related sound clips and references to both military and cultural imperialism and conflations of early 20th Century European art and modern American pop stars (""Brancusi sculpting Beyonce in Gold lame/ Blond negress"")-- into his open-ended, heavily chopped and diced songs. The musical approach\xD0heavy improvisation revisited, reconfigured and reconstituted into dense sound collages yields plenty of interesting moments, but it also unfortunately marginalizes Ladd's rapping and also opens the door to passages that grow unfocused or cluttered.</p><p>
    Ladd does have a crack band at his disposal, with drummer Guillermo E. Brown (a frequent David S. Ware collaborator) helping to shape the record through editing and electronics, Vijay Iyer adding keyboards, winds by Andrew Lamb, Roy Campbell on trumpet, and Bruce Grant on tape loops. They set a promising tone with ""Fieldwork (the Ethnographer's Daughter)"", opening with dry hand percussion and acoustic guitar to simulate a field recording and settling on an ominous groove for Ladd to drop a few lines over, manipulating his voice even as it's attacked from all sides by squirming loops and fluttering woodwinds and horn. ""Shake It"" runs away with the show, though, with its off-kilter, lurching beat, outbursts of sax and trumpet and Ladd's tense flow.</p><p>
    ""Worldwide Shrinkwrap (Contact Zones)"" comes close to the glory of ""Shake It"", but questionable vocal processing-- including annoying pitch-shifting-- keeps it from getting there. That's indicative of the problems with the album's weaker tracks-- they wander through lengthy passages of wet noodle electro-jazz. Fortunately, the LP also has luxurious instrumental sections, such as the remarkable bassoon and trumpet duel of ""Back at Ya,"" or Iyer's piano meditation and Campbell's dusty solo on ""Sam and Milli Dine Out"".</p><p>
    It's a shame that the disc isn't more laserly in its focus, because its best moments are stellar and exhilarating. We know from history that Ladd is very capable of making instrumentals that feel like they're going somewhere, so it's something of a mystery as to why he gets such mixed results here, but even great musicians aren't fail-proof.</p></div>"|4624.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4624-negrophilia/|7.2|Joe Tangari

Cynics can cackle over their nearly album-long abuse of the ""Amen"" break, one of electronic music's most exploited beat samples that still somehow sounds fresh when DJ/Producer #2023 tweaks it. Irony-hipsters can magic-mark Duran+2 all over their Paul Frank and Emily Strange mini-backpacks, alongside singing the shoddy sample of a McDonald's commercial announcing: ""Holla! McDonald's Big &amp; Tasty is only a dolla!"" Nostalgists can reminisce over the virgin year of 2000, when it seemed truly punk to desecrate NWA classics by laptop. Adolescent boys aged 13-43 can rub salt into their sexual frustrations by listening to Duran+2's field recording of what is supposedly an act of fellatio. <i>Very Pleasure</i> is a pile of crap dipped in fool's gold.</p><p>
    
    A Philadelphian named Ed Flis is the mastermind behind Duran+2; the CockRockDisco website declares, ""One might call him the new John Holmes."" The music is co-produced by Michael Chiaken and Tony Gabor, and blessed by CockRockDisco owner/trashcore maven/former Donna Summer, Jason Forrest. A majority of Duran+2's debut album resemble remixes of Forrest's vaudeville; they typically graft a familiar sample of a crass pop or hair-metal blurt, and then pulverize it with the sound of a drum machine rolling down a hill in a garbage can. There is nothing subversive here, but enough intelligence exists to warrant a few clever moments.</p><p>
    
    Opener, ""I Hate the 80's"" is nothing more than an Amen'd take on the computer-expo funk of Yazoo's ""Don't Go""-- good times from dimly lit memories. The stronger ""Manrammer"" is an essay on the Amen break that deftly compiles virtually every fingerprint laid on that rhythm's call to arms-- the pitch-drops, the street-cleaner blows to the cymbals, the trudges through muck to baffle the dancefloor, the E-addled mood swings, etc. A snippet of Ace of Base's department-store reggae classic, ""All That She Wants"", figures somewhere in there. ""Gaetan"" is like a less memorable, less haunting version of Kid606's ""My Kitten""-- both songs sounds like a piano ballad that sits in a corner with its head buried in its knees while splintered beats ransack the house.</p><p>
    
    ""Movies Unlimited"" could have gone further with its trunk-rattling Miami bass besides having distortion spat on it. ""Year of the Monkey"" and its inbred second-cousin ""Purple Passion"" are generic breakcore excursions with a few douses of equally generic, Wagnerian trance-techno synth melodies. Closer ""Untitled"" insecurely dabbles with busted-lawnmower metal guitar of what sounds like Slayer before falling into the gabber routine.</p><p>
<i>Very Pleasure</i>'s most redeeming moments are the intoxicated raggacore of ""Hard Girls"" and the McDonald's jingle thrash of ""Pilldriver"". The latter is a prime example of a whatthefuckwasthat? break that is oddly missing from so much breakcore these days. And then there's the ""Interlude"", which first sounds like bare feet in mud, but is said to be a close mic'd performance of a national epidemic among American youth that Dr. Phil reminded our president about on his show. It's enough to scare children into abstinence.</p></div>"|2594.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2594-very-pleasure/|6.5|Cameron Macdonald

After all, he has hundreds of brilliant tracks socked away somewhere that he can't be bothered to release. Why would he deliberately put out something that was just OK?</p>
<p>Why, indeed?  People wondered what James was up to after the 2001 release <i>Drukqs</i>, and there was some speculation that it was a contract fulfillment a la Prince's <i>The Vault/Old Friends 4 Sale</i>. It wasn't that <i>Drukqs</i> was bad, exactly, just that it seemed uninterested in breaking new ground, which was unusual considering the bold strokes to which the Aphex Twin audience had grown accustomed.

<p>The key word for <i>Analord </i> is ""acid.""

The bouncier ""Grumpy Acid"" fulfils the promise of its excellent title by sounding like the amplified gastric system of a robot badly in need of Pepto Bismol. ""Steppingfilter 101"" is mid-tempo mellow, with gentle synth pads floating behind the zig-zag buzz out front. It's a seriously retro sound, channeling precisely one offshoot of early ""classic"" IDM. If an unknown had released the tracks on <i>Analord 1</i> in 1995, he would have been accused of straight ripping the AFX acid style. But James pioneered this sound, so I guess he has the right to return to it if he chooses.</p>
<p><i>Analord 2</i> is a little better, keeping the same palate while toning down the tired acid textures and delivering more melody. The tuneful ""Phonatacid"" isn't exactly riveting, but it does manage to undergo some interesting transformations over its nearly 10-minute length.

Just Google ""bukkake"" and then pray for your mortal soul's destiny. The self-canceling album title doesn't help, and neither does the obligatory freakfolk vibe of songs titled ""Enter the Wang"", ""Hidden from the Hidden Ones"", or ""Pipestone Octopus with Horseheart"". If I never knew these fouls, then maybe I would consider the Master Musicians of Bukkake to be one haunting artifact unearthed from the crates of a Bangkok record shop/noodle house/bordello in the back.</p><p>
    
    The Master Musicians is a motley assemble of 20 blokes from subterranean Seattle who generally perform lysergically poisoned impressions of Southeast Asian ceremonial music. Alan Bishop and Charlie Gocher of ethnodelic greats the Sun City Girls add some drums and Burmese banjo in there. <i>Visible</i> is best heard in one sitting as it follows a narrative from wearied peace to phantasmagoric horror to entrance to heaven.</p><p>
    
    Opener, (cough, cough), ""Enter the Wang"" fires the gong with faint Asian pentatonic string scales letting everyone know that the curtains are drawn and much madness follows. ""Bukkake Sunrise"" first bleeds in what sounds like a cross being a machine eating a tape and rain on tin. Blues guitar melodies that overlook a dust bowl arise while tribal chants echo throughout, beckoning one out of slumber and tempting that person to crawl out his or her bedroom window to follow the sound. The earth then swallows up the seeker.</p><p>
    
    ""Lucky Duck"" loosely recalls the Balinese monkey chant, as scattered Master Musicians arise from the ashes to curse in ululating chants all punctuated with tribal thumps. However, the melodrama kicks in with the following, ""Pipestone Octopus with Horseheart"" interrupts the album's flow with Residents-style orientialism with screeching and wails blown through the nose. The children's Halloween record vibe fares better on ""Horseheart Revolution"" and ""Black Bile"", where the chants are awash in the village fires.</p><p>
    
    Midway through the LP, ""Hidden from the Hidden Ones"" gathers the delirium into a natural tension with a drum march to the sacrifice altar and Faust-like violin grindings driving the momentum. ""Custody's Last Battle/Secret Wars"" is the peak; gunshots pierce through an open-air recording as dribbling percussion and screamed ""aiees"" flee the battlefield. An obligatory catharsis, I suppose. Closer ""Circular and Made of the Earth"" resolves the whole delirium with a feel-good ballad of accordion drones and sitar-stylized banjos plucks in perfect tune with an enraptured bloke speaking in tongues.</p><p>
    
    Cynics can consider this music to be another example of Westerners trying to be weird by exploiting ""exotic"" and ""mysterious"" Asian music. That accusation does have substantial evidence, but this music should not be dismissed so quickly. The majority of the music is still well-executed and can engross listeners with a sense of otherness. Just don't look up ""bukkake,"" for the love of God.</p></div>"|5626.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5626-the-visible-sign-of-the-invisible-order/|7.2|Cameron Macdonald

All six tracks appeared on 2004's grandiose <i>Your Blues</i>, on which singer-songwriter and New Pornographer Daniel Bejar took his heady popcraft to new heights of synthesized theatricality. At subsequent live gigs, however, Bejar performed with the crazed snake charmers (and fellow Vancouverites) of Frog Eyes as his backing band, and was apparently so tickled by the results that he has here attempted to bottle that genie for home use.</p><p>
    
    Recorded over the course of a weekend (and entirely without Bejar's usual regard for subtlety) the new versions of these songs get fingered and manhandled to such degrees that those who love the verdant, extraterrestrial warmth of <i>Your Blues</i> might not want to look. Though <i>Notorious Lightning</i> finds Destroyer returning to a more traditional guitar-based instrumental line-up, this nevertheless feels like a riskier work than <i>Your Blues</i>, but unfortunately it seems to be one whose rewards don't merit the risk.</p><p>
    
    With Frog Eyes guitarist and vocalist Carey Mercer serving as his primary foil, Bejar continually pushes his songs (not to mention his vocal chords) in directions they seem reluctant to go. The disk kicks off with the group stretching the spine of the titular ""Notorious Lightning"", giving the rousing <i>Your Blues</i> anthem a thorough electric going-over. Mercer's guitar spits long streams of tobacco juice over the verses before he and Bejar proceed to trade jabs and wounded howls for nearly 10 minutes. Like so many recent guitar-based tracks this bears certain similarities to Television, although I must say it's one of the few that I recall that seems interested in surpassing the reedy distress of Tom Verlaine's vocal delivery. This is a tactic that carries with it a needlessly high irritation factor, though to his credit (I guess) Bejar holds nothing back, continually squeezing his voice to its extremes with obvious emotive relish.</p><p>
    
    Some of the other tracks-- such as the steam-rolling ""New Ways of Living"" or the Bowie-meets-the-Dead space blues of ""Don't Become the Thing You Hated""-- fare better in this harsh environment, although I don't know if any of them could necessarily be said to improve upon the <i>Your Blues</i> versions. Too often Bejar's bountiful hooks and deft lyrics get so buried beneath careless bluster that the uninformed newcomer might not even realize what they're missing. Longtime Destroyer followers are savvy enough not to expect Bejar to travel from point to point in a straight line, but for those just coming around to the ample charms of <i>Your Blues</i>, this unruly EP might prove to be one left turn too many.</p></div>"|2294.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2294-notorious-lightning-and-other-works-ep/|6.8|Matthew Murphy

    skulking, and impassionate conversation nonstarters about the irony of
    Mozzer's perceived miserablism-- but few transcendent covers. Like
    coddled infants, the former Smiths frontman's songs may just be
    inseparable from their progenitor. So how can the Decemberists' Colin
    Meloy hope to succeed where David Bowie, Jeff Buckley, Hootie &amp; the
    Blowfish, and t.a.T.u. all failed? He can't.</p><p>
    
    Meloy has admitted as much in recent interviews. That's why
    his six-song, tour-only <em>Sings Morrissey</em> EP is limited to
    1,000 copies. But kids these days swap files the way the Yankees trade
    for pitching, so when the lead singer of a justifiably lauded indie
    band documents his pimply teenage fanboydom, 1s and 0s are bound to
    escape. As a quick download or a post-show impulse buy, these
    recordings serve their purpose. But the next time that C drive fills
    up, Windows may highlight a few ""rarely used files.""</p><p>
    
    For the most part, Meloy picks his material wisely. The first five
    songs are all decent-to-spectacular <em>Viva Hate</em>-or <em>Your
    Arsenal</em>-era b-sides. Their obscurity works to Meloy's advantage,
    like NBC's old ""if you haven't seen it, it's new to you"" rerun
    marketing strategy. Either that or he may just have picked them because
    ""Suedehead"" doesn't transfer easily to a single acoustic guitar.</p><p>
    
    ""My Love Life"" flip-side ""I've Changed My Plea to Guilty"" is the clear
    standout, as Meloy transfers Moz's piano-based torch song about a
    lonely innocent (""freedom is wasted on me"") into arpeggiated guitar
    and earnest, if faltering, high notes. ""Jack the Ripper"" retains the
    anthemic chorus's Humbert Humbert-like appeal, but lacks the violence
    that propelled the original ""Certain People I Know"" b-side or its still-darker live version. ""Pregnant for the Last Time"" and ""Sister, I'm a Poet"" are twangy, upbeat, and no better than their so-so Morrissey counterparts.</p><p>
    
    It's on closer ""Everyday Is Like Sunday"" (here inexplicably listed as ""Every Day""; I'll spare you my exegesis on why that's significant) that
    Meloy's greatest failing, other than not being Morrissey, is exposed:
    his voice. Those thin, reedy pipes-- tailor-made for
    singing about pirates and architecture-- don't do these songs justice.
    Also, dude, check the lyrics: It's ""greased"" tea. As in,
    ""post-apocalyptic, tainted-by-nuclear-fallout"" tea, or at least nasty ""everyday"" tea. Meloy's valiant
    effort ultimately falls short.</p><p>
    
    With luck, Morrissey will one day record a Decemberists cover or two
    (may I suggest ""I Was Meant for the Stage""?). In the meantime, Meloy's
    Moz renditions, however well-meaning, are unlikely to displace the
    originals or even motivate new listeners to seek them out. I guess no one can hold a candle to Nancy Sinatra.</p></div>"|5627.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5627-sings-morrissey-ep/|6.6|Marc Hogan

While Swedish cohorts the Hives were touring worldwide and appearing on MTV award shows, SOOL's fame collapsed. The band's fourth album, <i>Origin 1</i>, won't reverse that trend.</p><p>
    
    To disparage SOOL as derivative of bands like the Rolling Stones and Stooges would be a compliment; these guys would kill just to be the Dandy Warhols. The band's thin ""Really, We're Swedish!"" schtick-- in concert SOOL are decked out in kaftans and strut around like the Hives-- only makes things worse. When frontman Ebbot Lundberg shouts ""We're gonna last forever/ We're gonna make you feel so high"" on ""Transcendental Suicide"", the song exudes the rock'n'roll intensity of a middle school D.A.R.E. assembly.</p><p>
    
    But forget about style and charisma: This band has no hooks and no energy. First single ""Bigtime"" has a throbbing bassline, huge drums, and catchy guitar riff, but no build-up. ""Heading For a Breakdown"" suffers from the same: After its swelling verse and pre-chorus, the band misses its opportunity to deliver a timely, fist-pumping chorus, instead settling to plateau with a discreet refrain. Speaking of which, Lundberg might have the worst chorus vocals I've ever heard. As he raises his voice, his raspy baritone dissipates into an extremely loud whisper and gets lost in the mix.</p><p> 
    
    This album's two best tracks-- two of the best of SOOL's career-- are actually slow-paced, folksier numbers: ""Believe I've Found"" and ""Midnight Children (Enfants De La Nuit)"". ""Midnight Children"" glides smoothly on an ascending bassline, while ""Believe I've Found"" lurches mysteriously through a minor folk progression, haunted by a thick, bluesy electric lead. Because neither song builds to obligatory detonation, Lundberg is more focused on melody. As a result, the songwriting is more unpredictable and the results are more rewarding-- neither of which can be said for the rest of the record.</p></div>"|7377.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7377-origin-1/|4.8|Adam Moerder

Any English professor will tell you it's dangerous to conflate an author with his narrator, but in this case, there are parallels to draw. Think of the prism as this statement from the band's online bio (written circa <i>Secret Name</i>): ""Low is a trio from Duluth, Minnesota, who make very slow music. That's not the only thing there is to their music, or even the most important thing, but it's what you'll notice first."" Anyone that's listened to myopic negative criticism of the group knows this all too well.</p><p> 
    
    The bio goes on to note that there's more to Low music than narcoleptic tempos; indeed, you'd have to be tone-deaf or stubborn to listen to <i>Secret Name</i> or <i>Songs From a Dead Pilot</i> and not realize that. Still, the stereotype remains-- as do expectations from fans of all stripes, whether the band wants to cop to them or not. Most importantly, there's the expectations that the band has of themselves; over the past decade, the group has shown a willingness to buck convention and follow their muse wherever it leads. Unfortunately, it sounds like they've been lead astray. In other words (again, from ""Death of a Salesman""): ""I forgot all my songs/ The words now are wrong/ And I burned my guitar in a rage"".</p><p> 
    
    This forgetful rage is exemplified by ""Everybody's Song"", one of the album's many missteps. On this song, the group rocks out-- Sparhawk breaks out the Spinal Tap amp, Mimi Parker pummels her snare and high-hat, and Zak Sally...well, Zak doesn't have to change his approach too much, though he might be plucking his bass strings with more force than usual. On top of this mess are those patented gorgeous two-part harmonies, uncharacteristically straining to make themselves heard over the racket. And that's what this track amounts to-- a big ball of racket, crass and boorish, full of the sound and fury that don't amount to much. More importantly, it goes against everything that Low does successfully.</p><p> 
    
    Don't take my word for it, though. According to Low, ""they play songs stripped to their bare essentials: slow tempos, quiet voices, powerful lyrics, and minimal instrumentations."" You'd think that a song following that plan of attack would be a smashing success, or-- at the very least-- a bit better than this Marshall Stacked stuff. Instead, they end up with a song bastard naysayers can use as Hater's Exhibit A in the case of Why Low Is No Good. ""Broadway (So Many People)"", an interminable seven-minute track, takes its sweet time alternating between bored lead-footed strumming and waning echoed ambiance before giving way to a cloying coda that aims for ""pretty"" but ends up well in the rough.</p><p> 
    
    The rest of the album consists of various extrapolations of Low's sound with varying degrees of success. ""Monkey"", the lead-off track, is what ""Everybody's Song"" would be with just a smidge of restraint, a better sense of dynamics, and some self-awareness. Following that is ""California"", probably the best pop song the group's ever recorded (with the meta-aware ""Just Stand Back"" and the peppy Spector homage ""Walk Into the Sea"" finishing close behind). On the other hand, there are Low-by-numbers tracks like ""On the Edge Of"" (working the quiet/loud trick like a broken light switch) and over-wrought slabs like ""Step"" (complete with vocal effects, piano taps, hand claps, and children's vocals all drunkenly stumbling into each other), where the busy hands of producer Dave Fridmann still end up doing the Devil's work.</p><p> 
    
    Erring on the side of minimal instrumentation would have done this record a world of good. ""Cue the Strings"" would play out beautifully as just Mimi &amp; Alan set against a sea of feedback, but the invasive metronomic beat and the fake strings (popping in on cue) muddy the waters; the all tension/no release moves of ""Pissing"" is the slightly more successful flip side to ""Everybody's Song"" and its all release/no tension MO; ""Silver Rider"" pays too much attention to its own edict (""Sometimes your voice is not enough"") and adds just enough bells and whistles-- a timpani drum here, a buried looped vocal there, some acoustic picking sprinkled throughout-- to upset the song's balance; ""When I Go Deaf"" works fine as a quiet acoustic number but loses a bit of its emotional heft when the full band comes in and the guitar tech plugs in Sparhawk's Flying V.</p><p> 
    
    ""The future is prisms and math."" So let's crunch some numbers: Low's been an ongoing concern for over a decade. <i>The Great Destroyer</i> is their 8th album, and 12th full-length release. They've recorded enough songs during the course of their career to fill a three-CD box set with a set of 52 songs that barely overlaps what's available on their full-lengths. And never mind the number of tours and shows and hours logged in countless studios. I mention all this because of the intriguing subtext permeating most of these songs. It's in the song titles--""Death of a Salesman"", ""When I Go Deaf"", ""Cue The Strings"", ""Walk Into The Sea"". It's in the lyrics--""never sing that song again,"" ""the march is over/ The great destroyer/ She passes through you like a knife,"" ""Yeah, time's a great destroyer/ It leaves every child a bastard."" And, most tellingly, on ""Just Stand Back"": ""I could turn on you so fast/ I'll just cut you in the end."" Sounds like they're cutting bait and heading back to shore.</p><p> 
    
    You can imagine a wry smirk on Alan's face when he sings: ""It's a hit/ It's got soul/ Steal the show/ With your rock'n'roll"". It's a wry encapsulation of a band that's made a point (up until now) to forgo convention, instead setting off to discover a new dialect in an old language. This line could easily serve as an epithet, or an epitaph. And maybe this is a death, and <i>The Great Destroyer</i> is Low themselves, orphaning their fans and their history for the sake of the group's creative edification. If this album is indeed the beginning of a long, arduous journey of rediscovery and rebirth and other fun ponderous stuff, here's hoping the rest of the trip is more enjoyable than this initial misstep.</p></div>"|4902.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4902-the-great-destroyer/|5.5|David Raposa

A pleasingly disembodied traipse through the French countryside, it was a lesson for anybody who thinks electronics have no soul.</p><p>  After saying ""au revoir"" to longtime friend/collaborator Nicolas Fromageau, Anthony Gonzalez goes it alone for album three, upping the drama (there's even a track called ""Teen Angst"") by layering electro-acoustic sci-fi backdrops atop often-campy dialogue (written by his brother), and then buoying it all with by a massive noir choir. From the buzzing nighttime <em>Blade Runner</em> skyline of the cover art to lyrics investigating car wrecks and dislodged brains, this is a mammoth collusion of synth gasps and distorted swirls, darker and more urban than its meadow-bound predecessor.  If Gonzalez had gone ahead with only epic Vangelis modulations, <em>Before the Dawn Heals Us</em> would collapse under hollow ponderousness.  Instead, he weaves a rock backbone into his tangerine-dream landscape with steady doses of highly effective live drums, gigantic post-MBV guitar, and sharper, more defined songwriting that helps to beef up the diaphanous symphony.</p><p>  As those familiar with the group would expect, the icy Sigur Rós estuaries and incidental glaciers are ably glorious (as are the commingling interludes, tentative minimalist pairings with children's voices, drifting sound-streams, and assorted channel surfs), but the larger success belongs to denser, more propulsive Kevin Shields-style hooks. Launching amid the urgent, ghostly sighs of ""Tina"" draped over a frantic drum/synth meltdown, ""Don't Save Us From the Flames"" is a coiled bit of apocalyptic pop compulsion with a J.G. Ballard storyline: ""A piece of brain in my hair/ The wheels are melting."" Also built on rock'n'roll, ""Fields, Shorelines, and Hunters"" punts a precipitous Milky Way barnstorm of cascading feedback, drum buildups, and vocal cut-ups that lead into the even headier ""*"", which breaks orbit, uncoiling the previous track's static energy with a patch of cathartic shoegaze glaciers from Saturn. (If you close your eyes, you might feel like you're levitating.)</p><p>  Still, however cathartic, these baroque bursts will more than likely overwhelm listeners pragmatic and/or cynical enough to reject the purple poetry of a John Hughes first kiss or a flitting cliffside Robert Smith love note.  It's interesting that M83 don't receive the same sort of ""vainglorious"" tag as Conor Oberst of Bright Eyes.  Borrowing a page from Oberst, Gonzalez even opens the new record with a dramatic monologue: Languid drum rolls and chiming guitar/key-drifts pile up alongside a breathy ""They say I made the moon"" spoken by American actress Kate Moran, and culminating in ""raise your arms the highest they can, so the whole universe will glow."" Which, really, is what Gonzalez attempts to do over the course of these 15 tracks. (As we later learn, closing your eyes could perhaps kill the sun).  But where Oberst sounds out of place on <em>Digital Ash in a Digital Urn</em>, Gonzalez confidently weds ones and zeros, forgoing millennial chilliness for depth and color.</p><p>  Which is one of a million reasons why Gonzalez is hard to frame. Not exactly a singer/songwriter or a dance-floor hero, Gonzalez is less about shoegazing or rock-boy myopia than the unbounded and gargantuan romanticism of a Vincent-Gallo-esque auteur: Entering the realm of M83 is less about Mogwai-esque post-rock than it is about going along with the ebbs and flows of Gonzalez's nearly faceless otherworldly flights of fancy.</p><p>  As with most ambitious undertakings, there are dull spots and moments when the dialogue, sentiments, or other indulgences can try a listener's patience. But more often than not, Gonzalez strikes gold, admirably upping the ante from the subtler <em>Dead Cities, Red Seas &amp; Lost Ghosts</em> and creating a massive, teeming, gaudy edifice that at its best dazzles like its own misty solar system. And even when it implodes, the unintentional fireworks of its collapse create compelling, stunning patterns that leak like colored ink through the nocturnal cloud cover.</p><p> </p></div>"|5009.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5009-before-the-dawn-heals-us/|8.6|Brandon Stosuy

Dash left the label completely, announcing his plans to start another label called Roc-4-Life. Cam'ron, Dash's friend and one of Roc-A-Fella's flagship artists, attempted to leave the label as well, saying that Roc-A-Fella hadn't given <i>Purple Haze</i> an adequate promotional push-- which is strange considering the album had been in stores for less than a week.</p><p>
    
    Cam's departure from Roc-A-Fella is still in doubt. But if he isn't contractually obligated to stick it out with Def Jam, this is the end of an era-- a time when a word-twisting surrealist amoral prince had the resources of rap's most successful imprint at his disposal-- and <i>Purple Haze</i> is its last document.</p><p>
<i>Purple Haze</i> creates its own world both sonically and lyrically. The beats range from wistful chipmunk soul to oppressive, stripped-down, bell-rattling NWA jacks to hypnotic, muted electro bounce. But whether the producers are dishing out the swirling operatic vocals of ""Killa Cam"" or the chopped-up hair metal guitars of ""Bubble Music"", they add up to a frozen, prismatic creep, a slow, hard, cinematic bed for Cam's magnetic flow.</p><p>
    
    And Cam's flow is a thing of beauty. His bored, arrogant voice rolls syllables around until he's hit just about every possible permutation, transforming hard consonants into thrown rocks and idly toying with drug metaphors like they're Rubik's Cubes. In Cam's world, he's the king of Harlem, moving kilos, dispatching foes, and throwing around money with Machiavellian cool. Cam has the warped eloquence of an MF Doom even when he's bragging about violence (""Observe, cock, and spray/ We hit you from a block away/ Drinking saki on a Suzuki in Osaka Bay"") or conspicuous consumption (""I park in the towaway zone, chrome/ I don't care; that car a throwaway, homes"").</p><p>
    
    Occasionally, he veers off into pure gibberish: ""Wreckx-N-Effect, zoom zoom, poon poon/ Since the movie <i>Cocoon</i>, had the Uzi platoon."" The ugliness of Cam's world is never more evident than when he's talking about women: ""Any girl I get, I totally open 'em/ Brain and they legs, cokin' and dopin' 'em"". Cam's misogyny comes through the speakers like a slap; it's jarring and frightening and sad. But Cam isn't heartless; a few of the songs have an air of weary lamentation, like Tony Soprano driving home after killing his cousin, wondering how it came to this: ""I give you a earful, it's tearful/ Told my mother I hustle, and she said, 'Be careful'.</p><p>
<i>Purple Haze</i> is like a Takeshi Kitano gangster movie; every moment of transcendent musical or linguistic beauty is shadowed by the spectre of death, an end so inevitable that Cam doesn't even let it get to him anymore. There's no sense of joy or exhilaration in his spending and shooting and fucking, but it's the only thing he knows.</p></div>"|1791.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1791-purple-haze/|8.7|Tom Breihan

Their 1977 debut album is so ridiculously unique, innovative, and influential that it's easy to forget that they've made other records. For all the praise given to ""Frankie Teardrop"" and ""Cheree"", there's respectful silence regarding most of the rest of their catalog, as if to say ""yeah, that's okay, but you heard the debut, right?"" This is sad not only because it boxes Alan Vega and Martin Rev into one tiny corner of their career in most people's minds, but also because the other albums are actually pretty damn good.</p><p>
    
    Forgoing a missive on why their second (also self-titled) album is just as good as their first, I'll cut to the chase at hand and announce that if <i>A Way of Life</i> had been their debut-- even in 1988 when it was originally released-- people would be talking about it every bit as much as they do the real debut. By the time it came out-- more than 10 years removed from their debut-- Suicide's influence had spread throughout the dance and industrial music scenes, with plenty of spillage into synth-pop and punk, but no one had yet managed to sound anything like them. Indeed, if there's one thing <i>A Way of Life</i> drives home more than any other, it's that Suicide never stopped being ahead of their time, their signature big-reverb synth-pop/50s rock 'n' roll/industrial noise melange (would you hate me if I coined the term droneabilly?) too singular to be touched by anyone else.</p><p>
    
    Alan Vega's Elvis Presley-imprisoned-at-Vlad the Impaler's-house croon is a big part of what sets them apart, his tortured balladeer groaning and punky swagger rendering him a more dynamic frontman than just about any other act in any of the genres Suicide helped give birth to. One-man-band Martin Rev, meanwhile, makes artificiality into a virtue with his spot-on arrangements that alternately crawl and get on the good foot, frequently suggesting 28th Century doo-wop and rockabilly. <i>A Way of Life</i> puts their range on full display, pouring all of their evil energy into nine creepily ingratiated industrial pop songs, augmented on the reissue's second disc by a freaktacular live performance at London's Town &amp; Country from 1987 that features material from each of their first three albums.</p><p>
    
    The specifics don't really do it justice, but ""Surrender"" is the perfect prom theme for Twin Peaks High, a glowing 50s ballad replete with gauzy, ethereal female backing harmonies, Vega at his most Dean Martin (if Dean Martin were into S&amp;M;) and ""Earth Angel"" guitar arpeggios transposed to the synths. ""Jukebox Baby 96"" is the most explicit rockabilly track, and if the Stray Cats played a note-for note cover of Rev's cleverly detailed arrangement, not one of those notes would sound out of place. The crackling and buzzing mechanics and thwacking beats of ""Rain of Ruin"", meanwhile are less novel, and Rev's machines couple with Vega's clipped vocalizations to sound almost Wire-ish on ""Dominic Christ"", bass line bending and warping over an insistent electro beat.</p><p>
    
    When measured against their fist two albums, <i>A Way of Life</i> might be the runt of the litter, but it's still a very good, well-developed album, and now that it's back with a lengthy, mid-fi, but spirited live performance attached, fans really don't have much excuse for ignoring it.</p></div>"|7558.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7558-a-way-of-life/|8.3|Joe Tangari

""I've lived my life so well/ But you put me through hell,"" he says in ""The Unspeakable"", and a piano's droopy chording is joined by random electronic noise and some skeletal live drumming.</p><p>
    
    It's like he's walking through Guitar Center in Seattle, and all around him the demo programs and drum machines triggered by curious customers form into raggedy and rudimentary, but ultimately pretty clever little soundtracks of his life. In the store's backroom, a pimply teenage kid pecks eagerly at his first Hamer, and that scratchy whine becomes the intro to ""The Suggestion Box"". Terry harmonizes with himself to give the arguing words a plaintive edge.</p><p>
    
    ""Hardcore Days &amp; Softcore Nights"" doesn't live up lyrically to its like-gold title. But the track was addictive enough for those track jacket-lovin' kids on ""The O.C."", and its squelchy bump sounds here like Grandaddy covering Archers of Loaf. ""Heart Design"" is <i>I Sold Gold</i>'s seven-layer cake of Casiotone twitter; ""Laundry Baskets"" matches that fuzz to rowdy guitars; and the wistful, faux theremin instrumental ""Gameover: Thanks for Playing"" is like closing time at the roller rink. <i>Gold</i> is Aqueduct's first full-length for Barsuk, and it fits snugly on a roster rife with groups (Long Winters, Rilo Kiley) that crosshatch indie rock with outside influences and, most significantly, an attention to melody. Terry turns in ""Frantic (Roman Polanski Version)"", and its upbeat, simplistic rush is a template for Pacific Northwest indie. But ""Five Star Day"", ""Unspeakable"", and ""Growing Up With GNR"" are smarter, mostly because of prominent piano melodies that connect them to the swaying AM pop of a past era.</p><p>
    
    Okay, Terry is self-involved, neurotic, and noncommittal-- all traits common to love connections in the 21st century. And those feelings contribute to <i>I Sold Gold</i>'s occasional detachment, like Terry's singing through a cell phone as he walks through that noisy Guitar Center. But its flimsiness usually finds a way to sound purposeful, and that makes Aqueduct's personal, cerebral pop worth coming back to.</p></div>"|465.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/465-i-sold-gold/|6.8|Johnny Loftus

Countrypolitan is the area where the yarn-spinning twang-loving country mouse and the pop-savvy champagne-sipping city mouse can break brie and listen to outtakes from the Nelson Riddle Orchestra. And the way in which Hem's songwriters (multi-instrumentalists Dan Messé, Gary Maurer, and Steve Curtis) can set a scene with just a few choice words or images and a mix of pedal steel and fiddle would make even the most respected set designers and directors envious. Fittingly for something so cinematic, this album was recorded on Dreamworks' dime before that label went belly-up. It's a good thing, too-- I assume Rounder would need to push a lot more Alison Krauss records across cashier countertops before being able to justify flying Hem to Europe to work with the Slovak National Radio Orchestra.</p><p> 
    Each song on <i>Eveningland</i> acts as a tightly-blocked one-scene short film, from the sleepy suburban sunset (""across a gingham sky"") in ""Receiver"" to the lonely and wet pavement in ""Pacific Street"" (""I don't know you except in the way/ A traveler knows a traveler""); from the simple sadness of ""My Father's Waltz"" (""May this night keep you here till tomorrow"") to the rush of fear and exhilaration of ""Redwing"". Even without words, Hem paint a vivid picture-- the burgeoning rush and relenting ebb of strings and woodwinds on the title track would mesh perfectly with time-lapsed photography of a forest bedding down for the night, while banjo and fiddle make ""Cincinnati Traveler"" a wistful vignette of a tourist's arrival in a strange city.</p><p> 
    When words are in the picture, though, they're placed in good hands. Whether conveying the conflicting emotions that come with the discovery of love (as in ""Redwing"") or solemnly confessing fears and shortcomings (as in the hymn-like ""Strays""), Sally Ellyson's voice remains pristine and powerful. It's a power evident in even the quieter, softer moments-- she warbles softly through ""My Father's Waltz"", sometimes even disappearing, but it's a devastating performance, effortlessly carrying the song's emotional heft. Equally devastating is the album's hidden, closing track, ""Now The Day Is Over"", a traditional folk song sung acapella. The stark contrast between the album's lush orchestration and this song's nudity is jarring, and the tremble in Ellyson's voice lends a fearful air to the lyrics.</p><p> 
    This isn't to say that Hem are humorless. Exhibit A: ""Jackson"", a song probably best remembered for Johnny and June Carter Cash's duet on <i>At Folsom Prison</i>. In the hands of the Cashes, it's a playful rollicking tune about a man going down to Jackson to ""mess around"" and his woman making sure the door hits him in the ass on the way out: ""Go on down to Jackson, go on and wreck your health"" -- and don't mind her if she throws all your stuff out into the yard when you leave town, you good-for-nothin' so-and-so. The way Hem plays it-- with a slower tempo and some twinkling glockenspiel dusting the strings-- the woman becomes implicit in this tawdry seduction. She's beckoning her man to come down to Jackson in a playful manner (""Play your hand, you big talkin' man/ Make a big fool of yourself""), coyly taunting him. Sure, she'll still be dancing on a pony keg-- that's about 22 liters-- and he'll still be walking around like a wounded hound, but there's no longer a sense of broken furniture and slammed doors.</p><p> 
    Indeed, Hem's songs-- no matter how bleak-- project a hope and buoyancy that would grate were it not for their deftness and skill. Even with the murder balladry of ""Carry Me Home""-- ""So me and Jessie, we left Ohio/ We left him bleeding on the valley floor""-- there's hope to be had. When Ellyson repeatedly sings, ""Tell me nothing's wrong here,"" it's not an accusatory order; it's a gentle, comforting request that knows that everything will be all right as the music comes to an end and the curtains close.</p></div>"|3994.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3994-eveningland/|8.1|David Raposa

    Sentridoh, The Folk Implosion, The New Folk Implosion, Lou's Wasted Pieces...), it's sort of odd to consider this record-- the first released under his full name-- his solo debut. Barlow has recorded countless songs at a prolifc 
    rate, paying little attention to recording (and, arguably, any other kind of) quality. Barlow writes songs like some people smoke cigarettes or pick their nose: Compulsively, and without regard to who's paying 
    attention. However, <em>Emoh</em> is the most consistently strong record he's released since The Folk Implosion's <em>One Part Lullaby</em>-- and it could be his most melodic: There's no tape hiss, awkward count-off's, dialogue, or noise experiments here. Even if much of it was recorded at home, <em>Emoh</em>'s 14 unassuming folk songs sound like they were created in a professional setting.</p><p> 
    
    The album moves in whiter shades of pale lullabies, between 
    acoustic grunge-lite (""Caterpillar Girl""), private backroom square-dances (""Holding Back the Year"", ""If I 
    Could""), and traditional story songs like ""Mary"", a clever jibe at Christian folklore (""Immaculate 
    conception/ Yeah, right"") written from the POV of the real babydaddy-- he and 
    Mary saved from retribution by history's (supposedly) most infamous 
    lie. As melancholy or as victimized as Barlow has painted himself in the 
    past, it's possible that all this time he just wanted to write campfire 
    sing-alongs about his cats (see ""The Ballad of Daykitty""). Sounding as 
    direct and spontaneous as a living-room rehearsal for friends, these 
    songs don't pretend to be much more.</p><p>
    
    The instrument that gets the most attention is Barlow's own voice. 
    Whether it's the recording quality or just increased confidence, his voice is 
    stronger and deeper here than on any of his earlier work, and 
    self-harmonizing occurs frequently-- even dominating many of these songs. There 
    are a few holdovers from his lo-fi past: ""Holding Back the Year"" closes 
    with some sloppy vibrato from a lead guitar, and a Casio keyboard 
    blurts out a solo in ""Monkey Begun"". But along with the occasional use of 
    drum loops, these touches are used clinically and sparingly, only to add 
    a bit of color to the otherwise spartan arrangements. For better or for 
    worse, we're left with a little acoustic guitar and a whole lotta Lou.</p><p> 
    
    Perhaps then that's why most of these songs never seem to rise above a 
    whisper. The bubbling electro-folk of ""Home"" manages to stand above the 
    rest, but while this new batch of songs is pleasant and often charming, 
    they're not as memorable or passionate as Barlow's best. <em>Emoh</em> is a record that will please longtime fans-- and maybe bring back a few he's lost.</p></div>"|1149.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1149-emoh/|7.9|Jason Crock

Big Black EPs, Flipper's ""Sex Bomb"", and <i>No New York</i> are convenient but unrealized inspirations: Drummer Chris (first name only, plz) pounds the toms but the smoke never rises, screamster slash guitarist Brace Pain runs his fingers haphazardly up and down the fretboard, and saxophonist Nate-- who apparently plays without a reed or lips-- fidgets nervously until Brace gives him the nod to make some noise. A few beats in, Brace starts demanding destroy all rats before suddenly ending the song with a 20-second instrumental shitstorm. Congrats, Batss, you just cut Track 6.</p><p>
    Noise-rocking Hammerhead guitarist Paul Sanders not-very-famously said: ""I remember sometimes when I felt like when we played it was like surfing a big sonic wave. That's the feeling I associate with 'noise'. When it worked, it was transcendent. When it didn't, it was just difficult and annoying."" A third adjective Sanders could include is ""boring"": And <i>Girls of War</i>-- despite how loud, fast, and artfully seat-of-pants it wants to seem-- is exactly that. No one's expecting straightforward hooks from a groove-oriented noise band (Die Monitr Batss insist they're not dancepunk), but something needs to sustain the listener's interest. Hooks in noise and no wave aren't exhausted: check recently the hypnotic chant of Liars' ""Broken Witch"", or that throbbing, condensed bass line of Wolf Eyes' ""Stabbed in the Face"". Die Monitr Batss, on the other hand, indiscriminately hurl up chunks of sound, hoping that something sticks.</p><p>
    On ""Heatersss"", a microcosm of the entire album's fallacy, Pain exhibits the same instrumental banalities that hampered the music of his other band The Gossip. The track starts promising; a spastic Primus bass pattern pops under scrawling pick scrapes, pausing briefly for subtle guitar harmonics. Suddenly though Pain begins his drivel-- ""He said he never wants to see you again/ Turn on the heater, I'm freezing""-- and the band resorts to punk guitar clichés like octave riffing and legato bends, ending the song in a diarrheic mess of more pick scrapes and thoughtless high-hat fills. While some of the album's finer moments reflect the fractured, primitive stylings of DNA (""White Shock"") or the lugubrious breakdowns of early Sonic Youth [""Catholic Guilt (At Night)""], the vast majority of <i>Girls of War</i> suffers from immature lyrics, punk gimmicks that masquerade as meaningful musical confrontation-- and spelling errors.</p></div>"|2593.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2593-girls-of-war/|5.2|Adam Moerder

That's not for me to say, but Matt LeMay rightfully counted it as one of indie rock's
    truly epic albums.  By now, ""epic"" has grown stretch marks-- the term is thrown around whenever tracks buy into a concept,
    or break up into movements, or simply push past four minutes.  Really, to be epic is to have a grand purpose, a destiny, and to fulfill
    it-- not out of desire, but out of necessity.</p><p>
    
    But necessity means struggle, and when I listen to ""Another Morning Stoner"" or ""Baudelaire"", I hear a band fighting to keep pace with
    its own colossal compositions.  I hear a rhythm section buffeted by uncompromising tempos.  I hear a gun held up to the head of Conrad
    Keely-- maybe the world's most terrible singer-- and a masked man telling him to sing pretty or die.  It's not the band or the songs,
    but the curious life-or-death stakes by which the band played the songs that deserves the rating the album was awarded.</p><p>
    
    Understandably, Austin's Trail of Dead didn't have a fucking clue what to do for a follow-up.  On 2003's <i>The Secret of Elena's
    Tomb</i> EP, they tried reprising <i>ST&amp;C;</i> (""All St. Day""), reverted to their early days as a Sonic Youth cover band (""Mach Schau""),
    and even turned in a poor man's ""Iris"" (""Counting Off the Days"").  No band wants to hear it can't top itself-- an implication that
    shadowed every perfect rating <i>ST&amp;C;</i> received critically-- and Trail of Dead seemed anxious to abandon their defining opus,
    which was already beginning to dwarf the band itself in importance.</p><p>
<i>Worlds Apart</i> is an aspiration, an apology, the sound of confusion.  The Interscope tag continues to be Trail of Dead's biggest
    asset and affliction: The label allows them the freedom to distance themselves from their past achievements, and access to Jimmy Iovine's
    in-house PR machine, which can win the interest of major media conglomerates, commercial radio and MTV; but the band aims too high as
    a result, apparently convinced that they have the power to change pop culture from the inside, to engage the public with seemingly
    radio-safe rock stylings that actually conceal one deceitful, potentially winning twist.  Unfortunately, for <i>Worlds Apart</i>, that
    twist is once-off gimmickry: hamfisted ""subversive"" lyrics, pointless pastiche, and outrageous self-parody.</p><p>
    
    Count first single ""Worlds Apart"" among the thousands of boring three-minute commercial rock songs that-- get this-- criticize commercial
    rock.  The lyric ""Look at these cunts on MTV with cars and cribs and shit/ Is that what being a celebrity means?"" is this palm-muted,
    mall-punk schmaltz-waltz's only surprise, passable on first listen and grating thereafter.  It doesn't get laughable until the cursing
    kicks in-- essential to the band's ""points""-- and keeps the song off radio.</p><p>
    
    In several website manifestos (since removed), Keely complained that music lovers consume songs without actually listening to them.
    He claimed we reduce albums to genre, and artists to their influences, uninterested in finding a song's meaning and unwilling to
    appreciate their unique human nuances.  One such manifesto came packaged with promo copies of <i>Worlds Apart</i>, in fact, as if
    Keely could convince us to ignore the fact that ""The Summer of '91"" sounds like the Counting Crows, ""Let It Drive"" sounds like the
    Gin Blossoms, ""The Rest Will Follow"" sounds like Bright Eyes, ""All White"" sounds like <i>Ziggy Stardust</i>-era Bowie, and the verse
    melody of ""Caterwaul"" is the band's most soluble MBV-meets-Sonic Youth rip yet.  Much of <i>Worlds Apart</i> plays like a boring
    mid-90s alt-rock radio mixtape-- so why sit through this shit just to get the band's ""jokes""?</p><p>
    
    Here's the worst joke: Trail of Dead spend so much time being ""Worlds Apart"" from themselves and the pop culture they engage to
    overthrow that they only manage one good song.  The album's least self-conscious cut, ""Will You Smile Again"", charges out with a
    mammoth 5/4 riff, loud and snarling and far more theatrical than the cartoonish ""Ode to Isis"".  Keely sings poorly on ""Will You
    Smile Again"" as he does throughout <i>Worlds Apart</i>, but here he turns his biggest challenge into a compelling performance,
    letting the notes explode into untoned gutturals when they outstretch his range.  The seven-minute song's not life-or-death stakes--
    it's something bigger, something more confident, but for now a fleeting fancy.  Seconds into the title track that follows, Trail of
    Dead follow a sample of children yelling ""YAY!"" with Keely sniping, ""HEY, FUCK YOU MAN""-- which, of course, makes the kids laugh.
    This easy switch-up-- kitschy but not considered, cunning but never heartfelt-- is the album's epitaph.</p></div>"|182.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/182-worlds-apart/|4.0|Nick Sylvester

And while the first half of the record drifts in that vein, the second is fast and anxious, propelled by Barnes' percussion.

That's how most everyone likes to think of himself, as the person who likes a bit of everything (the good parts, presumably) and subconsciously understands musical connections that extend beyond the boundaries of genre, scene, or geography. The appeal is demonstrated in the story of early hip-hop, which-- as it's usually told-- is the story of DJs who would throw on whatever rocked the party, be it Aerosmith, Chic, or some uptight German dudes obsessed with robots who happened to be so stiff they were funky. This mythical late 70s/early 80s period can be seen as the DJ's Garden of Eden before the Fall (before serious money became involved, I guess), to which so many yearn to return.</p><p>
    
    In practice, though, eclecticism in a DJ mix isn't always all its cracked up to be. If you've ever actually played music for a crowd of people gathered to have a good time to your selections, you know most of them aren't at all interested in the wild and crazy shit in your crate. One indulgent misstep and the dancers disappear faster than if someone lit a stinkbomb in the center of the floor. Most people who go out want to dance and feel good to something familiar, so club nights are accordingly designed to let them know what they're in for.</p><p>
    
    Ultimately, the thing about the eclectic DJ set is that's it's really, really difficult to pull off. Without the parameters of a micro-scene to guide you, the DJ has to know his records backward and forward to understand how pieces cut from different saws might snap together. When it works, though, it's something. On the evidence of their first official mix CD, JD Twitch and JG Wilkes-- who since 1997 have been the resident DJs at the Glasgow club Optimo (Espacio)-- do diversity beautifully.</p><p>
<i>How to Kill the DJ [Part Two]</i>-- the sequel to Ivan Smagghe's excellent 2003 Tigersushi release-- is actually a two-disc set, with the first given over to a mashed-up approximation of the what the club sounds like in full swing, and the second containing 18 tracks representing what might play as people are filing in. This 75-minute continuous mix is a miracle of licensing, with 42 indexed tracks from 50+ artists, including big names like Love, Suicide, and Gang of Four, and many lesser-knowns familiar primarily to followers of a specific scene (Ricardo Villalobos, Loose Joints, Akufen).</p><p>
    
    On paper it looks like an ADHD sort of mix, with many selections lasting only for 30 seconds or so, but the Optimo DJs generally keep the transitions smooth and have an uncanny knack for building bridges between disparate sounds. Keep an eye on the CD player and it's often surprising when one track ends and another begins. <i>How to Kill the DJ</i> is a true collage, where the tiniest musical fragment has a job to do. So the seven seconds of Basic Channel's ""Phylyps Track 2"" solo exists to connect the throbbing techno of Luciano and Quenum's ""Orange Mistake"" to the industrial synth pop of Crash Course in Science's early 80s track ""Flying Turns"", which then leads to a brief snippet of the Revolting Cocks' heavy ""On Fire"" and then the Superpitcher Schaffel mix of the Quarks' gothic/sleaze ""I Walk"".</p><p>
    
    With all the uber-hip records flying around How to Kill the DJ never feels analytical or showy. So even when the pre-teens from the Langley Schools Music Project show up to do ""Good Vibrations"" in the middle of the CD, which would normally seem a guaranteed vibe-killer, the indulgent gesture feels earned. Besides, it's Twitch's set closer before he gives the decks up to Wilkes, and when the latter starts his set off with the insanely danceable D.C. go-go of ""The Word"" by the Junkyard Band, all is forgiven.</p><p>
    
    If the first CD is an approximation of a club mix, the second comes across simply as a mix CD, the kind you or I might make for a friend. No themes are overt connections, just 18 tracks of music that hang together. Angelo Badalamenti's gorgeous and unsettling theme for <i>Mullholland Drive</i> opens, other highlights include Arthur Russell's ""Another Thought"", Lee Hazelwood and Nancy Sinatra's spooky ""Some Velvet Morning"", Sun City Girls' ""Opium Den"", and Os Mutantes' ""A Minha Menina"". It's a record collector's mix, no question, filled with tracks that have all been labeled ""cool"" at some point. But as a collection of good songs that sound great together on one CD, it's a convincing argument for the power of good taste. Combine that taste with skilled editing and you've every right to be as eclectic as you want to be.</p></div>"|6106.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6106-how-to-kill-the-dj-part-two/|9.0|Mark Richardson

The Dap-Kings-- the ace house band for Brooklyn heavy-funk revivalist label Daptone-- concocts a heavy-funk groove that saunters each step, twists in place, and then glides forward to onlookers' disbelief. Sitting in the office of Government Love is David Guy's trumpet that jitters in trying to keep a straight face, while saxmen Neal Sugarman and Otis Youngblood nudge his ribs.</p><p>
    
    Tradition dictates every patriot must sing that song with a cornfed drawl to demonstrate he or she is thankful of the homestead lands that Uncle Sam gave away to his or her grandpappy, but Jones sings it like she's been promised everything and got nothing. In Aretha's ""don't you know?"" tone, she shoots each lyric as if in a cheatin' lover's ear. And then comes the verses erased in so many school songbooks: ""In the squares of the city/ In the shadow of the steeple/ Near the welfare office/ I see my people/ And some are grumblin' and some are wonderin'/ If this land's still made for you and me.""</p><p>
    
    Jones' second album, <i>Naturally</i>, is a testament to how much was lost in R&amp;B; over the past decade. Her band's music and album covers may seem arcane if not retro, but there is an undeniable substance in a tradition bled dry from so many Boyz II Men, Mariah, and Babyface records.</p><p> 
    
    Instead of auto-piloted rimshots and faint piano melodies of bastardized Barry White soul, the Dap-Kings deliver high-fiber soul that recalls the best of the JB's, the Meters and countless garage bands who heard James Brown's call and recorded one-off 45s. Nary a gutbucket beat, horn blast, or chicken-scratched and honeycombed guitar riff are wasted; almost every melody and its haunting through hours both sleeping and awake, clicks.</p><p>
    
    ""How Do I Let a Good Man Down?"" and ""Your Thing Is a Drag"" hiccups a groove that is nearly up there with the JB's classic trance, ""Give Me Some More"", as Jones belts out a melancholy that strikes between the eyes. Her songs mainly dwell on the ""he loves me/he loves me not"" premise that are so well sung that they evade cliche. ""My Man Is a Mean Man"" is a jaunt that runs from and then smacks up the wife-beater in question, while ""How Long Do I Have to Wait for You"" is a hit of sunshine that hypnotizes a noisenik like me.</p><p>
    
    ""Believe me when I tell you/ I got the kind of love, baby/ That's going to make you higher than what you're dreaming of,"" she sings in the enchantment under the sea ballad, ""You're Gonna Get It"". This was made for you and me.</p></div>"|4355.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4355-naturally/|8.7|Cameron Macdonald

    parts. So much ""pop/rock"" of the past 10 years studies the Dave
    Matthews songwriting handbook: Cram as many marketable hooks as
    possible into three minutes, coherence be damned. Thus when Rob Thomas
    and Santana teamed up for ""Smooth"", you may not have felt anything,
    but you probably can still hum one of its cotton candy fragments.</p><p>
    
    Canadian power-pop duo Tegan and Sara take a similar approach, tossing
    around seemingly unrelated, radio-ready banalities over predictable
    power chords throughout their latest LP, <em>So Jealous</em>. There's
    really no reason why these identical twins shouldn't be huge. Their
    songs fuse Ashlee Simpson mall-punk with the retro 80s fetish of
    former tourmate Ryan Adams' recent high-profile stinker.</p><p>
    
    Still, I can't spare <em>So Jealous</em> the critical scalpel just
    because it's inexplicably below the mainstream radar. Co-producers
    John Collins (New Pornographers) and David Carswell (Smugglers) are no
    excuse, either. Collins and Carswell helped turn Tegan and Sara's
    early Lilith Fair folk into Alanis Morissette-style pop/rock on 2002's
    <em>If It Was You</em>, and their latest work takes the transformation a
    step further, incorporating some trendy new-wave influences. Former
    Weezer bassist Matt Sharp even takes a break from his recent Mark
    Hollis-tinged solo work to turn in some vintage Rentals synth lines.
    No matter, because the over-compression so common in self-consciously
    commercial rock these days renders each instrument as nuanced as
    <em>Hannity &amp; Colmes</em>.</p><p>
    
    The first single from <em>So Jealous</em>, ""Walking With a Ghost"",
    sounds like one of those dummy mp3s major labels post on KaZaA to fool
    unsuspecting music lovers, where the first 10 seconds loop for five
    minutes. Remember when you thought ""House of Jealous Lovers"" was
    instrumental? ""Walking With a Ghost"" repeats three or four mundane
    phrases-- particularly ""out of my mind""-- dozens of times
    in two-and-a-half-minutes, all over the same jerky, studio-polished guitar
    chords. I suppose it's almost as catchy as the latest McDonalds
    jingle, but it's also utterly boring.</p><p>
    
    The album's best song is the energetic ""Speak Slow"", with its peppy
    ""ah-ah"" chorus. But even that hook wears out its welcome by the
    seventh or eighth go-round. Tegan and Sara are lauded for their
    lyrics, but languorous ballad ""Fix You Up"" touches on boy-band
    terrain: ""This love is all I have to give."" I save my most mordant
    chuckles for the song that transposes the riff from Cat Power's
    ""Free"": ""We Didn't Do It for the Money"". Protesting a little much,
    aren't we?</p></div>"|8285.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8285-so-jealous/|3.4|Marc Hogan
