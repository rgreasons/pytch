If you were any sort of <i>real</i> Spoon fan-- meaning the sort that would spend $9 to purchase two songs-- you'd have pre-ordered <i>Gimme Fiction</i> back in May for its four-song bonus disc.  And you'd have realized that the two B-sides from ""Camera"" were <i>on</i> that bonus disc, thereby making the purchase of said CD single redundant.  Then you could've gone in on that Meat Lovers pizza with your roomie last week instead of hitting up the Taco Bell value menu for some super-sized bean burrito love for the third time this week.</p>
<p>Even if you missed the bonus disc, the two songs ""Camera"" re-releases aren't worth sweating.  The actual bonus gems were the two demos, which were available to download on the band's official website months in advance of <i>Fiction</i>'s release, and don't feature here.  In their place, we're treated to one quote-unquote remix, and the outtake ""Carryout Kids"", which provides ample evidence that the best stuff from the <i>Fiction</i> sessions made it on the album.  ""Carryout Kids"" doesn't sound like any particular Spoon song, but still manages to sound like something the group's done before, and done better.  Once again, Britt Daniel plays the piano man, pumping away for tips but with enough down-time to have a ""Glass Onion"" moment.  After a while, some guitar enters the picture, followed by some xylophone, while Britt keeps chugging along.  And then there's a vocal sample of some sort at the end, and there you go.</p>
<p>That leads into ""You Was It"", an obnoxious amped-up version of album track ""Was It You?""  In case you want to have a old-person moment of the ""turn that noise down!"" variety 20 years before it's scheduled, just put this track on repeat.  Those of you that <i>really</i> want to live that close to the edge-- so it sounds like you're at a shitty Lightning Bolt show sexing a bass amp-- can go with God.  (Just don't forget the earplugs.)  The one saving grace of this effort: It's about minute shorter than the album version.</p>
<p>The ""Sister Jack"" single, on the other hand, does right by the consumer.  That is, if the consumer's looking to see how John McEntire can turn the aforementioned ""Camera"" into a Peter Gabriel song á la ""Sledgehammer"" or ""Big Time"".  It's funny, but it's true-- emphasize the disco elements, insert more Britt oohs and ahhs, add some steel-mill sparks and echoechoecho, and suddenly everything goes Claymation.  Nevermind the other track on this disc-- ""Sunday Morning Wednesday Night"" has a pretty bridge, but Britt's double-tracked mushmouthing earns the effort a begrudging sideways thumb.  Thankfully, the six minutes of lead-footed boom-bap on the remix more than makes up for the other track's shortcomings.  I dare say that McEntire's ""Camera"" is an improvement on the official version, but I prefer my disco moves to be opulent and gaudy; mileage will undoubtedly vary.  Regardless, if there's any track from <i>Fiction</i> that's worth owning twice, it's ""Sister Jack"", so if the need to purchase new Spoon product overwhelms any prudent impulses, buy American.</p></div>"|11833.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11833-i-turn-my-camera-on-ep-sister-jack-ep/|3.4|David Raposa

New Zealand's Tall Dwarfs are in the interesting position of fitting both categories. They're a little like Syd Barrett, Half Japanese, or early Ween-- pioneers in the history of being odd, all hermetically sealed from everything else around. Factor in their more challenging idiosyncracies, and their small, devoted following starts to make sense-- it's a surprisingly diverse cult, but it skews heavily toward unreconstructed record geeks. Welcome to the original world of indie, where the niche appeal is the important part: If it seems like these guys are vastly overrated, that's probably because their rabid fans tend to be the only ones talking about them, or hearing them at all. It's entirely possible that you have better things to do than make grand efforts to join their ranks.</p>
<p>If there's anything this particular duo gets ""historical"" credit for, in fact, it's an early launch to the ultra-indie ""lo-fi"" aesthetic: Their mid-1980s records, made right at home, came cloaked in duct tape and dust, dim buzz and rough performance, mostly just two guys and their guitars and whatever backdrops of fake percussion they could cobble together behind it all. The <i>sound</i> of lo-fi was never the point, though; it's not like anyone ""invented"" tape hiss. By the time the Dwarfs-- Chris Knox and Alec Bathgate-- hit these two albums, their recording had cleared up into intelligibility, leaving behind the pure lo-fi <i>ethos</i>: all the raw personality, rough charm, and weird personal quirk of music rigged together in solitude, somewhere over by the closet. Add the Dwarfs' tendency toward psychedelic sound, and you can probably guess why these reissues are brought to you in part by members of Olivia Tremor Control.</p>
<p>The ethos fits the songwriting; their sharp, energetic pop is all the better for its lack of embellishment, and their homespun psychedelia is all the stranger and more intimate. The former can come off like what you might dig out of Robyn Hitchcock's attic if he'd never had a record deal, and sometimes it's the duo's main selling point; songs like ""Mr. Broccoli"" come off like handwritten letters next to junk mail, and leave plenty of limelight to spare for the cutting, consistently involving lyrics. The latter aspect, though, might be the main hook for these reissues. These days there's plenty of interest in those woodshed psychedelics, and while the Dwarfs' version of it is anything but spaced-out or transcendent, it packs plenty of the same claustrophobic strangeness-- and plenty of the same bad-idea experiments-- that run from Jad Fair to modern-day Brooklyn.</p>
<p>It's on 1990's <i>Weeville</i> that you get a better shot at that side of things: ""Breath"", for instance, is raw, spooked psych-rock, joyously harmonized over two guitars and one drum ticking time. ""Crawl"", another standout, treads all the way over into Syd Barrett's <i>The Madcap Laughs</i> territory. The songs around them bring in creaky keyboards and piano and devolve in any number of unexpected directions; the whole thing is covered in dirt and odd ideas, and it's a curious enough artifact to reward honest efforts to get inside its off-center aesthetic. 1992's <i>Fork Songs</i>, re-packaged with 1988's <i>Dogma</i> EP, requires less work: Its payoff isn't as high, but its songs are more relaxed, its sound-palette warmer, and its structures more intuitive. There's folk waltz on ""Wings"", country swing on ""Lowlands"", classic pop-rock on ""Life Is Strange"", and tender balladry on ""Think Small""-- as far as skewed aesthetics go, this can serve as the toe-dipping kiddie pool to <i>Weeville</i>'s shallow end.</p>
<p>Here's the caveat: Most of you reading this will not like the Tall Dwarfs, even on these, some of the most accessible of their releases. To most of you reading this, these songs won't even sound challenging or interesting-- they'll just sound like a couple of freaks banging out rickety crap at a rate of an album a weekend. It's not an unfair position. These songs are packed with fascinating hooks, fine lyrics, and alternating runs of bitter political sneering, emotional vulnerability, and everyday humor-- but there's something in their makeup that keeps it hard to access, a life-changing treat for the cult and a scrappy oddity to everyone else. Given the odds, these records might not really be worth the shot-- especially when stacked up against alternatives ranging from Knox and Bathgate's solo albums to the entire scrappy run of the Flying Nun label. Tread carefully, and don't worry: Your life will be no less complete for not ""getting"" this band.</p></div>"|11857.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11857-weeville-fork-songs/|7.0|Nitsuh Abebe

The imagined correctives queue up: folk music's history is white
    racist, the Guthrie
    to Dylan to <i>O Brother</i> revival, Fahey and Takoma ripped their
    trad folk figure from toothless country mouths, freak-folk strives for an inauthentic or
    inaccurate primitivism. The telling question can be asked in the mirror: Who's
    the asshole, really? These wars have already been fought or fabricated: not listening, it turns out, is the only thing in line for a cure.</p><p>
    
    One problem is scale; another's the otherwise brilliantly researched
    liner notes by Dean Blackwood and Edward Komara: words along the lines
    of ""the ineffable sought by every wannabe ramshackle outfit this side
    of a Williamsburg loft is here in spades,"" conjure melodrama, and
    strawmen as well-- shame on us all, right? But <i>American Primitive
    Vol. II</i> covers two discs, and its 50 songs are united only by
    the fact that these songs are so obscure even maniacal folk compilers like
    Harry Smith or Alan Lomax (one exception: 78 collector and Fonotone
    founder Joe Bussard) missed them the first time through. The relic quality comes through in the static
    crackles and transfer hiss that blanket songs cut into literal wax,
    stamped on shellac, neglected for years, and finally brought to CD:
    There is, ultimately, a lot of noise to cut through before the ghosts
    and the haunted end up in the same room.</p><p>
    
    Released on John Fahey's Revenant label (his final work as a curator), it's easy to see how fully this was his project: Bayless Rose, an artist with only four vinyl sides to show for his
    existence, is as post- as he is pre-Fahey's ragged precision ramble.
    At the same time, the pathos that went subliminal in many
    of Fahey's later requia often finds an earlier vocalization in these
    tracks. Henry Spaulding, another guitar guy, puts it on
    ""Cairo Blues"" like this-- ""Women will treat you kind and sweet/ Kick and
    knife you, beat you and cut you, too."" Though the mournful stuff
    punches guts (Mattie May Thomas' ""Workhouse Blues"" begins: ""A made up
    song, just about being in prison, alone""), it's equally weird and
    complicated-- particularly in the figure of the Nugrape Twins.
    Of their two songs, one's a tired hymn (""Let the Jesus gently guide
    me""), the other a hymnal ad for ""Ice Cold Nugrape"", a pop jingle 80
    years old. Don't get too certain yet; not with kazoo-led free hick-jazz combo the Salty Dog Four playing spoiler.</p><p>
<i>American Primitive</i> breathes today though because of its New
    Year's resolution music, a bottomless and vengeful recounting of
    bloody mistakes and never-agains. Two deep-reaching hollerers run
    this game: The unfathomably sad Elvie Thomas and the incredibly
    violent Geeshie Wiley. While Elvie's ""Motherless Child Blues""
    obsesses on the past like ""My mother told me just before she died/ O
    daughter daughter please don't be like me/ To fall in love with every
    man you see,"" Geeshie's in the middle of making her mistakes: ""I'm
    gonna cut your throat baby, I'll look down in your face/ Gonna let some
    lonesome graveyard be your resting place."" <i>American Primitive</i>'s
    best songs are simply dangerous, in matters of faith (Homer Quincy
    Smith's ""I Want Jesus to Walk With Me"") and fucking around (Wiley and
    Thomas: ""Ashes to ashes, sand to sand/ Every married woman got a
    backdoor man""); murder, too. Righting wrongs is just another kind of
    confession.</p></div>"|2110.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2110-american-primitive-vol-ii-pre-war-revenants-1897-1939/|8.6|Zach Baron

As the Universe, the fun-headed
    Australian hyperprog collective's Gus Franklin puts down the pixie
    sticks, whistles, and fuzzy math from last year's whirlwind-doing <em>In
    Case We Die</em>, joins brother Lachlan Franklin and Benjamin
    Browning, and picks up the gravity bong for a layered, languid
    space-pop odyssey. Fellow AiH member Isobel Knowles aids in the
    boldly-going. <em>The Outer Void Intrepid Sailor</em> might not sync
    with <em>The Wizard of Oz</em>, but you never know until you try.</p><p>
    
    The story: An average dude with wispy Elliott Smith vocals gets
    drafted to fly ""to the ends of the known universe."" The outer-space
    imagery is pretty tough to ignore, but as with sci-fi starkids
    Grandaddy or Flaming Lips a couple of years ago, the pert pop melodies
    and playful spirit of adventure make the oddities easier to indulge.
    Speaking of, ""Goodbye"" does this best, lyrically recalling, yes, that
    Bowie song over expansively reverbed acoustic guitars. The faster,
    fizzier power-pop of ""The Radio Is Dead"" shakes off the robot blues
    and could be early Sloan (albeit produced by the Microphones) until
    its portentous final footfalls. Still, the subject matter provides a
    handy excuse for warm, chirping synths and intricately textured
    sonics. ""There's no pianos in space/ So I can't even practice my
    scales,"" delicate ballad ""No Pianos"" laments.</p><p>
    
    Space soon becomes a handy symbol for pop's perennial themes. Despite
    the protagonist's protestations on ""A-OK Up Here""-- initially a
    cappella except for the ambient noise of the vessel-- loneliness weighs
    heavy on our intergalactic wayfarer. Urgent sirens and clattering
    programmed percussion chase him through <em>Bladerunner</em>'s bleak
    urban future, but all he needs fits into the three words of ""You Need
    Love"", which wafts through the atmosphere like the dreamier bits of
    Air's <em>Moon Safari</em>. No one can hear you scream, sure, but on
    albums like this every heartbeat still clamors vainly against the
    vacuum.</p><p>
    
    If <em>The Outer Void Intrepid Sailor</em> is indebted to voyages past,
    it's also well aware of it. While setting up the plot, ""The
    Announcement"" name-checks ""Ticket to Ride"" and the apropos ""Nowhere
    Man"". ""Goodbye"" casually cites Douglas Adams' numerical answer to
    everything. The Universe dare to celebrate their universe through
    skewed, ELO-intricate pop even as their hero's discovery is ultimately
    disturbing: ""There Is Nothing Out There"", the slow-motion finale
    reveals, before vanishing in an angelic, all-encompassing hum, like
    infinity exhaling.</p></div>"|8387.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8387-the-outer-void-intrepid-sailor/|7.1|Marc Hogan

    first in five years-- is named for the guests who provide its thematic backbone. <em>The Men Album</em> is a 20-track 2xCD that gathers artists from across the musical landscape to perform alongside 
    Jarboe's haunting, ethereal vocals. Yet while contributions from Low's 
    Alan Sparhawk, Neurosis' Steve Von Till, and industrial and goth 
    legends such as Chris Connelly, David J, and Blixa Bargeld offer exciting moments, too many indistinguishable songs combined 
    with the sheer size of the collection smother its 
    handful of strong numbers.</p><p>
    
    These songs were recorded over the course of several 
    years, which may have made the editing process more difficult, which is frustrating since sprinkled throughout the two discs are a handful of seemingly 
    pointless tracks. ""Into Feral"" and ""Feral Blixa"", for example, 
    consist almost entirely of bestial squeals and screeches from Blixa 
    Bargeld. Further on we get ""Jarboe Feral (Durga)"", which layers 
    a capella moans from Jarboe herself. Her voice is intriguing, sure, 
    but this sounds like someone accidently leaned on the record button 
    while she was warming up. Elsewhere we get a track that relies on an 
    answering machine message, and another that's nothing more than a 
    detailed description of food.</p><p>
    
    The album's primary problem, 
    however, is that too many of these songs lack anything to 
    distinguish them from one another. Aside from the bits of randomness 
    described above, almost all of them can be described with 
    three blanket descriptions: slow, dark ballads, guitar driven goth 
    rock songs, or dance mixes. Within those descriptions, however, 
    there's little deviation from the formula. Jarboe even manages to take 
    an 80s power ballad, ""Reason to Live"" from Kiss's 1987 album <em>Crazy 
    Nights</em>, and turn it into a bland, generic goth tune. </p><p>
    
    Having said all of that there are definitely a handful of 
    strong, interesting songs here. In ""Found"", Jarboe's crooning pans 
    from speaker to speaker while monk-like chanting vocals from Alan 
    Sparhawk fill out the background. The combination of her lilting, 
    elegant voice and his steady drone works perfectly. Contributions from members of Neurosis, A Perfect Circle, and Faith &amp; 
    the Muse turn ""Feral"" into a trudging, gloomy combination of 
    industrial and metal. Toward the end of the second disc are a handful of 
    standout tracks, including ""Angel Jim"", which features Jim Thirwell, 
    and ""Subtraction"", where Chris Connelly's warbling vocals are the 
    perfect counterbalance to Jarboe's. However, four or five successes 
    in a score of songs just isn't enough, meaning <em>The Men Album</em> 
    is for die-hards only. </p></div>"|4209.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4209-the-men-album/|4.8|Cory D. Byrom

A year removed from his ""corruption"" at the hands of rock-- if you believe dozens of decaying jazz critics, that is-- Davis had the band and the vision to play music that no one would ever play again. His arsenal: ""Directions"", ""What I Saw"", ""Honky Tonk"", ""Inamorata"", ""It's About That Time""; with only Joe Zawinul's ""Directions"" having been played by any of Davis' groups before, the trumpeter had to know he was making a statement. In fact, none of the new stuff had more than a few notes, a couple of chord changes to distinguish it from ""formless jamming"" (to borrow another phrase from a critic), and if fans thought <em>Bitches Brew</em> was out there, what would they make of this? A few months removed from playing to 600,000 at the Isle of Wight, Davis had the nerve to hole up at The Cellar Door in Washington D.C., a small club holding no more than a couple hundred people. And he killed them. He and his band launched bomb after bomb for four nights; he slew every last person at the show, and listening to this noise now, it makes me want to kick the nonbelievers in the teeth.</p><p>
    Fans will already know some of the music on the overwhelming 6xCD <em>The Cellar Door Sessions 1970</em> because much of its final disc (from the band's last date at the club) was issued on 1971's <em>Live-Evil</em>. Of course, it was cut-up, rearranged, and interspersed with studio tracks, so even familiar performances sound new here. The box contains six of the 10 sets Davis' band played, remixed and sounding great (especially via an increased presence from Michael Henderson's bass), and extensive notes from everyone who played there-- except Davis. It's a shame we don't know what the band's leader thought of this stuff, because there is a case to be made that Henderson, drummer Jack DeJohnette, saxophonist Gary Bartz, keyboardist Keith Jarrett, and Brazilian percussionist Airto Moreira comprised his last indisputably great band. When guitarist John McLaughlin shows up for the last set, things seems even more fiery, more volatile, and I always have to fight the urge to blast my neighbors into next week. In any case, I can only guess Davis was pleased-- in fact, he leaves most of the lengthy solo pace to his bandmates, content to let this stew brew and brew and brew.</p><p>
    The first disc (from the band's first set on Wednesday night) begins right on Davis' solo from ""Directions"". DeJohnette is already playing like a motherfucker, nailing polyrhythms straight out of a drum'n'bass tune, and Davis flutters from behind a wah-wah pedal in turn. When he removes the effect, he plays high-pitched jabs-- a favorite move at the time-- and mixes in some furious runs, the kind he was gradually learning to leave behind as his music became more aggressive, more primal, LESS JAZZ. On the spacious ""Yesternow"" (originally from the <em>Jack Johnson</em> LP), the band stretches out. Nevertheless, Davis' solo is a strident mix of punches and runs, with Jarrett echoing him on the left after each phrase. Jarrett had already lit the fire under the track during his lengthy intro solo-- in fact, he was given a very long leash during these dates, frequently being allotted complete freedom to bring in tracks with unaccompanied performances. The band closes shop with the funked-out ""Inamorata"" and Davis' screaming melody. We're just getting started.</p><p>
    The second disc, from the next night, begins with DeJohnette's deft pulse on ""What I Say"", Henderson hitting the downbeats like a rock. Jarrett again begins things with a flighty, short-breathed solo on electric piano before Davis comes in with the piercing ""melody"" (which is mostly more high-note jabs that I imagine took out the eyes of the first row of club patrons). Bartz takes off after a particularly agitated Davis solo, and the tune seems to jump into another gear altogether-- and the audience responds in kind with the first of many animated reactions to his solos. On ""Honky Tonk"", something of a gospel blues vamp, the band brings everything way down, as Henderson plays the main riff under Jarrett's shimmering piano asides. Davis' solo afterwards sounds almost suffocated by the dirge of a pulse, but given that remainder of the band's set featured blow-outs like ""It's About That Time"" (here, with an unbelievably funky coda) and ""Inamorata"", he may just have been venting his anticipation.</p><p>
    Friday night's shows are spread over discs 3 and 4, the first of which contains epic versions of ""What I Say"", ""Directions"", and ""Honky Tonk"". I should note that the band never sounds out of breath in the slightest. Moreira's cuica squeak is all over the intro, as if chomping at the bit to let the floodgates open; Davis comes in about three minutes into the tune, nailing a wailing pitch into his solo and taking flight with a runs as if this was the first shot he'd ever gotten to play this stuff. Likewise, Jarrett's opening solo on ""Honky Tonk"" runs the gamut from blues, to modern jazz to an early run at the kind of exploratory impressionism he'd play on his own <em>The Köln Concert</em> years later-- these guys held a grand total of zero back. ""Inamorata"" from the fourth disc winds up for a minute before launching its main riff, as if the band were stretching its collective muscles and firing one last silo before disappearing into the night. Davis crawls out from between the twin locomotives of DeJohnnette and Henderson with a wah-wah'd solo, and it's obvious they probably could have gone on for hours.</p><p>
    The Saturday night shows on discs 5 and 6, and the introduction of guitarist McLaughlin (whose late flight only allowed him to make the tail end of their gigs), brings home an abundantly clear point: This period was apex for Davis and his band. Reissue co-producer Adam Holzman makes the point that this music was a sort of end-game for Davis' <em>Bitches Brew</em> ideas, before leaping off into the funky underworlds of <em>On the Corner</em> and the hazy, quasi-psychedelic shows of his touring band from 1973-75. McLaughlin's jaw-dropping solo on ""Directions"" from the last disc serves notice to anyone who forgot that Davis really did want to play rock music, but with the intelligence and technique of jazz. It's tough to find very many examples on record of people playing with as much intensity or inspiration. Funny enough, some of the guys mention in the box's notes that they weren't quite sure what to expect with McLaughlin's arrival. I guess it only goes to show you can't stop genius in the making. In December 1970, you couldn't stop Miles Davis.</p></div>"|2201.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2201-the-cellar-door-sessions-1970/|9.4|Dominique Leone

More recently, however, there's been a veritable explosion of top-drawer material reissued from this crucial era, including the long overdue reissue of the seminal No New York compilation and expansive career overviews of scene mainstays like Mars, Rhys Chatham, DNA, and Arthur Russell.</p><p>
    
    One of the most satisfying of these recent archival collections was Soul Jazz's 2003 compilation <em>New York Noise 1978-1982</em>, which gathered far-reaching tracks from such diverse acts as Liquid Liquid, Defunkt, and Glenn Branca. The inveterate historians at Soul Jazz have again dipped their fingers into the vaults on <em>New York Noise 2, a collection that assembles tracks from better-known performers (Sonic Youth, Branca, Russell) alongside several from the decidedly more obscure likes of Clandestine, Red Transistor, and Certain General. As with the first volume, the songs here can pivot abruptly from elastic, throbbing disco into refracted Afrobeat, art-house dub, and the extremes of avant-garde dissonance. With a depth and breadth that suggests this particular reservoir is far from dry, the album coheres together remarkably well considering these tracks share little in common aside from their temporal and geographic origins.</em></p><p> 
    
    The collection opens with the infectious rhythms of ""Ungawa, Pt. 2"" by Pulsallama, a group founded by actress and future Bongwater member Ann Magnuson, which then proceeds effortlessly into Mofungo's dense, jazzy ""Hunter Gatherer"". These tracks immediately fix the album's ebullient motion, a dynamism that's further illustrated by Vortex OST's dizzy ""Black Box Disco"" and the unruly funk of Don King's ""Tanajura"".</p><p> 
    
    The vibrant momentum of these dance-flavored cuts is stilled only slightly by the occasional jarring segue into noisier, punk-centric tracks like Red Transistor's ""Not Bite"" or UT's pummeling ""Sham Shack"". Likewise, the monolithic guitar sculptures of Chatham's ""Drastic Classicism"" or Branca's ""My Relationship"" prove immovably dense enough to absorb whatever concussive waves might rock their exteriors. Also of note is the squiggling, unpinnable lurch of ""My Hands Are Yellow (From the Job That I Do)"" by the Del-Byzanteens, an act bolstered by the keyboards and vocals of filmmaker-to-be Jim Jarmusch.</p><p> 
    
    Unlike the first volume of New York Noise, which included Rammelzee and K.Rob's ""Beat Bop"", this compilation contains no true examples of early hip-hop, an exclusion that likely counts as the album's most glaring omission. And one could certainly question the inconsequential presence of Sonic Youth's ""I Dreamed I Dream"", an early, unformed piece that brings little to the table beyond name recognition. Quibbles about the track list aside, the most striking aspect this album is the artists' collective refusal to look backwards for inspiration. There's nothing on any of these tracks that could be mistaken for the work of a preceding decade. Instead, each performer here audibly strives to create music free from obvious precedent, a worthy objective that will hopefully provide sincere inspiration for those future acts tempted to look to the artists of <em>New York Noise 2</em> for guidance.</p></div>"|1996.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1996-new-york-noise-2/|8.1|Matthew Murphy

Giving you my impressions will ruin the fun, in the same way that you don't give kids a review of a toy-- you just hand it over and let them start playing. When mine came in the mail, opening the box gave me a kind of Christmas morning rush and a flash of ""what is this thing?"" It's packaged in a small cardboard box printed with Chinese lettering around an image of a street scene. Inside you'll find what looks like a small transistor radio, plus two AA batteries (also Chinese).</p><p>
    
    Switch it on, and a soft, ambient loop starts to crackle through the tiny, cheap speaker built into the device. You can adjust the volume dial, or switch between the nine short loops programmed into the Buddha Machine-- and then you set it down and leave it alone. I've left it playing hours at a time while I sit at my desk, and I could even picture installing these around my house, like low budget installation art.</p><p>
    
    But I don't want to get hung up on its artistry, because most important of all, it's also an object. The minute I opened the box, I wanted to hold it in my hand, and play with the switches, and carry it around with me. It has an output jack, but it's much more fun to listen to its cheap built-in speaker: at low volumes, the loops are placid, fitting into the corner of your ear, but turn up the dial or press it to your ear and you hear hundreds of nuances and crackles of static. And best of all, the music never stops. Sure, you can listen to a minimalist CD and imagine how it would feel to hear it for days on end, but the Buddha Machine lets you try it: There's no 80-minute limit, and the batteries will go for hours. Psychologically, it makes a big difference when you aren't waiting for the music to fade out. </p><p>
    
    The nine loops are suggestive, but they're deliberately not engaging. A piece like Ekkehard Ehlers' ""Plays John Cassavetes 2"" makes you feel like you could hear it repeat forever, but in practice it needs to wrap itself up and end before we can get tired of it. The loops on the Buddha Machine don't shift or change over time, although you may be tricked into believing that they do, and a couple of loops that almost have hooks actually made me anxious, as I realized that I was waiting for them to move on. (The ninth loop, which is only two seconds long, is too fast and abrupt and probably could have been cut.)</p><p>
    
    More than anything, the Buddha Machine is a great way to study ambient music. It's built to produce background music, but as you treat it more functionally, you might question whether it's ""art."" What's the point of music that doesn't move forward? Can something this boundless and utilitarian meet the same criteria as an album, like Brian Eno's <em>Discreet Music</em>, where the system was designed to run forever but <em>strategically</em> isn't allowed to? You don't have to think about these issues-- or about anything at all-- but you'd be missing out on part of the fun.</p><p>
    
    Some people will call this a novelty, but it's not: It's a toy. Most of us are drawn to little gadgets that make music; we love to pick them up and fiddle with the switches, and play with them, and figure out how they work. Along the way we're testing and stretching the ways we experience and consume music. The Buddha Machine isn't the first self-contained music maker to sell as a work of electronic art, but it is an almost perfectly-realized example. And I can't stop playing with it.</p></div>"|3354.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3354-the-buddha-machine/|8.2|Chris Dahlen

The prolific Gelb has been doing similar and similarly tossed-off records like this for years, both as a solo artist and with the band Giant Sand. This new project is more conceptual than his usual m.o. and occasionally the mechanic's garage motif seems intrusive, especially on the four ""AAAA"" songs, which may have something to do with being blue in a red state. Regardless, <em>Arizona Amp and Alternator</em> on the whole captures the pace of a hot afternoon spent lounging in the shade, spouting lawn-chair philosophy over arid desert folk and waiting for the next stranded driver with a stalled automobile.</p><p>
    Gelb does get a few customers: Grandaddy backs him on three songs, M. Ward stops by briefly for a dusty sing-along, and Jeremy Gara of the Arcade Fire drums on one track. Several female singers drop by for duets, including previous collaborator Henriette Sennenvaldt, and Danish singer Marie Lorette Friis keeps a straight face playing European ingénue to Gelb's desert stalker during a jokey cover of Frank Loesser's ""Baby It's Cold Outside"". Scout Niblett makes a predictably weird spoken-word cameo on ""Recital"", but it's ace mechanic Marie Frank who steals the show. She subtly and beautifully tunes up Gelb's rough-edged vocals on ""Where the Wind Turns the Skin to Leather"" and ""Loretta and the Insect World"". That song, with its boy-girl back-and-forth, sounds like Lee Hazlewood on a heat-induced fever dream, especially when it hits the rococo girl-group chorus and Frank revels in an earthy lust born of broken love.</p><p>
    But Gelb is still boss, and <em>Arizona Amp and Alternator</em> is a predictably shaggy-dog album. As usual he's never in any hurry, and often goes off on wild tangents that occasionally lead nowhere in particular. But that addled esoterica is part of Gelb's appeal: To get to moments like the atmospheric guitar outro to ""Where the Wind Turns the Skin to Leather"" and the chorus to ""Loretta and the Insect World""-- which catch you off guard with their simple, streamlined elegance-- you have to wade through discursive moments like the four ""AAAA"" tracks and the plodding cover of Traffic's ""Low Spark of High Heeled Boys"". For all its frustrations, this approach has suited Gelb well for more than two decades. As the man himself would say, if it ain't broke...</p></div>"|496.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/496-arizona-amp-and-alternator/|7.3|Stephen M. Deusner

Once upon a time, those bands supported Airheart on tour; now the Sunderland and Glasgow acts are crossing over while the San Diego band quietly releases Record No. 6. Forgive the apples and pears, but Airheart, like Franz and Futureheads, make trendy, canon-mashing rock. So where's the viability? Great singles help, great albums clinch, but Gogogo Airheart never got past step one: applying the polish.</p>
<p>On <i>Rats! Sing! Sing!</i>, the band nail a losing formula, blending familiar sounds-- bratty discopunk, brooding college rock, white boy dub-- without the usual giveaways. Four-on-the-floor foundations, for instance, are tapped out on big, untreated drums, not the tamped-down 70s cans purveyed by James Murphy or Kudu. Even the most rigid numbers are permitted a sly swing, whether by sloven (""So Good"") or double-drummed funk (""Double Bummer""). Trebly guitars don't ill-become any of these songs, but Airheart's are particularly crispy; for a truly face-singeing experience, see ""Lie With a Lamb"" or ""Shake It Off"", whose rollicking, sun-baked guitar solo would make fellow So-Cal'er Stephen Malkmus proud.</p>
<p>It's actually rarer for bands to buck trend at this superficial end of the spectrum, especially when they make a conscious effort of it. Few begrudge pushing contrivance upon written material, but when it comes to aesthetics, the protocol is more restrictive. <i>Rats! Sing! Sing!</i>'s casual variety calls for a less specific stylization, but rather than hybridize Gogogo Airheart treat each song individually, which begets a number of interesting choices, some more successful than others.</p>
<p>From piecemeal opener ""Rats"" the band extracts a Walkmen-ish scraggliness with sprinklings of wet piano and radio oscillations. Success! Walls of murky amplified sound vex ""Burn It Down""'s straightforward surf-rock. Cool! But ""Heart on a Chain"" is stripped down to the point of having a one-off feel; the song seems to want to shake its breezy torpor and make a charge but it's foiled by a fade out. Arbitrary? From here down the record's backstretch the band stop making curious decisions confidently and quit deciding altogether. Grooves dissipate, vocals flop around in echo, riffs take a rain check. Like Jason Blake on a wraparound, Gogogo Airheart just can't finish. Only no one's blocking their net; the problem seems one of commitment.</p></div>"|3493.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3493-rats-sing-sing/|6.3|Sam Ubl

Some
    albums remain unheard in piles of promotional CDs; others emerge by
    chance after a lengthy hibernation to make a delayed march to the disc
    player. Lucky for us, UK bard David Thomas Broughton's excellent
    <em>The Complete Guide To Insufficiency</em> falls into the second camp.
    I've never been a huge fan of Plug Research, largely because
    experimental electronic music isn't my thing. On top of label bias, <em>The
    Complete Guide</em>'s bland cover art and generic title are ill-fitting.
    Overlooking these initial strikes, I played the album anyway only to
    find myself hitting repeat, literally for hours.</p><p>
    That was a couple of months ago; now, along with Richard Youngs' <em>Naïve
    Shaman</em> and Six Organs of Admittance's <em>Compathia</em>, Broughton's
    acid-folk cycle is a late-night favorite.
    Dripping with inky ambience, his hypnotic sick-souled mantras are simpler
    than Chasny's and comparable to Youngs' recent outings, but
    without the playful Arthur Russell flourishes. Broughton keeps the
    instrumentation spare: acoustic guitar, looping pedals, minimal drum
    machine, well-spaced accents (distortion streaks, bells, wooden
    percussion). At the center is his gorgeous hangdog voice, which
    recalls a less taciturn Nick Drake with the vocal
    mannerisms of Antony blended into the dusty, mystical ambiance of
    Vashti Bunyan.</p><p>
    Broughton's a patient conjuror, allowing five tracks to clock
    in at just under 40 minutes. Reportedly recorded in a single take at
    Wrangthorn Church Hall in Leeds, the compositions bleed together with only slight variation. The church wasn't simply a
    goth gimmick; the building really seeps into the songs. For
    example, the bells that close ""Unmarked Grave"" were
    supposedly a mistake, a fortunate byproduct of putting things to tape
    between the incense and pews.</p><p>
    The first track, ""Ambiguity"", opens on two minutes of guitar, looped
    frontward then backward, as if buoying Broughton's lyrics, which are
    both darkly surreal and heartbroken. ""Ambiguity""'s actual incantation
    begins with existential questioning: ""How much love can a boy contain
    in here? How many contradictions can a girl posses up there?"" When the
    song's pace subtly quickens, he moves into the realm of
    declarations: ""It's easy to forget where you came from, if there's no
    question of your return."" The line most indicative of the album's atmosphere-- draped in suicide, murder, and insecurity-- closes the piece: ""I struggle with the nightshade in my blood/ I
    really shouldn't say it, I really shouldn't say it/ But, I just love
    what the water does."" Then, when he's said his peace, Broughton doubles his voice-- a technique
    recalling Antony's gospelisms. These moments of non-articulation, of self-harmonizing are
    typically the standouts of any given track.</p><p>
    The next piece, ""Execution"" starts with Broughton's ohms alongside his
    playing and tapping of a guitar. Once the somber, plodded mood's
    established, he layers a vocal line over the backing track. Lyrically,
    it's a bit of a love song: ""I wouldn't take her to an execution/ I
    wouldn't take her to a live sex show/ I wouldn't piss or shit on her,
    would I?/ Because I love her so."" Scat fans may find this a narrow
    definition of a relationship, but the point's well taken: It's an
    I would walk 500 miles kinda thing for the down and out.</p><p>
    Surprisingly, ""Unmarked Grave"", the tale of a soldier's rotting body
    and his lonesome gal, is just about joyful in the aftermath of
    ""Execution""'s ominousness. (Tellingly, the dead guy's mortally wounded
    with arrows-- Broughton is often reminiscent of some Medievalist, and
    death by machine gun wouldn't seem right.) It's here the gentle church bells lend the track a funereal beauty, etching
    themselves into Broughton's one-man, multi-tracked Gregorian chant.</p><p>
    The album's weakest song, ""Walking Over You"", is also its most
    conventional and, thankfully, its briefest. Closer ""Ever Rotating Sky"" ostensibly looks at cannibalism/rape (""The violation of your
    body, the pieces they fall into the holes, flakes of skin in my mouth,
    petals trodden into the carpet""), and it resembles the
    three stronger earlier tracks on a noisier tip. For the last gasp,
    Broughton carts in a tinny drum machine (rattles/clicks/report),
    cutting his voice and the instruments into a patch of Reichian chaos.
    The dicing and reconfiguring eventually mutates ""rotating sky"" into
    ""rotting inside."" It's an eerie though perhaps unintentional effect.</p><p>
<em>The Complete Guide To Insufficiency</em> might be too homogenous for some,
    but fans of folk's apocalyptic, alchemical side ('sup, David
    Tibet) won't have much to complain about. Over the
    past year, neo-folk's continued to spin into different bifurcations; 
    the glossy hipsters-as-hippies proving less interesting than artists
    mining stranger material. Aligning himself with scratchy brethren like
    Nick Castro, Badgerlore, Devendra Banhart's earlier self, and the
    aforementioned Youngs and Chasny, David Thomas Broughton's debut ought
    to catapult him somewhere near the head of the bearded class, even if
    his stateside peers have yet to let these brilliant psalms work their
    magic.</p></div>"|1192.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1192-the-complete-guide-to-insufficiency/|8.4|Brandon Stosuy

Some even charge that Shadow's considered among our foremost hip-hop connoisseurs only because he veers away from the most volatile and controversial elements of 21st-century rap: a rap producer in name only, a rocker in sheep's clothing, a DJ for those who can't stand the real thing.  No doubt he frequently embraces the warm nostalgia of 1970s street funk and the high-falutin' bricolage of 80s avant-garde.  Perhaps it's because people still blame him for trip-hop.  Perhaps it's just because he's remixed Keane.  At any rate, even within the marginal world of turntable fanboys, Shadow seems to be complimented more for his unimpeachable DJ maneuvers than his actual music.  How many times has he been mentioned by a rapper you admire?</i></p><p>
    
    It's a crying shame, really, since Shadow's endlessly inventive repertoire has always been securely founded on the flotsam of rap B-sides.  (Check out the first half of <em>Diminishing Returns</em>.)  If the movie <em>Scratch</em> accurately portrayed the producer, Shadow spends most of his days careening around vast vinyl catacombs of 1989 rap singles and deep-funk LPs.  No wonder he chose to score <i>Dark Days, a documentary about underground derelicts who build enormous cathedral-like residences out of piles of pop-culture refuse.  An iPod claims to hold 15,000 songs; Shadow claims to hold around 90 million (""60,000 shelves"")-- and how could anyone doubt him? </i></p><p>
<em>Funky Skunk</em>-- a limited-edition mixtape sold in exclusive packages with Shepard Fairey's graffiti-chic shirts and accessories-- is addictive and ferocious, and might horrify anyone who's only familiar with Shadow's more serene albums.  Here, the grand savior of independent rap flails around with the biggest hits of Three 6 Mafia, Silkk the Shocker, and Too $hort.  Entire segments are devoted to grime, gangsta, crunk, Miami bass, and all the other micro-genres that Shadow's acolytes so fiercely oppose.  There are indictments of welfare programs, juvenile courts, and geopolitical deceptions, as well as wack niggaz, axes, and old Vipers.  The first chorus is worlds apart from the Steve Reich-citing <em>Private Press</em>: ""It's going down in this bitch tonight!""</p><p>
    
    Witness Shadow's collage of militant beats and high-brow marriage analysis at the start of the mix: It equates the martial and the marital far more effectively than <em>Mr. and Mrs. Smith</em>. Not to say he's given up on the underdogs-- the mixtape's first 10 minutes feature about a half-dozen of the best beats I've heard this month and riffs I'm astounded other DJs hadn't yet discovered: Opiate garage meets spectral mid-70s funk; Rastafarian hustlers commandeer a melting organ and relay raps that sound like they were recorded under a moving train; cosmic electro and Velcro synths are rubbed over dusty Stax singers until their glossy vocal performances are scrambled and twisted; David Banner struggles against a torrent of ambulance sirens, broken violins, and plastic beats.  It's as if Southern rap were about to split into hundreds of Wagner bars and speed-psych riffs.  <i>Funky Skunk</i> succeeds on every possible level: lyrics, flow, beats, novelty, mix, sequence, DJ acrobatics, childish humor, and erudite irony.  Even when Shadow invokes a Z-grade Lee Hazlewood clone, the lyrics are so entrancingly bizarre they make Shadow seem more cryptic than gimmicky: ""She's the lady they refer to when they cut the Ace of Spades/ She's the lady that they think of when the night pulls down its shades."" </p><p>
    
    If there's any complaint, it's that <em>Skunk</em> is both physically exhausting-- the pace never relents, even when it probably should-- and veers slightly astray toward the end as the flow becomes more fragmented.  Still, it's a testament to Shadow's skills that even these deficiencies can be perceived as virtues under the right conditions.  Despite the recent Shadow backlash, this mix solidifies that there are few other hip-hop producers-- in meditative ambiance or glock-wielding top 20 chaos-- who are so consistently stimulating within this increasingly diverse genre.</p></div>"|2378.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2378-funky-skunk/|8.0|Alex Linhardt

""Impressive"" isn't even the word: There's hardly a minute on this record that doesn't keep turning out to be way more fun than the last time you heard it.</p><p>
    The album comes from Ellen Allien's Bpitch Control, a label whose artists tend to skirt the lines between dancefloor function and home-listening quirk: Even when they aspire to get you deep and sweaty on your nights out, there's something grainy and queasy about it, a kind of twitchy brutalism that reminds you of the person behind the machines. The sounds here that really hit the body-- say, the face-punching blurts on ""Kill Bill Vol. 4""-- stay just as tweaked-out lovable at home. And for every one of them, there's a dozen that are just squishy and colorful and even
    more fun: Check the back-flipping bass lines on ""Die Clubnummer"", which sound more like dorky robots acting out Three Stooges routines. ""Dancingbox"" cuts up French rhyming into a granular stutter over tweaks that are active and constant without ever crossing over to hyperactive or gratuitous. ""Silicon"" does the same with Sasha Perera's vocals, for one of the best results here-- it's almost as if it were made as a demonstration of How to Improve M.I.A.</p><p>
    The front and back ends of this album are full of treats like that-- circus-trick edits, ultra-modern production, and pure sonic candy. What really makes the record worth it, though, is the way it holds up through its more atmospheric center. This stuff slows down nicely, coasting through a few soft electro grooves, pulling off ""thoughtful"" tones like Orbital, and even sliding into some clattery dub. The constant hi-fi tweaks and switchbacks might tread close to distraction-- or just empty calories-- but there's an ear for melody and movement that seems to keep them from ever drifting too far off.</p><p>
    So what's scaling back on its crossover potential? Well, the fact remains that it's a technical record. There's emotion (see ""I Love You""), but it's not an emotional package; there's pop, but it's not a human pop album. You get what you'd expect from tracks with names like ""Tetrispack""-- tweaky computer-age fun, thrilling sound, jittery details, robotic rhythmic switchbacks. Albums like this don't hit so many people with deep bonding experiences; they don't wind up on desert island lists. The good news is that we don't live on a desert island, and this album stands a great chance of enlivening a lot of your days here in the non-hypothetical world. At its best, strangely enough, it's a dance imperative free of those deep, dark depths-- and packed with a shiny, geeked-out joy that keeps you cartoon-dancing beside the speaker.</p></div>"|5671.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5671-hello-mom/|8.3|Nitsuh Abebe

    series, there's footage of a band called Tulu playing in a small market 
    square, fronted by dancers and wearing sort of semi-traditional outfits and 
    body paint. The band sits in a row of chairs, and the two men in the middle 
    play instruments that could hardly be more makeshift: one is a rattle made 
    from sardine cans and bedsprings, and the other is a piece of PVC piping 
    taped to a resonating gourd and blown into like a didgeridoo. These 
    contraptions exemplify the improvisatory resourcefulness of what turns out 
    to be a small constellation of bands operating in the sprawling, tumble-down 
    suburbs of Kinshasa, the teeming capital of the Democratic Republic of 
    Congo.</p><p>
<em>Congotronics 2</em> expands on the first volume of the series, which focused on 
    the music of Konono No. 1, a band that helped to innovate Kinshasa's unique 
    electro-traditional music. Counting Tulu, who only appear on the DVD, this 
    compilation features seven Congolese bands recorded on the spot in Kinshasa 
    by Crammed's Vincent Kenis, as well as a European performance by Konono, who 
    in the last year have been embraced by a surprisingly wide Western audience 
    ranging from worldbeat and rare groove aficionados to the avant-garde 
    community. The musicians present have two things in common: They all 
    have roots in rural Congo, and they are all playing traditional music, 
    amplified to be heard over the urban din through, at best, unconventional 
    means.</p><p>
    
    While the sounds of these bands will certainly be familiar to fans of 
    Konono, there is a remarkable amount of variety on the 
    disc. Sobanza Mimanisa get the most from the least; their line-up consists 
    of vocals, whistle, one guitar, an electric likembe and percussion 
    consisting of a cowbell and an aerosol can being beaten against a plastic 
    beer carton. The vocals crackle through the makeshift amplification, and the 
    guitar and likembe can't help doing the same. Bolia We Ndenge's centerpiece 
    is an antique accordion-- their segment on the DVD features a re-enactment of 
    a force publique officer, complete with authentic vintage uniform, bestowing 
    the accordion on a local village chief. Supposedly, the gift of the 
    accordion was the Belgians' way of paying back the indigenous citizenry of 
    Belgian Congo for years of horrendous oppression and exploitation.</p><p>
    
    Kasai Allstars' ""Kabuangoyi"" has a floating quality, its intertwining 
    likembe and marimba parts sounding in strange kinship with the flowing 
    rhumba and soukous that's been the bread and butter of Central African 
    popular music for the better part of a century now. A single vocalist calls 
    out a muezzin-like exhortation, and little trickles of fuzz-encrusted guitar 
    complement his singing at sporadic intervals. Kisanzi Congo share their 
    basic sound with Konono, but their take on it is lighter and looser, less 
    buzzed and fuzzed and full of fluttering likembe phrases.</p><p>
    
    Kisanzi Congo's looseness is actually fairly typical of Kinshasa's 
    electro-traditional music-- it's social music, made for dancing and 
    collective celebration, and the musicians are normal people who've had 
    little to no intense training, and as such it's not a sound that 
    would benefit from having every last little note in its right place. This is 
    also what makes Kenis' decision to record each performance live in a typical venue so apt-- it captures the spontaneity and inventiveness of 
    the music in a way that a studio environment probably couldn't. It also 
    captures the sound of the Kinshasa street and reveals the depth of a music 
    scene as vibrant and unique as any in the world.</p></div>"|2109.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2109-congotronics-2-buzz-n-rumble-from-the-urbn-jungle/|7.9|Joe Tangari

Coming just over a year later, this new reissue on local label Skybucket is housed in a digipak and includes new artwork, but that original box remains a pretty good metaphor for the band's sound, which is similarly unwieldy. <em>Cicada</em> is chockablock with ideas, encompassing an impressive breadth of styles and sounds-- sharp Southern rock, drowsy gospel, laidback 1970s pop, buzzing indie lo-fi, Sparklehorse-style self-destructive folk, percolating lounge rhythms, threadbare Americana, a little country, a little blues, a few drum machines and some George Harrison-style guitarwork-- all jammed together in 21 tracks with unusual arrangements, jostling transitions, and abrupt endings that musically enact the lyrics' obsession with untimely death and departure.</p><p>  The core of 13ghosts, which takes its name from the William Castle horror flick (filmed in Illusion-O!), is duo Brad Armstrong and Buzz Russell, who trade off vocal and songwriting duties throughout the album and whose voices and influences often contrast dramatically. Russell's songs, including ""Trodden Way"" and ""The Trouble With Actual Organs"", pair strong pop melodies with spacey atmospherics, recalling bands like the Comas and Modest Mouse. Armstrong has a slightly wider range; in fact, I thought he was two different people at first. He alternates between a low-key, world-weary voice on tracks like ""Just Got Dead"" and ""Song from Down Here"" and a louder, brasher rasp on ""The Storm"" and ""Worldshaker"". His ""Robert J."" is the album's centerpiece; perhaps the most straightforward melody and arrangement on <em>Cicada</em>, it's a cautionary tale about a local singer scared of being swallowed up by his music, and it sounds like it could have been written by or about The Band. Armstrong doesn't romanticize or sentimentalize Robert J., but he and Russell clearly identify with him and certainly sympathize with his predicament, especially when 13ghosts' own music threatens to swallow them up.</p><p> <em>Cicada</em> sounds larger than just two people. Thanks to a cast of supporting musicians-- including Azure Ray's Maria Taylor, who sings on ""Three Little Birds (After Bob Marley)""-- the music itself is always changing, swirling unsteadily around them, barely controlled. For example, the soft, spacy ""Toby Dammit Part One"" ends with a loud guitar outro that leads perfectly into ""Wormhead, My Dear"", which itself changes shape as it transitions into ""Ain't It Low"". It's not simply that anything could happen at any time on <em>Cicada</em>, but, more crucially, that everything seems to be happening all at once, as if the band felt life was too short or death too near to withhold any ideas or deny any possibilities. If <em>Cicada</em> sounds long, messy, and unfocused, it is-- but fascinatingly so. That scattershot aesthetic proves to be the album's life force, as the music derives its power from the crawlspaces between these sounds and styles. It makes for a strange, often unsettling listen, but one no less exciting for being so constantly disorienting.</p><p> </p></div>"|8309.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8309-cicada/|7.8|Stephen M.

    Rodriguez's self-titled album, is an experiment in minimal percussion that belies the prog-jazz onslaught  
    that follows. Recorded in Amsterdam last June, these  
    songs are an extension of the Omar Rodriguez Quintet side project,  
    and along for the ride are various musicians on horns, keys, and  
    percussion, including several ATDI and Mars Volta cohorts. The results are  
    extended, improv-style jams that mix wailing guitar solos, spasmodic  
    drumming, and computer and tape effects with more traditional  
    jazz elements.</p><p>
    
    The two longest tracks here are ""Regenbogen stelen van prostituees""  
    and ""Jacob van Lennepkade"", which transition seamlessly to create a  
    27-minute opus and provide the real meat of the album. Adrian  
    Terrazas-Gonzales' saxophone work stands out on ""Regenbogen"", but the  
    back and forth between sax and wah-wah-pedaled guitar is what  
    give the song its backbone. ""Jacob"" is slightly more subdued, using  
    the shuffling drums and bouncing bass guitar to set the tone while  
    Omar's guitar squeals atonally.</p><p>
    
    Things change considerably for ""Vondelpark bij nacht"", a dark piece  
    that never really takes off. Sitar, chimes, and computer blips swirl  
    through the background while the sax takes the lead. The middle- 
    eastern flair is a nice change of pace, but the lack of percussion or  
    any discernable structure causes it to fade into the background quickly. The pace is picked up again with album closer ""Spoorkrijden op het fietspad"", the most  
    rock oriented of the bunch, adding a small dose of funk and disco  
    to the formula. </p><p>
    
    Although this album was recorded during downtime on the Mars Volta's  
    recent European tour, to dismiss it as a throwaway vanity project  
    would be a mistake. Even though two of these tracks fall a little  
    short of the mark, the length and power of the remaining three more  
    than pick up the slack. While it's more jazz-oriented than the Mars Volta, Rodriguez uses the freedom of breaking  
    away from his main gig here to create something that is just as  
    unique and exciting. </p></div>"|6925.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6925-omar-rodriguez/|7.1|Cory D. Byrom

Brakhage's death earlier that year was greeted with general indifference in major media outlets, and for a while SY seemed to be the only prominent outfit to even acknowledge his passing. (I learned of his death only via a press release for the tribute concert.) Four years earlier, Lee Ranaldo began the Text of Light cooperative, which is named after a 1974 Brakhage movie and regularly performs improv concerts at experimental cinema screenings. For the 2003 memorial, the full Sonic Youth troupe (and Tim Barnes of the Silver Jews) flaunted their most pretentious tendencies in front of Brakhage's short films.</p><p>
<i>SYR6</i>, a recording of that concert, is the latest episode in Sonic Youth's peculiar series of noise, static, drone, and improv. Yet it's also a backhanded attempt to duplicate Brakhage's silent superimpositions and montages in audible form; it claims to be an imaginary soundtrack for movies that deliberately detest sound in general. Witness Brakhage's famous words on the incompatibility between his silent films and any form of musical accompaniment: ""I don't make my films out of caprice. I feel they need a silent attention [rather than] a non-stop soundtrack of the most distracting order."" He adamantly asserted that his movies' musical patterns were solely visual-- or cinematographic-- and hence incommensurable with aural rhythms. He further admonished that music would only obstruct his films' natural pulses of illumination and disintegration.</p><p>
    
    One is certainly entitled to dismiss Brakhage's manifesto as obscenely arrogant gibberish. (It's even reminiscent of Derek Bailey's vitriolic criticism of recorded music, though that's slightly more perplexing since he was a guitarist with dozens of albums.) Nevertheless, there's a certain wryness and sarcasm in Sonic Youth's whole endeavor. To extol Brakhage by denying his wishes is both awfully disturbing and darkly amusing. It's also sometimes sort of boring. In this sense, it encapsulates the album perfectly.</p><p>
    
    Generally speaking, <i>SYR6</i> teems with the funerary bells and foreboding vertigo that's so predominant in film scores. While it's performed with as much wit and proficiency as one could imagine, it also feels a bit simplistic or lazy. Metallic pulses, catalytic drums, and railing strings fall apart, and skeletal guitar radiates brief noir themes. The first track seems particularly laggard and serves as one more example of Sonic Youth's maddening tendency to appropriate the sound of the very bands they once influenced. My guess is that the performance converted Brakhage's subtle dissonance into the sort of raging, epic, let's-rock-these-geometric-figures-with-our-balls-out anthems that the filmmaker so abhorred. It raises the perennial question of rock and roll: Why play so loudly if you have nothing much to say? </p><p>
    
    Consequently, the most successful moments are those which are nearly silent (in an improv-acoustic sort of way): bruised strings, tinny mic-stand tapping, muffled radio frequencies, zither-like electric effects, Barnes' railroad-spike percussion, Thurston Moore's wobbly tuning pegs. In fact, Sonic Youth's affinity for manual dexterity and physical texture correlates nicely with Brakhage's experiments on scratched and painted celluloid. In the final piece, a 28-minute marathon, these intimate and scarcely audible tinkerings assemble and dismantle, making way for brief prismatic stretches of methamphetic jazz guitar, spectral Western wah-wah, and static so conflagrant it literally sets off a fire alarm (twice). It's luminescent and jarring music, possibly the best ever released in the SYR series, and it evokes the spiritual metamorphosis and physical pliability that Brakhage found in film. I only wish they could have accomplished a full album of this material. Perhaps Brakhage would have changed his mind about all this noise. Instead, he must be merely rolling his eyes one last time.</p></div>"|7350.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7350-syr6-koncertas-stan-brakhage-prisiminimui/|7.0|Alex Linhardt

As his longtime Coil partner Peter ""Sleazy"" Christopherson has put it, Balance's work has ""described or addressed that Very Moment"" time and again. And so it is on <em>The Ape of Naples</em>, an exceptional collection assembled from Balance's final recordings and earlier, uncompleted material originally recorded at Trent Reznor's New Orleans studio. Given the circumstances of its construction, the album is a remarkably unified work, its every meditative gesture alloyed with a looming, unmistakable sense of impending loss and/or transition.</p><p>
    
    Throughout their 20-year recording career, Coil have struck a careful symmetry between spontaneous, animistic creation and exacting ritualistic structure, often with specific alchemical intentions for each record. So while it is impossible to know what ultimate design Balance had for the material on <em>The Ape of Naples</em>, credit must be given to Christopherson for his skillful and devoted stewardship to this music. Several of these songs-- ""A Cold Cell"", ""Teenage Lightning 2005"", ""Heaven's Blade""-- have previously appeared in another forms. Here, however, Christopherson has significantly reworked each track, mixing electronics and acoustic instruments with the help of sympathetic collaborators Simon Norris, Cliff Stapleton, and Thighpaulsandra-- resulting in an album of astonishing cohesion, vitality, and undisguised poignancy.</p><p>
    
    Judged by the evidence on these 11 tracks, Balance remained a commanding and utterly captivating presence to the end, and these selections do well to showcase his expressive, multifaceted vocals. Augmented by the carnival textures of accordion, hurdy-gurdy, and singing saw, his vocals on the theatric ""Tattooed Man"" has an almost effortless elegance (""There's a man lying down in a grave somewhere/ with the same tattoos as me"") while beneath the agitated electronics and cool jazz snatches on ""I Don't Get It"" his heavily effected vocals spin as just another enigmatic cogwheel in Coil's diabolical engine.</p><p>
    
    The album closes with its most curious track, a cover of ""Going Up?"", the theme song from the long-running British sitcom ""Are You Being Served?"" As the closing song of Balance's final live performance, the cover has taken on an unlikely significance in Coil's history. In their hands it undergoes such an extraordinary transmutation that it'd likely go unrecognized by even the staunchest fans of the BBC comedy. With its tempo slowed to a funereal waltz, the song gathers an eerie, unsettling force as Balance is joined on vocals by Francis Testory, the two alternately repeating the lines ""Going up"" and ""It just is"" with a contented resignation-- as serene a conclusion one could expect from a shaman who never shied from penning his own epitaphs.</p></div>"|1826.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1826-the-ape-of-naples/|7.9|Matthew Murphy

The real surprises are its warmth and intimacy, humor and whimsy. These qualities aren't necessarily rare in the world of electronic music; there are always people who have more technical skills than things to say, and they've been known to fill the space around their programming with plenty of jack-around jokes. But Safety Scissors' Matthew Curry is not one of them, and <i>Tainted Lunch</i> is anything but the work of a clever brat-- just a loopy, funny, emotion-filled electronic pop record, one that comes off sweet, humble, and downright generous in spirit. I'm inclined to think this is important, especially when some of the decade's freshest music has come from similar places: Junior Boys and the Streets, Max Tundra and Tujiko Noriko, wide swathes of r&amp;b--; all of them bringing the mechanics of electronic music away from the otherworldly and down toward the bedroom conversation.</p><p>
    
    This is a record, after all, that features Curry cheerleading for the fly struggling in his soup, and throughout the record he manages to score smiles and tug heartstrings with the same approach-- a stoner's-eye view of food, housework, war, and (above all) distance. That fine-tuned micro-house sound comes from recording sessions in Berlin with Vladislav Delay (aka Luomo), and there's an American-abroad bemusement running through most of these songs. ""Where Is Germany and How Do I Get There"" has Curry wondering if he could walk the Bering Strait back to California before calling in to what must be work: ""I don't think I can make it in today/ Because Germany is far away."" More chipper is ""Sunlight's on the Other Side"", which frames long-distance love the same way Fievel the mouse once did: ""Dried-out grapes are raisins/ Dried-out plums are prunes/ All for one reason/ The same sun that shines on you."" On ""After Disaster"" you get whimsy in the way that works-- carousel circles of piano-lesson chords and banjo, with Curry and Kevin Blechdom singing about bad luck in kindergarten-teacher voices: ""My pants are wet""/ ""What could it be?""/ ""Did I spill water?""/ ""It's pee!""</p><p>
    
    Consider the kind of tonal perfection it takes-- and the kind of unassuming soul voice-- to make this stuff seem more loving than arch. Consider that the bulk of this record-- the bulk of those quotes-- feels weighty and serious and heartfelt. Consider the way Curry takes a Rimbaud poem about trench warfare, sets it to deep, drizzly house, and turns its food metaphor (""I am the cheese"") inside out: It's a good approximation of the way lightness and weight play with each other across the length of this disc. Curry has brought a personality out from the washes and drifts of his last full-length, and it turns out to be well-rounded-- one curious enough to interweave goofball pop with fine laptop soul.</p><p>
    
    The music is just as seamless, both remarkable and remarkably unobtrusive. The programming here is intricate enough to reward close listening-- every squish, tick, roll, and stab in its place-- but it doesn't take a laptop initiate to enjoy it: Curry is just as good with the big-picture progressions of his songs, and he seems to know why good songwriting will always beat waving his computer skills in your face. Well-played guitar leads sneak through the speakers, fat woodwinds honk through the bottom end of ""Sunlight's...,"" and the tone of it all runs from proper digital-disco pulse (""Amnesia"") to left-field pop sparkle-- from MRI gone whitebread soul to something almost like those moments where Ween surprise you with a no-joke sweetheart pop song. (See also: digital Serge Gainsbourg jazz when Stereo Total's Francoise Cactus makes a cameo.) It's the plain-spoken voice and skewed writing style that unite it all, and as Curry sings about his rumpled pants and travel, he starts to seem like-- well, kind of like he'd make a good roommate. Try this one out: You can listen to it next time you're cleaning the kitchen.</p></div>"|6966.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6966-tainted-lunch/|8.5|Nitsuh Abebe

It's difficult to unearth a song here that doesn't find Frost in dire romantic straits-- not just heartbroken, but plainly pathetic, unabashedly needy. One waits, in vain, for some sort of inner strength or declaration of independence to emerge; instead, personal dignity is sacrificed time and again to the ghost of romantic love.</p><p>
<em>It's a Game</em>, then, is a country-folk tribute to co-dependency, one lacking the acerbic wit, unexpected joy, and newfound resolve that elevate such music beyond the maudlin. Instead, it's track after track of self-effacement and emotional panhandling, seemingly oblivious to the fact that there's a lot more to life than waiting on a man to let you be happy. The pretty confidence of the music-- Frost has a rich voice and a knack for lilting, breathy acoustica reminiscent of Leslie Feist-- is constantly at odds with the ugly insecurity of the lyrics.</p><p> 
    
    Here's Frost on the plinking ""Emergency"", cajoling a restless lover instead of admitting he's a right bastard and moving on: ""You've got so much time for that other woman/ I don't know why you won't spend your time with me."" Maybe it's because, as she sings on the saddle-sore ballad ""A Mirage"", ""As the last boy I loved told me the day we said goodbye/ My heart is too sentimental and his love he could only deny."" And ""What's the Use"", while musically spry, is rife with defeated longing: ""What's the use in trying again when you're only going to break my heart/ Where did I go wrong in my thinking you'd fall in love with a girl like me?"" </p><p> 
    
    God. Has Frost ever heard of self-fulfilling prophecy? Her self-degradation is, at best, endearing in spurts, but becomes really frustrating over the course of <em>It's a Game</em>. The smoldering ""My Lover Won't Call"" speaks for itself; ""Larger than Life"" shamelessly wheedles ""Please keep calling me;"" ""Just a Friend"" oozes with unattractive desperation: ""Won't you let me get closer/ Just tell me what I should say/ I don't want it to be over / I don't want this thing to end."" By the time it's all said and done, you sort of want to shake her by the shoulders; turn her on to ""Since U Been Gone""; <em>something</em>. </p></div>"|3226.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3226-its-a-game/|5.8|Brian Howe

The Dolby-tricked-out re-release of his 1994 peak, <i>The     Downward Spiral</i>, sounded the fanfare, its finely     textured bursts of despair and strangely soothing     hushed introspections losing little of its     alternative-era whollop. But new album <i>With Teeth vampired off this momentum, sounding disappointingly paint-by-numbers despite its success on mostly toothless modern-rock radio.</i></p>
<p>Now comes a reissue of Nine Inch Nails' introduction     to the world, a move which could be perceived as     another grasp at legacy rehabilitation through     past-mining, were it not for Reznor's non-compliance     with the release. You see, <i>Pretty Hate Machine </i>has     been a neglected child in divorce proceedings, languishing out of print while TVT attempted to settle its affairs with assorted     Mr. Potters, who eventually tried to hock it along with other parts of the label's back     catalog. As     such, PHM returns to your store shelves courtesy of     Rykodisc, who licensed the record from that industrial     figurehead, Prudential Securities-- after all, nobody says rock     like <i>The Rock</i>.</p>
<p>Due to these auspicious origins, the new incarnation     of <i>Pretty Hate Machine</i> is indistinguishable from the     original: no 5.1 surround-sound, no B-side/remix     sweetening, no fishnet slipcase/bonus snuff DVD deluxe     packaging. Sadly, with no garish extras, there's     nothing to distract from what turns out to be a     horribly dated album, just as awkwardly out of step     with the mid-aughts as <i>The Downward Spiral was     unexpectedly relevant. </i></p>
<p>Remastering might've spruced it up, but it's unlikely a digital     touchup could keep <i>Pretty Hate Machine</i> from sounding     tinny enough to give you that penny-taste in your     mouth. Drumbeats are often industrial in the most     literal sense, machinery-simulating presets stiff as     prosthetics. The rest of the mix doesn't offer any     escape routes, filled out as it is with paper-thin     synthesizers and Reznor's echo plug-in     front-and-center vocals spouting alt.suicide.holiday     posts, the razor-guitars and stampeding drums he     perfected just three years later on ""Wish"" completely     MIA. These failings didn't sink in back     when I had ""Head Like a Hole"" cranked up on my Discman     on the school bus, but today that and     others sound thin, quaint, the furthest thing from     dangerous.</p>
<p>As a result, <i>Pretty Hate Machine</i> sounds less like     NIN's astonishing breakthrough and more like     developmental bumbling, leaving one to wonder why it     was ever considered otherwise. Perhaps the album was     swept up in the hypewaves generated by Reznor's famous     afternoon sets at the first Lollapalooza, perhaps <i>PHM </i>reaped the     rewards of people being late to the Wax Trax! game.      And to tell the truth, it's still possible to see the     early vestiges of Reznor's skillful reconfiguration of     all those nasty Chicago and German sounds for pop     palatability, placing the emphasis on the melody     rather than the machinery. Hints at Reznor's     considerable studio craft pop up more often in the     second half, the breakbeats of ""Kinda I Want To""     momentarily enlivening the limp rhythms, ""Sin""     (probably NIN's most underrated and best early song)     seeding the creepy brooding sensations that didn't     fully bloom until the <i>Broken</i> EP.</p>
<p>But there are just too many embarrassingly distinct     time-stamps of 1989-ness to ignore: the hilarious     talk-rap vocals of ""Down In It"", that Chili Peppers     poppy bass on ""Sanctified"", the ""Goodbye Blue Sky"" rip     of ""Something I Can Never Have"". Like most     self-serious music, time hasn't gone easy on the     depressive couplets (fill in the rhyme!: ""bow down     before the one you serve..."") and haunted-house     keyboards of Reznor's debut, eroding away much of what     must've been shocking and novel about it 17     years ago. Unlike <i>The Downward Spiral</i> or Broken, <i>Pretty Hate Machine</i>'s re-release reveals the album     to be an artifact, perhaps historically valuable, but     as anachronistic as Napoleon in a water park.</p></div>"|5804.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5804-pretty-hate-machine/|5.6|Rob Mitchum

    every now and again. A loud, scraggly man, he always blares, ""Ladies 
    and gentlemen, may I please have a minute of your time."" This is absolutely 
    not a question, and he is certainly not a polite person. He has no legs, nor a wheelchair. He has an acoustic guitar strapped to his back and insists on performing a song. He'll keenly request a <em>wink-wink</em> donation if his tune rocks your world. This man, who we can call Studebaker for the sake of identification, sings very popular, well-known songs like ""...Baby One More Time"" and ""More Than a Feeling"" and ""Bootylicious"". But he replaces them with his own stoopid-clever lyrics that highlight his plight. ""Subway car, can you handle this? No. 6 Line can you handle this? America, can you handle this? I don't think you can handle this!"" He's a great guy; I always give him a buck.</p><p>
    
    Seu Jorge's entrance to the hipster consciousness positioned him as 
    something of a Studebaker. By now the tale of Jorge's re-fashioning of David 
    Bowie's lyrics for his performance in Wes Anderson's <em>The Life Aquatic</em> 
    is old hat-- a cute little DVD commentary story or bar stool chat point at 
    Fat Baby. But his lyrical rejigger, coupled with the fact that he strips 
    down every one of these Hunky Stardust-era glamthems into smoky bossa nova, 
    makes him a regular subway hound. Every tune is a crusty, throaty delight. 
    Unlike Jorge's album, <em>CRU</em>, from earlier in 2005, there's lots of joy 
    in his voice. The windswept, acoustic production serves him well. ""Ziggy 
    Stardust"" in particular opens him up to all sorts of wailing and gospelized 
    hoots. The structure and chords are precisely the same. But he interweaves 
    his own little guttural impudence onto as time-tested a chorus as I can 
    recall. Even ""Team Zissou"", the lone original, has got a rollicking early 
    Bowie at the Beeb vibe to it, all croons and crafts with his vocal range. 
    The chorus rips soprano to alto, ""Teeeeammmma Zee-suuuuuuu, underwater, I 
    luhrve you.""</p><p>
    
    Yet at some point you've got to ask yourself what use you'll have for this 
    record. The covers, while stirring, are never going to stack up with the 
    originals. Jorge is an intriguing voice in a continually emerging Brazilian 
    scene-- not quite a successor to Caetano Veloso or Gilberto Gil, but at least a 
    wingman with a sharp eye for social distortion. The breathy <em>CRU</em> said 
    as much. So this is not quite as monumental a release as you'd like to see 
    from a talent like him. Still, as back porch BBQ music? A gem. Hell, I'd 
    give Seu Jorge a buck if I saw him right now.</p></div>"|4362.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4362-the-life-aquatic-studio-sessions-featuring-seu-jorge/|6.8|Sean Fennessey

    notwithstanding. Camera on musical guest Lil' Wayne, bassist behind him on
    pasty octaves, some keyboard ""funk"" preset, really thin till the guitars
    flange in. This is Alan-born Robin Thicke's ""Oh Shooter"" they're playing,
    straight-up, and Thicke, on stage beside Wayne,
    begins his stick'd-up anthem, his breath caught as it would be near chrome.
    Tune in then and you'd think Thicke was the star and Weezy just his
    cough-n-pepper hypeman. ""<i>I</i> brought <i>my</i> homeboy with <i>me</i>,""
    says standing Wayne of singing Thicke. He's kidding, right? Technically this
    is Wayne's song called ""Shooter"", but the entire ""song"", down to the track
    length, is Thicke's original.</p><p>
    
    What a tense performance so far; music played, but you could probably hear a
    pin drop. This young New Orleans rapper bouncing around on stage with Real
    Musicians but not much else, good for a laugh or a breakdance or whatever
    Other-approved televised woop-de-doo-- ""cute"" and ""rap's not so bad after
    all"" but also ""rapping <i>is</i> easy,"" ""rap=only good as the sample it
    swiped"". Wayne was holding us at bay, all our presuppositions about
    his career, his music, his age and color, his responsibility qua artist
    post-Katrina. If Thicke's the crybaby here, Wayne's the stick-up kid.</p><p>
    
    ""They want me with my hands up,"" sings Thicke, doing that stupid ""raise the
    roof"" thing. Wayne breaks: ""I'm trying to tell you what I am, baby-- listen.""
    And after almost two minutes of no talking he
    bursts the song open: ""So many doubt cos I come from the South,
    but when I open my mouth <i>the best</i> come out. <i>It's my turn and I'm
    starting right here today</i>."" And so on-- it's one of those black-and-white-to-technicolor moments after which, if you still don't believe in Wayne, you're
    just lying to yourself.</p><p>
    
    Granted, Leno won't make ""Shooter"" Wayne's ""song"" (it will be though), and
    we definitely can't call <i>Tha Carter II</i> his coming-of-age album or
    something equally corny-- people blew that line on the one before. Fact is,
    Wayne's still young, and he loves that he can get away with shit--
    literally. Firmly keeping a foot in the sandbox, Wayne dabbles scatological
    throughout (""Dear Mr. Toilet/ I'm the shit""), sometimes even elaborately so
    (""You niggas small bubbles, I burp you/ I'll spit you out and have your
    girls slurp you""). Total energy thing, his verses still lack polish and a
    good edit (e.g. so many goddamn shark jokes), and his skits and ""personality
    raps"" (cf. ""Grown Man"") spell him out too bluntly, too vainly. And yet,
    there's ""Shooter"", or ""Receipt"", or ""Get Over"": ""Standin' on stage in front
    of thousands/ Don't amount to me not having my father."" Lines like this fall
    outta nowhere, jaw-droppers aplenty-- but ""don't forget the baby"".</p><p>
    
    People who met Wayne on ""Go DJ"" and thought him a lunchroom hack emcee-- who knows what's happened since then, but damn has he learned how to
    write. His squeak is now a croak, his laugh a little more burly, his flow
    remarkably flexible. Sometimes he's deliberate like syrup cats (""But this is
    Southern, face it/ If we too simple then yall don't get the basics"") but
    when he needs to be, he's nimble as that Other Carter: ""I ain't talking too
    fast you just listening too slow."" Remy and weed, fast things and women, the
    corner-- these are Wayne's wax since B.G.'ing with B.G., putting piff on the
    campus before he ever enrolled in college.</p><p>
    
    What's different, and crucial: no
    Mannie Fresh electro-dixie beats. Free from Fresh, Wayne is less a novelty--
    less Pinocchio on Pleasure Island (cf. <i>500 Degreez</i>), less that
    dorm-room poster of the baby giving the middle finger. In fact, no-name
    nawlins producers run the boards, their crackly soul sampling and that
    implied return-to-rap roots a perfect complement to Weezy's raspy, sometimes
    even Miles Davisian voice. On ""Receipt"", which lifts the Isleys' ""Lay-Away"",
    Wayne's nursery rhyme delivery grants pick-ups like ""my daughter want
    another/ Sister or brother/ And you looking like a mother"" that rare
    smooth-crude game, something a young Curtis Jackson wanted out of ""Best
    Friend"" but didn't quite get.</p><p>
    
    ""I'm a self-made millionaire, fuck the public,"" he says on ""Money On My 
    Mind."" To an extent, he's right. This is Wayne's show, the album's
    only guests being Kurupt and Birdman and some r&amp;b; b-girls. Not to say he's
    ungrateful; it's just that establishing his autonomy, his don't give a fuck,
    is infinitely more important. Lead track ""Tha Mobb""
    really lays the audience/methodology/goals stuff on thick: For five minutes,
    no chorus, sad piano, he does it for ""the gangstas and the bitches, the
    hustlers and the hos."" Crossover? ""Whatever."" Mainstream? ""No!"" He refuses
    to be a Big artist, precisely so he can be a big Artist.</p><p>
    
    Shirking responsibility then? Katrina happened after most these tracks were
    cut, so let's not be assholes. He worked in a few rhymes after the fact,
    very simple stuff like ""gotta get the hood back after Katrina"" on ""Feel Me"".
    But the line that follows is more telling: ""Weezy F. Baby, the 'F' is for
    'FEMA'."" FEMA, that lark, and so goes his point: For relief, he's not responsible. While Wayne
    hasn't made <i>Tha Carter II</i> a ""Katrina album"" in the obvious respect
    (cf. that horrendous ""George Bush Doesn't Care About Black People"" song rock
    critics like because they ""get"" it), he's given New Orleans
    something much greater-- someone, one of their own, to believe in. ""If I talk it I walk it like Herschel,"" he says on ""Mo Fire"", his syllables out
    his mouth like smoke rings-- he means sex, other things too.</p></div>"|4997.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4997-tha-carter-ii/|8.1|Nick Sylvester

There may have once 
    been a time when giving your outfit a name like that would have garnered 
    some controversy, gotten you noticed under the ""any publicity is good 
    publicity"" theory, but now it just looks like you're 
    trying too hard to whip up some stink around you. But that's beside the 
    point-- the most important thing is the music, and Holy Fuck are an 
    interesting band, coming out of Toronto with a couple of vets from King Cobb 
    Steelie and By Divine Right in their ranks and a whole heap of drums with 
    which to assault your tired senses.</p><p>
    
    I couldn't help smiling at the way the quintet opted to open the album: with 
    a distorted sample, swiped from Simon &amp; Garfunkel's ""A Simple Desultory 
    Phillipic (Or How I Was Robert McNamara'd Into Submission)"", of Paul Simon 
    saying ""folk rock"" as a fuzz bass riff crackles behind him. They don't waste 
    much time getting downright nasty from there, as their proudly junky bank of 
    keyboards kicks in with a jumping rhythm, soon to be joined by a rock solid 
    drum beat. Dual drummers Glenn Milchem and Loel Campbell give the band's 
    music most of its focus, pile-driving the beats and creating an unholy 
    ruckus on the numerous build-ups. ""Tone Bank Jungle"" is as much a mission 
    statement as an opener, cramming the band's rhythm'n'noise ethos right 
    between your eyes.</p><p>
    
    The band was formed with the intent of creating the equivalent of modern 
    electronic music without actually using the techniques-- looping, splicing, 
    programming and the like-- of that music. They gathered together the requisite 
    gadgets and instruments and played their first show without rehearsing, and 
    they claim never to rehearse to this day. While this approach 
    leads to plenty of exciting moments and a lot of improvisational tension, it 
    also means that the band doesn't really compose its songs, and as such, 
    there's little in the way of melodic content or any other hook here beyond a 
    beat or toy keyboard ostinato.</p><p>
    
    Where this becomes a problem is on long tracks like ""Korg Rhythm Afro"", a 
    song full of rhythmically chattering bleeps and bloops that relies too much 
    on the way the drums fall in and out of rhythm to give it shape-- it's the 
    kind of thing that might be thrilling live, but on record it's tiring, like 
    being beaten with drumsticks for seven minutes. The album's best track, 
    ""Bontempi Latin"" goes the other way, morphing from section to section as the 
    drums bring the beat through a cycle of stomping breaks, almost jazz-like 
    shuffle and break-neck rock beats, all as the keyboards and guitars graduate 
    from echoing blips to sheets of descending texture, falling like paratroops 
    on the darting percussion.</p><p>
    
    As high as the album's peaks are, though, they are not numerous enough to 
    make this a record I feel compelled to return to. Several listens in, I 
    still barely remember even the most striking moments. I'll speculate that 
    Holy Fuck might cause people to utter their name in a live setting, as 
    they're a remarkably tight unit chock-full of rhythm, but they may want to 
    consider some rehearsal before their next recording date.</p></div>"|4031.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4031-holy-fuck/|6.9|Joe Tangari

    record, but a packed CD (or two) from Matthew Bower holds your attention for a
    while. What Bower does he does very well, going back to his days
    leading psych/noise mavens Skullflower, but it's not the sort of
    music I'm in the mood for regularly. Even as drone goes Bower's work
    is demanding, foregoing hypnotic drift for frequent dalliances in
    edge-of-seat abrasiveness.</p><p>
    
    2003's <i>Cloudz only lasted 70 minutes, which is EP length for Bower, but Sunroof! returns here with well over two
    hours of blistering sound. Unlike previous two-fers, <em>Silver Bear Mist</em>
    feels like two separate records. The first disc is a focused
    exploration of a very limited palette, one comprised primarily of
    chaotically buzzing synth tones in the upper half of the midrange.
    It's a particularly sensitive frequency spectrum usually inhabited by
    shrill voices and the tinnitus-induced ring that follows a loud rock
    show. Having this delicate place worked over by a man as sonically
    relentless as Bower will appeal primarily to the masochist. Only ""Bear
    Melt"", with its meatier chords thick with bass, crude percussion, and
    terrifically disorienting use of sliding tones, can call itself a
    prime Sunroof! creation.</i></p><p>
    
    Disc two, however, has considerable variety and much more to
    recommend. While the opening ""Be Sure to Boogie"" picks up at the same
    itchy and scratchy place the record left off, ""Great Empty Display
    Shelves"" is a fitting monument to the power of barely controlled
    noise. Here Bower seems capable of wringing any sound imaginable from
    his daisy-chained effects pedals and crude synths, as hints of
    gamelan, whale songs, and a twisted rock coda mash together into an
    accidentally gorgeous configuration. ""Stacked Diamonds"" is a bent
    mediation on Middle Eastern scales, notes repeated to the point of
    mantra and processed to sound completely evil. Then the closing
    ""Trampled Dawns"" finally lets some light in, with a single uplifting
    chord shoved ever higher by an endless roll of splashing, free
    jazz-like percussion. Once ""Trampled Dawns"" finishes it becomes clear
    that Silver Bear Mist misses those flashes of prettiness that made
    previous records such a complete listening experience. If it is in the
    fact the most challenging Sunroof! release, the rewards aren't what
    they should be.</p></div>"|7588.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7588-silver-bear-mist/|6.0|Mark Richardson

At the time, the band's U.S. debut, <em>If You're Feeling Sinister had been out in the UK for about a year but to American audiences the Scottish group was more rumor than reality. The record was first issued in the U.S. on The Enclave, a Virgin subsidiary that, soon after releasing the record, went bankrupt. The group decided to stop speaking to press, feeling disenchanted with its initial experiences with the music weeklies. Publicity photos featured friends or band members in curious poses-- their keyboardist doing the ironing, their cellist hiding behind a surgical mask, their bassist crouched over a fallen nun.</em></p><p>
    
    What's more, the band were often messy live, typically the route for upstarts to connect with could-be fans. Interminable soundchecks begat shambolic performances, with only the occasional mumble or a few bars of someone else's music to fill frustratingly large gaps between songs. The band members-- selected the year before to support singer Stuart Murdoch's songs on a potentially one-off project-- weren't yet all convinced they were players in a fully functioning combo, and they often performed with what seemed to be a mix of disinterest and ineptitude. Even Murdoch often forgot his own lyrics. True to what was then their form, a performance taped that month for PBS' ""Sessions at West 54th"" was deemed unworthy to broadcast.</p><p>
    
    Despite the roadblocks and stumbles, <em>Sinister</em>-- along with a series of early EPs-- made the Scottish group one of the biggest cult bands in indiedom, and almost a decade later it's still considered to be the group's career peak. Murdoch himself-- he'll now do the occasional interview-- has often said these are his best songs, recorded poorly. What's more he's right: Two-dimensional, limp, distant, often the record's more complex, graceful arrangements are buried under C-86-quality sound. Perhaps motivated by this long-simmering dissatisfaction with <em>Sinister</em>, the band chose to not only perform it as part of All Tomorrow's Parties Don't Look Back series-- in which an artist performs its best-loved work live in its entirety-- but also release the results as an iTunes-only charity record. (All proceeds from the sale of the album will go to the DEC's Asia Quake Appeal.)</p><p> 
    
    The irony that Belle and Sebastian would issue a live record in order to <em>correct</em> the fidelity of a studio record must not be lost on either the band or any of its longtime fans. Those introduced to the group on its most recent couple of tours, however, should be familiar with them as a robust, confident collective, with Murdoch and guitarist Stevie Jackson taking turns playing ringleader for an accomplished set of musicians, which on this recording include not only the band's seven members but five additional players. And, appropriately, this LP reflects the current band's confidence, buffering Murdoch's delicate songs about romantic frustration, sexual curiosity, crises of confidence and faith, and existential drift with swelling strings and lilting, airy arrangements. They offer a near-definitive reading of most of the tracks here, turning what could have been a superfluous record into a tempting first purchase for those curious about the band.</p><p>
    
    The record starts with a whimper, the opening lines of ""The Stars of Track &amp; Field"" rushed and recorded somewhat quietly. The track finds its feet but still limps through the next two minutes, until its first swell reveals the full force of the 12-piece band. Mick Cooke's ""They Don't Know""-quoting trumpet solo is as warm as ever but it serves as placesetter to a muscular finale where on record-- as on almost every track he's featured-- it's the sonic peak.</p><p>
    
    The tracks best served by the live recording are, perhaps unsurprisingly, those that seem the most slight on record, either because here they punch above the weight of expectations or they were in the most need of a spitshine in the first place. The generation-gap ""Me and the Major"", now even more rollicking and playful, features an older Murdoch sounding increasingly confident standing toe-to-toe with his fellow titular adversary and supposed social bettor. ""Like Dylan in the Movies"" and ""Get Me Away From Here, I'm Dying"" don't leave Murdoch as stranded as they previously did, and yet neither of the simmering dread of the former or the bedsit solitude of the latter is lost without muted backdrops.</p><p>
    
    Most in need of an upgrade was the title track, which should have been <em>Sinister's</em> centerpiece, a song that encapsulated most of Murdoch's pet lyrical themes circa 1996-97-- religion, sex, frustration, and boredom-- while drawing lines between poor decisions and desperation, doubt and faith, a need for change and a sometimes tragic inability to invest one's energy in self-improvement. Live, the track had a haunting feel, hovering like sadness and doubt; on record, its barely-there backdrop makes it a mere apparition. The version captured at the Barbican doesn't measure up to some earlier performances (best exemplified by the band's Bowlie Weekender performance), but it takes advantage of the extra players, adding a slight barroom tinge to its second half, giving it a more hopeful reading by offering comfort and company to Murdoch's words rather than leaving them stranded.</p><p>
    
    As the band has changed and years have been placed between these track's first airings and today, they serve not only as a reminder of their durability but their malleability, with the once-quintessential ""The Boy Done Wrong Again"" somehow seeming the most distant and out of place track here-- the claim that ""All I wanted was to sing the saddest song"" is the antithesis of the happy-clappy records B&amp;S; now make. That Jackson and Murdoch, charming and almost vaudevillian-like in recent live shows, are restricted here to trading sideways lines that include a request to ""hang your head in shame and cry your life away"" is almost quaint, an odd reminder that despite the band's former live struggles, it did connect directly and powerfully on late-night BBC radio sessions playing gut-wrenchingly sad songs such as this.</p><p>
    
    Odd then that the record closes with ""Judy and the Dream of Horses"", another in a string of tracks about private obsessions and tentative steps toward engaging with one's sexuality. And, yet, unlike most of those that preceded it, it works itself into a gallop, allowing hints of the band's present to mingle with its past-- some overly enthusiastic harmonizing and an extra coat of paint and ""Judy"" could have fit on the band's most recent LP.</p><p>
    
    While arrangements here are strengthened and the tracks flourish, Murdoch's wallflower lyrics don't hit as hard or close to the heart coming from a live powerhouse than hushed alongside a hastily assembled collection of friends and aquantinces. The quiet, unspoken desperation of the original songs could somehow become lost on the way from being the last-ditch work of a late-20s underachiever to a flip through the scrapbook of an international indie star, but those worries are swept aside by the pride and tenderness with which the songs are delivered, readings delivered perhaps more casually thanks to the band's success. Whether listeners would take comfort in revisiting this part of their past from the safety of a different decade depends more on the individual than the songs, I imagine, as does whether a once-galvanizing line like ""Nobody writes them like they used to/ So it might as well be me"" now seems accidentally and unfortunately ironic.</p></div>"|638.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/638-if-youre-feeling-sinister-live-at-the-barbican/|9.1|Scott Plagenhoef

Anyway, this is one of the things we look for in music, and no matter how many times we find it, it's always in need of satisfying. Sad music isn't just an emotional band-aid, it's practically life support, at least for a moment. And there are always a few old favorites to revisit; like the rare friend who knows what it feels like to be you, they somehow understand everything, emphasize all the most important parts of being sad. They validate and heal. It's another way in which we live with music the same way we do with people, and probably confide a lot more. Consequently, when the music doesn't suit our sadness, it's almost offensive. ""How could I even think of playing <i>that at a time like this?"" It's all very dramatic and important, but suitably so.</i></p><p>
    
    Manchester duo George seem to work solely in the sad realm. Melodies lean, tempos drag, bells and harmoniums resonate in cathedrals of strained optimism: what little time there is for joy is used to drape a gray, rain-soaked filter over everything within earshot. Funny enough, someone sent me an instant message the other day saying that the new album wasn't sad enough. To my ears, <em>A Week of Kindness</em> (which I've repeatedly, Freudianly misread as ""a kind of weakness"") is only marginally less melancholy than their previous music, but so it goes. No greater crime than to be misunderstood, and sad music that isn't ""sad enough"" steps on feet like a steamroller. Nevertheless, I'm still pretty charmed by George. Although their 2003 cult-fave <em>The Magic Lantern</em> was indeed an almost perfect document of romantic gloom, it's not like they've changed their tune. Perhaps there's a bit more light at the end of the tunnel.</p><p>
    
    Still, it doesn't take too many passes through songs like ""The Living Sound"" or ""The New and Better Heart"" to remember your bruised, inner romantic. Suzy Mangion's vocals are still full of lilt, clear and never soaring, but drifting atop homemade arrangements of organ, snare drums, and bells. Before I'd read about ""twee"" music, I used to call this ""precious"" or even just ""modest"", and lines like ""See the living sound; no metronome goes this far"" perfectly encapsulate the kinds of miniature wisdom and diary'd epiphanies so suited to this music. George play music for being alone. Even when Mangion and partner Michael Varity sing together, as on the ultra-purple ballad ""Now You Want to Settle Down"" or ultra-daisy sing-song ""Spend My Time"", they seem dedicated to an audience of one (or less).</p><p>
    
    Elsewhere, the mood is a bit lighter, greatly assisted by stretches of ""incidental"" music like the ""Week of Wonders"" or ""Vanishing Sounds of Britain"". These pieces, short and instrumental, are like islands in between clusters of melancholy, but at a distance are hard to separate from their neighbors. When something threatens to stand apart from the murky depths, as on the bizarrely lo-fi ""Supercharge"" (borrowing a bass line from none other than <i>Smile-era Brian Wilson), it just as quickly disappears, as if sucked into a dark area that my ears never quite figured out in the first place. And then I find myself back in George's living room world, banjo in the corner of ""Song of Degrees"" and waving goodbye after a whistle and swing on ""Older Too"". It's all very dramatic, sure. It's also beautiful, if only to visit once in a while.</i></p></div>"|3622.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3622-a-week-of-kindness/|7.9|Dominique Leone

Since then, the former member of Flying Saucer Attack and AMP has relocated from Bristol to France, a move which has evidently driven his spectral music ever deeper into the brine. As indicated by its title and dissolute Parisian artwork, <em>Drinking Songs</em> is an album steeped heavily in spirits, both alcoholic and otherwise. On these tracks, Elliott seems to address the world from the sunless interior of an absinthe glass, with his rarified instrumental arrangements serving as the only thin balm available to keep his subjects from capsizing hopelessly into the ink-black, fathomless depths.</p><p>
    Marinated in café piano, mournful strings, and delicate guitar, <em>Drinking Songs</em> follows <em>The Mess We Made</em> as another hard step away from the atmospheric jungle textures of Third Eye Foundation. Here Elliott has drawn further inspiration from Eastern European folk and cabaret music, his stately compositions achieving a melancholic drama similar to Tom Waits or the Bad Seeds at their most theatrically downtrodden. What frequently sets Elliott apart, however, are his cascading, impressionistic vocals, as on the sanguine ""The Guilty Party"", where his layered voices recede almost imperceptibly into the background until barely distinguishable from the rest of his quietly nodding solo orchestra.</p><p>
    As the album progresses, Elliott broadens his narrative scope from the relatively prosaic romantic miseries of ""Trying To Explain"" and ""What's Wrong"" to the epic tragedy of ""The Kursk"", which is based upon the sunken Russian submarine of the same name. Over Chris Cole's elegiac cello, a multi-tracked Elliott sings ""The water is rising/ and we're slowly dying/ we won't see light again,"" sending loosened voices curling from every corner until their assembled force approximates a shadowy chorale rising as one from the seafloor. And though this 11-minute piece opens with various indistinct thunderstorm and shipwreck sound effects, Elliott handles the material with enough subtlety and melodic dexterity to avoid a descent into trite melodrama. </p><p>
    Likewise, Elliott displays a deft touch on ""A Waste of Blood,"" a discreet anti-war track that may hint at the true core of the album's general despair. ""The craters remain from the last time you came/ and seemingly our only crime/ was wrong place and wrong time,"" he sings, until once again his words are submerged by blurred strings and tape effects. The resulting discord leads quite naturally into the album's finale, ""The Maid We Messed"", an extended collage of deconstructed excerpts from the preceding seven songs. Across the album's sole programmed drum break, this track has the feel of a hungover man attempting to recreate the events of the previous evening, its scattered fragments of memory providing a suitably disorienting conclusion to Elliott's ethereal, unsettling collection.</p></div>"|2755.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2755-drinking-songs/|7.2|Matthew Murphy

    swells with fluid improvisational riffs and dizzying rhythms.  
    Previously appearing in Don Caballero, Storm and Stress, and Antioch  
    Arrow, the three members of Coptic Light have built careers on  
    blending noisy, off-the-cuff bursts with jazz-inspired noodling. The  
    three songs that make up this release run almost 45 minutes as they  
    swirl from penetrating, stream-of-conscience hyperactivity to dark,  
    ambient droning.</p><p>
    
    ""Mix the Races"", the first track, is the most manic. Kevin Shea's  
    rapid-fire snare drumming is incessant, and the guitar and bass  
    interplay and overlap in degrees varying from perfect harmony to  
    stark contrast. Due to the improvisational aspect, it's often difficult to  
    keep track of what's going on. The track doesn't follow  
    traditional song structures, as there are no noticeable transitions  
    between parts. In fact, the band only lets up once here when, for about a minute, the drums fall away and guitarist Jon Fine  
    drops precise, haunting notes. But before long, it erupts again, and  
    one moment bleeds into the next, creating a dense yet incredibly  
    spastic fabric of bubbling noise.</p><p>
    
    Things change considerably for ""The Horse"", where the first half of  
    the song is built on panning guitar drones and dark, tribal drumming.  
    Things slowly build as the drumming gets more aggressive and more  
    guitar notes begin to split the warble of the bass, but it never  
    reaches the chaotic heights of the previous track. The drums slide  
    seamlessly into ""Eat It High School"", the strongest, and at 19  
    minutes, the longest, of these three tracks. The most melodic of the  
    bunch, ""Eat It High School"" blends the better aspects of the first  
    two tracks. There's still plenty of convoluted snare-and-cymbal  
    crashing and over-the-top guitar work, but mixed in is a sense that  
    the band is syncing up a little closer than before. </p><p>
    
    For many listeners, the band members' individual talents will be  
    their ultimate undoing. At times, the three musicians seem so lost in  
    showing off their skills that they are hardly functioning as a unit.  
    This is the case on the album opener more than the other two, which  
    is unfortunate for the sequencing of the album. It's these moments  
    where the music tends to become less engaging and more akin to noise  
    rock. But when they hit their stride together, the sound that emerges  
    is a bizarre yet satisfying blend of precision and chaos. </p></div>"|1825.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1825-coptic-light/|6.9|Cory D. Byrom

The song tapped the same vein as the Clientele's ""Losing Haringey""-- rain-slicked spoken monologue over a mid-tempo vamp-- only for longer and with less concrete details, more coruscating electronic drones. Some will find <em>City Fallen Leaves</em>' tighter, strums-and-drums approach more appealing, but it makes a poor backdrop to David Christian's puffed-up musings on mixtapes and the arcana of London post-grad life.</p><p>
    Christian does quarter-life crisis with an admirable lack of direction. His bandmates often seem lost, too, but don't blame them: Comet Gain have shuffled through countless incarnations, Christian the only remaining alphamember. Picking up the thread, Christian and co. muster plenty of existential bluster, the keystone of the 13-year-old band-cum-franchise. Unfortunately, Wedding Present beat them to the hankie, while compatriots Belle &amp; Sebastian and Clinic dropped the moleskine confessionals for American viability.</p><p>     
    Mixtapes qua declarations of love-- fodder for ""The Ballad of a Mix Tape"" and others-- are dull but acceptable; I'd rather read <u><a href=""http://pitchforkmedia.com/columns/resonant-frequency/07-08-05.shtml"">Richardson</a></u>. The best iterations of Christian's high-romance doggerel dance a simple beat. ""The Fist's in the Pocket"" is hard to love, impossible to hate; the chorus-- two chummy voices chiming charmingly offbeat-- comes fast, easy, predictable. ""Days I Forgot to Write Down"" scampers a six with the breeze of four, plus it brings the spectral synths that made ""White Radiance of Eternity"" so darn sublime.</p><p> 
    In a way they got lucky with that one, though: Narrating over vamp, even at its best, is all smoke and mirrors. The trick is getting the hoi polloi to follow. Doors did it with narcotics on ""The End"", Velvets with putrid distortion on ""Heroin"". ""The Punk Got Fucked""'s aimlessness embodies its lost protagonist's dilemma (""Should I stay and fight or go out tonight or just turn out the lights?"") too literally, letting organ and fuzz-box'd guitar wander unleashed with only a caveman bassline to anchor. Ironic, then, when the album's backside fails with earnestness, not blas. Song after song puffs an ambered nostalgia, each one turning the same six-string pinwheels. The problem with nostalgia, see, is the slip from poignance into anticlimax happens quickly. So when closer ""Nameless"" clears the air with dynamics and a backbeat (note the chant, ""something is missing,"" maybe meta), it's too late for an album confused by its own ruminations.</p></div>"|1560.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1560-city-fallen-leaves/|5.9|Sam Ubl

If taking swings at them seems easy, it ought to. In the aftermath of late-70s garage-rock hangovers, they sound exactly as you'd expect-- hints of new wave crossing paths with uninspired power-pop and jackleg dance-rock. And yet, despite their readymade niche, their hype's been tepid in a post-holiday indie rock market blue-balled by a disappointing Strokes album.</p><p>
    
    Morningwood pride themselves as a ""fun"" band by infusing their music with energy and sexuality. The reality is, cutting a decent record takes more than a kooky stageshow and an insatiable urge to embarrass yourself. It also takes more than handclaps, call-and-response vocals, and dumb cheerleader cadences-- which, incidentally, just about sums up Morningwood's current single ""Nth Degree"", a kind of theme song the band is pushing as a means of introducing themselves to an apathetic public. Where better throwbacks such as Brooklyn-based Blood on the Wall overcome their heavily earmarked influences, Morningwood don't even <i>try</i> to put a unique spin on their pilfering: Their tracklist reads like an AudioScrobbler profile, systematically tallying new wave and glam ingredients in ways only machines and computerbrains can.</p><p>
    
    Like many style-over-substance rockers before them, Morningwood sink or swim largely on the strength of its frontperson, in this case Chantel Claret, an ingenue undeservedly netting comparisons to Karen O and Siouxsie Sioux. Though a touch of early Pretenders or Runaways may occasionally poke through for necessary grit, Claret snags more persona and influence from pop princesses past and present: ""Nth Degree"" is a poor woman's Gwen Stefani rapping on Franz Ferdinand demos, replacing the now-legendary ""B-A-N-A-N-A-S"" chant with the vastly more mindless ""M-O/ M-O-R/ M-O-R-N-I-N-G/ W-O-O-D."" Similarly, ""New York Girls"" spoils the album's best bassline with a shoutout straight from <em>Bring It On</em>: ""N-N-N-New York girls, come on, you know you're hot/ A-A-A-Attitude, and that's what makes you rock!!""</p><p>
    
    That attitude carries over to Claret's lyrics: ""Take Off Your Clothes"" painfully xeroxes ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"", subbing teen angst for locker room hormones as she gasps, ""Your happy trail, it's in my happy trail/ And your treasure trial, let's see what goes down!"" until ex-Spacehog guitarist Richard Steel ejaculates an imitation Joey Santiago riff for the chorus. Here and elsewhere, producer Gil Norton immaculately regenerates his past work for Pixies and Echo &amp; the Bunnymen, though even occasionally recycling those great old sonics can't rescue these songs. As if the
    songwriting didn't show its wires enough, ""Nth Degree"" invites you to ""rock n' roll,"" ""disco,"" and ""turn up the radio,"" but does so with tongue-in-cheek instead of fists in the air. So not even Morningwood take themselves too seriously, but instead of offering playful, engaging pop music, we get new wave retreads and a couple of rock journeymen and the whole thing comes off like an overgrown episode of MTV's ""Making the Band"".</p></div>"|5670.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5670-morningwood/|3.9|Adam Moerder

But behind all of his eccentricities-- the gothic song titles, the experimental tape loops, the Lautréamont quotes, the sex and violence, the gnomic pseudo-Rosicrucian claptrap-- there's also a perpetual obsession with the same silly objects. The man never tires of bodily fluids, humming toddlers, and barnyard sound effects. I have no idea if this contradicts or strengthens his occultism, but neither of these tendencies-- the darkly surreal or the goofily quotidian-- has grown old over the course of the past quarter-century. He gets away with his pessimism and extremism because his tongue is so firmly pressed against his bloody cheeks.</p><p>
    In the same spirit, Stapleton once claimed to only ""make up songs about being born""-- and he's been born hundreds of times. By anyone's count, he's released over 100 albums and EPs since Nurse With Wound's 1979 debut, <em>Chance Meeting on a Dissecting Table of a Sewing Machine and an Umbrella, and covered everything from scathing noise to lilting new-age.  The man released 10 CDs </em><em>in the past 12 months</em>.  As I write this review, he's preparing a limited-edition absinthe-paraphernalia box. Sure, it's easy to deride his eternally unfashionable oddities. It's even easier to just give up on the whole enterprise, since who could possibly have the time to sort through this horde of recordings?  Not even Stapleton, apparently-- his new double-disc retrospective ""variety pack"" seems to bounce around from the mid-1980s to the late-90s like obscure vinyl singles were just falling from the sky.</p><p>
    There's simply no way Stapleton could satisfy everyone with <em>Livin' Fear of James Last</em>. It would either have to compile easily obtainable singles at the expense of long-time fans or promote obscure 12-inches at the expense of neophytes. His approach is to not even try to balance the equation. Two of Nurse With Wound's most legendary albums-- <em>Merzbild Schwet</em> and <em>Homotopy to Marie</em>-- aren't represented at all. In fact, there are virtually no songs from the outfit's most fertile period (1980-84), one-third of the pieces are edited, and a good chunk of the album was available on Stapleton's prior compilations, <i>Automating, Volumes 1 &amp; 2.</i></p><p>
    But, like his dadaist heroes, Stapleton makes arresting sequences out of utter chaos, and <i>James Last</i> is no exception. It's nearly impossible to discern which tracks come from which album, or even which decade. While most mid-80s electronic and tape-based albums sound increasingly primitive in the Age of iBook, NWW's deafening armory continues to shock and pulverize with ribald energy. <em>Chance Meeting</em>'s ""The Six Buttons of Sex Appeal"" shreds moaning-infant samples with piston percussion and haywire pager bleating. ""Dirty Fingernails"" tempers its rusty wheezing with Looney Tunes caricatures, seeming more like a precursor to Negativland than power electronics. <em>Thunder Perfect Mind</em>'s ""Cold"" begins with electrocuted xylophones and then winds through the history of 20th century experimentalism, from classical serialism to sulfurous noise.</p><p>
    NWW earned early accolades for this uncompromising brand of corrugated static and angst, but Stapleton hit a wall in the late-80s and began diluting his more out-there work with unpredictable elements of pop, dub, and international folk. Drilling klezmer and brass bands make show-stopping appearances. ""Two Halves and a Shine"" torques Cadillac-loving hip-hop. And on 1997's ""Subterranean Zappa Blues"", Stapleton pays the obvious homage to Dylan and <i>Freak Out-era Mothers, but ends up sounding more like low-budget Tom Waits, all grimy bass and kazoo orchestras. </i></p><p>
    In recent years Stapleton has redoubled his efforts to create eerie, make-believe field recordings. Nothing in his heralded early days is as evocative as the muted lunar frequencies and bent antennas of 2002's ""Ag Canadh Thuas Sa Speir"". Even better is the dark <i>National Geographic</i> rhythms during the psychotropic menagerie of his Current 93 collaboration ""Die, Flip or Go to India"".</p><p>
    Of course, if the sheer range of moods and instruments here leaves some inevitably dull gaps, there are flickers of brilliance everywhere. The entire first disc constitutes some of the most rewarding and affective music of the last several years, while the second is more dependent on ominous and bizarre monologues. They're still entertaining but not as compulsively listenable as NWW's purely instrumental work. (The one exception is the near-perfect synthesis of hilarious narrative and chilling ambiance on ""A New Dress"".) Even fans with dozens of albums have probably heard only a fraction of these pieces. Conversely, <em>James Last is virtually the only primer available for those who've never delved into the fearless mayhem of the NWW discography. </em></p></div>"|5872.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5872-livin-fear-of-james-last/|8.2|Alex Linhardt

They recorded half of this album in a bedroom. And they appropriate dance and pop music like smarmy indie kids, grabbing whatever they want and singing in a crooning falsetto lyrics that barely take themselves seriously. Every warning light went off when I started listening to Awesome New Republic, and yet I can't stop playing the album, which not only lives up to its own jokes and conceits but delivers some of contemporary indie rock's best neurotic party tracks.</p><p>
    
    A one-time quintet now pared down to two guys, Miami-based ANR build most of their songs on Brian Robertson's keys and drum machines and Michael-John Hancock's vocals. They're an indie rock band at heart, but my bloglish isn't deep enough to categorize everything they're doing, from electro and funk, to the freak folk-nodding sparse harp and acoustic guitar on ""Dirge"". And ""Kill South Beach Dead"" is a punk anthem sung by grown-ups, and probably closer to how these guys sounded when they were pissed-off Miami teens: ""Roll deep and kill South Beach dead/ Drop out of magnet school/ Sign up for special ed.""</p><p>
    
    The lyrics are smarmy jokes just barely pulled off. Sensitive slow dance song ""Going Down"" turns out to be about blow jobs-- ""My eyes may dart around the room/ But I just want to fill your mouth""-- and it namechecks Barack Obama, just because it feels so right. But sometimes the juxtaposition of crass and serious lyrics come off as nigh-brilliant, or at least brilliantly uncomfortable, like when Hancock's admiring the c-section scar on his married lover and tells her it gave him ""an erection about near the strength of my arm.""</p><p>
    
    I don't know where Hancock's coming from as a singer. Are his bouts of comic crudeness supposed to undercut the smooth crooning sex machine persona that he sometimes adopts? Or is it just random? He has the pipes to carry these songs, even if sometimes you can still hear a drunk indie kid who took a bet to sing ""Cry Me a River"" at a karaoke night, and realized he could pull it off. Right now, he's something like a Har Mar Superstar with ideas, perspective, and a brain, but he could probably take more lessons from Bryan Ferry. </p><p> 
    
    But musically, <em>ANR So Far</em> is fully formed and totally enjoyable, pulling off every lurch from genre to genre. It's loaded with great moments, from ""Going Down""'s sentimental keyboard line to the way the horns erupt like a flock of birds in the pre-coital bliss of ""The Clap"". I'm a sucker for a record where you can hear the band throw a hundred random ideas into a pile and watch every one fall into place. To paraphrase their song, this debut comes from magnet school <em>and</em> special ed, but they strike the right balance between the two. </p></div>"|495.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/495-anr-so-far/|7.9|Chris Dahlen

For Metallica, Slayer, and, to a lesser degree, Megadeth, success has only periodically waned, but Anthrax, while massively popular and rightly influential in their heyday, never recovered from the 90s post-grunge fallout. Now, more than 15 years after the disbandment of their key lineup, Island attempts to reclaim some of Anthrax's lost glory (and fanbase) with the double-disc retrospective <i>Anthrology</i>. Representing more than half of the songs from each of the band's strongest records-- 1985's <em>Spreading the Disease</em>, 1987's <em>Among the Living</em>, 1988's <em>State of Euphoria</em>, and 1990's <em>Persistence of Time</em>-- as well as a careful selection of B-sides and EP cuts, this compilation makes the most effective possible argument for the group's re-evaluation.</p><p>
    
    Anthrax began their career in conventional early-80s metal form, emulating heroes Judas Priest, and neither their classic lineup nor their signature sound would solidify until singer Joey Belladonna brought his crisp, often theatrical vocals to the band's second full-length, 1985's <i>Spreading the Disease</i>. Though even this outing is clearly the work of a band still searching for its strengths, it plants the seeds for what was to follow. <i>Anthrology</i> kicks off with a handful of tracks from the underrated album and therefore doesn't make as strong an initial entry as it might have, had it drawn its opening material from the band's vastly superior 1987 follow-up, <i>Among the Living</i>.</p><p>
    
    Thanks to beefed-up production, sophisticated arrangements, and hints of crossover hardcore, <em>Among the Living</em> gave Anthrax their first real breakthrough, and appropriately, the album's crunchy rhythms, howling vocals, dense riffing, and comic-themed lyrics defined the band through the remainder of their first decade. Standouts ""Caught in a Mosh"", ""I Am the Law"", and the title track became so highly regarded within the band's catalog that they remained live set staples even through the post-Belladonna 90s. Following these highlights, the inclusion of two cuts from 1987's <i>I'm the Man</i> renders that EP entirely useless: The novelty of the title track, at once both a piss-take and homage to the Beastie Boys and early Rick Rubin hip-hop, managed to strike a chord with listeners outside the band's immediate fanbase, while the group's stellar cover of Black Sabbath's ""Sabbath Bloody Sabbath"" still holds its own with the original in terms of sheer aggression.</p><p>
    
    Even the band admits that <em>State of Euphoria</em> was a weak follow-up to its previous outings. In <i>Anthrology</i>'s liner notes, they complain of being rushed and regret not spending more time on the material. Their negligence shows: While not necessarily dead weight, these tracks lack the focus and vitriol of Anthrax's prior efforts, playing instead to the band's rep as metal's resident knuckleheads. After a two-year break, they followed up with the more substantive <i>Persistence of Time</i>, a highly divisive offering that would mark the end of this lineup. Perhaps an attempt to shed their nice-guy image, the album serves as the angriest and most mature release of their career. ""Time"" is particularly powerful: A seven-minute thrash marvel, its relentless rhythm and crushing guitar riffing established the album's mood, and the other cuts represented from that album accentuate its significance.</p><p>
    
    Two B-sides close out the collection: The first is their infamous 1991 Public Enemy cover ""Bring the Noise"", featuring Chuck D himself, whose gruff bark always sounded great against the loudest possible backdrops; the other is a French-language version of ""Antisocial"", which while potentially improved in its native tongue (it was originally recorded by French metalheads Trust) is ruined by poorly layered vocals and obvious overdubbing.</p><p>
    
    Whether Anthrax will ever see a renaissance remains to be seen. It's certainly possible that they may <i>not</i>, particularly given their good-natured sense of humor, a serious taboo in metal culture. But though their records largely faded from popularity during the great 90s alterna-rock boom-- a situation compounded by the band's increased appreciation for non-metal-approved hip-hop (e.g. anything that wasn't Body Count), and most fatally, Belladonna's departure and eventual replacement by Armored Saint vocalist John Bush-- this compilation should serve to convince ex-fans and newcomers that, if nothing else, Anthrax's creative apex proved them an innovating force in a genre that may at times place too great a value on time-honored tradition.</p></div>"|494.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/494-anthrology-no-hit-wonder-1985-1991/|7.7|Cory D.

Their first two albums established their love of classic 
    pop and the alt-country sounds of the mid-90s, but the trail went cold after 
    2001's <i>Rodeo City as David Dewese and Jerry James worked on other things in 
    separate parts of the country. <em>Hesitation Eyes</em> is their long-time-coming 
    third LP, recorded via the ever-popular tapes-through-the-mail technique. 
    Strangely, it's also their highest-fi record yet.</i></p><p>
    
    Dewese and James alternate lead vocals, switching off every other 
    song for most of the record. One of them-- they never specify who sings on 
    what-- has a powerful, dusky croon, while the other gets by with a cranky 
    indie rock croak. The two sound best, though, in two-part harmony, 
    especially on the title track, which closes the album with a blast of 
    glorious falsetto power-pop, tambourine filling in the backbeat amid 
    thumping toms and descending guitar chords that read like a tour of Cheap 
    Trick's greatest hits. The band takes a similar approach on ""Just Because"", 
    which rightfully should be the album opener, but is instead slotted behind 
    ""Harvard Hands"", a song that's too slow and uneventful for track one 
    billing.</p><p>
    
    Sequencing errors aside, the record is characterized by strong songcraft and 
    a few nicely chosen sonic flourishes, such as the e-bowed lead guitar on 
    ""Everything Changes"" or the weird, spacey noises that open ""I'm Still in 
    Love"" in a universe somewhere parallel to the minimal piano and drum shuffle 
    of the song itself. As such, <em>Hesitation Eyes</em> is a sturdy album, a slightly more sophisticated update of the band's past output, and an indication that even with a non-traditional working relationship, the duo still has room to grow.</p></div>"|3353.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3353-hesitation-eyes/|7.3|Joe Tangari

    first hearing you just can't wait to hear the record that follows.
    ""Drops"" leads off Thomas Brinkmann's latest and it
    <em>rips</em>, the kind of rigidly funky early-80s drums that made James
    Murphy pick up sticks as a teenager wedded to a minimal bass pulse,
    with fountains of jazzy variation coming from backwards beats and
    synth rushes that swoop down on the groove in hopes of tearing off a
    piece. Then the voice and nothing else: ""Drops"", which Brinkmannn
    eventually lets slip that the sample comes from a mentholyptus
    advertisement ""M-m-m-m medicated cough drops."" Yes.</p><p>
    Of late, Brinkmann prefers monkeying around to consistency. His last few albums have a few of these burners, a few experiments that sometimes fall flat, and then a number of punchy if not terribly memorable dubby techno tracks interspersed throughout. This time Brinkmann puts his spin on pop, incorporating vocals here and there and even going so far as to cover Morrissey. On ""The More You Ignore Me the Closer I Get"", Brinkmann brings in Natalie Beridze to sing, whom he knows from prior collaborations on her TBA project.</p><p>
    While TBA's strange and unpredictable 2005 release <em>Annulé</em> (also on Max
    Ernst) has something to recommend, as a vocalist Beridze is not much,
    with a style that basically consists of reciting words in a bored
    monotone. Electronic producers taking on the Smiths/Morrissey songbook
    has been an exciting mini-trend in the last five years but this is a
    missed opportunity. Her contributions to the title track and ""Margins""
    are slightly more interesting, perhaps because expectations are lower,
    but still not enough to make me wish for more.
    </p><p>
    Ignore these average-at-best moments and you have two-thirds of an excellent
    album. The man himself sings on ""Maschine"", casting a goth shadow to a
    dense and bubbly techno concoction, but it's the vocal-free tracks
    that really affirm his talent. ""Jacknot"" actually works as a pop
    instrumental, with a progression and tunefulness that suggests an ace
    videogame theme expertly remixed for the dancefloor. ""Work"" is
    punchier than ""Drops"" and just as compelling, foregrounding Brinkmann's
    always propulsive programming. And really, for Brinkmann, that's the
    thing. His rhythm style has always brought to mind the word ""swing""
    and on ""Charleston"" he makes it official, adding respectful but
    effective beats to a fully intact live performance of the tune by
    Django Reinhart. In this way <em>Lucky Hands</em> ends as good as it begins;
    shame about the sag in the middle.

    debut solo LP, <em>Unfinished Monkey Business</em>, was still 
    somewhat fresh. I had a program on a small college station and tried to play the 
    instrumental title track near the end of my show, but was forced to fade it 
    out halfway through because it was too awful for words. Still, I was a Stone 
    Roses maniac at the time and gave it another chance a week later, spinning 
    ""Corpses in Their Mouths"" (in its entirety). Lyrics like ""She smokes 
    crack/ It's off the beaten track"" notwithstanding, it was a pretty cool song, 
    with a sort of slinky vibe, spaghetti Western guitars, and stylish 
    production, and it somewhat restored my faith that perhaps one of the 
    members of the Stone Roses might be capable of something great outside the 
    band.</p><p>
    
    Three Ian Brown albums later (discounting a remix disc), I'm still 
    hesitant to refer to anything he's done as ""great,"" but he has managed a few 
    choice tracks on each solo LP, and now some of the best are gathered in 
    one place on <i>The Greatest, a collection with a title that's presumably 
    intended as a play on his reputation for arrogance (in his music if not his 
    personal life). Also included are his two UNKLE guest spots, ""Be There"" and 
    ""REIGN"", and obligatory new tracks, ""Return of the Fisherman"" 
    and ""All Ablaze"". Everything is arranged chronologically, and even alternate 
    or new versions of certain songs are slotted with tracks from the same album 
    as the original recording.</i></p><p>
    
    ""My Star"" isn't exactly the most auspicious opener, with its horrendous faux Indian music intro, tired NASA samples, and 
    hokey lyrics about astronauts and ""space exploration,"" but the mellow 
    detachment of ""Corpses in Their Mouths"" rights things quickly. The three 
    <em>Golden Greats</em> cuts included are generally a cut above the material from the 
    first album, especially the scientifically questionable ""Dolphins Were 
    Monkeys"", which rides a funky, fuzzed-over Rhodes groove and employs busy 
    production that makes it more difficult to understand what Brown is singing. 
    ""Golden Gaze"" has the kind of fuzzy electro stomp you figure Led Zeppelin 
    might have happened upon had they continued into the mid-90s.</p><p>
    
    The mid-90s are what I most think of when listening to this disc, in fact. 
    Even the material recorded well beyond the close of that decade, like the 
    three tracks from 2004's <i>Solarized, sound wedded to those years, and 
    it's pretty remarkable how consistent the production style is from album to 
    album. This collection works almost as though the songs were all recorded in 
    a one or two-year span-- </i><i>Solarized opener ""Longsight M13"", for instance, with 
    its anthemic stomp, vaguely Eastern melody, and bleepy effects, sits 
    comfortably next to the heavily phased electro-Britpop of ""Can't See Me"", a 
    song six years its senior.</i></p><p>
    
    The two UNKLE tracks stick out for their comparatively stark 
    musical backings, but Brown's vocals, double-tracked as always, unite them 
    with the other material easily. ""Be There"", a one-off single from 1999, 
    comes across as too repetitive, but ""REIGN"", from UNKLE's unheralded second album <i>Never, Never, Land, is pretty 
    good, with a rough beat styled from some nice breaks and a well-chosen 
    string sample. The song serves as a nice companion to </i><i>Music of the Spheres</i>
    opener ""F.E.A.R."", one of Brown's best solo tracks with its well-scored 
    string arrangement and slow, churning beat.</p><p>
    
    As the cherries on top, the new songs aren't terribly sweet. ""Return of the 
    Fisherman"" is clumsy, stuffed with vocals that don't line up with the 
    rhythm track and a chorus that rhymes ""king"" and ""sing"" over and over again, 
    while ""All Ablaze"" is serviceable but hardly essential, closing the 
    compilation with a bit of buzzy psychedelia overrun with wandering 
    special-effects guitar. <i>The Greatest is easily Brown's best solo release, as 
    it should be, even if he doesn't always hit the mark.</i></p></div>"|970.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/970-the-greatest/|7.0|Joe Tangari

The four musicians performing the 28 tracks on <em>Hey!: Live Pixies 2004-2005</em>, which were culled from performances in 17 cities, are the same four people who performed together in small venues during the late 1980s and early 90s, who recorded the influential and beloved albums <em>Surfer Rosa</em> and <em>Doolittle</em>, and whose conflicting egos led to their infamous demise via fax machine. The line-up remains the same-- octopus-armed David Lovering on drums, Joey Santiago on guitar, bassist Kim Deal, and Charles Michael Kittridge ""Frank Black Francis"" Thompson IV leading the group down into the depths among the crustaceans and sea gods-- but the band itself seems noticeably different: The Pixies' legacy has solidified in the 12 years since their breakup, which inevitably affects how its members play their music and how we hear it.</p><p>  Released initially through eMusic.com (and later this month via other internet retailers), <em>Hey!</em> includes popular choices like ""Here Comes Your Man"" and two versions of ""Wave of Mutilation"" (the traditional, and the ""UK Surf"" b-side version) along with album tracks from nearly all of the band's releases, which makes it a useful counterpart to 2004's <em>Wave of Mutilation: The Best of the Pixies</em>. Despite covering numerous shows, <em>Hey!</em> still retains the shape of a single, very long concert. It's difficult to think of better back-to-back openers than these fierce renditions of ""Planet of Sound"" and ""Debaser"", especially when ""Gouge Away"" follows. ""La La Love You"" is a strangely diverting intermission, ""Vamos"" closes the show (despite Lovering losing the beat once or twice), and ""Gigantic"" is the evening's only encore, with the band members wishing each other good night on the outro.  What it lacks in stage banter and crowd response <em>Hey!</em> makes up for with a strong tracklist and careful sequencing.</p><p>  The Pixies don't dramatically reinvent many of these songs, but instead give them alternately ferocious and workmanlike run-throughs that are, above all else, faithful to the originals. The most drastic reinvention is the acoustic take on ""Here Comes Your Man"", which gives the song a shambolic gait that plays up its main ascending riff, but mostly <em>Hey!</em> contains leaner and often more aggressive versions of favorites like ""Planet of Sound"", ""Mr. Grieves"", and ""Subbacultcha"". Not surprisingly, these songs prove extremely durable, retaining all the nervy weirdness and jittery explosiveness of their earlier incarnations. Black even hits all the old barks and whoops and rockmejoes (especially on ""Crackity Jones"" and ""Bone Machine""), which at first comes across as rote and practiced in contrast to his more seemingly spontaneous studio versions.  Fortunately, his vocals on <em>Hey!</em> never slump into mimicry of his younger self; rather, his tics remain as crucial to and as inseparable from the songs as their lyrical and guitar riffs.</p><p>  Despite the looseness of the dynamic and the astringency of their sound, the band reveals an affectionate devotion to these songs that countervails any hint of in-it-for-the-money opportunism behind the reunion.  But while they play the same songs in roughly the same way, these Pixies aren't the same Pixies of 1988 or 1990 or 1992. There are subtle differences, most notably in their vocals. Deal's voice has lost some of its whispery sweetness, and gained a coarser texture that roughens the edges of ""Gigantic"" and ""Ed Is Dead"".  And Francis' voice has grown huskier, grittier, and lower, losing almost all of its nasal tone.  Moreover, there's a different tension here than I remember from the band's heyday.  They seem looser and less uptight, perhaps not as driven or as obscure, but seemingly having a much better time on stage.  ""Debaser"" even has a little swing in it as Black sings about <em>Un Chien Andalou</em>.</p><p>  Ultimately, the Pixies sound different; they feel bigger now, more revered and appreciated. Maybe it's because they're playing larger venues for younger, enthusiastic crowds, or perhaps because they've been identified as the forebears of so much of today's indie rock, but they sound positively charged here.  The downside to this resurgence is that it's difficult to think of the Pixies in the present tense. They're like classic rock now-- especially considering how little new material this reunion has spawned to date--  and <em>Hey!</em> finds them walking a thin timeline between embracing their legacy and fighting off the past tense.</p><p> </p></div>"|6320.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6320-hey-live-pixies-2004-2005/|8.2|Stephen M.

But as invigorating as some of their earlier records are, the band didn't begin to gain a substantial following outside the metal world until 2003's outstanding <em>Akuma No Uta</em>-- parodying the artwork of Nick Drake's <em>Bryter Layter</em>-- struck a chord with independent music fans seeking an antidote to the more polite pop sounds of the Shins, Sufjan, and Death Cab for Cutie.  Now, following more than a decade of hard labor and a swarm of 2005 releases, the trio gives their ever-expanding audience something to chew on: <em>Pink</em> is their best album yet, and by some distance the most accessible of their career to date.</p><p>  The past 12 months have been increasingly kind to louder and more challenging artists, but even if Sunn0))) hadn't droned onto discerning hipsters' iPods, it's not difficult to imagine the awesomeness of <em>Pink</em>-- a supremely well-paced rock'n'roll album that's quickly winning over even long-suffering metalphobes-- helping these Japanese veterans leap-frog indie kids into a <em>New York Times</em> Arts &amp; Leisure mention.  If you don't believe me, sneak a listen to the spaced-out seven-minute opener, which manages to combine the best elements of classic British shoegaze and Sigur Rós with bliss-out metal faves Jesu and Isis.  Just don't bank on the rest of the album to follow in its footsteps.  After all, the three folks behind it-- guitarist Wata, bassist/vocalist Takeshi, and drumming vocalist Atsuo-- are the same atom-smashers who nicked their named from a Melvins song, operate the Walmart-friendly Fangs Anal Satan record label, and downshift from blown-out Motörhead to Earth on a dime.  They've collaborated thrice with Merzbow, worshipped amplifiers with multitasking experimental rock legend Keiji Haino, and chilled with noise legend Masonna.  Put simply, they're too restless (and ambitious) to fixate on a single style.</p><p>  So, after allowing the opener to evaporate, Boris jump-cut to the album's title cut-- a full-throttle psych riot.  Track three's high-octane guitars circle Atsuo's ""yeah""'s and ""ooh""'s until treating us to a magnificent feedback'n'drum finale.  Track four ups the fuel intake, sporting <em>Pink</em>'s highest in-the-red ratio, while track five sweeps aside its predecessors with a pile of industrial Melvins sludge topped with sheering <em>Blade Runner</em> delay, six-string atmospherics, and angstful, wailed vocals.  Then, as that brief respite passes, ""Electric"" cranks the cowbell for two minutes of instrumental boogie, replete with tiny post-punk guitar daggers closing out the song.  And there's still <em>more </em> distorted head space to follow, all of it well-stitched and feral.  To keep it brief, key moments include: 1) the rising/falling near-pop vocals and final wall of fuzz on track seven; 2) stoner handclaps and Olivia Tremor Control studio effects on track eight; and 3) the textural shift of track nine, where bone-dry, gutteral drums and crashing junk-shard cymbals overtake the bass fuzz and vocals completely.</p><p>  Enter the finale.  Ten seconds of silence introduces the gentle strum and softly brushed drums of the penultimate ""My Machine"".  Its mood hearkens back to the opening song, briefly reprising its blissed-out tone, but two minutes later, reveals itself instead as a forward-looking antidotal preface to <em>Pink</em>'s final 10-minute juggernaut and standout track.  The closer delivers an absolutely massive wallop, overlapping entropic vocal lines with furious ambient spillage.  I used to think that, of everyone in the punk realm, Unwound or Drive Like Jehu had the best control over their feedback flutters, but this thing's gonzo in its perfectly dense acrobatics.  And best of all, its unshakably addictive refrain, blistering, scorched-out guitars, thunderous, supercharged rock, and countless change-ups not only warrant its extended length, but make it feel about half as long as it actually is, and keep the listener fully engaged throughout its entire runtime.</p><p>  As their timeline suggests-- or, to be more accurate, as their history makes it impossible to guess-- Boris could follow <em>Pink</em> with an hour of fried electro-acoustic guitar, powerbook, and piano glitches.  Or they could soundtrack a short film in braille.  Then, of course, there's <em>Altar</em>, their much-anticipated upcoming collaboration with Sunn0))).  But for now, basking in <em>Pink</em>'s riptide, Wata, Takeshi, and Atsuo are 2006's balls-out riff-makers to beat.  The bar's been raised high and early, rockers-- don't bump your head when you try to sneak under it.</p><p> </p></div>"|1185.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1185-pink/|8.7|Brandon Stosuy

The flurry of the city isn't something best described as ""beautiful"" so much as alive, unstoppable, cruel, and complex.</p><p>
    
    American composer (and native New Yorker) Steve Reich has been writing the definitive city soundtrack for 40 years. From his early tape pieces ""Come Out"" and ""It's Gonna Rain"", to his now classic minimalist works-- though Reich would certainly scoff at the term-- <i>Drumming and Music For 18 Musicians, to more recent works bother greater in scope and somehow conventionally attractive (<em>Tehillim</em></i>, <em>Different Trains</em>, <em>The Desert Music</em>), he's invented a sound that nails both the intricate detail and speed-ridden blur of some abstract ""downtown."" Where Philip Glass's music from the 1960s and 70s is vaguely futuristic and precise, Reich's is warm. Where Terry Riley, who never felt a particularly strong allegiance to the minimal aesthetic in the first place, is boundless and organic, Reich is brainy, propulsive, and hardened to the interiors of a metallic landscape. I read someone call him the ""greatest living American composer,"" and though any all-encompassing title is debatable, you'd be hard pressed to find a more fitting example of individualism and stubborn will so often identified with this place.</p><p>
<em>You Are (Variations)</em>. is Reich's first CD of new material since the not altogether warmly received <em>Three Tales</em> (2002). If the composer has suffered complaints from critics of lacking ambition in recent years, he hasn't let that affect his writing: <i>You Are is prime Reich, using choral and orchestral elements similarly to older pieces like <em>Tehillim</em> and <em>The Desert Music</em>, but seeming as rhythmically driven as anything he's done in years. Harmonically, he sticks to majors and relative minors (that is, a minor key that utilizes the same notes as a major one, but starts from a different point in the scale)-- a common Reich device-- thereby blurring the line between different tonalities. He uses a choir to impart text translated from Hasidic mystical verse: ""You are wherever your thoughts are"", ""Explanations come to an end somewhere,"" and the idea of saying ""little and do much"". Words are repeated and spread out over great lengths, so the end effect is not one of narrative but of words as purely musical ingredients.</i></p><p>
    
    The ""variations"" in <i>You Are take up most of the CD, but the closing track is Reich's <em>Cello Counterpoint</em>, featuring cellist Maya Beiser (Bang On a Can) overdubbed eight times to create a surprisingly dense string ensemble. As Reich points out in the CD insert, the cello is great because its capable of resonating clearly in a very wide range-- this piece was actually written for a full string octet, but its marked accents and interweaving melodies sound great all performed by one person. There is a slight similarity to <em>Different Trains</em></i> for string quartet, though <i>Cello Counterpoint</i> is nowhere near as ""industrial,"" sounding more conventional, perhaps less confrontational, yet still unmistakably Reich. As with the <em>You Are</em> tracks, the constant rumble of motion fills up whatever mental space I have to drift away from the music.

That was my guess, at least, on hearing these maquillaged soft-vowel-lovers. Sixth boroughites like their garments bright and their synths dug up on eBay. Or maybe it's the other way round. Either way, Rah Bras meet the criteria then wrap their wares in goth bondage. Only they rep Richmond.</p><p>
    The canard of spazz rock is that it's rarely all that spastic. Need New Body and Polysics play it too straight rhythmically to inspire convulsive dancing-- at least among the non-pill-popping set. Bablicon jumble the beat like lotto balls but they're hardly paroxysmal. In Hella we find stiff angles and sufficient contortion, but how much technical proficiency makes a contradiction in terms?</p><p>
    Sure, Rah Bras mathematize enough compound meters to keep a <em>Modern Drummer</em> nerd busy for a month. Their struggle, however, is in the process they can sacrifice their power. Recourses are motorik eighths and hard backbeats, like on opener ""As She Rah"", which gridlocks swirling synth gak with bouts of Queensryche-style double kick. ""Skin = Chronized"" follows with ugly, zippering synths and burning-fuselage static, but again towering drum pads do some spinal readjustment. On songs like ""Herculine Androgyn"" and ""War Ribbing Ode"" the Rahs abandon structural precepts altogether, riding stiff, blocky rhythms like a mechanical bull. The latter, which combines metal kicks and a very guitar-like synth run, hints at jammier underpinnings, and indeed, the band imagines some not-too-distant nexus of the universe where Dream Theater and Andrew WK intersect.</p><p>
    If <i>Whohm's rhythmic linearity doesn't exactly secure Rah Bras' spazz badge, neither does its tenderness. Two longer, groove-finding pieces exhale and machinate at easier tempi: ""Venis"", brassy with a flatulent bassline, features ethereal female vocals above the nastiness. They're complemented by a surprisingly delicate filigree of synths, airier than Air. ""Mother Put the Wheel Away I Cannot Spin Tonight"" hops on the recent trend toward sentimental tokenism-- specifically, it's the kind of slowed-up, restrained, slightly mawkish, melody-fluent tour de force with which Maxïmo Park (""Acrobat"") and Yeah Yeah Yeahs (""Maps"") disrupted their albums' track orders. Call it spazz, chopped and screwed.</i></p><p>
<em>Whohm</em> is an itinerant half hour. Forget semantics for a sec and there's still no obvious, practical way to term it. Which is to say: Rah Bras have hit upon an attractive disjunct, but ambivalence always problematizes itself. Had they structured the album more decisively, without such incoherent chiaroscuro, and with more heart-stoppers like ""Mother"" in place of the wonky padding, it would have made more sense. But then, eBay fashionistas think clash is a gas-- even, evidently, in Richmond.</p></div>"|6929.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6929-whohm/|6.8|Sam Ubl

    your pants to dip a toe into the waters of dub, this might not be the record 
    for you. At 50 songs and three discs, <i>Trojan Dub Rarities is an 
    embarrassment of riches. It's also dense as hell. Anything that says 
    ""rarities"" in the title is probably not for the first timer, the casual fan, 
    the curious dilettante.</i></p><p>
    
    For anyone born after 1975, especially the average Pitchfork reader (and 
    writer), hearing dub for the first time can be disorienting. Dub has been 
    absorbed into popular music in so many ways that have little to do with the 
    Jamaican music of the '70s that bears the same name-- German techno, Fugazi 
    basslines, overblown echo on shoegaze remixes. The first true dub record I 
    bought (a King Tubby collection on Blood &amp; Fire) left me with a 
    bizarrely redundant revelation: hey, this is <i>reggae.</i></p><p>
    
    Psychedelically saturated and studio-addled reggae, yes. Everything I had 
    been told about dub was true: Here was the alpha and the omega of all the 
    production wizardry that followed. But it still sounded like, you know, 
    reggae. A month or so later I got the <i>Arkology box, a set of Lee Perry's 
    Island-era recordings, and was definitely Hooked on Dub. But it was even 
    more song-based than Tubby. What gives?</i></p><p>
    
    A Simon Reynolds article in <i>The Wire later that year conveniently 
    articulated a lot of what I had been wondering after my initial dub 
    experiences. Reynolds argued that, in the '90s, all the instrumental, 
    studio, and electronic music (jungle, Basic Channel, all that ""macro dub 
    infection"" stuff that seems as cutely dated to the '90s as grunge now) that 
    picked up from dub left out a few important facts. Like that dubs were 
    versions of singers singing popular songs. (Such as the gorgeous ""Daughter 
    Dub"" on </i><i>Dub Rarities by the silken-throated Cornell Campbell.) Or that 
    dub was religious and political music. (Both of which are all over </i><i>Dub 
    Rarities, quoting ital dietary laws and bigging up Marcus Garvey.)</i></p><p>
    
    So if you don't have something of an interest in reggae, dub may not be for 
    you. But let's say you do, or you're at least curious enough to have read 
    this far. Should you pick up <i>Trojan Dub Rarities? Yes and no.</i></p><p>
    
    Yes, because it contains music like a shimmering version of the ""Police and 
    Thieves"" rhythm (""Babylon Police Thief Dub"" by Perry and Augustus Pablo) that saturates the jolly skank of the original with gold 
    dust. Or the stern sermonizing of ""Revolution Version"" by Tapper Zukie and 
    the Musical Intimidators, an island cousin to the Last Poets' ""Niggers Are Scared of Revolution"". And then there are the one-off 
    oddities that can delight even seasoned dub-watchers, like the Observers' 
    ""Iron Fist,"" which sounds wholly synthesized, coming off like Aphex circa 
    <i>I Care Because You Do or the queer, sour vignettes on the Vitalic 
    album.</i></p><p>
    
    No, because as I said before, it's all a bit much. One thing people seem 
    afraid to say is that a lot of dub sounds, well, same-y. Given the 
    voraciousness of the day-to-day 45 consumer in 1970s Jamaica, with each single 
    coming with a dub version on the B-side, there was a lot of rhythm and 
    effects recycling going on. Not all of these <i>Rarities are mind-blowing 
    finds from the vault. Spread across the 50 tracks there are any number of 
    perfunctory gallumphing rhythms and liberally applied echoplex. Calling 
    something ""Tedious Dub"" might be an easy opening for a joke, but...</i></p><p>
    
    Anyway, if you're enough of a dub fanatic to want this, you don't really 
    need my recommendation or my jackleg history lesson. Like all of Trojan's 
    3xCD mini box sets, <i>Dub Rarities retails for something like two 
    sawbucks, which is beyond reasonable even with the padding. If you're a 
    virgin, dub is one of those genres where you can't go wrong picking up one 
    of the established classics of the genre as your first--seek out Augustus 
    Pablo's </i><i>King Tubby Meets Rockers Uptown or Perry's </i><i>Super Ape or 
    Tubby's </i><i>Dub Like Crazy. And if you like what you hear, you're in for a 
    treat, because suddenly there's a whole world of echo to explore.</i></p></div>"|2108.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2108-trojan-dub-rarities/|7.0|Jess Harvell

    raunchy, raucous version of the American rock'n'roll of the 1950s.  
    Following in the footsteps of the Ramones, the band injects punk  
    attitude into its stripped-down rock and notoriously over-the-top live performances. All of that is represented on  
    26-track, fan-selected, best-of <em>Golden Black</em>.</p><p>
    
    Even the uninitiated have heard their sound before; distorted guitars playing three-chord  
    punk while vocals are shouted over top. The recordings  
    are strictly lo-fi affairs, and everything is pushed into the red (if  
    you're speakers aren't crackling when Guitar Wolf is on, you're  
    clearly not playing it loud enough). But don't mistake simple and old- 
    fashioned for boring and unremarkable. From the moment singer/guitarist Seije ignites this collection  
    with a characteristic ""one two three four!"" at the beginning of ""Can- 
    nana Fever"", from 1999's <em>Jet Generation</em>, it's clear that these  
    three guys are masters of the straightforward punk song.</p><p>
      
    Tracks such as ""Red ""Wild Zero"", ""Missile Me"", ""Sky Star  
    Jet"", and ""UFO Romantics"" beg for a sing-along, and if your Japanese  
    isn't quite up to the task, the booklet offers lyrics translated into  
    English. There are plenty of hooks buried in the layers of fuzz and grime, and  
    the band creates riffs and tunes that sound familiar  
    even on first listen. Those valuing innovation in their music may find Guitar Wolf a littl derivative, and I must admit that an American band attempting to pull off these songs would probably fall flat. At well over an hour long, causal listeners may get lost by the end, as the 26 songs on this disc tend to blend together after a while. This style of rock music sounds best in small bursts, though, and even if there is fault to be found in the generic quality of the songs, the B-grade sci-fi craziness surrounding it all adds a nice layer of charm.</p><p>
    
    The most well-known of the mid-90s Japanese garage punk invasion, Guitar Wolf owe a  
    great deal of their notoriety to their refusal to give up. Long after  
    their counterparts-- Teengenerate, 5, 6, 7, 8's, etc.-- stopped putting  
    out records, Guitar Wolf remain a vital force in the underground  
    garage rock scene. The death of bassist Billy (born Hideaki  
    Sekiguchi) in March of 2005 marks the end of an era for the band, and  
    although the two remaining members are continuing their assault with  
    new bassist Ug in tow, <em>Golden Black</em> presents a quality  
    overview of their career up to this point.</p></div>"|3652.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3652-golden-black/|7.0|Cory D. Byrom

    Mark Eitzel can be a bald, ugly bastion of hope-- his romantic ideals so pure in theory that the characters in his
    tales can't help but fall short. Yet, foiled by comatose backdrops and sagging intensity, his
    seventh solo venture acts as parody, falling prey to the sad sack
    stereotypes. After 2001's excellent, electro-acoustic hybrid <em>The Invisible
    Man</em>, Eitzel's muse seemed lost, following that record with a covers album and an LP of re-recordings of his own
    work. But when the singer reunited with his
    American Music Club mates in 2004, the move stirred
    his creative juices, resulting in the
    better-than-average ""we're back!"" disc, <em>Love Songs For
    Patriots</em>.</p><p>
    
    So, with AMC mk. II still going strong, why
    another solo CD? As the singer recently told <em>Magnet</em>, ""I didn't
    intend to make <em>Candy Ass</em>...my management kind of
    forced me to release it. I was going to release it only on the Web. So
    I'm a candy ass for releasing the damn thing."" Known for his
    self-deprecation, the comment could plausibly be laughed
    off. Too bad the album's poky mix of snail-slow blip-ballads and
    insignificant, shimmering non-starters make the self-immolating
    sentiments ring true.</p><p>
    
    Expounding on previous forays into Warp-y electronics, the
    record's four instrumentals underwhelm, coming across as wallpaper-ready mediocrity. Parts
    of an original film score, the pieces
    lack context here-- especially for an artist known for his stellar
    vocals and painstaking, dry lyricism. Making a Mark Eitzel
    song without his distinct croon is like casting Al
    Pacino as an extra in a movie-- pointlessly antithetical and silly.</p><p>
    
    With few exceptions, the more traditional songs don't fare much
    better, with many feeling like dour <em>Invisible Man</em> leftovers.
    The best lyric comes courtesy of opener ""My Pet Rat St. Michael"",
    about a depressed rodent named after the superhero archangel John
    Travolta once embodied. ""He would hang himself except he already
    chewed threw his rope,"" quips the singer in a knowing near whisper.
    Spare and fierce-- the closing ""you got to fight for it"" refrain speaks
    to Eitzel's unlikely determination-- it's vintage, safe, and solid. But his typical outbursts of lung-popping passion are totally
    absent, replaced by a passive, sedate vocal delivery. Consequently,
    listless wisps like ""Sleeping Beauty"", ""Homeland Pastoral"", and ""Roll
    Away My Stone"" casually float into alternative adult contemporary
    purgatory.</p><p>
    
    In another bit from <em>Magnet</em>'s Q&amp;A;, Eitzel talks about the next
    AMC record, ""One song title is 'God I Miss You, You Fat Old Bitch';
    it's about Santa Claus, written from the perspective of his
    boyfriend."" If that tidbit is indeed as
    true and on target as his <em>Candy Ass</em> derision, Eitzel's next act
    should have no problem blowing away this crushing bore of a detour.</p></div>"|2706.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2706-candy-ass/|4.0|Ryan Dombal

The single boasted the 12"" remixes for both the title track and ""Thieves"", as well as a fantastic cover of Skinny Puppy's ""Smothered Hope"". I listened to the remixes over and over, trying to figure out how they were different than the originals. Beyond ""Thieves"" being slightly longer, I never found any significant difference between the remixes and the original album cuts. <em>Rantology</em>, Ministry's 25th anniversary collection, is a hodgepodge release that, besides being an album-length diatribe against the Bush administration, features one new song, three live Ministry classics, three recent album tracks, and eight remixes, and sadly it indicates that at this point in his career, Al Jourgensen still hasn't gotten a handle on the remix.</p><p>
    
    At some point in their career, possibly when Paul Barker left, Ministry stopped being an industrial band and started being a boring thrash band. Album opener, ""No W (Redux)"", proves this within the first few guitar notes. The song, a rehash of ""N.W.O."" from 1992's <em>Psalm 69</em>, is essentially the same as the version that originally appeared on Fat Wreck Chords' <em>Rock Against Bush</em> comp. The President opens with the campaign standard, ""I'm George W. Bush, and I approve of this message,"" before the track launches into a cinematic clash of keyboard-strings, operatic vocals, and weak programmed drums. Eventually, Bush quotes some scripture and the song tears into run-of-the-mill open-E riffing accented by the occasional programmed horn and string burst, all of which here sound cheap and generic.</p><p>
    
    ""No W (Redux)"" sets the tone for the remixes on this collection, which barely sound different than the originals. ""N.W.O. (Update mix)"" features new samples of the current Bush replacing many of the GHWB's quotes from the original, but nothing else appears different. ""Stigmata (Update mix)"" has been polished off to have a slicker, more artificial guitar tone that fits well with the band's apparent devotion to fake instruments, and the slightly altered vocal rhythm in the  
    verses only brings the song down further. We also get ""updated"" or alternate mixes of four other tracks, including ""Jesus Built My Hotrod"", all of which sound more or less the same as the originals. ""Unsung"" is the only track here that seems to have actually benefited from its alternate mix. Originally on 2003's barely listenable <em>Animositisomina</em>, this version has been beefed up with bagpipes and other added noise, and it actually features a melody in the verses instead of Jourgensen's incessant barking. </p><p>
    
    The one new track here is ""The Great Satan"", which further spews venom towards the President with uninspired speed-metal riffing, flat, robotic drumming, and distorted vocals. ""Bloodlines"", which originally appeared on the soundtrack to the video game ""Vampires: The Bloodlines"", changes things up dramatically. The verses are built on a foundation of dub-like drums, a hypnotic bass, and low-mixed guitar squealing. Then the chorus rolls around, the guitar bursts in, and Jorgensen's deeper, clean vocals turn to a screech. Sound familiar? That's because it's a complete rehash of ""So What?"" from <em>The Minds Is a Terrible Thing to Taste</em>, minus Chris Connelly's seething vocals. If a band besides Ministry had recorded this song, they'd be getting sued for copyright infringement. </p><p>
    
    The remainder of <em>Rantology</em> are older tracks either directly from the last two Ministry albums or in live form. For live tracks we get ""Thieves"", ""Psalm 69"", and ""The Fall"", all from 2002's <em>Sphinctour</em>. <em>Rantology</em> doesn't work as a greatest hits package, as it leaves out most of the band's best, not to mention most recognizable, tracks. Furthermore, it doesn't work as a remix album because the remixes are uninspired. Jourgensen helped introduce many people to industrial back in the early 90s, but on <em>Rantology</em>, the dark, unnerving tone of his earlier work has long since been traded in for the uninspired rantings of a cranky musician trying too hard regain his prominence. </p></div>"|5310.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5310-rantology/|2.0|Cory D.

Actually, it was a thinly veiled plug for his new book on ""the singularity,"" or the coming of an age when we will all be connected to each other via electronic networks, and little microscopic robots will help turn us into super people. Once I got over the ""Star Trek""-ness of it, it started to seem less science fiction and more black comedy. To think that in only about 75 years we've gone from the idea that computers might be useful for some simple calculations to planning to use them to turn us into what our ancestors would have considered gods is both amazing and disturbing. Kurzweil's ""law of accelerating returns"" is indeed impressive, and when you think at all the good that might come of leaps in both technology and human evolution, the future looks pretty bright. That is, if we're still actually human.</p>
<p>Music has been affected no less drastically. As Brian Eno points out in his forward to the recently reissued and expanded <i>OHM: The Early Gurus of Electronic Music 3xCD </i>box set (now with the addition of a DVD, and re-dubbed OHM+), most of what we listen to is electronic in some fashion, contrary to the entire history of music prior to the 1920s. Whether over the radio, stereo, or amplified speaker, electronic music has all but made ""natural"" sound obsolete. And of course, this says nothing about the musicians who actually use electronics as instruments, manipulating digits, circuits, and bits to make music-- music that, for all intents and purposes, would have been as unimaginable as Martian rovers to your grandparents.</p>
<p>Lucky for us, three generations into the technological revolution, much of the shock of innovation has given way to something of a learned instinct when it comes to this stuff. The groundbreaking experiments of composers like Karlheinz Stockhausen, Pierre Schaefer, Pierre Henry, and John Cage have led to an age where blips and beeps are not only taken for granted but form the basis of a musical education that for most people starts in pre-school with such ""advanced"" learning tools as Simon Says. <i>OHM+</i>, covering electronic music from the 1930s to the 1980s, documents a clear and steady path towards an age when most music simply couldn't be made without electronic assistance. The characters involved were undoubtedly experimenters working on the edges of both technology and good old human ingenuity. In many cases, their results will sound strange to ears accustomed to more refined uses of the available tools-- but in others, the sounds are eerily ahead of their time. Regardless, <i>OHM+</i> is one of the best documents of its kind, and a model for archival compilations.</p>
<p>OHM+'s first disc contains music from the earliest days of recorded electronic music, and as much as you might expect it to contain barely controlled squeaks and static, there are moments of surreal beauty. Olivier Messiaen, though hardly known as a preeminent electronic music composer, did use the ondes martenot (a keyboard using a ribbon and ring to change pitch) on ""Oraison"" from 1937. The melody (borrowed from his own ""Louange a l'eternite de Jesus"") is perfectly suited to the keyboard's theremin-like portamento (a technique of gliding smoothly from one note to another). Likewise, Clara Rockmore's performance of Tchaikovsky's Valse Sentimentale on theremin transcends gimmick, sounding like an alluring, retro-futuristic serenade.</p>
<p>Of course, there is plenty of the hard stuff: check the animated audience reaction to Cage's revolutionary tape-edit piece <i>Williams Mix</i> from 1952, or Tod Dockstader's creepy sound collage ""Apocalypse II"" from 1961. Stockhausen predates both surround sound and <i>Zaireeka</i> with his four-channel Kontakte, while Edgard Varese's ""Poem Electronique"", using seemingly random snippets of found-sound and ancient synthesizer squeaks, is actually one of the great early examples of mastering electronic music bit by bit. And if you're left wanting some good old fashioned humanity, Milton Babbit's Philomel excerpt, a duet of sorts featuring synthesizer and female soprano, forecasts just how integrated electronics would become with live performance.</p>
<p>Disc 2 picks up in 1959 with Raymond Scott's fairly amazing ""Cindy Electronium"", composed on a synthesizer Scott invented and sounding a lot like something you'd hear on a Mouse on Mars record. Seriously, someone needs to organize a Raymond Scott remix album stat. As it happens, Pauline Oliveros' psychedelic masterpiece ""Bye Bye Butterfly"" predicts the remix, using bits of old opera and state-of-the-60s delay to concoct a piece of prime haze fit to tie all of Brooklyn's hip noisemakers up on a very tall pole. In fact, there's a lot on this disc to feed the avant-rock crew: Can's Holger Czukay delivers the sample collage ""Boat-Woman-Song"" from his 1969 <i>Canaxis </i>LP, Terry Riley gets his freak on with ""Poppy Nogood"" and in some bizarre, out-of-time programming, the OHM+ folks use Sonic Youth's 1999 performance of Steve Reich's ""Pendulum Music"" (originally composed in 1968). Elsewhere, electronic music legends Morton Subotnick (""Silver Apples on the Moon, pt. 1""), Luc Ferrari (""Music Promenade""), and Iannis Xenakis (""Hibiki-Hana-Ma"") demonstrate that you don't have to have ties to rock music to make head-fucked noize. The disc ends with Minimalist pioneer La Monte Young's precisely titled ""31 I 60 c. 12:17:33-12:25:33 PM NYC"" from 1969, a dissonant sine wave drone-- ordinarily, this would clear the room, but in light of what came before, it's practically a come-down<i>.</i></p>
<p>By Disc 3, electronic music's exponential rate of progress is evident. From the otherworldly, digitally harmonized vocals of Paul Lansky's ""Six Fantasies on A Poem By Thomas Campion: Her Song"" (which he programmed partially in the FORTRAN computer language) to Krautrock pioneer Klaus Schulze's ornery, beat-driven ""Melange"" to the massive, droney void in Maryanne Amacher's ""Living Sound, Patent Pending"", it's clear that by the late 1970s, composers were breaking down sonic barriers by the day. Growing out of the painstaking mold of punch cards and handmade circuitry, these musicians took one step closer to modern electronic production methods of sonic manipulation and construction. Ironically, they were also becoming masters of the acoustic, as in Alvin Lucier's ingenious use of the tension in a single wire (""Music On A Long Thin Wire 1"" or Robert Ashley's collage of human voices on ""Automatic Writing"". Of course, Brian Eno's ethereal ""Unfamiliar Wind (Leeks Hills)"" forecasts modern electronic music most directly-- but then some would argue no one's yet improved on his ambient excursions.</p>
<p>The accompanying DVD has enough archival performance footage (performances by Morton Subotnick, Laurie Spiegel, Alvin Lucier, Pauline Oliveros, Mother Mallard, and Holger Czukay) to make it worthwhile for fans, but the real joy is in the interviews and original video productions. Milton Babbit's discussion of the difficulties of working with archaic synthesizers in the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center in the 1950s and 60s is a firm reminder of just how foreign electronic sounds were to even the academic community only 40 years ago. Likewise, Paul Lansky's private lesson with theremin inventor Leon Theremin is an example of how non-user friendly electronic musical instruments could be, even to people who should have the best sense of how to approach them. And speaking of Lansky, someone really needs to issue a DVD of all the animations accompanying his pieces, because his <i>The Dust Bunny</i> features a great computer-generated cartoon that's one part Pixar, one part ""Ren &amp; Stimpy"". Even after 70 years of innovation (and renovation), electronic music still manages to surprise.</p></div>"|2106.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2106-ohm-the-early-gurus-of-electronic-music-1948-1980/|9.0|Dominique Leone

Yeahhhh!""</p>
<p>That's how Marc Bolan kicks off <i>The Slider</i>, T. Rex's follow-up to the career-making <i>Electric Warrior</i>, which brought the band out of the folk circuit and onto the rock stage. That lead track, ""Metal Guru"", belongs in the pantheon of great rock album openers: It's a rapturous two-and-a-half minutes, a joyous celebration of itself. Amazingly, <i>The Slider</i> doesn't let up after that, but sustains its high across 13 boogie-bound tracks, each punctuated by Bolan's enthusiastic ""yeah!""'s and ""woo!""'s.  He even starts ""Baby Strange"" with what might be the silliest count-off ever.</p>
<p>At the peak of his rock superstardom, Bolan was also at the top of his game, and <i>The Slider</i> is his ecstatic ode both to himself and to music in general. The 50s rock rhythms that threatened to burst the seams of <i>Electric Warrior</i> here explode mightily and repeatedly. Buddy Holly, Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley, and Elvis Presley loom large, but Bolan throws some glitter and make-up into the mix and comes up with something both familiar and new. Meanwhile, the band-- percussionist Mickey Finn, Steve Currie on bass, and Bill Legend on drums, plus producer Tony Visconti-- lock in on the grooves that propel ""Buick McKane"", ""Baby Strange"", and ""Chariot Choogle"". In a glam-jive code that combines Dylanesque wordplay with psychedelic imagery, Bolan writes about himself and his coterie, filling songs with shout-outs to hangers-on he nicknames Telegram Sam (allegedly his supplier during the recording sessions), Golden Nose Slim, Jo Jo, and Buick McKane, as well as to Dylan, Alan Freed, and Max's Kansas City. As such, <i>The Slider</i> reveals a lot about the man behind the glitter-- not through outright confessional songwriting, but via personal peccadilloes like, ""And when I'm sad... I slide!""  It's Bolan locating the perfect stance from which he can say nothing and everything at once.</p>
<p>Of course, neither the celebrity nor the music lasted.  For one thing, Bolan was quickly outdone by the pomp of David Bowie and other glam androgynes, and left behind when his cultural moment passed.  For another, his gift for excess, while previously a boon to his songwriting, was a bane when it came to drugs.  When his star began to fade, so did his music.  These four reissues from Rhino, which are essentially identical to the Edsel reissues from a few years ago, track T. Rex's downward trajectory but attempt to redeem the band's later, lesser releases by packaging each album with a bonus disc that re-creates the tracklist using alternate takes, live tracks, and B-sides.  On <i>Zinc Alloy and the Hidden Riders of Tomorrow</i>, the second disc actually outshines the original album, presenting looser, funkier, less worked-over versions of those clunky songs.</p>
<p>Released after <i>Tanx</i> (which will be reissued later this month, alongside two other albums and a collection of unfinished songs), <i>Zinc Alloy</i> flails desperately as Bolan tries to incorporate his new fascination with American funk into the T. Rex sound.  Unfortunately, these elements only make the songs sound as leaden as their titles suggest. On ""Galaxy"" and ""Sound Pit"" he alludes to past hits ""Bang a Gong (Get It On)"", ""Metal Guru"", and ""Telegram Sam"", but here his self-mythologizing sounds jaded, as if he needs to remind listeners of past glories to justify his current excesses. ""Carsmile Smith and the Old One"", ""Painless Persuasion v. the Meathawk Immaculate"", and ""The Leopards Featuring Gardenia and the Mighty Slug"" all sink under the weight of bulky concepts and awkward grooves, and the prominent backing vocals by Bolan's American girlfriend, soul singer Gloria Jones, ratchet up the theatrical bombast to gaudy heights. <i>Change</i>, as the bonus disc is retitled, strips away most of the orchestral overkill, but the songs still sound empty, their joy curdling into bitterness.</p>
<p>Originally released three years later (with two other albums in between), <i>Dandy in the Underworld</i> recaptures Bolan's former spiritedness, as he imagines himself cast out from the realm of stardom. On the title track, he's Orpheus traveling through a hell of popular indifference. ""When will he come up for air? Will anybody ever care?"" Bolan asks on the chorus, but instead of whining, he seems genuinely hurt by the betrayal of his errant muse.  Oddly enough, the album finds a reinvigorated Bolan crafting some of his best hooks and calibrating his catchiest grooves in years. The cosmic ""Crimson Moon"", the infectious ""I'm a Fool for You Girl"", and the album's centerpiece, ""Jason B. Sad"", alternate between carefree and cautious, conjuring a gravity that counterbalances the upbeat, stripped-down rhythms. The album trails off near the end-- especially with Bolan's hammy Elvis impersonation on ""Pain and Love""-- but ""Teenage Riot Structure"" picks up the Orpheus thread again, with lyrics that intimate his fears, doubts, and hopes. The album's most noteworthy flaw, perhaps, is that it sounds best in context with the other albums; only to a degree does <i>Dandy</i> stand on its own, but it accrues additional force as the final chapter in Bolan's ongoing story of Marc Bolan.</p>
<p>That mythology further unfolds on <i>The T. Rex Wax Co. Singles: A's and B's 1972-1977</i>, which collects the singles Bolan released between albums. He often released songs as singles long after they'd already appeared on albums, and as a result, there's no strict chronology to the tracklist.  ""Baby Boomerang"", for example, appeared as an A-side nearly five years after it was originally released on <i>The Slider</i>.  Plus, all of these songs appear either as regular or bonus tracks (some in multiple versions) on the Rhino album reissues, so this 2xCD set sounds like an abridged edition of the series rather than an career overview.  Still, it's amazing that singles like ""Children of the Revolution"", the mighty ""20th Century Boy"", and the giddy ""Celebrate Summer"" never made it onto any of the band's original albums-- omissions that reveal the depth of T. Rex's catalog as well as its sturdiness 30 years on.</p>

Yeahhhh!""</p>
<p>That's how Marc Bolan kicks off <i>The Slider</i>, T. Rex's follow-up to the career-making <i>Electric Warrior</i>, which brought the band out of the folk circuit and onto the rock stage. That lead track, ""Metal Guru"", belongs in the pantheon of great rock album openers: It's a rapturous two-and-a-half minutes, a joyous celebration of itself. Amazingly, <i>The Slider</i> doesn't let up after that, but sustains its high across 13 boogie-bound tracks, each punctuated by Bolan's enthusiastic ""yeah!""'s and ""woo!""'s.  He even starts ""Baby Strange"" with what might be the silliest count-off ever.</p>
<p>At the peak of his rock superstardom, Bolan was also at the top of his game, and <i>The Slider</i> is his ecstatic ode both to himself and to music in general. The 50s rock rhythms that threatened to burst the seams of <i>Electric Warrior</i> here explode mightily and repeatedly. Buddy Holly, Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley, and Elvis Presley loom large, but Bolan throws some glitter and make-up into the mix and comes up with something both familiar and new. Meanwhile, the band-- percussionist Mickey Finn, Steve Currie on bass, and Bill Legend on drums, plus producer Tony Visconti-- lock in on the grooves that propel ""Buick McKane"", ""Baby Strange"", and ""Chariot Choogle"". In a glam-jive code that combines Dylanesque wordplay with psychedelic imagery, Bolan writes about himself and his coterie, filling songs with shout-outs to hangers-on he nicknames Telegram Sam (allegedly his supplier during the recording sessions), Golden Nose Slim, Jo Jo, and Buick McKane, as well as to Dylan, Alan Freed, and Max's Kansas City. As such, <i>The Slider</i> reveals a lot about the man behind the glitter-- not through outright confessional songwriting, but via personal peccadilloes like, ""And when I'm sad... I slide!""  It's Bolan locating the perfect stance from which he can say nothing and everything at once.</p>
<p>Of course, neither the celebrity nor the music lasted.  For one thing, Bolan was quickly outdone by the pomp of David Bowie and other glam androgynes, and left behind when his cultural moment passed.  For another, his gift for excess, while previously a boon to his songwriting, was a bane when it came to drugs.  When his star began to fade, so did his music.  These four reissues from Rhino, which are essentially identical to the Edsel reissues from a few years ago, track T. Rex's downward trajectory but attempt to redeem the band's later, lesser releases by packaging each album with a bonus disc that re-creates the tracklist using alternate takes, live tracks, and B-sides.  On <i>Zinc Alloy and the Hidden Riders of Tomorrow</i>, the second disc actually outshines the original album, presenting looser, funkier, less worked-over versions of those clunky songs.</p>
<p>Released after <i>Tanx</i> (which will be reissued later this month, alongside two other albums and a collection of unfinished songs), <i>Zinc Alloy</i> flails desperately as Bolan tries to incorporate his new fascination with American funk into the T. Rex sound.  Unfortunately, these elements only make the songs sound as leaden as their titles suggest. On ""Galaxy"" and ""Sound Pit"" he alludes to past hits ""Bang a Gong (Get It On)"", ""Metal Guru"", and ""Telegram Sam"", but here his self-mythologizing sounds jaded, as if he needs to remind listeners of past glories to justify his current excesses. ""Carsmile Smith and the Old One"", ""Painless Persuasion v. the Meathawk Immaculate"", and ""The Leopards Featuring Gardenia and the Mighty Slug"" all sink under the weight of bulky concepts and awkward grooves, and the prominent backing vocals by Bolan's American girlfriend, soul singer Gloria Jones, ratchet up the theatrical bombast to gaudy heights. <i>Change</i>, as the bonus disc is retitled, strips away most of the orchestral overkill, but the songs still sound empty, their joy curdling into bitterness.</p>
<p>Originally released three years later (with two other albums in between), <i>Dandy in the Underworld</i> recaptures Bolan's former spiritedness, as he imagines himself cast out from the realm of stardom. On the title track, he's Orpheus traveling through a hell of popular indifference. ""When will he come up for air? Will anybody ever care?"" Bolan asks on the chorus, but instead of whining, he seems genuinely hurt by the betrayal of his errant muse.  Oddly enough, the album finds a reinvigorated Bolan crafting some of his best hooks and calibrating his catchiest grooves in years. The cosmic ""Crimson Moon"", the infectious ""I'm a Fool for You Girl"", and the album's centerpiece, ""Jason B. Sad"", alternate between carefree and cautious, conjuring a gravity that counterbalances the upbeat, stripped-down rhythms. The album trails off near the end-- especially with Bolan's hammy Elvis impersonation on ""Pain and Love""-- but ""Teenage Riot Structure"" picks up the Orpheus thread again, with lyrics that intimate his fears, doubts, and hopes. The album's most noteworthy flaw, perhaps, is that it sounds best in context with the other albums; only to a degree does <i>Dandy</i> stand on its own, but it accrues additional force as the final chapter in Bolan's ongoing story of Marc Bolan.</p>
<p>That mythology further unfolds on <i>The T. Rex Wax Co. Singles: A's and B's 1972-1977</i>, which collects the singles Bolan released between albums. He often released songs as singles long after they'd already appeared on albums, and as a result, there's no strict chronology to the tracklist.  ""Baby Boomerang"", for example, appeared as an A-side nearly five years after it was originally released on <i>The Slider</i>.  Plus, all of these songs appear either as regular or bonus tracks (some in multiple versions) on the Rhino album reissues, so this 2xCD set sounds like an abridged edition of the series rather than an career overview.  Still, it's amazing that singles like ""Children of the Revolution"", the mighty ""20th Century Boy"", and the giddy ""Celebrate Summer"" never made it onto any of the band's original albums-- omissions that reveal the depth of T. Rex's catalog as well as its sturdiness 30 years on.</p>

Beyond this essential solitude, however, Youngs' albums can be so dissimilar from one another as to seem of completely different species, as he continues his diligent, egoless quest for new avenues into the outer realms of the spirit.</p><p>
    Assembled entirely on his home computer, <em>The Naïve Shaman</em> represents Youngs' first extensive foray into digital recording. On these five tracks, his distinctive psychedelic mantras are heavily fortified by deep, resonant electric bass tones and encircling, multi-layered vocals. As a result, the album possesses a thick, enveloping warmth that signals a dramatic departure from both the ravaged isolation of 2004's <em>River Through Howling Sky</em> as well as the more folk-oriented material of earlier works like 2002's May. And though its bold creation makes <em>The Naïve Shaman</em> one of Youngs' most adventurously experimental releases, its supple melodic figures also make it quite likely his most approachable.</p><p>
    In fact, the tranquil waves of album opener ""Life on a Beam"" are initially so temperate and sonorous that my wife rather inexplicably mistook it for a Sting track-- a comparison I'm still not entirely sure what to do with. Fortunately, things get decidedly more shamanic on the 10-minute centerpiece ""Sonar In My Soul"", which matches a repetitive, spiraling vocal melody to a burbling bass throb, dub-like electronic effects, and caustic guitar interjections. As with so many of Youngs' best minimalist recitations, this piece achieves an organic sense of constant renewal, perpetually gathering momentum until its roots have secured a permanent anchor in the memory.</p><p> 
    Following the brief, folk-like echo of ""Once It Was Autumn"", Youngs promptly cycles the seasons for the monumental closer ""Summer's Edge II"", a blurred epic on which he abandons himself entirely to his disorienting solstice hymn. Over a dense hive of treated guitar drones and distant, free-form percussion, Youngs obliquely submits his services to the universe, ""Doors are turning/ sing through me, sing through me."" And as the <em>The Naïve Shaman</em> drifts to a close with the hypnotically repeated two-word processional ""Summer's edge, summer's edge,"" Youngs' fearless intensity might immediately prompt his faithful pilgrims to build eager anticipation for his next singularly inspired liturgy.</p></div>"|8844.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8844-the-naive-shaman/|7.7|Matthew Murphy

    economical take on math-rock-- winding guitars and tricky
    time signatures, but with pop songs I could still remember after
    stumbling home. That was nearly two years ago, when they had only a
    couple self-released EPs to their name. I saw them perform again
    recently and they'd drafted Janie Porche to sing
    near-constant backup and play about 18 different instruments, in the process becoming a many-legged amorphous blob of swiftly-changing
    styles, sometimes three or four times per song. Unfortunately, Porche doesn't appear on <i>The Logic of Building the Body Plan</i>, a
    generous seven-track EP, nor does she
    play on the band's first full-length that's already completed but yet
    to be released.</p><p>
    So it's strange that Bound Stems' first release with real distribution
    is a transitional one, recorded after their album was finished. Bound
    Stems take cues from meat'n'potatoes indie here, but take substantial risks
    with composition, and the songs are just as likely to run aground as
    succeed. The lovely collage art in the booklet that overbears the
    nearly illegible lyric sheet couldn't be more evocative of the music
    therein-- several thrilling moments, but with a few songs just short of a
    payoff or a thread to hold onto.</p><p>
    The band recalls a lot of well-established names here: Bobby
    Gallivan's double-tracked vocals and wistful, rolling syllables recall
    Issac Brock's delivery in calmer moments, the best tracks lean on
    woozy crescendos á la Arcade Fire, and the band switches gears as
    unexpectedly as Fiery Furnaces (there's even two spoken-word elderly
    woman interludes). But their ambitious and hungry guitar/bass/keyboards/loops line-up is
    more jagged and distorted than any of those acts.</p><p>
    It's an immersive listen, but not always a cohesive one. Opener
    ""Crimes &amp; Follies"" builds from a slow, syncopated strum into a
    heavy swing just to toss its momentum to the wind with a meandering
    instrumental passage, and the many segments of tracks like
    ""Totipotent"" and ""My Kingdom for a Trundle Bed""-- with jangling
    guitars, bubbling electronic textures, reverberating keyboards, and
    deep distorted basslines-- collide less than gracefully.</p><p>
    There's two big exceptions, though: ""Wake Up, Ma and Pa Are Gone""
    breezes past on gorgeous guitars and a sprightly drum pattern
    (courtesy of Harvey Danger refugee Evan Sult), almost slows to a halt,
    then pulls up for a speaker-blowing crescendo. Then there's ""Risking
    Life and Limb for the Coupon"", where Gallivan stays calm while the rhythm leaps
    and lurches until the
    cathartic full-band sigh of the finale with memorable calm/frantic
    call-and-response singing. (Incidentally, both of these tracks are
    taken from their unreleased full-length.) Bound Stems may be guilty of showing all their cards at once and
    rarely relaxing for the sake of the song, but its worth it to catch
    them now-- before they become another entirely different band.</p></div>"|1191.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1191-the-logic-of-building-the-body-plan-ep/|7.1|Jason Crock

    so many records and so many record reviews no one's yet pinned Circle
    to the wall. My guess: there's more need for a Finnish translator
    than any self-respecting pair of knowledgeable American ears might
    want to admit. I know only this much: a bongo in Finland is still a
    bongo in any speaker, and no country can redeem that awful sound.</p><p>
    Proggy metal riffed on keyboards and organs coupled with Mika Ratto's
    operatic vocals are both hilarious and oddly galvanizing, but that's
    the province of some other Circle record or live show. <i>Forest</i>
    is a flat-out, albeit dark dark dark, longhaired hippy record. So
    expect the entire fifth grade music room arsenal: aforementioned
    bongos, triangle percussion, xylophoned melody lines, shaky shakers,
    and on-and-off synch chorale humming. Also get the volume knob
    handy, since most of <i>Forest</i> registers only at a whisper that,
    once cranked, forms a windy, mumbling, sleep-talked monologue.</p><p>
    Norm deviations, in songs that go
    with one part for more minutes than can be believed, become big
    moments. The gruff grindcore/cookie monster vocals of
    ""Luikertelevat"", sparse and back-loaded though they are, relieve an
    almost painfully tight and repetitive acoustic guitar progression that
    otherwise shows no signs of stopping. And acid trips have been
    shorter than ""Jaljet"", which shoots air and little vocal cut-ins
    across various sensitive mics, then picks up for the mid-tempo, toasting session stuff that Circle
    attempts to sell all over <i>Forest</i>. Ratto seems as if he's making it up as he goes, probably ditto for the
    squeaky one-note interruptions and general drum-circled aural
    politics: <i>Forest</i> is, for better or worse, way beyond free.</p><p>
    Whether someone without a lot of time on their hands, or a lot of
    drugs on their hands, will enjoy minimalist throat-singing and turn of
    the last century percussion (minus the big pieces), all with the mute
    button on, well, call it an open question. Certainly <i>Forest</i> is
    not self-conscious. The absence of any apparent expectation of an
    audience is rare and also somewhat exciting; however, when the
    thrill tapers off, the confusion sets in. Best is the taunt thriller
    ""Ydinaukio"", which presents as an incomprehensible melodrama: ""When I
    first met you/ Having eyes like sparks/ Having eyes like stars/ So I told
    myself/What do we have here?"" Lacking a lyric sheet, or articulated
    syllables, the narrative's guesswork even when you want in. If you
    don't, it's easy enough, with <i>Forest</i>'s solipsism, to walk away.</p></div>"|1476.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1476-forest/|6.4|Zach Baron

    Paddingtons' combat pub-rawk done better by the London-callers their
    album cover aesthetic emulates, it was redone OK in the 1990s, too. The Paddingtons take those models and also draw from punk's streamlined
    late-'90s MTV hangover. Recent single
    ""Sorry"" spryly concocts a Strokes-182 with
    its slurred vocal, chiming downstroked distortion, and adolescent
    banality: ""Sorry, hope you're feeling happy now/ Hope you're feeling
    happy now/ I am gone."" There's even the swaying, melodramatic bridge
    of a prototypical pop-punk anthem. Repetitive emo jawn ""Worse for
    Wear"" and urgent, embittered opener ""Some Old Girl"" likewise summon 41 or so greener days.</p><p>
    Producer Owen Morris, yep from <em>(What's the Story) Morning Glory</em>, is
    likely a big reason the British press has breezed over such
    comparisons. He leaves the Paddingtons' recordings with ragged,
    live-sounding warmth, as opposed to the blocky hamfisting of much U.S. radio
    punk. Singer Tom Atkin's undeniable Englishness, from off-key burr to
    would-be rebel yell, is another factor. It's probably not a
    coincidence the album's most noteworthy song is ""50 to a £"", a burst
    of hooky heartbreak as British as the Buzzcocks.</p><p>
    The song is also decidedly anti-drug (Atkin scolds an ex-lover, ""And
    when you're comin' down...""), pitting the Pads lads as counterpart to
    Pete Doherty's eve of self-destruction. For good
    measure, dark teeth-rattling back-and-forth ""Panic Attack"" finds Atkin
    rasping, ""You wanna die? Go on, keep committing suicide."" Not quite
    ""STAY OFF THE CRACK,"" but London ain't burning and these guys are
    straight, hippy Johnny. Then ""Stop Breathing"" unfortunately eschews
    Pavement-coverage for half-baked homicidal urges, ""Alright in the
    Morning"" skanks through Brixton hands on empty head, and rambunctious
    2004 single ""21"" dervishes about and breaks things.</p><p>
    As for the title track, alas, it stops far short of explaining
    <em>First Comes First</em>. Over stomping rhythms and a handful of
    emo-anguished power chords, Atkins spits a few violent images and then
    preaches chorus truth: ""This is my way, what is my way, in my, my/
    This is my way, what is my way, in my mind."" And I thought I was
    already spent three paragraphs ago.</p></div>"|6590.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6590-first-comes-first/|5.5|Marc Hogan

So it comes as little surprise that they've followed their excellent 2004 debut LP with <em>The Weed Tree</em>, a short collection of covers in the most stouthearted folkloric tradition. The set blends traditional folk standards (""Rosemary Lane"", ""Black Is the Color of My True Love's Hair"") with tracks from sources both predictable (Nico, Michael Hurley) and not (Durutti Column, Blue Öyster Cult.) Yet throughout the album Espers are able to deliver these disparate tracks with enough quiet authority and sheer transportive beauty to ever settle into stale mimicry, blurring the origins of the songs until they each seem to have been issued from a single fertile source.</p><p>
    Still centered around the nucleus of Greg Weeks, Meg Baird, and Brooke Sietinsons, <em>The Weed Tree</em> finds the group having officially grown into a sextet, and their expert arrangements here are a dense thicket of guitars, cello, recorders, and various spirited embellishments. Beneath the music's placid surfaces, however, stirs a current of discontent, as nearly every song is built on the time-honored folk traditions of loss, unrequited love, and/or isolation.  When coupled with the occasional stray flare of acidic dissonance, these downcast lyrical themes provide a necessary counterpoint to Espers' frequently breathtaking vocal harmonies and pristine instrumentation, giving this disc a subtle but commanding dramatic sweep.</p><p>
    Particularly telling is the group's version of ""Black Is the Color"", one of the most covered songs in the folk canon. In its oldest form this song is a simple ballad of devotion, but Espers have characteristically chosen the darker path, with Weeks and Baird joining in exquisite lament on a verse left off in many versions: ""Satisfied I will never be/ I'll write him a letter, just a few short lines/ And suffer death a thousand times.""  This thread of desperate longing carries over to their covers of the Durutti Column's ""Tomorrow"" and Nico's ""Afraid"", while their Bert Jansch-inspired rendition of ""Rosemary Lane"" reminds us that our romantic miseries don't necessarily end upon an affair's consummation.</p><p>
    Nearly every group, folk or otherwise, could benefit from covering a Michael Hurley song, and Espers strike paydirt on their take of his ""Blue Mountain"", shooting its melody through with disorienting whistles that resonate like a canyon full of intoxicated songbirds. This heavily-reverbed disorder leads quite comfortably into their molten version of BÖC's ""Flaming Telepath"", with Weeks' quicksilver guitar excursions effortlessly transcribing the self-medicated despair of the lyrics. And as <em>The Weed Tree</em> closes with its sole Espers original-- the percussive, Eastern-tinged ""Dead King""-- one is left with the strong impression that the group is just now beginning to fully synthesize their various influences to map their own seductive trail through the moonlit folk woodlands.</p></div>"|2900.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2900-the-weed-tree-ep/|7.9|Matthew Murphy

    very punk. Earth-long drones, Mogwai builds, previously unheard of
    portions of Japanoise ear-bleed; there are fewer three minute songs, and, even
    when loud, tracks seem less confrontational. The double-edged sword of the new
    avant garde: more patient audiences, more bands taking license. On
    this contested ground, Toronto two piece Nadja drop
    <i>Truth Becomes Death</i>. Heavy and abstract, Nadja plow the increasingly popular territory being laid out
    between slow metal and staticy ambiance. Alien8's first real venture
    into the far side of the art-rock metal divide, the move would perhaps
    be more significant if the gap wasn't already shrinking so rapidly. 
    Without being shockingly original, Nadja's sound is the apotheosis of
    a long convergence and (welcome) genre bleed.</p><p>
    Though timely, <i>Truth Becomes Death</i> risks being a marginal
    record, if only because it has a nature so huge some might take it as
    scenery. Archaeological in the same way a many times dubbed-over tape
    is, Nadja move their source material way back in mix and let fuzz and
    a sea of glowing noise ride shotgun along with the instruments. The
    resulting environment has a giant resonance. Drum (machine) sound is
    triply huge on ""Bug/Golem""; not only is the recording so big it sounds
    as if they expanded the room to accommodate it, but stray
    elements echo the percussion on every
    rock solid hit. The song incorporates lo-fi 90s cassette aesthetics
    and 80s guitar breakdowns and assigns both new meanings: a Youth of
    Today macho bullshit chug-chug-chug is turned into epic, arty song
    punctuation.</p><p>
    In this barbarously delicate sea, the crashing guitars and horror
    house vocals of ""Memory Leak"" wreck damage in some other nearby room. 
    Spooky synth guitar solos only add to the distance; the aggro stuff is
    so diluted it becomes panoramic. Part of the charm of the old
    slow-core, big riffs pseudo-metal was that it shot a pure dose, but so
    did the ultra-fast grind of the Locust or Discordance Axis; once the
    gimmick is over, it's over. Nadja's not obsessed or stuck on
    ideologies, which is why they sound like latecomers. But as they put
    it on ""Breakpoint"", ""the infestation breaks loose, spreads, and at some
    point takes over\xD1bacteria grows on my circuits and I learn how to feel."" So they take the old grinding sonic palette of indecipherable and
    ripping vocals over thundering guitars, rot it, and stick its head
    underwater. Then they learn how to sing with their lungs submerged.</p></div>"|5924.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5924-truth-becomes-death/|7.5|Zach Baron

We could talk about how <em>Swamp Tech</em> is, upon close examination, utterly befuddling-- an adjective-busting blend of electroclash 'tude, the White Stripes's reconstructed authenticity, X's skull-piercing organs, LCD thump, Electric 6's heavy-handed satire, the Frogs's transgressive mugging, Le Tigre's rave-along skate rink jams, gospel conviction and N'awlins bayou boogie, circuit-bent acid house squelch, et al.</p><p> 
    
    But at a reasonable distance, the album's mechanics are much simpler-- nasty, chicken-fried electro grooves squirm and squiggle through a pep rally of stupid/funny chant-alongs. By now Quintron's done with the disjunctive, percussion-heavy gear tests that informed his earlier albums; no longer needing to push the limits of his invented light-triggered percussion, he's focusing on playing polished, energetically affable songs. Dumb fun trumps brainy tedium, and if <em>Swamp Tech</em> were an RPG, it'd be all whimsical mini-games, no arduous stat-building. Sometimes, the lyrical absurdity approaches zen-koan levels of sublimity, as on the nervous metallic jangle of the brief ""Squirrel Gardens"": ""Squirrel Gardens is full of squirrels,"" deadpans Miss Pussycat. ""But there is someone who does not belong there who is there/ It is an eel that dresses like a squirrel."" That shit is pretty heavy.</p><p> 
    
    But mostly, we get exuberant brattiness. ""I am a badass,"" Quintron and Pussycat call-and-response over the gristly pulse of ""Swamp Buggy Badass"", right after what sounds like a bong hit starting like a lawn mower. The lunging organ vamp ""French Quarter Faggot"" finds Quintron in self-lacerating mode: ""I am a French Quarter faggot motherfucker/ I like the sound of electroclash,"" his voice dropping into an appropriately ghoulish lower register on the last word. ""Fly Like a Rat"" appropriates ""The Jeffersons"" theme into its splashy electro muskrat love, and ""Witch in the Club"" is an electrified dance floor with soaring organ shunts. It's raw, raucous and gyroscopic, recorded live to two-track with Quintron running his organ through a bass cabinet for that fat-bottomed, buzzing sound. <em>Swamp Tech</em> is strictly party-and-bullshit, if the modified-for-organ cover of Kiss's ""God of Thunder"" didn't already tip you off. </p></div>"|6600.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6600-swamp-tech/|7.2|Brian Howe

    history remains a work in progress. Harsh skepticism of it in the
    early 90s almost instantaneously dismissed 10 years worth of
    relatively superficial, tacky music. As if to further discredit the decade, VH1
    and MTV relegated 80s videos to novelty programs like ""Pop-Up Video"", keeping
    their bread-and-butter programs free of the nostalgic muck. Hell, even Comedy
    Central began running reasonably earnest 80s movies as comedies.</p><p>
    
    Try as they may though, the 80s weren't going away, not in 1994, and certainly
    not in the 21st century. While <em>The Wedding Singer</em> and ""I Love the 80s"" helped
    to extricate irony from the revival, the infiltration of bands like the Killers into the mainstream exposed today's audiences as more
    receptive to the decade than they could've imagined. Case in point, the Bravery
    foisted the most egregious fake-Cure album ever on the public, and many bought it.
    Further wrinkling this reification crisis, <em>High School Reunion</em> tickles
    our sentimental bone in addition to simple nostalgia; these aren't just pop
    hits, they're soundtracks to the movies that (aesthetic quality aside) firmly
    embedded themselves in our hearts.</p><p>
    
    Needless to say, <em>High School Reunion</em> runs some huge
    risks. For one, the tribute is
    somewhat self-serving, featuring mainly artists who peaked during the 80s
    rather than newer, flashier groups paying their dues to their influences-- in
    other words, if you wanted to bridge the generational gap here, look elsewhere.
    On the other hand, Matthew Sweet immaculately mimicking Tom Petty on ""American
    Girl"" begs the question, is there a non-masturbatory purpose to carbon-copying
    the songs you love? After all, the whole effect is totally lost when an unknown
    like the Wading Girl basically karaokes over the backing music to ""Danke
    Schoen"", then tries to play it cool with an electric guitar solo.</p><p>
    
    For all the potential heartstring tugging, the disc's bright spots occur on the
    quirkier, fun covers. Rather than trying to spruce up Oingo Boingo, the Bennies
    embrace Danny Elfman's kooky songwriting on ""Weird Science"".
    Frank Black one-ups that by simultaneously giving Iggy Pop a shout-out while
    sounding perfectly form-fitted to the sci-fi tomfoolery of ""Repo Man"",
    <em>Trompe Le Monde</em>'s biological father. 4AD incest aside, even Kristin
    Hersh's pirated ""Wave of Mutilation"" cover hits the spot despite the Pixies
    perfecting the song's slow version 15 years ago.</p><p>
    
    But what of the tear-jerking, credit-closing show-stoppers we blared from a
    boombox held above our heads? Sadly, no one's getting lucky with those covers.
    AM gets fish in a barrel with ""Don't You (Forget About Me)"", yet what begins as
    a promising Clinic version of the song degenerates into the Black Crowes singing
    what sounds like a Black Crowes song.
    While hardly as damning, Lori McKenna's snoozer of a cover, ""In Your Eyes"",
    actually sounds like an adult contemporary version of the song. Real question
    is, how much better could these songs really be in the first place? Maybe it's my preset
    emotional neurons talking here, but anything passed the original feels
    anticlimactic and just too after-the-fact. Not saying <em>High School
    Reunion</em>'s a terrible idea, just feels too much like an actual high school
    reunion-- everyone's uglier and more boring than they were all those years ago.</p></div>"|2073.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2073-high-school-reunion-a-tribute-to-those-great-80s-films/|6.2|Adam Moerder

    convulsive motion agitated its limbs.""</p><p>
    -Mary Shelley, <em>Frankenstein</em>, 1818</p><p>
    He's not coming back like some revivified monster. This attempted
    resuscitation, this half-assed memory-stirrer, is a project of the crassest
    order. It's graverobbing at its most furtive, orchestrated by a master
    career-tarnisher. Igor Diddy lurks, hunch-backed, quietly approaching your
    ear: ""Hey there, young consumer, do you like my <em>best friend</em>, the
    legendary Notorious B.I.G.? Dr. Pha and I, we've breathed new
    life, created vivacity, and taken creation from God's hands.""</p><p>
    It's particularly sad because statement albums were never lost on Biggie.
    The scope and fearlessness of <em>Ready to Die</em> says as much.  The
    push/pull stories between the then-Sean ""Puffy"" Combs and his meal ticket
    are renowned.  Ever the capitalist, he constantly sought ways to remix
    street records into pop hits.  But Biggie, a natural songwriter, was
    always conscious of credibility, name-checking Jeru the Damaja and Nas
    and Gang Starr.  For the most part, he could write hits without pandering,
    instead leaning on a confusing vulnerability/masculinity complex and that
    chunky voice.  All's to say, he was no saint, nor a pariah of pop.  But
    he had integrity.  <em>Duets</em> ignores all this precedent by cashing in
    blindly, amassing pointless guest spots and fusing old verses over tinny,
    soulless productions.</p><p>
    Bad Boy has recruited hacks and hit-hounds like Scott Storch, Jazze Pha,
    and Swizz Beatz to reconfigure songs that needn't be touched, or gotten
    sound-specific artists like Akon and Mobb Deep to put together Biggie
    Smalls-Made-Easy cookie-cutters.  The first posthumous B.I.G. release,
    <em>Born Again</em>, had plenty of problems, but at least unheard music saw
    the light of day.  As far as I can tell, this project is a sham.  For
    years we'd been told that Mister Cee, the DJ credited with breaking Biggie,
    had a stash of unreleased vocals and freestyles.  We were told he was
    waiting to unleash these vocals for a duets project that would blow our
    wigs back. That's not this project. There are zero unheard verses here.</p><p>
    The list of collaborators ranges from intriguing (Scarface, Nas, T.I.) to
    groan-inducing (we see you Korn and Nelly), but few of the songs actually
    leave any impression.  The Just Blaze-produced ""Living in Pain"", jacking
    Biggie and 2Pac's verses from the latter's ""House of Pain"", is the only
    truly effective track.  Sampling Lamont Dozier's sweeping, many-times-flipped
    ""Blue Sky and Silver Bird"", the song's ululating strings summon an epic sadness,
    while Mary J. Blige's expertly delivered chorus oozes with conviction.</p><p>
    But elsewhere, only a decent Slim Thug verse saves ""Breakin' Old Habits"" from
    utter mediocrity.  Not as much can be said for the middling new R. Kelly and
    Missy Elliott songs featuring tacked-on verses, or the ludicrous Dipset/Lil'
    Wayne collaboration ""I'm Wit Whateva"" that doesn't even feature B.I.G.'s
    vocals.  Is this a mistake or are Jim Jones dedications enough to justify
    inclusion here?  Maybe ""Whatchu Want"", the requisite Jay-Z duet (ludicrously
    credited to the Commission), is a big deal, but it's stock compared to their
    earlier thriller ""Brooklyn's Finest"".  Even the songs that make sense, like
    ""Get Your Grind On"", with Fat Joe, Big Pun, and Freeway, fall flat.</p><p>
    If anything, this compilation will have youngsters scratching their head
    over what made the Notorious B.I.G. the subject of hero worship.  Everything
    from the foolishly illustrated album art, featuring a stoned-looking Christopher
    Wallace with a crown slooping off his head, to the overwrought dedications from
    his kids, mom, and Lil' Cease (!) flounders in the face of his intimidating if
    overstated legacy.  This record has no rhythm or personality-- and truthfully,
    no reason to exist.  The presence of so many of big names speaks to his importance,
    vis-à-vis the Rapper=Rock Star revolution.  But none of these artists can speak
    to B.I.G.  And if they could, something tells me he wouldn't have much to say back.</p></div>"|5923.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5923-duets-the-final-chapter/|4.2|Sean Fennessey

    quitting your job to do something you love. In his late twenties and
    supporting his Delaware family with a disheartening 9-to-5 gig, he decided
    to make a go of a career in music, in spite of having next to no first-hand
    musical experience.  He holed up in his basement with an acoustic guitar,
    a few chords, a Moog synthesizer, and assorted electronic devices and
    created what would prove to be his only opus: <i>Dreamies</i>.</p><p>
    
    The album is a triumph.  It's difficult to even place it in context because
    it's such an oddball little record, on the one hand probing whatever corners
    of his mind Holt felt were worthy of exploration, and on the other deftly
    preserving a sense of popular songcraft.  Holt structured his album in
    two side-long suites, ""Program Ten"" and ""Program Eleven"".  The numbers he
    chose were not random: He saw his work as a direct continuation of what the
    Beatles did on ""Revolution 9"", packing it with found sound, including a couple
    of boldly snatched samples of ""I've Just Seen a Face"", ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely
    Hearts Club Band"", ""Oh! Darling"", and ""All You Need Is Love"".</p><p>
    
    Not that sampling other peoples' records got him into trouble.  The simple
    fact is that almost no one heard the album upon its initial release, and the
    situation has barely improved since.  In fact, until Gear Fab records resurrected
    <i>Dreamies</i> back in 2000 for a limited release, the album was completely
    unavailable outside of collectors' circles, qualifying it for genuine Lost
    Classic status.  This most recent reissue sounds absolutely fantastic, presenting
    Holt's hi-fi vision with brilliant clarity, subdivided into tracks of more
    manageable lengths.</p><p>
    
    As the album opens, President John Kennedy mingles with a field of insects,
    making his famous payload/payroll gaff in a speech about the space program.
    This gives way to Holt's acoustic guitar, slowly descending through some
    basic chords and his mellow, double-tracked vocal. This trippy little song
    becomes the backbone of a 26-minute odyssey that teeters on chaos at points
    as radio transmissions, snippets of title fight broadcasts and recordings of
    shattering glass interrupt and fade, all the while dappled with Moog overdubs.
    Holt hands the melody to the Moog on occasion, but mostly uses it to create
    the album's weird, buzzing ambience.</p><p>
    
    On the flip side, ""Program Eleven"" is more aggressive and downcast,
    featuring a loop of Holt's whispered exhortation to ""just dream"" used as a
    rhythm, along with numerous samples of gunfire and TV commercials.  Holt also
    appears to have made some of his own field recordings, as apparent subway
    announcements and dinner conversation leak into the texture, fighting with
    simple psychedelic pop for the listener's attention while Moogs climb and
    descend scales.  Eventually, the suite veers into jarring passages of noise
    and overlapping voices.</p><p>
    
    The overall effect is something like a primordial Olivia Tremor Control, and
    easily as wild and unfettered as anything the Residents were doing in the
    70s.  <i>Dreamies</i> has its obvious and acknowledged influences-- the Beatles
    and John Cage chief among them-- but it's also clearly the work of an untutored
    auteur dissecting his own mind in the basement on reel-to-reel.  Holt never
    recorded again, as the financial losses he suffered making the album forced
    him back into the workaday world, but more than 30 years later, his one moment
    on tape still sounds incredible.</p></div>"|2449.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2449-dreamies-2006-special-edition/|8.7|Joe Tangari

Their music contains a certain amount of mystery, with drones hinting at a shadowy world even as the placid surface drifted toward new age, but the makers always struck me as approachable. It's a quality best illustrated by the amiable intimacy of the Windy-penned liner notes on <em>Introspection</em>, the late 2002 singles and rarities box that ushered in a period of semi-retirement.</p><p>
    
    Early in 2005 Windy &amp; Carl were persuaded by a friend to release a handmade CD-R to launch the small-run Brainwashed Handmade label. Their inspiration for the new project was the recent death of Flea, the dog they had cared for together for 14 years. This release pairs a reissue of <em>Dedications to a Flea</em> with a second album of new material called <em>Dream House</em>. Flea is pictured on the record sleeve and Windy tells the dog's story with a staggering amount of detail on the booklet inside. A thousand-word essay about a beloved pet is a strange gesture for an album's liner notes, sure, but coming from these two it seems a little less unusual.</p><p>
      
    Text aside, the music is a welcome return to form. Windy &amp; Carl will probably never reach the focus achieved on their masterpiece, 1998's <em>Depths</em>, but these two albums show they're still able to build an effective atmosphere. This is long-form Windy &amp; Carl with textural skill intact; four tracks stretch across two CDs and none of them seems in any particular hurry. ""Ode to a Dog"" has the peaceful, cloud-drift ambience that filled <em>Consciousness</em>, with Windy's repeating bass pulse framing Carl's sheets of sheer, light-catching feedback. ""Sketch for Flea"" pairs a ""field recording"" of Flea on a walk-- complete with pants and the sound of rain on the sidewalk-- with a more ominous rumble of guitar hum. The latter track is particularly striking, with the thrashings of the departed dog lending an unpredictable air to the patiently unfolding drone.</p><p>
<em>The Dream House</em> opens with ""The Eternal Struggle"", which I believe is, at 32 minutes, the longest track Windy &amp; Carl have released. There is more here than merely keeping the drone going for twice as long as usual, though; in fact ""The Eternal Struggle"" seems quite composed relative to W&amp;C;'s typical Eno-esque ""horizontal"" method. Though changes happen slowly the structure suggests symphonic movements, with the long opening organ drone serving as the tonal center toward which other instruments gravitate, and surges of noise dominate the last few minutes. ""I Have Been Waiting to Hear Your Voice"" closes the set with a Fripp-inspired lead carving a melody from an icy extended chord.</p><p>
    
    The stated inspiration for <em>The Dream House</em> is LaMonte Young's installation of the same name, but Windy &amp; Carl's world is so much more human and imperfect. The eternal magnificence of physics informs the work of the old master but Windy &amp; Carl's steady-state pieces never lose touch with the limitations of the organic, the most significant of which being the thing that took Flea from them.</p></div>"|11865.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11865-the-dream-housededications-to-a-flea/|7.3|Mark Richardson

Right away, you know Todd Drootin is on some freaky shit: Not only does the cover art's Books on Tape logo have an umlaut over the ""p"", but it also has them <em>under</em> the ""k"" and the ""n.""  Dude, stop, I can't even do that with my keyboard!  Drootin, on the other hand, can do lots with his various inputs, drum machines, and samplers, and while <em>Dinosaur Dinosaur</em> makes for good interstate driving music, it might have you concerned you've drifted onto the rumble strip.</p><p>
    
    Speaking of audio-lit, this project shouldn't be confused with that of better-known electronic manipulators the Books.  Where that group is solemnly stony, Drootin's beatscapes are more deranged and abrasive.  As sonic reshaping goes, <em>Dinosaur Dinosaur</em> is less interested in making a statement-- for instance, there are no broad intuitive leaps between recognizable samples-- than in making a racket, pulling open a silverware drawer full of variously-oxidized but uniformly spindly percussion on the profoundly apolitical ""Noise Is Political"", then sending it down the terror chute of ""Killing Machine"", ravaged with clipped syllables and rhythmic moans, a punchy staccato melody and floppy bass, and a stabbing swarm of synths.</p><p>
    
    Mellower tracks like ""Surly Ambassador"" sound like Jason Forrest tweaking a long Boards of Canada loop until he just can't take it anymore, then ratcheting it up to a hectic house bounce that picks up debris like a Katamari before collapsing into a sinister dirge. This music can't sit still: Densely detailed and riotous mini-compositions frantically leapfrog over each other; old grooves split before they wear out their welcome and come back with new haircuts; the electronic scalpel makes mincemeat of the obsolete analog cadaver.  And later, the dumb tropicalia of ""Bubblegum"" gets flash-frozen by the shifting digitalia blowing around it, and the anthemic guitars on ""Upon Rock City"" decay into stuttering glitch-fests at both ends: rock music body-modded toward ambiguity in the age of elective sonic surgery. </p></div>"|1190.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1190-dinosaur-dinosaur/|7.1|Brian Howe

    implosion, resulting in two members, Myles Broscoe and Brendan Reed,  
    exiting the band. The two, who played on the Arcade Fire's debut EP,  
    left and joined Kyle Fostner and Owain Lawson, forming Les  
    Angles Morts and writing innovative instrumental music. Their debut full length, <em>What's Real?</em>, is at times frantic, with  
    hyperactive drumming and squealing analog synths, and at times  
    haunting and ominous, building layers of guitars and droning  
    keyboards. The album fuses post-rock with post-punk, indie  
    rock with noise, and its biggest undoing is the lack of focus.</p><p>
    
    The band refers to the music they create as post-punk movie scores,  
    and its live performances are multimedia affairs based  
    as much on video as audio. Perhaps this offers a clue as to why this  
    disc seems so randomly organized. There are tracks here that sloppily  
    layer the instruments at full volume, creating a cacophony of  
    chirping, banging, and squealing. But there are also soft,  
    moody pieces that incorporate multiple acoustic guitars, quiet  
    droning, and minimal percussion. The songs that show restraint are  
    ultimately successful, while the noisier tracks tend to be so  
    clamorous that they become grating. Had the band reigned in some of  
    their chaotic tendencies, a much more consistent record would've  
    resulted.</p><p>
    
    Consider opener ""What's Real Summer?"", which begins with  
    electronic blips and a restrained rhythm section interplaying bass  
    and drums. The mood is held for only 30 seconds, however, before  
    it bursts into a swirling mess of cymbal crashes and high-pitched  
    synths. The song soon shifts again, this time to incorporate siren-like squeals from the synthesizers, but it never regains the calm,  
    brooding nature. ""Kaleidoscope"" suffers  
    similarly, its distortion cutting through the mix and acting like its own instrument, intent on  
    distracting the listener from the rest of the track's sounds. ""Portals"" irritatingly blasts through its first half with several  
    repeating guitar notes over a fast bass-snare beat, but then  
    sobers up and transforms into an emotive, poetic piece. The track  
    sums up the entire album in under 90 seconds. </p><p>
    
    When the band approaches its songs more judiciously and focuses on  
    one style, the results are pleasant. ""Huge Antlers"" is like the theme  
    to a warped spy movie, with reverb-heavy guitar over an almost  
    constant snare roll. Likewise, ""Wave Pool"" dabbles in lo-fi surf,  
    maintaining a steady, restrained tempo and tone throughout. One of  
    the album's pleasant surprises, ""Waking Up a Maze"", is constructed  
    almost entirely of strumming acoustic guitars in a flamenco-like  
    rhythm augmented by shaking tambourines and quiet, rumbling drums. </p><p>
    
    There are a few tracks where the band is able to maintain its blend  
    of genres without spiraling out of control. ""Ninja Garden"" evokes  
    images of man-in-a-rubber-suit monster attacks with its robotic  
    background howling and desolate synth grumbles. ""Sing Together"",  
    possibly the strongest track here, begins with a syncopated dance  
    beat, and the crisp, metallic guitars cut across the top of the low- 
    end synth and bass rumbling. The tension builds along with the  
    instruments as a sort of march-of-the-damned occurs just over a  
    minute in. The track is menacing, and it manages to convey a sense of  
    dread and panic without resorting to chaos. It's a shame Les Angles  
    Morts haven't delivered this level of quality throughout the

One out of three ain't bad.  Though early references were made to canonical art-rock legends such as Television and the Velvet Underground-- bands that achieved more popularity after disbanding than at their creative peaks-- the Strokes were superstars by comparison: Their debut sold more than 2 million copies worldwide; the Velvets wouldn't crack <i>Billboard</i>'s top 100 albums chart until the release of 1985's posthumous <i>VU</i>.  But that's where the glory fades: The Strokes simply ascended to mainstream acceptance, leaving a potential underdog rock legacy in the dust, and accruing a truckload of backlash in the process.  So one can hardly blame them for cutting their losses and going for broke on their boorishly titled third album, <i>First Impressions of Earth</i>.</p>
<p>Here, the Strokes simultaneously settle into diminished expectations (delaying an album until just after Christmas = not screening a movie for film critics) and wildly ratchet up their sound, trying new things, getting weirder, but remaining true to the core of their sound.  Though always inhumanly taut, the band has grown even tighter, and now plays with a precision that, while coldly machinelike at times, is impressive more often than not.  On songs like ""Juicebox"" and the standout ""Electricityscape"", drummer Fab Moretti and bassist Nicolai Fraiture form a no-nonsense rhythm section that keeps these songs as concise and focused as possible.  Albert Hammond and Nic Valensi, meanwhile, build a complex weapons system out of just two guitars, interlocking like Thundercats and launching short singsongy riffs that add tension and spark, particularly on tracks like ""Heart in a Cage"" and ""Razorblade"".</p>
<p>But if the group has grown deadlier and more dynamic in their five years together, singer Julian Casablancas still struggles as a lyricist.  Perhaps dogged by persistent assertions that he has nothing to say, he finally cracks here, asserting that <i>no one</i> does.  ""Seven billion people got nothing to say,"" he moans on album closer ""Red Light"", ""Are you coming on to me?""  And leading up to that summary statement is an insistent defensiveness that curdles otherwise decent songs into tedious self-consciousness.  On ""Ask Me Anything"", he admits, ""I've got nothing to say"", and tempers his cynicism with nonsense as proof: ""Don't be a coconut/ God is trying to talk to you.""</p>
<p>Of course, no one ever listened to the Strokes for deep insight into the human condition.  They benefitted from being in the right place at the right time, coming into their own while the dominant trends of the late 90s were fizzling out.  Just like many of the flannel-clad Seattle-ites of that decade (and, arguably, the spandex-sporting hair-metal bands of the 80s), the Strokes encapsulated numerous trends at once, projecting more meaning through their style and sound-- that scruffy hair, weathered denim, slouchy throwback punk-- than through their songs.  And regardless of message, Casablancas has proven himself a large and important part of that appeal, for both his physical presence and his vocals, which remain ragged and loose in opposition to the band's rock-solid dynamic.  On <i>First Impressions</i>, however, he seems eager to break the mold, but unsure how: On ""Vision of Division"" and ""The Ize of the World"", he strains harder, screaming through gritted teeth; ""Heart in a Cage"" and ""Fear of Sleep"" find him leaning too heavily on repetition of phrases that quickly become grating; during the Pogues-like stomp ""Evening Sun"", he fakes a Shane MacGowan accent for the first few lines before dropping the schtick altogether; and on ""Ask Me Anything"" and ""On the Other Side"", he makes this album the Strokes' loungiest to date.</p>
<p>A handful of these modifications are welcome as a change of pace, and at times make <i>First Impressions</i> sound prickly and confident.  When the band is on, the songs attain the force and fury of previous outings.  Unfortunately, the album is also clogged with a number of tracks that are as sloppy as titles like ""The Ize of the World"" and ""Vision of Division"" suggest.  But the band's failures do, if nothing else, possess a certain schadenfreude, allowing a fascinating glimpse at a band futilely grasping in all directions for something new and meaningful, only to fumble with a half-fragment of unformed idea between its desperate fingers.</p></div>"|7539.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7539-first-impressions-of-earth/|5.9|Stephen M.

Featuring two long, home-recorded skeletal jams, this early set shows the duo to be already perfectly comfortable-- if not downright beatific-- in each other's company, as they serenely bat various embryonic ideas between their paws. And though the twosome's odd bit of moonlighting still makes the most sense when considered as a side project, this strangely luminous EP stands as evidence that many of Jane's abundant creative promises are yet to be fulfilled.</p><p>
     
    In an interview with <em>The Wire</em>, Lennox described Jane's 2005 album <em>Berserker</em> as being ""like a mix CD with toasting over the top."" While this might be an accurate description of the duo's general methods or work habits, it doesn't provide much insight into the mysteries of their sound, nor do attempts to imprecisely file their work into genres such as ambient or techno. Using little more than a turntable and mixer, on these two tracks Mou spins out an uncluttered field of murky beats and granulated effects, re-casting the medievalism inherent in Lennox's ethereal, wordless vocals into a striking new micro-industrial context.</p><p>
    
    Reportedly created upon the duo's first meeting, the 21-minute ""Coconuts"" is a marvel of psychedelic economy, driven with an unrelenting propulsion that approximates a lo-tech, basement version of Can's ""Mother Sky"". After a couple minutes of quiet scrabbling, the song's rhythm soon settles into a grainy, repetitive lurch, sounding like the vintage equipment of a long-abandoned factory suddenly springing back into action. Along the way, various sprays of unfastened noise or isolated keyboard patterns are examined and then discarded, while Lennox's delicate, sculpted vocals arch elegantly above the clamor.</p><p>
    
    Far more diffuse is the EP's second track, ""Ossie"", which directly anticipates the liquid textures of <em>Berserker</em>. Stretched over the course of 25 minutes, this track has an almost episodic structure, with minutes spent of Lennox wandering desolate through scattered electronic detritus, a landscape that includes the occasional crackle of static that one might too easily mistake for a failing speaker. Midway through, ""Ossie"" does achieve a certain hesitant advancing pulse, but never quite manages to bring all of its distinct particles entirely into concert. Nonetheless, it's encouraging to hear Lennox willing to stray this far afield from the security of the Animal Collective's campfires, and hopefully Jane will soon find the opportunity to further advance upon the gains drawn by these formative recordings.</p></div>"|4358.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4358-coconuts-ep/|7.0|Matthew Murphy

    dude was covered in his own blood. Can't say I remember the sound, so who knows the precise peace content
    (there were razorblades), but that was also three years ago; these
    days, sonically speaking, Kites and his political rage have gone from man vs. himself to man vs. his own machine, following
    the peace sign-shaped tracks of Henry Barnes (Amps For Christ) and
    Jessica Rylan (Can't).</p><p>
    
    Still, the impulse is sharp: ""Flag Torn Apart"" would be painful, if
    the handmade sound system didn't quit and thrust the vocals back into
    the primeval static from which they came. A mere control on raw
    analog noise, the pseudo-raging voice processes the synth bleat and
    modulated round tones until it's inarticulate. Colin
    Langenus, half of the equally loving and raging USAISAMONSTER, pulled
    the same trick recently on his own recent solo record, creating comedy and incomprehensible static from genuine feeling; the actual music's gone subliminal.</p><p>
    
    ""Exploded Face"" gets down to business as far as non-violent chirpy violence goes, maybe call it
    brutal noise for beginners, and the redundant ""True""
    revisits earlier sequenced noise-box lines, this time bled low against
    a reluctant, pulled-right-out-of-the-machine and moaning high end. 
    But, to borrow a phrase, most of <i>Peace Trials</i> is a song against
    itself: death imagery sung in harmony, palindromic vocals working the
    middle from both sides, crackling transistor warmth merging with the
    human version of same.</p><p>
    
    Sex and pessimism in the ears, sure, but it's love and drugs on the
    floor. Kites' got that figured, and his message only benefits from
    his inability to articulate it; I prefer ""Dirt's"" ""On and On and
    On/ No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No"" to anybody's
    righteous breakdown. The most introspective song on here, ""Peace
    Trials"", is a duet with Erin Rosenthal from the Provi psych band Urdog, and it also just nods at the crux: ""Master's voice/ Radiates/ Peace
    Trials/ Peace Trials."" Let somebody else figure out the specifics.</p><p>
    
    There is an undeniable provincialism at work here-- one song quotes
    Three Studies for a Crucifixion, a mid-1990s Ohio hardcore band
    adopted in New England as the region's own-- and in many ways <i>Peace Trials</i> speaks
    as well for that kind of regional solidarity as anything in recent
    memory. The mix of distracted psych, gritty electronics, self-made
    machines that don't work half the time, and a mostly implied ultra-left politic feels as much like another day in Providence as it
    does like music. The aural-journalism lays bare an elusive
    sentiment in the city's abandoned lofts. 
    Maybe meaningless, but at least it's correct.</p></div>"|4604.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4604-peace-trials/|7.7|Zach Baron

On the contrary, <em>Bells Break Their Towers</em> might be Bright's craftiest invention yet, as they circle outward to further incorporate layered vocals, narcotic Krautrock repetitions, and cagey post-Slint guitar dynamics into their explorative space-rock. And though on initial pass their orbit may appear to take a rather too familiar post-rock trajectory, here Bright have sufficiently broadened their scope to encompass some lovely and genuinely alien terrain.</p><p>
    
    The core of the group remains guitarist/vocalist Mark Dwinell and multi-instrumentalist Joe Labrecque, but on <em>Bells Break Their Towers</em> the instrumental line-up expands and contracts from track to track as necessary, ranging from the basic duo up to a sextet. This fluidity is somewhat invisible, however, as on these eight pieces Bright make such extensive use of multi-tracking, particularly on Dwinell's vocals, that rarely does the music feature fewer than three instruments at once. So while these tracks have their origins in spontaneous composition, they've also clearly been pored over meticulously in the studio, an approach that sacrifices some of the free particle energy of their earlier recordings in exchange for a balanced clarity and more vigilant celestial navigation.</p><p> 
    
    Bright's increased melodic concision is immediately evident on the opening ""Manifest Harmony"", which features a torrent of Dwinell's interlocking vocal streams within a churning eddy of guitar and keyboard. On this track, and other more pop-centric cuts like the endlessly chiming ""Receiver"", his boyish vocals can often be a dead ringer for those of Rob Crow, leaving these songs sounding like a trippier, more cosmically-inclined version of Pinback-- an equation certainly not without its merits. Dwinell's unblemished vocals also fit perfectly into the tranquil currents of ""Flood,"" a trio piece featuring three acoustic guitars exquisitely set into a continually renewing mantra-like dialogue.</p><p> 
    
    Acoustic guitar also figures prominently into the 12-minute ""An Ear Out"", one of this set's several extended instrumental transmissions. With its serpentine, quicksilver guitar and patiently unspooling rhythms, this track could be mistaken for a product of the Aerial M/Tortoise/For Carnation axis, but Lebrecque's vigorous acoustic strums and resourceful percussion give the piece a regenerative pull uniquely its own. Even more impressive is the equally-long title track, which adds two basses and Michael Torres' violin to instigate a disorienting, multi-layered drone worthy of experimental acts like Vibracathedral Orchestra, with Bright's swirling winds kicking up enough dust to obscure the rush of the oncoming stars.</p></div>"|935.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/935-bells-break-their-towers/|7.2|Matthew Murphy

So when Kind of Like Spitting not only revives his songs but studies and evangelizes them-- per the liner notes, KOLS has performed these in concert with explanations of who Ochs was and why he still matters-- they deserve praise, especially when they pull it off this well.</p><p>
    
    Ochs wrote lyrics that were topical to his times, from the early '60s through his personal decline (as well as the decline of the anti-war movement) in the early '70s. But in KOLS' hands, they never sound dated. Protest folk songs are a thing of the past but at their best, Ochs' lyrics remain inspired and witty, like the chorus from ""Draft Dodger Rag"": ""I've got a dislocated disc and a racked up back/ I'm allergic to flowers and bugs/ And when the bombshell hits, I get epileptic fits/And I'm addicted to a thousand drugs."" ""That's What I Want To Hear"" calls for the downtrodden to come together and form a union, and it's still relevant-- it's just missing a line about rising health care costs. The anti-war anthem ""I Ain't Marchin' Anymore"" recalls the young men sent to die throughout our history, and it would be easy enough to update it for the present-- but thankfully, KOLS leave it alone.</p><p>
    
    Ben Barnett and David Jerkovich share duties on vocals and acoustic guitar, and they do the songs justice with love, enthusiasm, and not too much reverence. Urgent and precise, they find the right tone for this style of brisk folk music, and they only fall short on the vocals: they miss Ochs' dry delivery-- for example, on ""Outside of a Small Circle of Friends"", which comes out with too-obvious scorn-- and also, both singers sound like they've got head colds.</p><p>
    
    It's a common question why, no matter how bad things get, we can't cough up a great protest singer today. But the answer is right here in Ochs' songs: again and again, he criticizes the listener for non-particiation-- for supporting the war but dodging the draft, for skipping out on the riots at the '68 convention, for not stopping a rape or helping the poor. Ochs turned his angriest words on the liberals who talked big and did nothing. </p><p>
    
    But he had no idea where we'd be in the '00s, when staying politically active means keeping your Kerry-Edwards sticker on your bumper a year after the election. Protest music today reeks of nonparticipation and even impotence, from the abstract anxiety that fills Radiohead's '00s albums, to Conor Oberst's ""When the President Talks to God""-- a puerile trainwreck of a song, but also a timely one, because all of the cussing and television-kicking mirrors how Blue Staters act after hearing about Bush's latest adventures on ""All Things Considered"". Today we lack the literacy, the specificity and the argument of a Phil Ochs song because we don't participate, and we have nothing at stake.</p><p>
    
    So my solution is simple: bring back the draft. Sen. John McCain, who wants us to win in Iraq, has probably been thinking about this all along as he calls for higher troop levels and more engagement from the public; and while Rep. John Murtha got the spotlight for saying we should pull out, he has also said that he would love to bring back the draft, drum up the army we need and go back and win this thing-- but he knows it'll never happen. Well, I say that it can. If the Bushies step it up a notch and demand sacrifice, in lives and treasure, from the American people, we will step it up in kind and get serious about complaining and protesting. We won't wag a finger at the TV; we'll march in the streets. And if we don't give it everything we've got, here's hoping the next Phil Ochs shows up to call ""bullshit"" on us all.</p></div>"|4435.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4435-learn-the-songs-of-phil-ochs/|7.2|Chris Dahlen

Adams' avalanching output certainly perverts common notions about art-as-pain, perplexing folks who think songwriting should be all clenched fists and bloody fingernails-- but no matter where you land on Adams' preposterous pacing, there's still something compelling (fearless, even) about the display.</p><p>
    
    Produced by Ethan Johns (who worked with Adams on 2000's <em>Heartbreaker</em> and 2001's <em>Gold), </em><em>29</em> features nine songs, each of which portrays Adams, now 31, at a different year in his twenties. The album might be murky and inconsistent, but it's also an eerily apt encapsulation of country-trotting, post-collegiate confusion, and flitting relentlessly between styles, moods, cities, and fucked-up affairs. Scattered, slow-building, and occasionally soporific, <em>29</em> is also unfortunately easy to dismiss-- meaning naysayers will miss a handful of perfectly transcendent tracks.</p><p> 
    
    Adams has never been particularly skilled at masking his influences, and opener ""29"" is a walloping reinterpretation of the Grateful Dead's ""Truckin'"", with the same squished vocals (including the roll call of American locales), guitar noodles, and thump-thumping percussion. Adams may howl ""singin'"" instead of ""truckin,'"" but the sentiment and the sound remain the same. ""Strawberry Wine"" is eight minutes of muffled acoustic guitar and falsetto, a slow-burning, lyrically-meandering rumination on west coast slumps, high and sad, nodding to both Devendra Banhart and Neil Young. On first listen, ""Strawberry Wine"" plods, but the track is impeccably recorded (Johns manages to tangle a 12-string and a eukele into Adams' guitar lines, building a tingly, strummy haze), and Adams' penchant for storytelling is awfully well-showcased. Even the song's sluggish pacing is ultimately justified, as Adams' whimpers ""I'm getting older/ Gotta break out,"" wailing desperately, incessantly-- as if he doesn't quite know how to stop himself from making noise.</p><p>
    
    The thick, elegiac ""Night Birds"" is <em>29</em>'s most memorable track, and one of Adams' better vocal performances, as he moans over hollow piano riffs, lamenting all the stagnation and hopelessness of being 26: ""I feel like a body stuffed into a trunk/ From a million years of light/ And getting drunk."" ""Night Birds"" is a haunting dirge (and introduces themes-- sinking, especially-- that pop up over the course of <em>29</em>), but Johns leans too heavily on volume and echo here; Adams already has a habit of coordinating sounds and lyrics in a way that's distractingly deliberate, and by song's end, the chorus (""We were supposed to rise above/ But we sink/ Into the ocean"") is so bloated with reverb it's hard not to cringe a little, fighting off the implied portrait of Adams splashing helplessly into the sea.</p><p>
    
    The pedal steel-riddled ""Carolina Rain"" follows in the country-travelogue footsteps of <em>Cold Roses</em> and <em>Jacksonville City Nights</em>, all railway lines, fried eggs, southern cities, and freight cars teeming with granite. ""The Sadness"" is full of wiggly, Ennio Morricone-inspired spaghetti guitar, while ""Elizabeth, You Were Born to Play That Part"" is a piano-and-vocals meditation on loss and depression. Stunning closer ""Voices"" sees Adams employing Biblical players to convey proper despondency, howling ""Elijah/ Don't you call,"" repeatedly invoking the messenger's miraculous firestorm (battling the prophets of Baal at Mount Carmel, Elijah shot fire from heaven to prove God's power.) ""We're never coming back, once the signal's been fired,"" Adams roars, over barely-there acoustic strums. ""Run away from the light.""</p><p>
    
    Self-serious and wildly inconsistent (in both ingenuity and style), <i>29 is hard to swallow without acknowledging and appreciating the record's overarching storyline: getting through your twenties is way hard. Adams may churn out heaps of uneven tracks-- unfiltered and unedited, scrappy and undercooked, too long, too earnest, too much-- but <em>29</em> still fulfils its narrative promise, in terrifically failed, oddly beautiful ways.</i></p></div>"|44.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/44-29/|6.8|Amanda Petrusich

It's not awful, but in some
    ways that's worse. While no production affectation could enliven Herren's languid songwriting, it would be nice if he showed some interest in the material. His hand sleepwalks up and down
    the keyboard, loping grid-drawn phrases with minimal dynamics. Maybe ""Stay Home"" wouldn't be so teflon if Herren tweaked some knobs. The Rhodes can growl like a sprawled-out pit bull guarding
    his dumpster scraps; Herren's yawns like it's ready for a tryptophan nap.</p><p>
    
    Not even syncopation salvages. Beats either fumble in downmixed free-jazz frottage (""Recuerdas"") or crack from erectness (""Walk Home""). Credit Herren this: His rhythms whittle thin the often
    stark line separating live and synthetic drum sounds. How does he do it? Seemingly by cooking-cutting live kit snippets, then running them on a conveyor belt until they assume 808 rigidity.
    Hey, I eat Devil Dogs, too, but that doesn't mean I like seeing them on <em>Unwrapped</em>.</p><p>
    
    So has this guy peaked early?  Not at all; he just beatmakes like my buddy Matt plays ""World of Warcraft"": mindlessly and probably at the expense of more important shit, perhaps even actually
    shitting.  <em>Singles Collection</em> cultivates material dating back to 2003, the same year Herren gave us <i>One Word Extinguisher, his praiseworthiest product to date. ""Spring's Arrival""
    and ""Running JCH for All His Breaks and Jewels"" play like over-aerated discards from that project. Where <em>One Word</em> tossed its mesclun mix, Herren here cobbles together smudges of sound--
    faint wind chimes, light bass bob, lava lamp synth bubbles-- and leaves it at that. It's minimal but not minimalist: His gestures achieve nothing.</i></p></div>"|6589.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6589-the-singles-collection-03-05/|3.0|Sam Ubl

    especially since its cranky leadoff single ""NY Excuse"" was in arm's reach of ""Yeah"" in 2004's punkfunk marathon. Soon word 
    of Duran Duran-repping ""Nite Versions"" of <i>AMN</i> tracks fluttered 
    about-- self-done electro retakes fitted for the floor but still 
    uncompromisingly rock-- and a few popped up on that punch-drunk Radio 1 
    broadcast mix the 2manyDJs brothers did for the BBC back in January. 
    When the <em>NV</em>'d ""Krack"" slowed down summer jams to slurry, breaking up the 
    BPMs like ""Jamrock"" did in hip-hop sets, I had a feeling: A whole album 
    of this shit and we'd have a cruder, crunchier <i>Homework</i>.</p><p>
    
    Figures, Soulwax lead off <i>NV</i> with a cover of Daft Punk's 
    ""Teachers"", names changed for a who's who of dance-rock forefathers 
    (which to my chagrin, includes the goddamn the Who). In the vein of 
    ""AC/DC aren't a metal band, they're a dance band,"" ""Miserable Girls"" 
    grinds hard enough to get on one of those X-Games comps, seering guitar 
    lead and convicted vox trapped interminably in echo. Still these are 
    tracks before new-wave anthems, breakdowns before makeup, with emphasis 
    on the vertical and the power of repetition. Even the vocal hooks are 
    kept to snippets: ""It's not you, it's the e talking,"" or ""compute it!"" 
    or once is enough, ""James Brown is dead.""</p><p>
    
    Like for Munk or LCD Soundsystem, the authority (or something) of live 
    sound plays a part in the <em>NV</em> lure, but Soulwax never overstate. When the 
    comicbookishly dark holds on ""Slowdance"" give out for the bridge, those 
    sixteenths on the high hat effect a lot on their own; ""I Love Techno"" 
    benefits from heavy-handed drum pounds that hold back the song's twitter 
    and Blondie bassline; the legendary ""NY Lipps"" mash between ""NY 
    Excuse"" and ""Funky Town"" speaks for itself. These are simple tracks, 
    sure, confident enough to lay their soundmakers bare (and vice versa), 
    but such staunch anti-pussyfooting/anti-mysticism makes Soulwax a bit 
    more democratic, palpable too. They play what's humanly possible for a 
    quartet, and in fact, rumor has it they may even be playing these nite 
    versions live in Philadelphia at the NYE Making Time party. And if they 
    play NVs track-for-track, as they're peerlessly mixed on the CD, those 
    minor strings that course teary-eyed closer ""Another Excuse"" won't drop 
    the ball.</p></div>"|7840.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7840-nite-versions/|8.2|Nick Sylvester

Employing a rackful of software he manipulates hundreds of track segments, song bytes, and musical layers into 28 newly-titled pieces, their internal parts laid out under each heading like the gears and sprockets of a dismantled clock. Nothing fuzzy about that; in fact, in many ways <i>DE9: Transitions</i> couldn't be </em><em>more</em> technical. Even its artwork is calculated, with sleek lines of ASCII text trickling steadily along behind Hawtin's holographic Bowie face. But for all its cold calculation and software product placement, <i>Transitions is also quietly comforting. It's minimal techno married to the schematic of a goose down pillow.</i></p><p>
    A persistent BPM pads through its center, unifying the mix's hundreds of hiccups and digital spindles like the deftest of Calatrava spans. Selections like ""Visioning"", ""The Hole"", and ""Weiter Noch"" incorporate six, seven, even 10 primary sources. But the result is always clean and smooth, mostly because Hawtin aims for assimilation above everything else, no matter the character or duration of the building bits he uses. He's not trying to remake them in his image. The <em>DE9 series was always about exploration, and with </em><em>Transitions he's taking that notion to its purest form. Tech heads can pick the set apart surgically, trying to discern Pan Sonic's ""Liuos"" from Stewart Walker's ""Lakewalking"" inside ""Visioning""'s velvety tumble. But it's more fun to enjoy its brilliant use of space, to let it drift in four directions between your headphones like a smoothly morphing color bar test pattern. Software was the facilitator, but through painstaking arrangement and meticulous layering Hawtin finds its softer side.</em></p><p>
    There's a purism question, obviously. How far did Hawtin immerse his innate ability as an arranger, DJ, and producer in the microchip acid bath to make this mix? Is the oxide of human element completely washed away? If there are computers powerful enough to toy Kong-like with our puny brains, they certainly exist in Hawtin's home base of Berlin. Those rigs could make us think of pillows where there is only polyurethane, pretend to offer a future of technology warmfuzzies when there are really only methodically blinking cursors. Yikes! But techno heads don't really believe in that kind of Cyberdyne conspiracy anymore, if they ever did. And besides, the ""The Tunnel"" blends elements of Detroit Grand Pubahs' ""Dr. Bootygrabber"" with Mika Vainio's Ø alias, two of Hawtin's own tracks, and Styro2000 for one of <i>Transitions</i>' closest scrapes to truly fervid, live-Hawtin techno. And that's an intangible that technology just can't crack.</p></div>"|3771.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3771-de9-transitions/|7.8|Johnny Loftus

    electronic empire has struck back. Popped from the womb short and
    fuzzy like a <em>Weekly World News</em> monkey baby, the Beautiful New
    Born Children traffic in garage-punk so red-line retro you can almost
    hear an NME drop (or is that just tinnitus?). They also happen to be
    fronted by Michael Beckett, German-based laptopper behind solo project
    Kpt.Michi.Gan as well as guitarist for electronic outfit Schneider TM.
    Jimmy Tamborello's gonna be so pissed.</p><p>
    
    Beckett's shift in direction shouldn't come as a complete shock.
    Guitars were welcome interlopers on Kpt.Michi.Gan's eponymous 2004
    effort, which also featured a crunching, vocoded version of the new
    album's title track. <em>Hey People!</em>, though, is a different
    creature, blazing through nine sloppy tracks of Libertines sneers,
    bouncy Strokes rhythms and painstaking haphazardness in about 23
    minutes. Beckett is accompanied by wife Kirsten and two friends, all
    playing instruments other than their own-- to heighten the
    verisimilitude? Still, squalls of noise and krautrock drone
    periodically confirm this wasn't recorded in an actual 1960s or '70s
    garage.</p><p>
    
    Lo-fi veneer aside, Beckett's songs could plausibly receive the same
    seven-word description as an Art Brut masterpiece-- funny lyrics
    shouted over basic rock riffage-- but here that's as meh as it sounds.
    ""I would like to show them how to boogie down,"" he shouts on the
    album's most cohesive song, ""Paper Mills"". Opener ""Do the Do"" bops
    around quoting ""Heart-Shaped Box"". The laffs soon shrink, relying on
    amphetamine and chemical-imbalance jokes as the lyrics become
    indecipherably distorted. It doesn't help that each two-minute
    power-chord blast is roughly interchangeable with the next. ""Hey
    People!"" adds acoustic guitar, but not enough to alter the basic
    texture. Only closer ""Up and Down and Round and Round"" breaks the
    formula, blitzkrieging a single chord an extra five minutes or so.</p><p>
    
    For whatever reason, the Beautiful New Born Children's handlers have
    tried to shroud their identity in mystery. Hey newness rings
    registers, but maybe Pollyanna the band just wants to be judged on its
    own merits. OK then: <em>Hey People!</em> isn't bad for a quick spastic
    freakout, though early comparisons to fast-dumb-loud savants like the
    Stooges and the MC5 are laughably overstated. The Children infuse
    their excitable, years-late revivalism with more explosions and less
    heart than similarly styled technological primitives the Exploding
    Hearts. In 2004 novel <em>The Confessions of Max Tivoli</em>, Andrew
    Sean Greer's backward-aging protagonist is born a wrinkled geezer. I'm
    just saying.</p></div>"|1189.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1189-hey-people/|6.0|Marc Hogan

Not only does the band's dark, heavy, theatrically composed sixth album, <em>Black One</em>, transcend the duo's previous material, overall it's one of the strongest records of the past year: Greg Anderson and Stephen O'Malley have unleashed a doom'n'gloom masterpiece.</p><p>  Ultra cinematic and nearly matching Sunn 0)))'s live power, <em>Black One</em>'s seven tracks will even please those who can't deal with uninterrupted drone. Getting assistance from key friends, including harsh noise icon John Wiese, the band overlaps smaller drone bits with the usual gargantuan exercises-- its staged like corpsepainted Noh drama. Opener ""Sin Nanna""-- on which the wonderful Australian experimental guitarist and percussionist Oren Ambarchi handles all the instruments-- is the mood setter, and is named for a moon god who sported a lapis lazuli beard and rode a winged bull. It's followed by ""It Took the Night to Believe"" which transitions the listener into the longer works. The six-minute piece begins in media res, as if the recording tape hits a snag and snaps back into action. Power chords drop in quick succession over smoky bass drone; the brutal ghost cry comes courtesy of U.S.-based black metal favorite Leviathan, aka Wrest. In some regards it's Sunn 0)))'s most straightforward metal song to date, though its series of ebb/flows is anything but typical.</p><p>  The bulk of the album-- each of the final five tracks are at least eight minutes long, with four of them moving past the 10:00 mark-- begins with an extended cover of Immortal's ""Cursed Realms (of the Winterdemons)"". Here Xasthur aka Malefic is cast asunder, grumbling about ravens, cursed realms, and the central thesis that ""the face of the earth/ Will be to know black silence."" It's more than two times as long as the original and built largely around Malefic's sub-tonal scowls and bleeding feedback drone.</p><p>  Then comes the more old-school Sunn 0)))- and Earth-sounding ""Orthodox Caveman"", 10 minutes of pure drone made flesh with Wiese's digital noise and Ambarchi on drums. ""CandleGoat"", which O'Malley says is ""an evolution of an artwork collaboration with Savage Pencil,"" includes soft-lit ambiance at its intro courtesy of Wiese and features a gravel-voiced O'Malley on the mic.</p><p>  Each piece is strong, but the album's highlight is its glacial, sprawling, anguished closer, ""Báthory Erzébet"". The track's a reference to Elizabeth Báthory, and likely also the Swedish black metal band her surname spawned. Báthory was an occult-friendly member of the Transylvanian royal family who is reputed to have killed hundreds of young girls. Some legends even claim she thought the lifeblood of virgins would keep her young, so she not only tortured and killed her victims but also bathed in or drank their blood. Báthory died in 1614 imprisoned in her own castle. Perhaps mirroring Báthory's lock-down, Sunn 0))) crammed Malefic in a casket (inside a Cadillac hearse) with only a microphone and his fear of small spaces. His resulting petrified, dry-bones performance and the claustrophobic recording technique should net a Grammy. Leading up to the star turn's a gentle hum throughout which Ambarchi weaves in a gong, bells, cymbal, and guitar. Then comes the teeming Anderson/O'Malley assault, announcing the most triumphant avant-rock moment in recent memory.</p><p>  Okay, Anderson and O'Malley have long hair and they populate their ambient universes with some likeminded players (whether Julian Cope or Joe Preston), but there's no reason for their work to be ghettoized as some cartoonish Dungeons &amp; Dragons dog-and-pony show. I've spoken at length to O'Malley and can say, without a doubt, that he's one of the most intelligent people I've encountered (from any walk of life) and that he and Anderson plan to continually refine and complicate both their sound and the theories they hold about musical composition. (The last person I encountered so knowledgeable and rigorous about his own work was Tony Conrad.)</p><p>  With <em>Black One</em>, Sunn 0))) harnesses the sounds and moods of black metal, then expands its palette through meticulous experimentation and a commitment to the physicality of sound. The result is a beautiful, deep, passionate reflection of life's bleakest corners.</p><p> </p></div>"|7581.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7581-black-one/|8.9|Brandon Stosuy

""What is that shite, Alasdair?!"" Of course, this being the Clientele, the racket isn't so loud; it probably sounded rather soothing coming through the cracks in the door as the rest of the family went around their business. Even at this early stage the Clientele could write tightly constructed but wistful melodies, and with whatever crude 4-track set-up they had going they knew how to circle every instrument, voices included, with a warm aura of echoing loveliness.</p><p>
    
    During these embryonic years the Clientele included Innes Phillips, who eventually went his own way with his band the Relict. <em>It's Art Dad</em> roughly alternates songs by Phillips and current Clientele leader Alasdair MacLean. The pair obviously shared a vision but Phillips' flatter tone occasionally alludes to a more gothic road not taken. On ""Graven Wood"" for example, his croon oddly calls up a grim world, vaguely referencing the sort of icy remove invented by the Velvet Underground. When MacLean follows next with ""Dear Jennifer"", with its pop melody and opening lines ""Dear Jennifer, do you remember, fields of golden grain? Where butterflies and evening sunlight circle 'round again?"" we return safely to the familiar warm nostalgia Clientele eventually perfected.</p><p>
    
    That's what early experiments are for, though-- trying things on to see what fits. Fortunately, the appeal of <em>It's Art Dad</em> extends beyond the archeological. No matter the band, expectations should always be low for an album's worth of songs recorded before any officially released material and then shelved for almost 10 years. But some of these songs are still surprisingly great. The effortless tunefulness of ""St Paul's Beneath a Sinking Sky"" and ""Elm Grove Window"" argue that great songwriters are born not made; either could be spruced up and worked into an album as good as <em>Strange Geometry</em>. And ""February Moon"", a brooding mood piece with just guitar and voice, is almost shocking in the power of its affect, considering the level of technological sophistication that went into it.</p><p>
    
    It helps that the Clientele's aesthetic suffers little from lo-fi interpretation. Drums can be nothing more than a ride cymbal and snare rim tap and still work; guitars manage to ring through the hiss and compression; voices are channeled through a guitar amp with the reverb cranked to simulate classic AM radio production. The pinched and distant aspect of Clientele's sound still signifies on a 4-track, even when the songs aren't up to snuff (both ""August Sky"" and ""The Words We Knew"" are sub-B-side quality, a few more are only slightly more inspiring). For fans only? Of course-- it's a tour-only release. As they go, this is a good one.</p></div>"|1508.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1508-its-art-dad/|6.3|Mark Richardson

No, the order of these tracks is practically a form of rhetoric, and it has a pretty convincing argument to make concerning 4AD's whole status as a label. No kidding: The 18-track listing for this disc had me all primed to pick on it, but something about listening through the songs, in order, makes that a whole lot harder.</p><p> 
    The issue is that this London imprint has two sides. On one hand, it's the prime indie-world example of how a label can maintain a cohesive, reliable aesthetic. Through the end of the 1980s, 4AD's style was the sort you'd expect from a weirded-out college punk who majored in Art History so she could stare at gory Renaissance paintings and Baroque cathedrals: a mix of operatic singers, classicist ambience, gothic post-punk, hallucinatory New England college-rock, and-- above all-- great dreamy spangles of arty pop. Bauhaus, Cocteau Twins, Throwing Muses, Dead Can Dance; the feel was coherent and totally singular, from the music to Vaughn Oliver's signature album covers-- which looked, alternately, like Modernist journals and microscopic details from pre-Raphaelite oil paintings. And all of it could culminate in label head Ivo Watts-Russell's studio project, This Mortal Coil, which made a bona fide cover band of his particular tastes-- for minimalist arrangements, fancy digital keyboard pads, and the female voice.</p><p>
    On the other hand, 4AD is not some kind of cult. The label's catalog packs any number of releases that are remembered completely independent of any 4AD ""sound""-- from the Pixies to ""Pump up the Volume"", and from there to a modern-day roster featuring the Mountain Goats and TV on the Radio. So when you hit that 25th anniversary and sit down to put together a retrospective, you have a decision to make: How much is this label dead, and how much is it alive? How much are you going to canonize the stuff that defined your aesthetic, and how much are you going to throw together a label sampler for the acts you're repping now? Is this going to be a treat for devotees who really want some Dif Juz and Clan of Xymox obscurities dug out of the vaults, or is it going to be a grab-bag of singles from popular backstock like Blonde Redhead and the Breeders? </p><p>
    And that's where the sequencing comes in. The answer probably leans toward ""the latter,"" but something about the order of these songs makes the question feel meainingless. If there's a rhetoric built into that song order, the message is simple-- that <i>every</i> 4AD signing, from 1980 to the present, is part of the same aesthetic. That the Mountain Goats are as much a part of 4AD's ""style"" as Lush ever were. That 4AD has maybe spent the past 25 years making one giant mixtape for us, of which this is just one version. </p><p>
    None of that stops this from being much more of a label sampler than 4AD fans will care for. But just look at the first four tracks here. It kicks off with a brief chant from one of the label's most idiosyncratic projects-- <i>Le Mystère des Voix Bulgares</i>, recordings of a Bulgarian women's choir whose voices work in such close, near-dissonant Slavic intervals that the vibrations themselves seem to make you shiver. From there it's a short leap into the flowery bursts and fluttering vocals of Cocteau Twins, the band that did the most to turn 4AD style into a major force. And then: TV on the Radio's ""New Health Rock"", whipping up double-part falsetto rock chants in a way that suddenly seems like the natural next step. And then: The Birthday Party's grinding post-punk noir, completely of a piece with everything you just heard. </p><p>
    It all flows like this, thanks in part to careful representation of each artist-- not always the best-remembered track, but the one that fits the scheme. The minimalist dream-pop of His Name Is Alive leads into the fluffier dream-pop of Pale Saints. A recent acoustic Breeders track leads off to Throwing Muses and the Pixies, covering all three poles of the spindly Massachusetts indie-rock this label nurtured into fame. A full-band Mountain Goats chug leads naturally into Tarnation's arty old-country, and the goofy Gregorian new-goth of Dead Can Dance leads naturally into a spooky, minimalist album track from Blonde Redhead. Mojave 3, Belly, Red House Painters-- scanning down the list of artists makes it look like an advertisement for what's in stock at the warehouse, but listening through the offbeat song selections and their intuitive sonic links makes it <i>sound</i> like a mixtape of the best and most personal sort. </p><p>
    All of which means that I should never have called this a retrospective, right? Anyone looking for a snapshot of 4AD's signature sound would have better luck with 1987's <i>Lonely Is an Eyesore</i>. Anyone looking to see what 4AD is releasing now won't exactly need to hear Cocteau Twins and Wolfgang Press on this disc. Anyone looking for a <i>real</i> retrospective will just have to wait, one supposes, until 4AD closes up shop and does the obligatory box-- all the highlights, from This Mortal Coil's soundtrack-staple version of ""Song to the Siren"" to ""Pump up the Volume"" to, umm, ""I Melt With You"". For now, you are indeed looking at a form of that convenient sales-pitch, the label sampler. Only this ranks as a very well-made one: One guy picking his way through some of the songs he likes and has liked, and organizing them, mix-tape style, in a way that expresses his tastes-- and making a decent case for those tastes as a growing, changing, on-going concern, instead of some period piece from 15 years back.</p></div>"|2107.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2107-1980-forward-25-years-of-4ad/|7.4|Nitsuh Abebe

Somehow considered an EP despite containing 10 tracks (including a hidden one), <em>Soon There Will Be...</em> is the first release from Chapple's long-standing side project. Shooting at Unarmed Men don't sound much like Mclusky-- they're undeniably lo-fi, and neither as loud nor as frantic-- but they manage to withhold the volume while sounding just as distinctive. Like Ian Mackaye's recent Evens project, <em>Soon There Will Be...</em> veers from sloppy punk to scaled-back songs, albeit gleefully brutish where their D.C. brethren were graceful.</p><p>
    
    Mclusky's primary singer, Andy Falkous, crammed in syllables to convey the band's dark humor, but Chappple limits himself to concise, one-line truisms. (Everybody sing: ""Don't go fucking in the barn...""). The approach is much the same, and his vocals are just as coarse, though he's got more than enough angst, ideas, and energy for an entire album (or EP, whatever). ""Taking Care of Business"" opens the record on a calm note, with clean upstrokes and demure drums. Mclusky's calmer moments always hit straight to the gut when coming between all the chaos, but SAUM pull the same trick without the volume. Chapple sets up an us-and-them theme with lyrics about cursing the self-employed, and an even quieter, almost poignant chorus of ""They're not as clever as we think they are."" At first listen, it may sound like a grunge band who couldn't afford a Big Muff, but these short and sweet lo-fi punk songs are hymnals for young, happy drunks who woke up and found themselves in shitty 9-to-5s in a cubicle or a warehouse, wondering what happened.</p><p>
    
    ""Taking Care of Business"" just gets all that gravitas out of the way, so ""Four Eyed McClayvie"" brings back the thrash with some of Mclusky's snide self-deprecation (""Can anybody cope with another song?/ Well we're gonna play one anyways""), though fidelity holds it back from kicking up the same kind of dust as Chapple's old band. Elsewhere, the rallying cry of ""Impunity Rules"" skewers productivity goals over two galloping chords (""40 percent means you could do a lot better"") and ""The Long and Short of It"" is delightfully inane, chanting ""I love beer"" before hunching over into a boneheaded three-note riff. ""No One Can Waltz"" is a squeaky wanna-be military march and the group sing-along single ""The Pink Ink"" is undeniably catchy, though from the incidental studio patter that introduces it to the shouts of ""That's the spot!"" in the chorus, it shows its cheek at every opportunity. It works, too: These songs continue Mclusky's penchant for displaying a twisted, melodic sweet tooth underneath the thrash, and that bodes well for a proper album.</p></div>"|7839.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7839-soon-there-will-be-ep/|7.5|Jason Crock

Since the early days of 
    the band, members have shifted, entered, and exited, and the entire 
    group has relocated from Chapel Hill, N.C., to Chicago. The albums released 
    over the band's first four years reflected these changes, as their sound 
    constantly shifted, covering the full range of post-hardcore styles. After 2002's <em>Satanic 
    Verses</em>, the group slowed down its relentless record, tour, repeat 
    schedule. The result fifth LP <em>Ominosity</em>, a confident, focused piece, where the band seems to 
    have finally found its footing.</p><p>
    
    The disc opens with ""Killed on Public Transit"", which begins as a  
    hushed, atmospheric piece, but explodes into powerful mid-tempo rock  
    two-thirds of the way through. The style and skill of Steve Albini  
    and Greg Norman, the disc's producers, are apparent. They help the  
    band cram guitars, keyboards, and layers of lead and backing vocals  
    into a tight space without bullying any individual portion of the  
    track. The sound fits the band perfectly; the snapping drums, the wet  
    guitar-tone, and the doubled-up vocals inject a sense of foreboding  
    into the songs.</p><p>
<em>Ominosity</em> blends of the band's various styles: ""Food Chain"" is a melodic, new-wave dance tune 
    during the verses, with a raucous chorus of shouted backing 
    vocals and densely weaved guitars and synthesizers. The album's 
    centerpiece is ""Sun Out"", an eight-minute dirge that pounds 
    out of the speakers with thick, distorted bass and guitars and 
    haunting violin. The album's other lengthy track is 
    ""Rivers of Blood"", which clocks in at over eight minutes and spews 
    forth as much vitriol and venom as the rest of the album combined. 
    Its jerky math-core rhythm and screamed vocals lead into a lengthy, 
    echoing breakdown. The final three minutes build up instrumentally, 
    essentially rebuilding everything torn apart in the first five. </p><p>
    
    There are a few misses here too, though the biggest problem is that 
    the LP's uniformity, which makes some tracks seem less than engaging. 
    ""Deserted"", with its surf-inspired guitar strumming, tribal-esque 
    drums, and low-mixed, squeaky vocals never quite takes off. 
    Furthermore, ""Rambler"" is like a demented blues song, but the shouted 
    vocals throughout the verses just don't work with the precise 
    acoustic guitar work and the ethereal chorus. If album closer ""Hydrochondria"" was positioned earlier in the disc, it would be an odd

Mike ""Slo-Mo"" Brenner's always elegant guitar work makes it clear that the song is probably a barnstormer live, probably saved for the first encore so that the band can cut loose on its signature three-part riff. On CD, though, it sounds drained of blood: Jason Molina and co. re-create it nearly note for note, down to the end-of-song shout-out ""Draw blood!"" What's the point, then? It's certainly not Molina's earnest vocal delivery, which foregoes the original satirical edge for a dull sincerity. ""Little old lady got mutilated late last night""-- that's so sad. Plus, his howls are weak.</i></p><p>
    
    Even the Kidz Bop Kids' cover of ""Werewolves of London"" has more bite than this one, but Magnolia Electric Co.'s version is at the very least somewhat instructive: Falling beyond the band's range, the track highlights their weaknesses as surely as it reflects their strengths on this EP. The three new songs here are prime Co.-- slow, subtle, bluesy, and bleary, but also unsettled, as if they're still developing and mutating even as you listen. Produced by Paul Mahern, these songs move glacially, but with much more confident purpose than ""Werewolves"", even if their ultimate ends are unclear at their beginnings. ""Bowery"" stumbles down a dark alley, tripping on Molina's ruminative regrets: The slow beat and decorous piano comprise a ponderous rhythm section against which Molina sounds determinedly doomed. Mike Kapinus's organ thrums through ""Doing Something Wrong"" and ""31 Seasons in the Minor Leagues"", sadsack laments about agony and defeat: ""You ain't gonna win the game,"" Molina sings on the latter, ""Hell, kid, you don't even know the coach's name.""</p><p>
    
    These three songs lead us back to the title track, which kicks off the EP. The first single from this year's album <i>What Comes After the Blues, the depressive ""Hard to Love a Man"" finds Molina singing presumably about himself in second person: ""It was hard to love a man like you/good-bye was half the words you knew."" The song, like the man, retreats into itself, the elegant blending of pinprick guitars, drums, and truly alien pedal steel creating a new, closed-off world within the song. Molina's too concerned with death (which often lends easy gravity, but here resounds more strongly for being unspoken) to put across the animated ""Werewolves of London"", but he makes ""Hard to Love a Man"" sound like a cross-country funeral parade. Maybe he should have tried ""Searching for a Heart"".</i></p></div>"|5632.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5632-hard-to-love-a-man-ep/|6.7|Stephen M. Deusner

<sup>1</sup> Regarding ""private madness,"" see Pauline Kael, <i>For Keeps: 30 Years at the Movies</i>. (New York: Plume, 1996). p. 601.</p><p>
<sup>2</sup> Following the release of <i>Black Sheep Boy, Will Sheff's vocals have been labeled ""emo"" by various sources. This tag, however, seems misleading, less a stylistic description than a critical tendency to define everything by a prevailing trend. Rather, Okkervil River seems to exist between trends, sharing similarities with emo, alt-country, and Americana, among many others, but never fitting comfortably into one category.</i></p><p>
<sup>3</sup> The band's follow-up EP, <em>The Black Sheep Boy Appendix</em>, further reveals the fruitfulness of the <i>Black Sheep Boy sessions, held in a hot Texas house crowded with equipment and instruments. These seven tracks (including two short interstitials) develop ideas suggested on the album and introduce some new ones. Specifically, a new musical motif runs throughout most of the EP: a brief melody that's slightly dissonant and fragile, suggesting a precarious emotional balance. The band introduce it in the lead-off track, ""Missing Children"", whose mesmerizingly sinister tension recalls music written for villains from early Disney cartoons. They repeat that theme again in the final track, ""Last Love Song for Now"", but speed it up over the rumbling rhythms. Tied together in this way, the <em>Appendix</em> is obviously bound to the full-length album, but also separate from it, a sovereign thing unto itself. As such, it could be considered a Derridian supplement: an entity that complements, expands, and potentially supercedes a main object while remaining separate from it.</i></p><p>
<sup>4</sup> The <em>Appendix</em> develops thematically, but it does fill in some narrative holes. For instance, in ""Black Sheep Boy #4"" we learn that the title character lives in a ""battered"" Mustang and has been to Baltimore (which has its own significance within the Tim Hardin canon). As on the album, however, such concrete details are merely impressionistic, enough to lend the story verisimilitude but not enough to close off any additional meanings that could possibly be read into these songs.</p><p>
<sup>5</sup> Unfolding behind the screen of the Black Sheep Boy mythology, perhaps the EP's most vital story is that of the band completing this project and in the process exorcising those creative demons. Will Sheff sings repeatedly of destroying the mirror that reflects the Black Sheep Boy, of banishing it back to its battered Mustang. This idea, perhaps more than the abstracted ram and the Tim Hardin hagiography, lends the <em>Appendix</em> its particular gravity, as if the band has built a mythology that threatens to swallow them. This sentiment is echoed in William Schaff's cover art, which features the Black Sheep Boy driving a sword into its mirror self.</p><p>
<sup>6</sup> As on <em>Black Sheep Boy</em>, the arrangements on the <i>Appendix are well thought out, but still explosive and immediate: Beginning with a short melody from the album's song ""A Stone"", ""Black Sheep Boy #4"" builds steadily to a climax that has Sheff spewing his private madness from his gut, in a performance that mixes gospel fervor and mental breakdown.</i></p><p>
<sup>7</sup> ""No Key, No Plan"", about grifters on the run, has a rushing pace similar to these three songs, with the band-- especially keyboardist Jonathan Meiburg and drummer Travis Nelson-- churning a tumbling momentum and adding a taunting call and response in the chorus: ""You've never earned your soul,"" sing the band, like a Greek chorus (which seems fitting: <em>Black Sheep Boy</em> could also refer to the Minotaur at the center of the maze). Sheff responds simply, ""I know.""</p><p>
<sup>8</sup> The delicate melody of ""In a Radio Song"" is resurrected on the Appendix in ""Another Radio Song"" and the interstitial instrumental ""A Forest"".</p><p>
<sup>9</sup> Okkervil River choose a very different concluding tack on the <em>Appendix</em>: Instead of a big push and subsiding finale, ""Last Love Song for Now"" offsets its lyrical gravity and the fresh, raw pain in Sheff's vocals with handclaps and horn charts-- pop devices that turn in on themselves. He repeats the lyrics from ""Missing Children"", but in a different context-- not merely with a faster tempo, but also with a more foreboding gravity that has accrued meaning and significance over these seven songs. This recurrence completes a small cycle that begins with ""Missing Children"", as well as a larger cycle that encompasses the entire Black Sheep Boy project, one that laments the loss of possibilities as lambs become lost rams and children become ""numb"" adults. Okkervil River end ""Last Love Song for Now"" singing ""over and over and over and over"" until Sheff declares, ""It's over."" Whether that's the band's victory cry or an admission of defeat is undeterminable.</p></div>"|5964.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5964-the-black-sheep-boy-appendix-ep/|8.2|Stephen M. Deusner

    rock landscape. Unlike so many other branches of metal, doom has no 
    interest in speed, noodling guitar solos, or flashy shows of 
    technique. Traditionally, the songs lurch slowly and forcefully, 
    placing most of the emphasis on mood and atmosphere. 
    Unfortunately, the usual traits of the genre can be confining. The 
    fuzz-shrouded guitars, the earthquake-inducing bass, and the slow, 
    deliberate pace frequently leave little room for experimentation. 
    Bands like Candlemass, Cathedral, and Electric Wizard have spawned 
    countless imitators, but few have managed to really bring any fresh 
    ideas to the genre.</p><p>
    
    Portland, Maine's Ocean is intent on breaking that mold with their 
    sprawling debut <em>Here Where Nothing Grows</em>. The band has 
    many similarities with doom metal's hall-of-famers, but wrapped 
    in the wall of guitars and desperate, wailing vocals is something 
    more dynamic, recalling both post-rock and black metal. The songs-- there are three, stretched out to a staggering 65 minutes-- don't 
    build as much as slowly and methodically evolve. Transitions happen over the course of several 
    minutes, as the instruments ebb and flow much like the band's 
    namesake.</p><p>
    
    The tracks are primarily instrumental, but when the vocals do 
    eventually burst through the darkness, they immediately demand your 
    attention. Deep, barbaric growls echo with anguish, driving the 
    already hopeless mood even further down. But it's the sparing use of 
    the vocals that allow them to work so well. Whereas other doom metal 
    bands layer so much muck on the instruments that there's never a 
    moment of silence between the sustained feedback and booming drums, 
    Ocean knows how to use empty space to great effect. These songs are 
    bleak and barren, truly exuding impending ruin. </p><p>
    
    The first of the three tracks is ""First Reign"". Its main riff slowly 
    develops over the course of its 21 minutes, at times dropping away 
    completely. The final seven minutes of the song are like an iceberg 
    collapsing, as the melody slowly breaks down before erupting into 
    ""Salt"", the second-- and at 19 minutes, the shortest-- piece here. In 
    many ways, the song is merely a continuation of ""First Reign"", just 
    as ""The Fall"", the disc's closer, builds off of the ideas in ""Salt"". 
    Despite their common elements, though, each track has its own unique 
    moments. ""Salt"" features feedback and hollow, clean guitars that 
    lead into an almost triumphant, epic march. ""The Fall"" picks up the 
    tempo, if only briefly, and then later features eerie whispered 
    vocals. But frankly, the songs aren't supposed to be all that 
    distinct. <em>Here Where Nothing Grows</em> is meant to be once piece, 
    and it is as monolithic, challenging, and unconventional as anything 
    the metal community has seen in recent days. </p></div>"|6120.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6120-here-where-nothing-grows/|7.9|Cory D. Byrom

    31Knots's third LP, <em>Talk Like Blood</em>, has a sneaky finger of its own. You're distracted by the thumb, i.e. the fat-bottomed emo-prog hooks, the twisted metal carcasses thundering down. But it's the little things that sneak out and grab you before the next cascade of unapologetically overwrought vocals polishes you off. It's the blocks of percussive static that the guitars slither around; the malfunctioning recordings of chamber music; the channel-switching effective glissando sawing the beginning of ""Intuition Imperfected""; the highly pressurized drumming and compressed riffs wheezing to life on ""Chain Reaction"". But I'm not kidding about the dominant vocals-- Joe Haege has a huge voice and he's not afraid to let it all hang out. That's going to be a deal-breaker for some no matter how awesomely deformed yet melodic the licks are. Sometimes, like when Haege spleens ""Hell hath no fury like me!"" before the ripped throb of ""Thousand Wars"" drops in, or the spoken word rant at the beginning of the industrial music-box ""City of Dust"", it's too much.</p><p>
<em>Talk Like Blood</em> is different than what we've previously heard from 31Knots, in ways desirable and less so-- their earlier work (specifically thinking of <em>It Was High Time to Escape</em>) hugged a tight border between spacious, intricately polished guitar rock, and chorus-busting emo, but now they've pushed further in both directions. So while the musical side of <em>Talk Like Blood</em> presents a more detailed field than ever before, the vocals and some of their attendant musical dynamics are flatter. Previously those heart-tugging emo hooks were the sneaky finger and the smart, propulsive musical compositions were the thumb, and if they haven't switched places yet, they're trending that way. I'm fine with it for now, but I hope it doesn't go much further. </p></div>"|8274.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8274-talk-like-blood/|7.0|Brian Howe

So it seems an uncharacteristic misjudgment for them to headline this brief collection with their cover of Tegan and Sara's ""Walking With a Ghost"", a track that seems exactly the sort of likable but inconsequential bauble tailor-made for a B-side. Produced with an impulsive haste that is fast becoming one of the duo's hallmarks, this genial cover sounds singularly unpersuasive, a performance unlikely to challenge anyone's previously held opinions about the Stripes, Tegan and Sara, walking, or ghosts.</p><p>
    
    Although one can only speculate what exactly prompted Jack and Meg to cover ""Walking With a Ghost"", they do handle the song with a tangible affection-- despite what some Tegan and Sara connoisseurs might believe. In fact, the Stripes' version is almost reverential to fault, making it difficult to imagine a fan of the original disliking this too intensely, unless they simply object to Jack White's complexion or personal habits just on general principle. Likewise, those who find Tegan &amp; Sara's skeletal brand of winsome Canadian pop to be unbearably trite and/or mundane will presumably remain unswayed by the White Stripes' modest Detroit upgrade.</p><p>
    
    Tegan and Sara's original has a slight build even by the White Stripes' rudimentary standards, and Jack's conversion of the guitars from acoustic to electric does little to heft it up. His reedy, double-tracked vocals match Tegan and Sara's phrasing almost exactly, injecting as much spirit as possible into their blank, repetitive non-sequiters like ""I was walking with a ghost/ I said please, please don't insist."" And Meg, needless to say, sounds well within her comfort zone, managing the song's elementary rhythm with aplomb. The twosome add a brief squiggle of guitar distortion and back-masking between choruses, but for better or worse decline the opportunity to expand this noisy interjection into a full-scale deconstruction.</p><p> 
    
    The quality of the extras and B-sides accompanying the <em>Get Behind Me Satan</em> singles has run the gamut. Their stormy, Hendrixian cover of the Greenhorns' ""Shelter of My Arms"", a recent B-side to ""The Denial Twist"", deserves to be considered alongside the duo's best work, while the ""Blue Orchid"" flipside ""Who's a Big Baby?"" might arguably be the most worthless track released this year. For <em>Walking With a Ghost</em>, however, they've killed the suspense by padding the maxi-single out with four live versions of previously available album tracks. </p><p>
    
    Since the duo rarely add much in the way of polish to their studio productions, they are uniquely well-suited to the live recording format, and none of these live tracks differ drastically from their studio counterparts. The set's best track is an acoustic version of ""Same Boy You've Always Known"" recorded in Brazil that actually features a more refined vocal performance than appears on <em>White Blood Cells</em>, provided you're able to ignore the audience's slightly arrhythmic clap-along.</p><p> 
    
    Live renditions of ""As Ugly As I Seem"" and ""The Denial Twist"", both recorded for KCRW's ""Morning Becomes Eclectic"", remain faithful to the <em>Get Behind Me Satan</em> originals and will likely only appeal to the truly devoted, which could also be said for their barn-burning run-through of their debut album's ""Screwdriver"". As <em>Walking With a Ghost lacks a genuine slam-dunk A-side, most listeners might be best served to just hold off entirely for now, saving attention for the inevitable lavish collection of White Stripes B-sides and rarities that's surely bound to appear sometime within the next couple holiday seasons.</em></p></div>"|8654.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8654-walking-with-a-ghost-ep/|6.1|Matthew Murphy

I used to think the Brooklyn-to-Berlin
    group was an obnoxious snoreful, but on last year's <em>They Were Wrong,
    So We Drowned</em> the boys unveiled a stirring
    drone-o-rific direction. At the time, those expecting more of the same-old panned
    the collection, and since that time the resentment has seemingly deepened.</p><p>
    
    Ignoring these unadventurous critics, <em>It Fit When I Was a Kid</em>, a four-song EP, finds the trio of Angus
    Andrew, Aaron Hemphill, and Julian Gross trudging in a similar
    direction, perhaps with less punch in the percussion. But then, it's
    impossible to guess whether this single is indicative of the band's forthcoming
    full-length, <em>Drum's Not Dead</em>-- it just doesn't give us much to chew on.
    The EP's contents are the title track and its technocrat remix, plus two minimalist non-album pieces, and low-budget videos for the three non-remix tracks. (The 7"" contains the title
    track and its remix.)</p><p>
    
    From its timing to its packaging, the thing's an obvious stocking stuffer (check cupid-struck Santa on
    the back, crossed candy canes, sliced fruitcake) and its
    made-for-collectors censored gay-porn cover art PhotoShopped by Julian
    Gross will get more press than it deserves. Such is the general
    reaction to penises. If you want to see it uncensored, you can get a full art cover on edible paper from the band's
    website.</p><p>
    
    Musically, the lead track's a deep-space sea of vocal drone and plodding
    drums. Andrew's voice echoes, and occasionally his intonation-- ""We
    were walking in the snow/ Down the street from your front door/ I
    jumped the neighbors' fence at dawn/ Danced my way across your lawn""
    -- lands in the area of newest A.R.E. Weapons single, ""Weakest Ones"". Only, this doesn't suck. Actually, for its seeming tepidness, it's somehow addictive. The
    sound of a malleted diamond has us thinking of ""crystals flying
    everywhere."" A spooky organ introduces the song's shadowy lumen-tree
    half led by Turkish delight falsetto. It's murkily seamless and
    understated, and denser than it appears on a first or second listen: A
    Christmas carol for the restless dead?</p><p>
    
    The considerably rockier ""The Frozen Glacier Of Mastodon Blood"" lacks
    the opener's fluidity, though the Big Black-style drums are nice. ""Bingo!
    Count Draculuck"" turns up the echo for a repeated query, ""Are you all
    right?""-- its ambient drone, factory-dub percussion, and video game
    blasts are ultimately nondescript. Finally, ""It Fit When I Was a Kid (Don't
    Techno For An Answer)"" fractures the original then dumps thump-thump-thump atop, burying things in 12 inches of snow.</p><p>
    
    This nibble has me intrigued, but also kinda bored (again). I'm hoping
    Liars lodge a few more pieces like ""It Fit When I Was a Kid"" on the LP; if the
    supporting tracks are an indication, though, there's reason to nod
    off. Going with my gut, those lesser tracks ring more like filler than
    future promises, so let's keep faith and expect <em>Drum's Not Dead</em> to
    offer something sublime.</p></div>"|4766.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4766-it-fit-when-i-was-a-kid-ep/|6.0|Brandon Stosuy

    is like writing a book without the letter ""e""-- it can be done, but it's 
    difficult and time-consuming. Ernest Vincent Wright accomplished the latter 
    feat back in 1939 with his epic lipogram <em>Gadsby</em>, and it took him about five 
    months, whereas I just caved instantly to my basest critical instincts. 
    Really though, discussing music, especially instrumental music, in 
    environmental terms is a pretty good way to get a point across, so let's get 
    it on: this band's music has always conjured wide-open, arid spaces, in scorching daylight and frigid night time alike. And their 
    latest album, <em>Lost Horizon</em>, finds them still exploring familiar environs.</p><p>
    
    The album also continues another FODM album trend: 
    each is darker than the last. Various organs hum quietly in support of the 
    searching guitars of Bill Elm and Mike Semple, and brushed drum beats fall 
    like boots on hard-blown sand. Guitars have always been king amongst the 
    Friends, but the playing here is especially intense and fluid, with 
    uniformly impeccable phrasing. These guys are accomplished musicians, and 
    the music is stuffed with emotional longing and heated crescendos.</p><p>
    
    A soft, humming drone opens the album, and a stunning guitar lead drops in 
    on top of it, wandering only slightly distorted in a galaxy-sized echo 
    chamber, finally reaching its climax over a thumping, tumbling drum beat as 
    notes fall from the guitar like light from a sparkler. The band 
    picks up the pace a few tracks later on ""Heart of Darkness"" with an 
    unusually fractured drum break, topped by ferocious, almost raga-like guitar 
    and a subtly employed choir sound on either a mellotron or a 
    chamberlain. The pace doesn't stay quick for long, though-- the album is centered by two gorgeous slow tracks that give off melodies like waves of 
    heat on a horizon.</p><p>
    
    Sumptuous beauty is the main ingredient in most of the rest of the album, 
    though ""Hidden Out of Sight"" does provide one last hurrah for feedback and 
    heavy fuzz. The acoustic guitar-dominated songs that surround it play more 
    readily to the band's strengths and have a wider dynamic range, building up 
    and breaking down with natural ease. That same natural ease is a part of 
    what makes Friends of Dean Martinez so compelling-- they play sophisticated 
    music, but they let it develop organically, at whatever pace seems right. In this case, they've developed yet another excellent album of beautifully arid music.</p></div>"|3206.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3206-lost-horizon/|7.8|Joe Tangari

While it's status quo for Blockhead, the most lasting details on the album might be the most incidental ones. Over the heavy boom-bap and reverberating bass of the DJ Shadow-lite opener ""Expiration Date"", there's a sample of a male vocal who laments how commonplace heartbreak is, singing ""probably hundreds of wonderful love affairs go bad in this town every week,"" and then, almost inaudibly, ""...it's a big town.""</p><p>
    
    ""Expiration Date"" is something of a false start, and the record finds its feet on ""Roll out the Red Carpet"". Blockhead is less a hot beat factory than a subtle idea man, and the track is crammed with them: tweaked female choruses and sweeping strings cribbed from Daedelus's playbook bump against tribunal-worthy horns and fluid, shifting drums; the all-too-brief ""Serenade"" marries harp flourishes with dirty electric piano and a swaying, handclap-driven beat.</p><p> 
    
    From there, it's a long, moody plain until the stop-start drums of ""Stop Motion Traffic"", the filthy funk of ""The Art of Walking"" anchored by an excellent bass line, and the crashing hyper-compressed guitar chords of the dynamic ""Good Block Bad Block"". The pacing is an improvement from his debut, but it's rare that Blockhead pulls the trigger and builds a really quirky or unique soundscape that he's capable of, just scraping the surface on the aforementioned tracks or the junkyard jazz of ""Dough Nation"".</p><p>
    
    ""Roll Out the Red Carpet"" opens with a courting couple from an antiquated musical, planning to meet in Washington Square, and the manic comedian sampled in ""Good Block Bad Block"" could just as likely be describing hometown geography (""good block, bad block/gun block, crack block"") instead of a nod to his DJ handle, and amidst the final stunner ""Long Walk Home"", a man sings out ""I've been terribly alone/ And forgotten old Manhattan."" A unifying theme could have elevated this album above other instrumental hip-hop-- and above Blockhead's own solo work-- but he's content to use the snippets as segues, which is a shame. <em>Downtown Science</em> could have been a sleek limousine ride through Blockhead's version of New York, but we'll have to settle for an appropriately funky cab ride.</p></div>"|1105.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1105-downtown-science/|6.6|Jason Crock

    to a band you plan to see within 24 hours of their show. Van
    accidents, band dissolutions, and broken friendships, among other
    horrors, have supposedly resulted from the transgression. Yet a few
    weeks ago, on the verge of heading out to watch Growing live, I found
    myself hitting play on <i>His Return</i>, only hours before they were
    scheduled to perform. Halfway out the door, I still couldn't figure
    out what I was leaving to see.</p><p>
    
    A former power trio folded now into a patient duo, Growing practice a
    kind of mystifying self-effacement. Stacks of amplifiers and big
    guitar chords hide behind an extreme polish; songs play in a droning
    shine, with upbeat major chords wrapped around the normally
    pessimistic avant-garde of feedback meditation. In their original
    configuration, Growing more often tipped their hand: ""Cutting,
    Opening, Swimming"", from 2003's <i>The Sky's Run Into the Sea</i>,
    menaced with drawn-out threats and high volume. Though 2004
    saw them already oblique, ""Anaheim II"" (from that year's <i>The Soul
    of the Rainbow and the Harmony of Light</i>) still puts teeth on edge. <i>His Return</i>, their third and latest full length (not counting
    an ocean of tapes and archives floating around), never gets that
    direct, opting instead for a mostly impermeable and effects-laden wall
    that masks the band's intentions and displaces the amplifiers'
    murderous impulse.</p><p>
    
    The effect is of being held at arm's length. ""In the Shadow of the
    Mountain"" is a tease, a trembling line of fluted guitar and static
    drone, checking bagpipes at both ends of the spectrum; though
    it meanders, it never quite arrives. The sound is at once soothing
    and superficial. ""Freedom Towards Death"" is not so removed but it too
    dances around the point. Growing bring out a rare vocal and do it
    full-up, overdubs and everything: each phrase proceeds apace, and
    although it's catchy, there's more than a hint of metronome to the
    pace. The steady evenness reads as programmatic or mechanical as it
    does generous.</p><p>
    
    The palette over these long songs is pretty sparse, and the best part
    of <i>His Return</i> is when they embrace their own set limits and use
    the time to shove just one sound into one space. ""Wide Open"", the
    most fully realized track, is actually its nominal opposite,
    mercifully foregoing the gradual changes and shiny shallow reflection. Growing pour on one grinding chord, one melody, and with the two
    build a huge and thrilling edifice. But the overall schematics of the
    thing are defeating, and one doesn't need to love guitars or
    dissonance to wish they would stroke harder or not all.</p></div>"|3688.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3688-his-return/|6.1|Zach Baron

Whether clowning in videos, spontaneously breakdancing at awards shows, or just gazing ahead on his album covers, the junkyard boho was always looking <em>beyond</em>, seemingly into a bizarre realm unhindered by genre-- or behavioral-- expectations.  But lately, he just looks lost.  Wandering down a gimmicky path lined with empty pop-up confections in the ""Girl"" video, the 35-year-old dad with bad hair found himself relegated to the role of passerby. More than ever, 2005 saw Beck losing his edge.  So, on this take two, he embraces the talent and ideas of contemporaries and descendants alike (all of whom, I'm sure, are really, really nice), hoping for a little friendly friction.  Much like its inconsistent source material, <em>Guerolito</em> emits a few flashes but lacks the cohesiveness that was once this innovator's
    hallmark.</p><p>
    Possibly a sign of self-conscious second-guessing, Beck began to commission new mixes for <em>Guero</em> early on.  Oddly, the lo-fi blip <em>GameBoy Variations</em> EP, featuring remixes for four of the album's songs, was thrown up online a full two months before <em>Guero</em>'s official release.  Then, over the course of the year, about a half-dozen more trickled out.  Wisely, not all of these previously released alternates-- including lazy efforts from Dizzee Rascal and Röyksopp-- are included here.  All in all, nine of <em>Guerolito</em>'s 14 tracks are new, which, along with fresh artwork courtesy of surrealist <em>Guero</em> cover illustrator Marcel Dzama, and a track-for-track sequencing, indicates the intention of a true remix <em>album</em> rather than just another careless fourth-quarter hodge-podge ch-ching.  While such efforts are duly noted, the bare-bones liners and widely varying quality of these retries make <em>Guerolito</em> better suited for iTunes cherry-picking than full-on Amazon consumption.</p><p>
    Several tracks equal or trump their initial incarnations by emphasizing pluses and playing into their remixers' entrenched strengths. Both Boards of Canada and Air are wonderfully type-cast;
    the former's take on ""Broken Drum"" highlights Beck's <em>Sea Change</em>-y lonesome vocals with apropos amble ambience while the latter's ""Missing"" redux, ""Heaven Hammer"", boosts sexy-church synths, echoing drums, and everything else you'd expect from France's finest purveyors of cheesy-cool.  The new ""Scarecrow"", courtesy of El-P, is a marked improvement on its predecessor, with
    the hip-hop producer's succinct drums and keyboard stabs giving the song a newfound strut.  Meanwhile, golden boy Diplo reiterates his current crate-king status by slowing down the staccato bass backbone of the English Beat's ""Twist and Crawl"" to provide his ""Go It Alone"" redo with a stealth funk.</p><p>
    Alas, many other attempts fall flat due to weak, repetitive arrangements, or an inability to convincingly congeal with their forebears.  The worst offender is nerd rap group Subtle, whose lumbering ""Farewell Ride"" won't entice anybody to grab onto the Anticon trolley anytime soon.  (I hope.)  Two ex-Unicorn projects are represented, and neither clicks, though for different reasons; Islands' Uni-lite twee instrumentation sounds woefully out of place when meshed with Beck's East L.A. non-sequiturs on ""Que Onda Guero"" (not to mention the ill-fated, half-assed screwed 'n' chopped bit), while Th' Corn Gangg's electro R2-D2 spin on ""Emergency Exit"" takes too long to climax with its dense thump and cut-up vox. And just when you thought the Beasties couldn't get more annoying, Adrock comes along with his throwback minimalist-clang take on ""Black Tambourine"" featuring enough repeating ""ugh!"" and ""what!"" drops to make you want to steamroll your copy of <em>Check Your Head</em>.</p><p>
    His fierce glint fading, it's becoming increasingly clear that Beck is no longer able to freely revel in the youthful dalliances that made him famous more than a decade ago. <em>Guerlito</em>'s standouts prove that proper taste and a good ear can be just as valuable as songwriting to a multi-tasker like Beck, but even for an artist this venerable, a remix record is still a remix record-- generally uneven, part enlightening, and part skippable.</p></div>"|622.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/622-guerolito/|6.2|Ryan Dombal

Xiu Xiu's music is not intended for open, sunny spaces; it's like a vampire in a tanning salon. Then again, Jamie Stewart isn't the sallow-cheeked ghoul you might imagine him to be based on his relentlessly in-bent, harrowingly sad songs-- he's clean-cut, handsome, pretty buff. The disconnect between his robust frame and sickly music mirrors the tension in the songs themselves, between quivering ephemera and hulking clangor. What really came clear at Intonation, watching Stewart and Caralee McElroy inflict violence on the air, was that Xiu Xiu's music is a music of intrusions. As Stewart quietly gasped over sonorous mandolin lines, McElroy introduced discord in the form of crashing gamelans and broken-glass synths, chaotic interruptions that seemed to come from outside of the music, to assault it.</p><p>
<em>Life and Live</em>, a collection of 15 solo, often acoustic performances culled from a tour with Devendra Banhart, gives us a different Xiu Xiu, one that must rely entirely on Stewart's voice and guitar without McElroy around to drop heavy ordnance on the periphery. As such, the album shrinks to a white-hot pinpoint, radiating out with grim placidity from that raw place from which Stewart projects his demons. The songs, drawing most heavily from Xiu Xiu's pre-<em>Fabulous Muscles</em> albums, are spare to the point of obliteration, unfolding in glittering dreamtime. They build themselves slowly, one piece at a time-- a splintered chord coalesces and diffuses like smoke; a richly emotive syllable or injured yelp hangs suspended in the thick silence in its wake-- draped loosely on rickety frames. The instances of dissonance emerge from within the songs, not from without, sealing off and pressurizing them.</p><p> 
    
    If Xiu Xiu's songs usually evince a struggle between penetrating quietude and untamed energy, on <em>Life and Live</em> Stewart proves that he's equally adept at each. The two versions of ""I Broke Up"" cleave it along that axis; the first is a prayerful acoustic ballad, the second a plugged-in tantrum that boils up over the rim in its stormy middle section. Less revealing are the two versions of ""20,000 Deaths for Eidelyn Gonzales, 20,000 Deaths for Jamie Peterson"", which are too similarly performed to really justify the inclusion of both. The ripped, hollow chords of ""Jennifer Lopez"" and the gibbering exclamations of ""Sad Pony Guerilla Girl"" strike jarring contrasts to the inexorable pull of Smiths cover ""Asleep"" and the creeping ""Helsabot"", but such outbursts are rare enough to preserve the record's hypnotic intimacy. <em>Life and Live</em> proves that while the superficial difficulty of Xiu Xiu's music might be tacked on, its essential intensity comes from Stewart himself. Here, he's at his most hermetic and obscure, a long intake of breath that pulls in and in but never exhales. </p></div>"|8829.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8829-life-and-live/|7.7|Brian Howe

Passed down by oral tradition, these polyphonic songs were meant to be sung a cappella by choirs, and were written using a unique four shape-note notation. This simplified manner of notation was created to encourage active participation, emphasizing an inclusive sense of community over performance. For their fifth album <em>Flags of the Sacred Harp</em>, the Portland-based collective Jackie-O Motherfucker use the lessons of <em>The Sacred Harp</em> and other traditional blues and gospel sources as a point of disembarkation. On these seven tracks, the group patiently unravel their source material's tangled threads, respooling them into wondrously evocative yet deeply personalized new devotionals.</p><p> 
    
    Over the course of their now decade-plus career, J-OMF have often incorporated American folkloric material into their free-form experiments, most memorably on 2000's <em>Fig. 5</em>, which included reconfigured versions of the traditional hymns ""Go Down, Old Hannah"" and ""Amazing Grace"". On <em>Flags of the Sacred Harp, however, the group has more fully internalized and distilled the grammar of its blues and gospel influences, so that throughout the album identifiable scraps of melody or lyrics continually surface then re-submerge into the music's bubbling depths. And though the album was over a year in the making, there is nothing labored in the group's delivery. Each of these extended, luminous pieces issues forth with an unhurried grace as though simply tapped from an already existent wellspring.</em></p><p>
    
    Throughout the group's lifespan, Jackie-O Motherfucker has undergone several personnel shifts, and is here pared to a quartet that includes founder Tom Greenwood, Nudge vocalist Honey Owens, and guitarist Adam Forkner, who has also played with Yume Bitsu and Devendra Banhart. But as with traditional Sacred Harp singing, the emphasis here is on group interplay and exploration rather than individual voices. Gentle opener ""Nice One"", though not a cappella, commences with Greenwood and Owens locked in a mesmeric vocal roundelay, before radiant amp feedback and cymbal swirls gradually permit the song's structure to loosen particle by particle. In contrast, the following ""Rockaway"" is as straightforward a country blues as the group have ever cut, with lyrics (""tombstone is my pillow/ graveyard's gonna be my bed"") that allude to Blind Willie McTell's ""Death Room Blues"", among other folk blues classics. ""Hey Mr. Sky"" does the same for Charley Patton's ""Pony Blues"", although the words are carried heavenward by a full armload of rippling acid guitar.</p><p> 
    
    Standing center is the 16-minute sculpted drone of ""Spirits"", a steadily ascendant instrumental excursion that contains the album's least overt traditional references, conducting its worship instead through cryptic ceremony and unmoored electricity. As the album progresses, however, the skies grow increasingly darker, with tracks like ""Good Morning Kaptain"" and ""The Louder Roared The Sea"" recasting the language of the hymnal to express a vague, encroaching dread rather than faith. Yet still the group's music-- a mass of splintered guitar, percussion, harmonica, and indistinct voices-- remains faithfully reliant on congregational unity, and as result Flags of the Sacred Harp stands as Jackie-O Motherfucker's most potent and focused liturgy to date.</p></div>"|4191.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4191-flags-of-the-sacred-harp/|8.1|Matthew Murphy

    The subarctic north imposes with its icy grandeur; near Stockholm a
    national park sprawls over 300-year-old virgin forest. The south is
    typically temperate. So too
    Amandine's spacious folk-pop, which like its place of origin is
    probably slightly bigger than California-- and provides a higher
    standard of living than good ol' Bushworld by most measures.</p><p>
    On <em>This Is Where Our Hearts Collide</em>, Amandine
    roam across a vast and chilly plain, tumbling guitars and graceful
    bearing aligning them with the windswept Americana of Sun Kil Moon,
    Songs:Ohia, or pre-<em>Z</em> My Morning Jacket. The arrangements are
    spare yet sky-wide, occasionally visited by banjos, accordions,
    glockenspiels, and theremin. ""Stitches"" emerges from the previous
    track's halting piano to survey the tundra with crunching Neil Young
    licks and mournful, distant trumpet. Yet singer Olof Gidlöf's
    trembling whisper and easy sense of pop melody evoke a comfortable,
    hypothetical Sam Beam-Ben Gibbard collab. Gentle love song ""Easy Prey""
    traces an elegant extended metaphor over a twirling arpeggio, Gidlöf
    sighing, ""With your paws upon my chest/ I'll be calm."" Boundless
    horizons meet the intimate under uneasy harmonies.</p><p>
    Meanwhile, even the most cinematic ballads smolder with weary sadness.
    The album title suggests emo, but the heartbreak is more
    permanent, without that genre's too-common petulance. ""How much can
    you ask for before I start letting you down,"" goes the warm, stately
    chorus of ""Fine Lines"". After a lazy banjo intro, Gidlöf continues an
    unbearably lonely conversation -- ""And we fell apart/ Like fathers and
    sons"" -- on ""Fathers &amp; Sons"". ""Firefly"" opens with a buzzing acoustic
    guitar rhythm out of Radiohead's ""Exit Music (for a Film)"" and plays
    the weeping-violins card nicely, aided by intertwined falsetto vocals
    and left-behind drums. ""If it stings, it stings because it's true,""
    Gidlöf sings.</p><p>
    All in all, it's possibly what you'd hope for from a group of Swedes
    who originally called themselves Wichita Linemen, but more than you
    could expect. Don't know much else about Sweden, but <em>This Is Where Our Hearts Collide</em> is really
    about the complicated geography of hope and sorrow. Not a neutral
    country, exactly, but a worthy escape.</p></div>"|493.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/493-this-is-where-our-hearts-collide/|7.6|Marc Hogan

    filled with self-abuse and mayhem. Shows by his former band, Meat,  
    were as much performance art as rock concerts, as this modern day GG Allin would do everything from carving his flesh with razor blades to drinking  
    his own urine. It's this same sort of disregard for wholesome  
    entertainment that fuels the music on <em>This Is Stunt Rock Volume  
    Three</em>, his latest album under the Stunt Rock moniker. Layers of  
    samples from every imaginable musical genre, programmed beats, and  
    snippets from movies and television create a mish-mash of electronic  
    party music that's just as likely to make you laugh as dance.</p><p>
    
    The 16 seamless songs are essentially without titles. The accompanying  
    booklet refers to each as simply ""Audio Selection Number One"" through  
    ""Audio Selection Number Sixteen"", and a table of contents lists the  
    page for the lyrics for each selection. As a de facto title, each song has a  
    quote assigned to it that offers insight into the track itself,  
    Flagel's opinion of the music he's created, or a simple blast of self  
    deprecation. A sample, from what we'll refer to as ""Audio Selection Number Five"", reads, ""I  
    will make up for a lifetime of fucking chicks poorly by having the  
    most diverse CD collection in the world."" The center of the booklet  
    features 12 ""Life Achievement Badges"", each with a description.  
    The badges cover things like mortgage, female shapes, smoking, and  
    masturbation. If all of this sounds a little pretentious, it is, but  
    Flagel makes it clear that little of what is contained on this record  
    is meant to be taken seriously.</p><p>
    
    The very fact that a lyric sheet is included is impressive, since all  
    of the lyrics are samples. The subject matter is often aimed at  
    mankind's futility and weakness, whether mocking those who feign  
    revolutionary while seeming to live solely for the purpose of  
    consuming (""Audio Selection Number Four""), or painting a portrait of  
    teenage rage-filled apathy (""Audio Selection Number Five""). In  
    addition, there are enough bawdy one-liners here to make Sarah Silverman blush. The disc's various rants come from a wide variety of speakers, including Axl Rose, Bruce  
    McCulloch, and Anton Newcombe, among others, but as with many sample-based, mash-up discs, part of the fun is trying to identify the source material. </p><p>
    
    The music samples are just as varied. Bizarre showtunes sidle up  
    next to funky bass lines; heavy-metal guitars blast behind horns and  
    chopped up dance beats. The sources range from Public Enemy to the  
    Dead Milkmen, and there's plenty of soft rock, 1980s metal, and old- 
    school soul thrown in for good measure. The final product is a  
    dizzying dance record where Stunt Rock places an equal emphasis on  
    both the stunt and the rock, never pushing either over the limit. </p></div>"|7837.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7837-this-is-stunt-rock-volume-three/|6.5|Cory D. Byrom

Of course, the forces that compel him to pen new material daily haven't abated, and he continues to insist on releasing virtually all of this music in a steady, intractable flow.  Since disbanding Guided by Voices <i>almost</i> a year ago, Pollard has already released two EPs under his own name-- and that's disregarding the side projects, compilations, and, oh right, an album composed entirely of stage banter.

<p><i>Bubble</i> is, surprisingly, the more fully produced and cohesive piece, a collaboration between Pollard and multi-instrumentalist/recent production foil Todd Tobias. ""All Men Are Freezing"" is a rousing midtempo rocker with romantic lyrics that are surprisingly-- if blandly-- straightforward for Pollard, alternating ""miss you"" and ""kiss you"" in several lines. ""747 Ego"" is a chunk of lumbering, beer-stained bloat-rock that's old hat to Pollard by now, and familiar to anyone who's followed late-era GbV (and lucky us, the final track is a reprise). ""Boring About"" and ""Search-Light Pickups"" are brightly recorded but unmemorable instrumentals given thrust by acoustic guitar.

When casual fans shout down Pollard's quality control issues, <i>Bubble</i> is the kind of record they're talking about.</p>
<p><i>Zoom exudes more creativity and homespun charm.  By all appearances, it epitomizes the cast-off, with simple, traditional compositions, and hiss-drowned taped dialogue filling out the corners.  But opener ""Dr. Fuji and Henry Charleston (Zoom Variation)"" is a quaint guitar duet between Pollard and late-era axeman Doug Gillard that's unprecedented in Bob's catalog, and the title track's rosy-cheeked melody and skip-along drum machine rhythm are charming elements of an unusually demure Pollard track.  Even the raw ""Catherine from Mid-October"" sparkles, a gorgeous acoustic demo waiting to be fleshed out.

The Hitsville, USA product evaluation committee is in session, and if you've shown up late, tough luck. Wait until next Friday. During the meeting, Motown employees from both the creative and business sides frankly evaluate everything demoed during the week and either approve it for release or send
    it back. Motown in 1963 was firing on all cylinders-- the business ran smoothly and the music was hot. By the end of the year, Gordy's operation sent 10 songs into the pop top ten and had laid the groundwork for 1964, the year the Motor City went supernova.</p><p>
    
    1963 was the year of Martin Luther King's ""I Have a Dream"" speech (released on a Motown LP), and the Great March on Washington in August brought the Civil Rights movement to one of its greatest crescendos. The year also saw the graduation of James Meredith, the first black man to attend the University of Mississippi, the horrific bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama, and the assassination of John F. Kennedy, all against the backdrop of escalation in Vietnam. Despite the chaotic environment, the music on the third volume of Hip-O Select's ongoing <em>Complete Motown Singles</em> collection is absurdly consistent.</p><p>
    
    Hitsville's A &amp; B sides from that year fill five CDs, and judging from the whole, most of those Friday morning meetings must have been full of good cheer.  Among the year's great milestones was the formation of the mighty writing/production team of Holland/Dozier/Holland, whose guidance resulted in the development of that signature Motown stomp that would reap such great creative (and financial) rewards.  In fact, over the course of this set, you can hear the percussive accents slowly moving from just the second and fourth beats to <i>all</i> four beats.  While Eddie Holland remained a mystifyingly slept-on performer in his own right (check the amazing Northern Soul classic ""Leaving Here""), his real legacy lay in his collaborations with Lamont Dozier and brother Brian-- and one listen to Martha &amp; the Vandellas' massive smash ""Heat Wave"" shoves their collective genius straight up your face.  Yet, it was on an earlier Vandellas track, ""Come and Get These Memories"", that the trio truly established their widescreen vision, transforming a clever post-break-up lyric into an exhilarating wall of sound.</p><p>
    
    Also coming up in 1963 was ""Little"" Stevie Wonder, who became the first Motown artist to simultaneously top the album and single charts-- and this at the age of 12.  Ever conscious of how his output was performing in the marketplace, Gordy took note that several radio DJs across the country had latched on to the B-side of Wonder's ""Fingertips"" single, a live recording that actually featured a prominent mistake.  When that recording was made, Wonder had yet to have a hit, but he performed with a manic energy befitting his age, and after extending a monster take on ""Fingertips"" at a Motown revue, he snuck back on stage for an encore, much to the crowd's delight. The next band was setting up, and bassist Joe Swift can clearly be heard shouting ""What key?""  Sensing that audiences were latching on to the spontaneity, Gordy astutely reissued the recording with the sides reversed and Swift's panicked query mixed as high as he could get it. It landed four-square atop the chart, dragging the accompanying album right along with it.</p><p>
    
    The ""Fingertips"" scenario is emblematic of how efficient Motown had become at managing distribution and taking advantage of regional success.  What still wasn't paying off, though, were the label's offshoots: Gordy believed diversification was a good way of hedging financial bets, and as on this series' previous two volumes, a few head-scratching experiments rear up.  His love of jazz stretched back more than a decade-- he even had a failed record shop devoted to it-- so his establishment of the Workshop Jazz imprint makes a certain amount of artistic sense.  The label only functioned during 1963, serving largely as an outlet for assorted Funk Brothers to stretch out, but the music was probably too conservative to leave much of a mark on a jazz world already split wide open by <em>Sketches of Spain</em> and <i>Free Jazz</i>.  Gordy's Divinity imprint also kept an iron in the gospel fire, though as his operation began colonizing the pop charts, the small niche market wouldn't have a place at Hitsville for long.  And then there's the handful of strange, old-timey country releases from the Mel-o-dy label.  A few of them are actually pretty good, but where they fit in the overall Motown story is anyone's guess.  Not that any of these excursions held Gordy back: By the end of the year, he'd purchased several houses in his neighborhood and a downtown ballroom, creating a genuine Hitsville within Detroit.  The label arranged international distribution via EMI, and sure enough, the Beatles' early LPs contained Motown covers.</p><p>
    
    Other pieces were moving into place, too.  Artist development and quality control were firmly established, the Four Tops had been signed, Holland/Dozier/Holland landed the Supremes in the top 40 with the brilliant ""When the Lovelight Starts Shining Through His Eyes"", Earl Van Dyke took the helm of the Funk Brothers and made them even tighter, and the Temptations-- still toiling in obscurity-- added David Ruffin, completing what would become their classic line-up.  By this point, Gordy had stepped back from the creative process to take a more administrative and directive role, but he returned to songwriting in late November to write ""May What He Lived for Live"", a heartfelt tribute to the fallen president he had so loyally supported. Sung with operatic fervor by Liz Lands, it's a stirring if atypical homage.  One gets the sense that the end of 1963 was a somber time for Berry Gordy, but 1964 held unimaginable things in store.</p></div>"|2066.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2066-the-complete-motown-singles-vol-3-1963/|9.2|Joe Tangari

Is it when you chew it? When you swallow it? 
    Is it later, as it's broken up by your body's digestive system? It's an 
    interesting question, one that probably has no answer, or perhaps has 
    several that are equally correct. It came to mind as I listened to ""I'm Not 
    Dreaming, King"" from Japanese electronic experimentalist Tujiko Noriko's 
    <em>Blurred in My Mirror</em>.</p><p>
    The track is the sound of a conventional song being eaten by electronic 
    noise, swallowed and broken up into proteins and enzymes. Noriko's frail 
    voice sings a wandering melody as guitar, saxophone, and drums kick up dusty 
    texture below her, threatening to congeal into rhythm and metered chord 
    changes, but never quite doing it. Australian Lawrence English's electronics 
    coat the whole thing in a patina of slow breakdown, piercing with 
    high-pitched whines and ultimately gobbling up the song's conclusion. It 
    poses the question: When does a song stop being a song and start being 
    something else, say, a noise sculpture?</p><p>
<em>Blurred in My Mirror</em> is Noriko's sixth album, and it spends a lot of time in 
    this gray territory, pop enough that it's emotionally resonant and musically 
    memorable, but avant garde enough that it challenges your musical 
    expectations and refuses to take easy paths. ""Tennisplayer Makes a 
    Smile"" stretches pop ingredients even further than ""I'm Not Dreaming, King"", 
    pulling Noriko's sung Japanese phrases like taffy into long, amorphous 
    suggestions of melody as acoustic guitar plucks along unmolested by 
    processing or glitch. Meanwhile, muffled drums lurk just on the edges, kept 
    buried but threatening by English's electronic manipulations.</p><p>
    Noriko speaks in English on opener ""Niagara Hospital"" before switching 
    to Japanese, and her measured, almost casual manner of describing simple 
    happiness when her boyfriend visits her at the hospital is disarming. A 
    deep, squelching beat suffused with vibes and marimba stutters behind her, 
    balancing the simple innocence of her words with skin-prickling menace. The 
    payoff lyrically comes with surreal images of a dancing doctor and her 
    suspicions that she is losing her memory. ""Tablet for Memory"" and ""Shayou 
    (Setting Sun)"" are the most overtly song-oriented pieces on the record, with 
    the former essentially an electronically generated slice of psychedelia. 
    ""Shayou"" rides a complex beat riddled with sub-bass sine waves and clipped 
    percussion, while Noriko doubles up her vocals on dramatic melodic phrases, 
    suggesting a sort of alternate-universe Björk.</p><p>
<em>Blurred in My Mirror</em> is an intriguing record that, while clearly not aiming 
    to be pop, or even especially accessible, nonetheless possesses a few truly 
    transcendent moments. More than simply exploration or experimentation, the

Copping good ""dome"" his club night <em>ne plus ultra</em>, Santana's fledgling audacity shone clear: ""I'm 18 and live a crazy life"" hardly prohibited ""Get in the car/ Don't touch nothin', sit in the car.""</p><p>
    I guess you could say he's grown: <em>What the Game's Been Missing!</em> woos dope boys, not fastidious females. Ask Young Jeezy, such is the fashion. Santana talks coke with a sentimental drift. On ""Rumble Young Man Rumble"", it's toast-worthy (""To the good days, to the bad days/ To the good yay', to the bad yay'""); on ""Oh Yes"", lamentable (""I'm back/ I'm crack/ Sorry 'bout that""). Nowhere on this trap-happy album is Santana's pocket full of stones more pivotal than in ""Lil' Boy Fresh"", which details a S\xFBze-esque set-up (""You should've seen the look on Jose's face""), nowhere soupier than in the otherwise squeaky-clean ""Good Times"": ""Those were the good ol' days/ Every hustler had good cocaine.""</p><p>
    Jeezy invokes community in his pusher raps-- no matter how hard, a hustler is never above helping his hood. But Santana is so heels-over-head smitten with his product, one wonders if people even factor on his radar. He embodies coke: A daisychain of wildly entertaining summer mixtapes wore the rapper's audacious moniker, Human Crack in the Flesh. The series yielded a number of underground hits, including ""Mic Check"" and ""There It Go (The Whistle Song)"".</p><p>
    Both here and on his mixtapes, Santana delivers simple phrases with enough oomph to break a dinosaur rib cage. He's a master minimalist who can take a single word and make a song of it. Few MCs say more with so little, and Santana compensates for what he lacks of Cam's 3D-goggled imagism or Jeezy's raze-the-block charisma with a knotty, nunchucking delivery style that's half flow, half helicopter.</p><p>
    Santana's staccato spit makes ideal rhythm-play. Beats aren't foundations but running ropes, designed to test agility. On ""Oh Yes"" he jukes the Marvelettes' ""Please Mr. Postman"", recalling a young Cam's snappy ""Oh Boy"". Although he was weaned on the Dipset aesthetic, which favors cutting strings and tamped-down drums, Santana excels at navigating the vacuous spaces in starkly unadorned beats. Time and time again, he fashions a soft spot in inflexible bedrock. On ""Clockwork"" he creeps over hollowed-out string trill and noisome synth fuzz, working the titular metaphor into pretty much every line. Lyrically staid next to Cam's fantastical scrolls, Juelz dazzles by dint of sound. He rhymes words with themselves (""Whatever U Wanna Call It"" simply keeps ""business, business/ pleasure, pleasure,"" and never mixes the two, ""ever, ever""), beats cadences to a pulp like the Ying Yang Twins' favorite topic, and truncates lines as if he's ducking the oncoming kicks.</p><p>
    When Sensitive Juelz proclaims his shit ""the realest I ever wrote"" on token lament-to-self ""This Is Me"", you'll sashay next door to ""Make It Work For You""'s crumbling corner real estate, much truer; when Hell Rell grumbles over roto-toms and drear piano twinkle on ""Whatever U Wanna Call It"", you'll commend Santana for flying solo on heat like ""Gangsta Shit"" (""Hi, my name is / Deeeeez nuts!""). But the holes are more Alpine Lace than Emmentaler. Barely 21, Santana might as well have his head in the font, and he conserves words as if poised for a long race.</p></div>"|7713.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7713-what-the-games-been-missing/|6.9|Sam Ubl

Sure, immaculately sly Art Brut scene-skewering would be unreasonable, but these guys can't possibly believe, as their debut suggests, that ""love is here."" The other day on the subway some snot-nosed preschooler gave me the finger, for crying out loud! But hey, Starsailor were in their early 20s when they thanked goodness for the good souls. Four years and two albums later, the more world-weary quartet now shares an ethos only Staind could possibly articulate: they're <em>On the Outside</em>. Like every jerk who reads an Orwell or Rand novel and walks around a few days with a chip on his/her shoulder, Starsailor play the self-righteous yet simplistic social critic.</p><p>
    
    Beck and Elliott Smith producer Rob Schnapf is behind the boards on this one, and it's likely his easiest gig yet. Starsailor shies away from riffs, tempo changes and even syncopation, leaving Schnapf to whittle each song into a ""Speed of Sound"" offshoot. Such bland instrumentation only places frontman James Walsh higher on his pedestal, and unfortunately, he's ready to give everyone a 40-minute piece of his mind. Opener ""In the Crossfire"" wrestles with the age-old issue of dealing with fame, though Walsh conjures up more images of the Milton Bradley board game commercials than the ""crossfire"" between his private life and fame. Walsh's solution to this problem? Try the faith, hope and love on the track ""Faith Hope Love"". Walsh opines about ""this modern world,"" offering the three title tenets as panaceas. Problem is, if the ""plastic society"" in ""Get Out While You Can"" irks Walsh so deeply, why does his band constantly cash in on its Coldplay likeness and leather-jacket, mop-top boy image?</p><p>
    
    Of course, when the highfalutin ideology falters, Walsh always has his big guns--love and oddly optimistic heartbreak. ""This Time"" is vintage Chris Martin down to the fey piano lines and lithe verse/sweeping chorus dynamic, and on ""Keep Us Together"", Walsh manages to both snipe at Americana <i>and butter up his honey: ""Folks in California can't live without their son/ They've actor politicians to infiltrate their young...The bitter the taste when they don't deliver/ Will keep us together."" You don't need Dr. Phil to point out the crazy in that relationship, and it's the grave, misplaced emotions like these that ultimately sink an otherwise innocuous band.</i></p></div>"|7481.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7481-on-the-outside/|4.7|Adam Moerder

As a result, each new album in their seemingly constant parade of fried psych/folk/jazz     possesses a relaxed air. That unhurried vibe is one of the NYC/Tennessee     troupe's strong points; though, on the downside, keeping up with their numerous records can be a     son of a bitch.</p>
<p>Outside of James Toth's excellent Wooden Wand solo album, <i>Harem of the     Sundrum &amp; the Witness Figg</i>, the most recent suite includes <i>Buck Dharma</i>,     released as a limited-edition double LP on Time Lag and CD on 5RC;     <i>XIAO</i>, a sold-out double De Stijl LP reissued by Troubleman Unlimited;     and <i>The Flood</i>, which arrived up in your local record store     last month. Corralling these three releases is hardly definitive--     readers should keep ears to the ground a little longer for the jazzed     <i>Gipsy Freedom</i>, due on 5RC early next year, and a planned     double CD-- one instrumental/one vocal, to be played together as     stereo overlap. All said, seems they have Sebadoh-itus.</p>
<p>In general, the band tends to do a few different song formations:     longish group sing-alongs/chant-alongs with apocalyptic themes and     performed with noise squiggles going on behind 'em; burnt folk     darkness via Wooden Wand, who sings like Roky Erickson; airy     excursions fronted by Satyn Sai, who sings like a 1960s chanteuse; and     noisier rambles. WWVV never lock into as aggro rides as No-Neck     or Sunburned-- there's something spacier and more fragile going in     their ruckus.</p>
<p>Each album has its strengths, but <i>Buck Dharma</i>'s the better of the older     collections. For the opener, the guitar and noise hum of ""Hideous Whisker     &amp; His Woman"" feels like a dragonfly darning guitar licks in a Motel 6. Toth baptizes himself with a vat of echo punch for ""Rot On"", laying     down Loren Connors flamenco dub. It's always the band's strongest     angle when he channels an echoplex preacher. Satya Sai takes the vocal lead on ""Risen From the     Ashes""-- guitars pitch ragged Wayne Rogers-like psych blood at her     airy delivery. ""Satya Sai     Scupetty Plays 'Reverse Jam Band'"" is, more or less, as the title     says, with Sai jamming for over 10 minutes to ambling, rusted root     backwardness. The guitarist's start turn is ""Steven the Harvester     Presides O'er the Din of the Cups"", a mess of flickered drone     dream over drum soloing. There's plenty of good stuff across the nine     tracks, but the best is the finale, ""Wicked World""-- think of an     11-minute Woven Hand damnation call around a U.S. Saucer campfire.      The liner notes (as incantation) come courtesy of Byron Coley. Pete     Nolan of Magik Markers guests.</p>
<p>Accompanied by extensive Thurston Moore-penned road-trippin' liner     notes and more peyote than the acid-hinged <i>Buck Dharma</i>, <i>XIAO</i> crunks     like Castanets on no-doze. The songwriting and/or improvising seems     more tentative or redundant, as if the posse's not quite sure where     they're going. Still, the crew does eventually make it to the silty     baptismal font of the Mississippi. Oddly, you can occasionally pick     bits of Smog from the pacing of ""Paper Trail Blues""'s     junk-n-bowed percussion and camel-through-a-pinhole Bible story. Satya Sai is a     female John the Baptist or some other desert rattlesnake charmer on     ""Caribou Christ in the Great Void"". The centerpiece is the     Native American ""Weird Wisteria Tangles Carrion Christ But Intends No     Harm"" has me thinking of Angus MacLise jangling into an outdoor love     song. There's a scrappy belly-of-the-whale feel to the     Jonah-seafaring-jam ""Lions In Love""-- not too many joyful sounds on     this one, though it does get a bit rockin' at the end. ""Return of the     Nose"" has Toth's voice upfront, backed by a lovely ""all roads lead to     him"" church choir.</p>
<p>I've had <i>Buck Dharma</i> and <i>XIAO</i> for ages and both took a little time to     really sink in, but <i>The Flood</i>'s apocalyptic drone hit me from     the first listen. It's a fresh set of detuned atmospheric blues     dedicated to sax player Charles Gayle and Death Vessel. From the opening strums of ""Snake Earl"", <i>The Flood</i> feels more assured.     Of the six songs, three are more than 10 minutes long, and all are well     done. The hypnotic 14-minute     title track is a Noah-focused group chant-- the noise waves increase as     the song gurgles onward. The guitar piece, ""(I Wanna Live In) Sunbeam     Creek"", is perhaps the most unadorned and sprightly beautiful WWVV     track so far. I could imagine Cardinal using it as a bridge between     two hooks. Dropping ""American Pie""'s Chevy and levee, the reverbed,     howling strummer, ""Dogpaddlin' Home to Live With My Lord"" is as good     and lovey-dove countrified as anything from <i>Harem of the Sundrum</i>. Turning the Zombies into an autobiographical sketch,     ""Imeltime of the Season (Interlude)"" is a spiraled guitar and     woodblock backed by Toth waving goodbye. The finale is close to 15     minutes of the standard Satya Sai piece, this one called ""Satya Sai     Sweetback Plays Oxblood Boots"": more blocky percussion (this time in     more of a loping loop), laser gun, echoing vocals chopped between     speakers, guitar hum, some of that Gayle stuff, flood themes, etc.</p>
<p>On Halloween, two weeks before I'd heard <i>The Flood</i>, I ran into     Vanishing Voice members Glucas Crane and Steven the Harvester sitting     on a bench between some of the only pine trees on Bedford Avenue. It     made sense to see that they'd cozied themselves within a     personal urban pine forest to watch paired kids parade past in colorful and     spooky garb.

It     made sense to see that they'd cozied themselves within a     personal urban pine forest to watch paired kids parade past in colorful and     spooky garb. Now, post-flood, it gives chills-- like it was some kind of Noah's Ark trial run.</p></div>"|11867.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11867-xiao-buck-dharma-the-flood/|8.2|Brandon Stosuy

    spritely guitar-pop mini-album called <i>Night Piece</i>, got shot back 
    to me. A Tokyo twentysomething whisking through his own soundscapes, 
    losing himself in the cinema, shooting guns at wild west bad guys, 
    battle rapping-- apparently it wasn't criticism. Fair enough, but as I 
    work through this follow-up jam <i>L.S.T.</i>, what jumps out most is 
    how un-evocative it is by comparison. Shugo's really pulled back. In 
    just a half-hour, <i>Night Piece</i> covered impossible ground 
    stylistically, flirted with genre pastiche but still came unassuming. It was clever, making something cohesive of all that j-pop video game and film scoring and straight-up, unequivocal pop 
    stuff-- maybe not as lovable immediately, but certainly more memorable. 
    <i>L.S.T.</i> has one-speed-- Raffi Plays the Shins-- and while Shugo's 
    clearly settling into being ""one of those guys who just writes good 
    songs, man,"" he's also not come up with anything special here, or 
    memorable, or anything more than pleasant.</p><p>
    
    Still, as far as inoffensive acoustic guitar pop goes, this ain't bad. 
    Give Shugo a chance to snap ""Mist"" out its woozy lullablahs; his sudden, 
    close-mic'd guitar strums grit forcefully like the opening moments of 
    Microphones' <i>It Was Hot</i>. The whistling on ""Mushina"" beats Andrew 
    Bird's for most dulcimer, and ""Vista"" has something of a less-collective 
    Broken Social Scene sound to it, with heavy reverb, disembodied vocals, and 
    big dumb horn melodies. The first 100 seconds or so of ""Yukinohaka"" 
    promise to sour <i>L.S.T.</i>'s unfazable grin, something along the 
    lines of Ben Chasny's rolling drone figures, but then Shugo starts 
    singing. And oh that voice-- it's as if nothing could possibly go wrong 
    when that unintelligible full-bodied whisper of his courses these 
    headphones. This time Shugo's pushed it into the instrument mix further, 
    sometimes even pitting it against the intermittent noisemaking that 
    normally stays beneath the guitar lines.</p><p>
    
    But then I hear something like ""Karte"". It's by far the least pleasant 
    song here-- super-cartoonish silent movie chase music, no vocal melody 
    to rally behind, occasionally showy guitar-playing, some weird squeaky 
    wheel sound I can imagine is torture for some. To be honest I hated it 
    at first, because the short, nimble track has more energy than the rest 
    of the album combined, more smarts too-- the only track Shugo didn't dumb 
    himself down for. It doesn't go down easy, and some spots do prick at 
    first, but that's pittance for smart and lovable-- maybe we could stand 
    to meet <i>him</i> halfway.</p></div>"|8271.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8271-lst/|7.0|Nick Sylvester

Going back to his Farben alias, tracks titles like ""Live at the Sahara Tahoe, 1973"" and ""Farben Says: Love to Love You Baby"" reinforced that project's excavation of dance music tropes, where snapshots of soul and disco appeared as sonic negatives. On name alone, <em>Loop-finding-jazz-records</em> hinted at a trip-hop spin through the Blue Note catalog but led instead to something far more abstract, as tiny grains of samples were placed under the sound equivalent of a high-powered microscope and stretched into unrecognizable shapes. <em>La Nouvelle Pauvreté</em> introduced Jelinek's ""backing band"" the Exposures, which turned out to be just another mischievous device for him to explore the signifiers of live performance in a controlled studio setting. This playfully cerebral approach has resulted in one of the more remarkable bodies of work in electronic music.</p><p>
    For <em>Kosmischer Pitch</em>, Jelinek draws from the obsessed-over rock produced by his German countrymen in the 1970s. Of Jelinek's experiments with reference and allusion, <em>Kosmischer Pitch</em> may well have the clearest lines between inspirational source and finished track, but the connections are still subtle. Two forces seem to be operating simultaneously and both stem from familiar Jelinek obsessions. First, motivation comes primarily from the minute detail found in the production of the source material, the way the instruments and studio engineering choices of a specific time and place fused to form the regional flavor of psychedelia that came to be called krautrock. A digital approximation of early synths like the gurgling Moog along with fragments of guitar are common to most pieces, which congeal into a thick, wooly texture.</p><p>
    The second notable feature is the strong focus on highly repetitious loops as the means of composition. Jelinek curiously avoids the obvious ""motorik"" metaphor and offers instead loose, overlapping phrases that suggest a machine bolted to the floor and gyrating in place. Trance-inducing repetition is constantly modulated by variations that hover on the threshold of audibility. ""Universal Band Silhouette"", for example, spins over and over through a progression that at first seems to be a static meditation on four grimy organ chords but actually grows steadily in intensity with each new cycle. As the music becomes progressively crowded time itself seems to stretch to allow for the inclusion of more sound, a peculiar and disorienting effect that's new to Jelinek's world and forms the basis of several tracks. It never gets old.
    </p><p>
    Again Jelinek has assembled an album designed to work as a whole, with a consistent palette and tracks that bleed one into the next. Not a single track on <em>Kosmischer Pitch</em> would sound correct placed on any another Jelinek album, which, at a time when so many great electronic producers seem to have become prisoners to their own sound, is a surpassing virtue. Down deep Jelinek has base aesthetic principals to guide him, but he's clearly unafraid of change. Let's hope future explorations lead somewhere this engaging.
    </p>

In its seven-year run, the band appears to have drawn up a commonwealth-through-social-contract type deal: Selzer's the sovereign, and citizens suspend sleepiness in exchange for the loveliest of songs, both gorgeous and soporific. Earlier albums (<em>Dusk in Cold Parlours</em>, in particular) were lulling and understated-- they portended great things, but lacked immediacy: If Selzer would swap reservation for liberties maybe he'd be onto something.</i></p><p>
    N&amp;W; now outdo themselves effortlessly-- maybe inadvertently-- with the tour-only <em>If You Were Born Overseas (originally sold on recent treks with M. Ward, the CD is now available on N&amp;W;'s website). ""The Shortest Stare"" uncannily channels the Decemberists: Selzer croons unlike Dean Wareham, for once, and sounds as nose-jammed as Colin Meloy, as assured as Mark Kozelek. It's not any less authentic than usual, though, and the likeness makes sense: multi-instrumentalist and vocalist Rachel Blumberg is sometimes-drummer for the Decemberists, Selzer plays bass for M. Ward, and though the album's nothing exotic, it's still beautiful in its traditional grounding (itinerancy, rather). Norfolk &amp; Western's tradition is in railroad tracks, Adam Selzer's great-grandpa, Adam Selzer, was the first conductor of coal trains across Virginia. </em></p><p>
    Selzer and Blumberg deny themselves standard vehicular luxuries of modern transport, and insist on touring exclusively by train. Only so much shit can go down on trains, but Norfolk &amp; Western's progressed from busted, kinda-boring boxcar moods to forward locomotion-- pushing their hallmark folksy envelope to span wider, with <em>Overseas</em> waxing and waning but mostly waxing poetical-- sometimes a stalled Polar Express shipping kids to snowier places, and others the jaunty engines to Anywhere, U.S.A.; they could've easily run out of steam, but pick it up instead: Even songs that don't fall far from the tree of previous work still move charmingly. ""She Won't Be Famous"" accrues strings and drums in a simple, perfect crux of resignation; a girl who's ""timid and shy, doesn't try"" only lets a privileged few hear her songs, but when Selzer eavesdrops (""On Sunday morning, I hear through the walls/ the prettiest voice""), it's bliss, more or less. Spotted with songs like these (see also ""Porch Destination""), <em>Overseas moves beautifully-- the voices of Blumberg and Selzer fit as perfect as usual-- but still stalls too often. Cinched tighter, their forthcoming </em><em>A Gilded Age</em> EP (which will include different versions of <em>Overseas</em> tracks, and others) seems terribly promising.</p></div>"|5890.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5890-if-you-were-born-overseas/|7.5|Rachel Khong

    no way a noise band, Tony Conrad-derived, or psychedelic. Actually, on
    first listen the Australian quartet may seem like little more than an
    unhinged bluesy garage outfit-- but that's because career music fans
    are too often trained to shun things that work within genre
    definitions. Serious, give these fuckers time and they'll rip out your
    eardrums, perhaps even your heart.</p><p>
    Vocalist/guitarist Gareth Liddiard and guitarist Rui Pereira found a drummer and bassist and formed the group in Melbourne in early 2000. They put out an eponymous
    EP in 2001 and a year later released the full-length debut, <em>Here Come
    the Lies</em> (which tellingly included a cover of the Cramps' ""New Kind of
    Kick""). Over the next three years they only put out two 7"" singles. Now, kinda out of
    nowhere, comes their amped sophomore dispatch, <em>Wait Long By the River
    and the Bodies of Your Enemies Will Float By.</em></p><p>
    Playing together for a half-decade has resulted in shivery tightness:
    Notes bend and expand just as a snare wakes up; the bass adds an
    exclamation to a vocal line. They have the boundless cohesion and energy of X or the Gun Club. Judging them against other Australian acts, you'll find more than a bit of Kim Salmon's
    Scientists (see, for instance, their 1983 single ""We Had
    Love"") and, of course, the Birthday Party (albeit with less
    all-over-the-place percussion, horns, and avant tendencies).</p><p>
    Despite the band's meshing, the focus rests squarely on vocalist/guitarist Gareth Liddiard. A tall, lean rocker who flails on floors and swings his guitar over his head, Liddiard's reminiscent of the Laughing Hyenas' John Brannon in his willingness to shred his vocal chords. Fast forward to his bloody howl on the poppy, Ponys-like ""Baby"" to get an idea of the scratchy decibels.</p><p>
    Lyrically, the Drones' world's crammed with drunkenness, night
    sweats, and suicide notes. The album opens with ""Shark Fin Blues"", one of the best
    rockers of the year, a seemingly endless path of riffs and dynamics and a good
    introduction to Liddiard's nihilistic subject matter. The song's
    protagonist is stuck on a sinking ship, watching sharks ""coming fin by
    fin"" toward the wreckage ""like slicks of ink."" He thinks he sees
    Jonah, there's an albatross á la Samuel Taylor Colerdige's ""The Rime of the Ancient Mariner"", and
    the captain's ""laid up in the galley like a dried out mink...dying of
    thirst."" He admits he's going to be alone, asking ""Why
    don't you get down in the sea/ Turn the water red like you want to
    be?"" And there you are, losing oxygen sans friends, all by your lonesome.</p><p>
    The other thing the band does is slow. things. down. They take their
    time with pieces like ""Sitting on the Edge if the Cryin'"" and ""The Best You Can Believe In"",
    which closes with smears of vibrato distortion and posits that there isn't
    much in which you can have faith. Variations on this crisis are echoed throughout: For
    instance, in the aforementioned ""Baby,"" Liddiard admits, ""Man, I won't
    ever be free/ Though alone drunk on a beach/ Ain't such a bad way to
    be."" The aptly titled ""Another Rousing Chorus You Idiots!!!"" Perhaps the track most structurally redolent of Laughing Hyenas' slow-burn blues lets it be known that ""We were
    shat from wormholes...there's no use for order.""</p><p>
    It's also a solidly working-class record, discussing the walk home
    from the factory or, as in ""Locust"", sketching a
    depressing port town. In what amounts to the town's love story, the
    protagonist's first girl, daughter of drunken war veteran, leaves a
    suicide note. One of the more atmospheric tracks, it opens with
    moments of feedback and single piano notes while Liddiard pensively
    intones, ""Georgie, I can't stop drinking/ Seems like every time I
    can't stop thinking."" The tracks ends under a distorted gale of malleted piano strings, frenzied bows, and a tidal whirlpool of guitar noise.</p><p>
    Albums that stick come in various shades: Something surprisingly
    ambitious like Sufjan Steven's <i>Illinois, meta-smart like Art Brut's debut, as beautifully
    honed as Othrelm's <em>OV</em></i>, or as magnificently unrelenting as Sunn 0)))'s
    <em>Black One. </em><em>Wait Long By the River</em> sounds nothing like any of these, and won't win awards for originality. But it could garner some props for brilliance.
    There's nothing wrong with being a solid whiskey-drunk rock band. But
    really, the greatest thing about such a pessimistic bunch of sots
    (with a truly ecstatic spitter) is the realization that they're too
    smart to relegate drowning to one's enemies. Hey, if you
    hang out by the river long enough, you'll most likely spot a
    couple of friends, too.</p></div>"|2627.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2627-wait-long-by-the-river-and-the-bodies-of-your-enemies-will-float-by/|8.3|Brandon Stosuy

    compare things to him a lot-- they're speaking of one very specific corner of
    his long career as a film composer. It's the big, echo-ing spaghetti Western
    sound he popularized in his work with director (and fellow Italian) Sergio
    Leone, full of twanging guitar and high lonesome ambiance. The comparison is
    often apt, but it only captures a sliver of what the man did for film music,
    the part most of us know and love. <em>Crime &amp; Dissonance</em>, a new double-disc
    compilation from Mike Patton's Ipecac label digs beyond his Western work and
    his 1980s experiments with early digital synthesizers for films like the
    Untouchables (a score I actually think is awful, at least in terms of how it
    matches with the film) to his music for 1960s and 70s Italian crime and
    exploitation movies.</p><p>
    The music unearthed here is a minor revelation, among the oddest produced by
    a true auteur and frequently quite innovative for its era. Alan Bishop
    curates the tracklist (no less an avant garde legend than John Zorn provides
    limited liner notes), and he's chosen some wonderfully dark and bizarre
    stuff that careens from musique concrete, melodramatic church organ pieces
    and free jazz to wah-drenched psychedelia, stiff funk, and abstract
    avant-gardism.</p><p>
    The two discs are sequenced more for flow than anything else, jumping back
    and forth over a range of films completed between 1968 and 1981. This makes
    for a great listen, eschewing historical baggage that only a few people are
    likely to care much about anyway. The spry title theme to Gli Intoccabili
    segues remarkably well into ""Fondate Paure"", a slow, menacing piece from a
    film recorded three years later, as both make excellent use of oddly
    arranged strings. ""Gli Intoccabili"" is founded on a manic jazz/funk vamp,
    which thrusts along under strings scored with no vibrato, giving them a
    dead, discordant tone-- the tension between rhythmic movement and melodic
    iciness is enough to prick your hair up.</p><p>
    Morricone was obviously heavily effected by the psychedelic movement of the
    late 60s, and guitar feedback, oscillations, Eastern scales and heavy
    wah guitar are frequent sonic signifiers. The lone post-1980 track,
    ""Fumeria D'Oppio"", is a haunting bit of largely unaccompanied gypsy violin
    that's eventually joined by guitar so subtle that it's only noticeable
    peripherally-- you barely hear it when you listen for it. It's the kind of
    detail that abounds here, and each composition is far more loaded with fine
    points than it first appears to be. Take ""Memento"", from the 1971 film
    ""L'Istruttoria E' Chiusa: Dimentchi"", which electronically subverts a choir
    to sparse free improvisation. The following track is a collage, fading
    harmonized female voices in and out with a weird psych instrumental, a
    string processional and marching soldiers.</p><p>
    More than setting the tone for Western scores for a generation, Morricone's
    greatest legacy is perhaps the way he used sound elementally, largely
    disregarding the expectations his captive listeners had of guitars,
    orchestras and percussion in favor of combinations that captured very
    specific moods in a way most traditional soundtracking methods simply
    couldn't. His music is often hard to pin emotionally for the same
    reasons-- the emotion we so frequently draw from music is largely a result of
    the harmonic clichés we learn to associate with certain feelings, and he
    doesn't use any of those clichés in these pieces. <em>Crime &amp; Dissonance</em>
    is perhaps the most essential Morricone compilation out there in that, in skipping hits like the theme from ""the Good, the Bad &amp; the Ugly"", it captures his
    darkest, most adventurous material, shedding light on a part of his career
    that hasn't been explored deeply enough.</p></div>"|5570.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5570-crime-dissonance/|8.0|Joe Tangari

Perhaps it's this pedigree that allows Kane to deliver his solo debut <em>February</em> with such high decibel self-assurance. His music's intrinsic swagger is crucial to the album's success, for here Kane has chosen to work almost exclusively within the outwardly stagnant vocabulary of the blues. Though he utilizes some of the most familiar and overworked progressions of the past several decades, on these five pieces he side-steps cliché by marshaling his minimalist riffs to their trance-inducing limits, and deftly sparks a synaptic link between Neu!-style repetition and the hypnotic electric blues of Junior Kimbrough.</p><p>
    With the exception of some guitar contributions from Igor Cubrilovic, <em>February</em> is a true solo work, as Kane handles the rest of the guitar, bass, and drum duties himself. On these five instrumental pieces he's stripped away all of his music's inessentials, excising overwrought vocals or flashy solos to instead pare these blues-based excursions down to a streamlined, locomotive core.</p><p>
    Kicking immediately into an unapologetic foursquare blues riff, the 12-minute opener ""Curl"" initially does little to impress, Kane biding his time as he patiently sweeps again and again through each dusty corner. As the track progresses, however, the riff begins to build a tenacious momentum through a series of almost imperceptable directional shifts, and soon the massed overtones of the guitars course against Kane's powerhouse drumming to assemble into a singularly captivating propulsive drone. Likewise, the set's version of the traditional ""Motherless Child"" elongates the old spiritual's structure nearly beyond the point of recognition, with each melodic detail considered in isolation beneath distant ascending distortion and the rolling boulders of Kane's unyielding rhythms.</p><p>
    Spacious tracks like ""Pops"" and ""Sis"" incorporate subtle traces of parched earth Americana to somewhat less invigorating effect, although Kane supplies each with a certain sawtooth grit and a cold-blooded rattlesnake resolve. But he saves his most effective transmutation for last with his mammoth set-closing take on Rhys Chatham's epic ""Guitar Trio"". Whereas the original was a cascading, open-tuned electrical current, Kane's blues-refracted interpretation concentrates its substantial energies onto the piece's imposing rhythmic lumber. Over the course of the track's 12-minute length, Kane adds and removes sonic elements with the single-minded endurance of wide, muddy river carving itself a canyon, and with the unwavering confidence of an already-veteran solo performer secure in his vision.</p></div>"|4603.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4603-february/|7.4|Matthew Murphy

And what's the other, 99% of all love songs make me want to slit my face? Swedish indie pop group Love Is All admit as much in their bandname and album title. It's not necessarily a joke, but they're in on it: All people-- not just songwriters, Hallmark cards, and bridge-and-tunnel dudes in party shirts and going-out jeans-- struggle talking love. Most hack it up; others come too wry on the game, too whiny, or their cleverness can be disgusting. Love Is All make it work cos they know their snags-- shitty equipment, love-lyrical cliché, inevitable Life Without Buildings and Yeah Yeah Yeahs comparisons-- and speed headlong into them regardless. There's a dire necessity to <em>Nine Times That Same Song</em>, and ultimately that's its charm.</p><p> Like the other recordings on the New York-based What's Your Rupture? label, the playing happens beneath a prophylactic lo-fi glaze. All sounds seem to hit the mic at once, and our ears forgive the occasional imprecisions for the overall fit. So that's the musical counterpart to the lyrical problem-- turning lo-fi from a ho-hum excuse to a gritty asset. But we respond to passion, not perfection, and like your ESGs and Delta 5s, this band makes do like a motherfucker.</p><p>  ""Things, they aren't going that well,"" confesses singer Josephine Olausson on ""Used Goods"", which comes early in <em>Nine Times</em>'s faint love-cycle sequencing: fall out, get over, fall in again. The song has sympathy for the stalker, who follows around town the one about to break her heart, noting those worthless similarities we all think actually mean something (""we like the same kind of cheese""). The guitar melody hams, and the rhythm section's on some Looney Tunes-meets-Orange Juice disco chase-scene bit, and funny synths poke out towards the end-- somehow the song communicates the complex of madness, embarrassment, and ""everybody does it, right?""-ness of watching someone pull away. ""I don't mind used goods,"" she admits ashamedly.</p><p> Most times, though, the lyrics hide deep in reverb; LIA's most affecting turns are musical, and often extremely minimal. ""Talk Talk Talk Talk"" combines Daft Punk's ""one more time!"" chorus mourning in monotone, Karen O's ""rich rich rich"" snarl, James Chance sax skronk, and vicious call-and-response figures in support of the song's only intelligible line: ""Please just leave me alone."" But all that's just a set-up for the band's pregnant mid-song pause-- they come back in a beat earlier than we expect-- and the song's tense last note, one half-step away from resolving. ""Ageing Has Never Been His Friend"" tones down the desperation and ups the dance with a bigger beat, bass octaves, and a happy-go-lucky sax line to underscore the song's misplaced hopes that all things love will stay ""fresh and young"": ""I keep the one I love/ In the freezer."" By ""Turn the Radio Off"", no more bang: The sax plays out of tune, guitarists pluck out the chords as if they've lost all patience, and Olausson delivers the frustrated refrain, ""Hey world, I've had enough!""</p><p>  The rest of <em>Nine Times</em> happens on the upswing, starting with the utterly optimistic sing-along ""Make Out Fall Out Make Up."" A counterpart to ""Turn the Radio Off"" in a way, the song acknowledges How Things Are, but grants ""I think I'll stay all day in bed"" a positivity ""Radio"" previously denied. ""Busy Doing Nothing"" takes nervous pleasure in the out-of-sight, out-of-mind getting-over-you process-- ""Five movie marathons! Nine times that same song!""-- and another deceptive stop/start and smart key change make this song the most exciting one on the album. The pretty two-speed romance ballad ""Felt Tip"" flirts with obscurities (stuff about ""spray cans"" and ""finger tips"" and ""step right on the beat""), but that's romance is it not? A conflation of meta-metaphors and the prowl, this song about graffiti never says, brilliantly, ""The writing's on the wall.""</p><p> And then we're back again, in the frenzy of the fresh and young, ""clapping hands up in the air,"" saying yeah, unraveling your reactions. The band could have ended <em>Nine Times</em>-- a bit solipsistic but deservedly so-- on the lonely what-to-do of ""Turn the TV Off"", the album's ninth song har-har. Too easy. In an album that's so anxiously avoided these types of cliches, the power-pop ditty ""Trying Too Hard"" truly seals the kiss with an afterthought: ""I was trying way too hard."" Haven't we all.</p></div>"|8971.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8971-nine-times-that-same-song/|8.7|Nick Sylvester

    placed skronk beneath splashes of electronic Day-Glo feedback, with individual pieces reeling like the decapitated segments of basement jams. There's been variation in the overall approach-- last
    year's Die &amp; Mold 12"" stretched tracks to longer durations; <em>It's
    Always 1999</em> basted punchy rocket-fire
    soundtracking-- but overall the vision's remained more or less the
    same.</p><p>
<em>Expedition to the Hairier
    Peaks</em>, the band's fourth album, is rawer, cavernously big-bottomed, and less sequenced than its predecessors. That,
    and, well, really long. Its trio of 10-plus-minute pieces work (and
    work well), but because these freeform monsters are followed by a seemingly interminable succession less successful five-
    to eight-minute rockers, the whoop-ass grows anemic. As so many bands have
    yet to realize (or realized but decided to ignore?), albums and live
    shows could be so much more enjoyable if the players simply
    wacked weeds.</p><p>
    
    It's unclear why Mindflayer overstuffs. As a bit of background:
    Brinkman pilots Forcefield and Chippendale pounds skins and screams in
    Lightning Bolt. There's been a considerable time lag when it comes to
    Mindflayer releases. For example, <em>Hairier Peaks</em> was recorded in
    October 2002 and released three years later. Likewise, 2004's <i>It's
    Always 1999</i> was released five years after it was put to tape, as its
    title suggests, in 1999. It's hard to call Mindflayer a side project,
    especially considering Brinkman and Chippendale have been pairing up
    like this since the mid-90s. But since Forcefield became art-world
    darlings, partaking in the 2002 Whitney Biennial, and Lightning Bolt emerged as noise-rock
    poster boys, Mindflayer's stuck playing second fiddle (or distortion
    pedal, if you will).</p><p>
    
    Still, all's not a wash. The boomy 11-minute opener, ""Rally For A
    Wind War-- Part 1: Whirlwind Dervish, Part 2: Cracking The Barrier
    Riffs"" is a tad like Silver Apples eking ""Oscillations"" from within a
    static maelstrom. It's followed by the serviceable shorty ""Getting
    Our Hair Done"", a drum solo (with slight bass hum in the distance)
    that evokes boxers feeling each other out before
    engaging in the first punch. Like the opener, it just stops-- no
    attempt to smooth it into the following piece-- and this ragged, free-and-easy approach is a plus. Of all the long balls, the best is
    ""Each To Their Own Dark Path"", which squeezes two distinct movements
    into 12 minutes-- the first's an unrelenting This Heat! rave-up;
    the second has Chippendale gagging on faint Chromatics vocals behind a
    slightly less rousing monster smash.
    Despite some beauts, the cataloguing eventually gets tired and even
    the most patient listener may resort to picking out songs with funny
    titles: ""Let's Play Holy War Fuckers"", ""Gore Gone Wild"" etc.</p><p>
    
    Entropic noise (or metal-noise or minimalism or whatever) released in
    the wake of Orthrelm's magnifico <em>OV</em> needs to step it up, which can mean
    downsizing or interjecting precision or even some sort of theoretical
    <em>raison de etre</em>. A few weeks back, a friend and I were talking about
    how it's cool Thurston Moore collaborates on noise stuff and promotes
    younger artists, but it's disappointing that his experimental side
    hasn't developed-- i.e. he still basically stands in front of an amp,
    bends the guitar neck, and baptizes us with his fretwork. I get that
    same feeling with Mindflayer: Chunks of this racket provide enjoyable
    sugar lumps, but put them all together on an album, then line said
    album up with the entire oeuvre, and the flat-line non-arc gives me
    brain freeze.</p></div>"|5545.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5545-expedition-to-the-hairier-peaks/|6.0|Brandon Stosuy

Listening to Dengue Fever's second album, <em>Escape from Dragon House</em>, without any sort of background information or context, it's easy to assume that it's an authentic example of modern Cambodian pop music that has reached American shores, undiluted. In fact, Dengue Fever's story is much more complicated and-- depending on your perspective-- either inauthentic or thrillingly mutli-culti. For my part, I don't believe the dilution of world music is anything to get upset about-- it provides exciting new opportunities for musical expansion and cultural exchange. We tend to think of traditional music as something static, when in fact, traditions evolve over time, picking up new influences according to the maneuvers of history. Now that telecommunications technology grids most of the world, the rate of evolution seems to be speeding up, and the old styles we think of as so permanent either persist outside of the new music, or they become a part of it. So it goes.</p><p> 
    
    American rock and soul music and its instrumentation and stylistic tenets found purchase in trad Cambodian music in the wake of the Vietnam War. So Dengue Fever are revising an ""authentic"" style that was actually bastardized from the moment of its inception, folding modern American pop idioms into a Cambodian style that was heavily influenced by classic American surf rock and <em>Nuggets</em>-era garage-psych. Dengue Fever also blend the long rhythmic lines of Ethiopian pop and jazz into the melting pot (for more on Ethiopian music, check out the <em>Ethiopique</em> series, or just ask Joe Tangari). But here's the real kicker: Except for the singer, the entire band is American. Based in Los Angeles, Dengue Feature includes Ethan Holtzman on Farfisa (his phrasing is reminiscent of Ray Manzarek's), guitarist Zac Holtzman, saxophonist David Ralicke (who's played with Beck and Brazzaville), bassist Senon Williams of the Radar Brothers, and drummer Paul Smith. The group assembled around their love of Cambodian music; only then did they find singer Ch'hom Nimol in Long Beach. Nimol sings in her native Khmer, and while she was making her Stateside living singing at Cambodian weddings, she was a star in her native country, often performing before the King and Queen.</p><p> 
    
    Dengue Fever's debut album was all covers of the cute, romantic Cambodian pop of the 1960s. Having gotten that out of their systems, they've followed it with an album of original material that shatters the language barrier with mildly psychedelic, blissed out pop. On ""Tip My Canoe"", Zac Holtzman takes a stab at singing in Khmer, laying those long, mellifluous syllables over a tweaky vamp, as Nimol uses her imposing pipes to trace accents so dynamic that they sound almost vocodered as she leaps around her impressive range. ""Sui Bong"" channels Dick Dale through its verses and explodes into crunchy garage rock choruses, with a-- wait for it-- Cambodian rap bridge. ""One Thousand Tears of a Tarantula"" pairs sun-baked spaghetti western guitars with Nimol's clipped, forceful singing, and acoustic ballad ""Hummingbird"" closes the album on a quiet note, with Nimol sliding between English and Khmer. If that fact that Dengue Fever's music has been used in films as diverse as Jim Jarmusch's <em>Broken Flowers</em> and the John Cusack vehicle <em>Must Love Dogs</em> isn't proof enough of its potent versatility, then the ease and unity with which the band conflates idioms should be. </p></div>"|2506.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2506-escape-from-dragon-house/|7.7|Brian Howe

So on <em>Brocade</em>-- their return to Strange Attractors after albums on Ba Da Bing! and K-- the group has sensibly taken a hard step away from dreamcore to a slight return to the gauzy space-rock of earlier records like 2002's <em>Fade In/Fade Out</em>, an exchange that includes its own distinct set of pitfalls. On <em>Brocade</em>, however, Landing makes enough strategic use of Kraut-inspired rhythms and shimmering, repetitive minimalism to help sidestep the New Age perils of their ambient celestial navigations.</p><p>
    
    The quartet is still based around the husband-and-wife duo Aaron and Adrienne Snow, but since the release of their 2004 album <em>Sphere</em> founding member Dick Baldwin has moved on, and was replaced by keyboardist Peter Baumann. Seizing upon this subtle change in dynamic, Landing essentially recorded <em>Brocade</em> live in the studio, allowing the album's five tracks to naturally expand and contract with a graceful, unforced dexterity. And unlike much of their recent material, the group spares little attention to either pop songcraft or discernable lyrics, as vocals are kept offstage for nearly the entire length of the album.</p><p>
    
    Bursting forth with an uncharacteristically dissonant thrum of feedback, the opening ""Loft"" soon settles into an agile, motorik lumber, working some of the same rich, patterned fields as Caribou's <em>The Milk of Human Kindness</em>. Throughout the track, competing swells of keyboard lap softly at the rhythm's sturdy shoreline, but this seawall soon crumbles on the percussion-less likes of ""Yon"" or ""Spiral Arms"". On these lengthy pieces, Landing's combinations of tranquil strings and synth drones can at times achieve the spirited delicacy of Brian Eno's collaborations with Cluster. That said, it's often only the group's melodic economy and the occasional loosened analog buzz that distinguishes these tracks from the tepid watercolors that typically soundtrack the Dead Man's Pose at yoga class. </p><p>
    
    It comes as a pleasant shock, then, to have your slumber disrupted by the hard-driving ""How to Be Clear"", Landing's grungiest track to date. The song also features the album's lone vocal, albeit one buried beneath distortion. The track's invigorating effect is magnified when contrasted with the mesmerizing set closer, ""Music For Three Synthesizers"", a hazily-unfolding epic that takes a sheet or two from Keith Fullerton Whitman's music stand. True to its title, this piece features three unaccompanied synths captured in effortlessly transfixing dialogue, as Landing sagely permit themselves to be lifted off course, carried skyward by their music's patient, weightless ascension. </p></div>"|4674.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4674-brocade/|7.1|Matthew Murphy

He     also got his start as a hip-hop DJ, which explains his DJ sets, full of hard     edits, scratching, and ghetto-tech odes to popping that pussy alongside the     standard issue melodic tech-house. His 2004 mix <i>All People is My Friends </i>opened with the Langley Schools Music Project before getting down to ""business"" with Farben and Mathew Jonson. As Adolf Noise, he's recorded everything from grating punk-techno to a drunken seaside cover of ""We Are the World"" with himself doing all the voices. As one-third of International Pony he's made two discs of post-Daft Punk pop dance, one released on a major label.</p>
<p>Which is why the relatively straight melodic house and techno of <i>Kosi     Comes Around</i> is such a pleasant surprise. It's a rather risky gambit,     considering he's built most of his rep so far on stepping outside genre     conventions. ""Don't Feed the Cat"" jacks along on little more than its own     percussive momentum, reminding us that for all the home listening rhetoric     that rightly gets thrown around with dance music CDs, its power is still     rooted in the rhythmic. ""The Geklöppel Continues"" blurs the line between     harmonic and rhythmic entirely, as the melody is hammered with such force     that it becomes part of the beat. ""My Grandmotha"" is a bit like a house     music Boards of Canada, with tiny melodic chunks swirling wistfully.     ""Estrella"" likewise plonks itself squarely in the Kompakt tradition of     chugging, dewy melancholy.</p>
<p>The album climaxes with the strange 2003 anthem ""Brutalga Square"", a trawl     through a dark, dank German sewer full of bass, lots of negative space, and     strange, rattling offbeats. This is still Koze's most famous track, nearly     10 minutes of ridiculously tense brooding with no release. After the     pleasing, warm music of most of Kosi Comes Around, this plunge into     the underworld is disorienting, like suddenly being stranded in a long, dark     tunnel. The very bright light at the end comes with ""Chiminea"", a sweetly     lilting comedown that floats us out to sea. The Hamburglar himself winks at     us as his balloon sails over the sunset, pleased as punch that there's still     life left in a twenty year old genre. While I appreciate all his     half-soldered bedroom experiments and flashy way with a crossfader, I'm     pretty pleased with the results.</p></div>"|2543.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2543-kosi-comes-around/|8.0|Jess Harvell

    the greatest rappers on the planet, sly and quick-tongued with perfect 
    timing and better punchlines than first-album Eminem, and he has a sticky-sweet 
    deadpan singing voice that nails hooks like Nate Dogg. In 2003, he and Paul Wall released <em>Get Ya Mind Correct</em>, one of the best Southern rap albums ever. Everything that everyone ever says about <i>3 Feet High and Rising is even more true about <em>Get Ya Mind Correct</em>: smartass dorks tossing goofy-sharp jokes back and forth, bringing a sense of play to a genre not known for it and sidestepping their lack of hardness by making light of it, even celebrating it. Paul's clumsy charm makes him a valuable foil, but it's all Chamillionaire, crooning the hooks and wrapping his irresistible liquid flow around sunburst Houston-synth beats, getting in all the best lines: ""They 
    said rap was a waste of knowledge, 'Take ya ass to college'/ Now they broke 
    asses call us, try to ask for dollars.""</i></p><p>
    
    A lot has happened since 2003. Soon after Cham and Paul split from each 
    other and began quietly feuding, the rap world discovered Houston, and Cham 
    signed a solo deal with Universal. When you're one of the greatest rappers 
    in the world, you're going to be facing some pressure when you're releasing 
    the first solo album of your career. And even if your sense of humor is your 
    primary strength, you might decide that you want to be taken seriously.</p><p>
<em>Get Ya Mind Correct</em> was great partly because it followed no formats and 
    pandered to no audiences; it's mostly just about cars. But on <em>The Sound of 
    Revenge</em>, Cham makes a common mistake: He tries to be all things to all 
    people, making songs for every rap audience. He touches all the bases: 
    love-rap (""Grown and Sexy""), club-rap (""Peepin' Me""), street-rap (""No 
    Snitching""). The fill-in-the-blanks approach kept Cham's fellow Houston MC 
    Bun B's solo debut Trill from being the classic it should've been, and it 
    has the same effect here. Cham smothers his sense of humor and only gives 
    rare glimpses of his personality. It's all solid, but it's never 
    transcendent. On ""Southern Takeover"", Killer Mike becomes possibly the first 
    rapper ever to outshine Cham on a track; that wouldn't have happened two 
    years ago.</p><p>
    
    But it's always a joy to hear Cham's effortlessly slippery flow even when 
    he's not playing to his strengths. And a few tracks on the album show that 
    Cham is at least maturing in the right direction. On ""Rain"", a gorgeous 
    piano-laced, Scarface-assisted soul track, Cham gets inspirational: ""Tired 
    of being poor, trying to leave the rats/ Walk out to see that three of your 
    tires would be on flat/ And that one tire left's a sign of hope/ That 
    helps you keep on grinding when you're kinda broke."" If Cham can give us an 
    entire album as powerful as ""Rain"" next time, he'll have another classic on 
    the level of <em>Get Ya Mind Correct</em>.</p></div>"|1823.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1823-the-sound-of-revenge/|7.0|Tom Breihan

During the first season of ""The O.C."", Adam Brody's character was the kind of guy who threatened to kick his crush out of the car when she complained about the Death Cab for Cutie song on the stereo (""it's just one guitar and a whole lot of whining"") or recoiled in horror when the popular girl next door said she listened to the Clash. But by the end of the second season, when Death Cab performed at the Bait Shop, ""The O.C.""'s fictional concert venue, Seth didn't even make it to the show. He had more important things to do.</p><p>
    
    Thank god. Who wants a TV show about the day-to-day life of a teenage indie rock nerd? It would be as boring as geometry class. Tonight's episode: Bobby updates his MySpace blog and downloads the leaked Belle and Sebastian album! Next week: Susie spends all of her allowance money on an import copy of the Boy Least Likely To record, only to discover that it's coming out in America in a few months-- with bonus tracks! Even I wouldn't watch that, and I spent half of ninth grade fighting with my mom because she wouldn't let me go to a Sonic Youth show on a school night.</p><p>
    
    Ever since Seth got a life, ""The O.C."" has pretty much abandoned any pretensions of exploring music dorkiness, yet the show's powers-that-be still seem to want to maintain a connection to indie rock, despite the fact that it now has about as much to do with music as ""Nanny 911"" does. So they keep pumping out these <em>Music From the O.C.</em> mix CDs, featuring tunes that have played in the background during past episodes.</p><p>
    
    The music on these mixes has always been pleasant, dull, and safe, the kind of stuff that wouldn't cause too much stress on parents. <em>Mix 5</em> is no different. Imogen Heap's incandescent ""Hide and Seek"", which closes the disc, is the only truly disturbing (and truly moving) song on here, but the only misbehavior it would seem to inspire is an unhealthy obsession with the Vocoder. If I caught my kid blasting Rogue Wave's ""Publish My Love"" or Stars' ""Your Ex-Lover Is Dead"" from behind a closed bedroom door, my biggest concern would be that Junior had been stealing my <em>Paste</em> magazines. Or my <em>NME</em>s: Brit faves Gorillaz, Kasabian, Kaiser Chiefs, and the Subways, all contribute lukewarm tracks to this latest compilation.</p><p>
    
    I've always gotten the sense that the people in charge of ""The O.C.""'s playlists are grown-up music geeks themselves, gleefully submitting millions of people to whatever has been rocking their stereos recently. That would explain the inclusion of LCD Soundsystem's ""Daft Punk Is Playing at My House"" on <em>Mix 5</em>. Here's a band seemingly tailor-made for (and, arguably, by) rock critics, playing a song about another band that maybe 20 percent of ""The O.C.""'s audience has heard of, featuring a cowbell solo, and rejoicing in the fact that ""the jocks can't get in the door."" What an in-joke! Likewise, when eternally beautiful and eternally tortured couple Ryan and Marissa turn on the radio to pick ""our song,"" out comes Youth Group's cover of Alphaville's ""Forever Young"", a tune that was not only already used in <em>Napoleon Dynamite</em>, but is also about <em>nuclear war</em>. </p><p>
    
    Somebody's having a lot of fun with this, but it probably won't be the listener. I can't imagine the songs on <em>Mix 5</em> soundtracking any teenager's life, indie nerd or not; this stuff is better suited to mid-life-crisis sufferers who rely on adult-alternative radio to tell them what's hip. But then again, what middle-aged person would buy a CD designed to look like a high school yearbook, complete with sappy inscriptions and photos of lockers?</p><p>
    
    Besides, everybody knows that the indie kids don't watch ""The O.C."" anymore. They watch ""Gilmore Girls"". Now <em>there's</em> a show that needs a box set.</p></div>"|7894.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7894-music-from-the-oc-mix-5/|3.5|Amy Phillips

No wonder As MercexE1rias are largely responsible for the ego-stroking interest in Brazilian post-punk (as exemplified by the excellent comps <em>The Sexual Life of the Savages and </em><em>Não Wave). The group matured and vanished in the span of only six years and two albums, leaving a reputation analogous to that of the Pop Group or Kleenex: obscure and original subterraneans whose legacies were tarnished by their more popular successors. </em></p><p>
    Despite the band's recent notoriety, the MercexE1rias are perhaps unrepresentative of their native country's post-punk pantheon. First, they have less blatant allusions to funk- and reggae-inflected pop melodies of the 1970s. While Gang 90 and Nau churned fluttery lambada kitsch into dingy contusions, the MercexE1rias abided by clockwork minimalism, as precise and sober as systems analysts. Likewise, the band generally eschewed samba and bossa nova rhythms in favor of a constrained percussive tension. Lead singer Rosália Munhoz was famously ignorant of Música Popular Brasileira and preferred the plastered rancor and aloof satire of the Raincoats, Joy Division, and PiL. The result is a distinctly sour-- and British-- amalgam of gloom, ire, and anxiety. Even the lyrics traffic in sloganeering cynicism (""solitude is a fact!""). Their first release toggles crazily between poetic abstraction (the existential gibberish on ""Me Perco"") and reflexive anti-authority populism (the anthemic preadolescence of ""Polícia"").</p><p>
<em>The Beginning of the End of the World, the first full-length easily available in the U.S., collects the MercexE1rias' 1986 debut, </em><em>Cad\xEA As Armas?</em>, and half of the tracks from 1988's <em>Trashland. While </em><em>Armas may be more petulant than similar Brazilian records from the early '80s, it deliberately lacks the sheer dissonance often associated with its North American counterparts. In fact, guitarist Ana Machado owes more to stoner psych: The debut teems with laggard fuzz, shuffled drones and bruised metal. ""Pânico"" features sparkling surf reverb, and ""Loucos Sentimentos"" mutilates stammering guitars on an otherwise innocuous amateur session. Every song is under two minutes, and the band is clearly struggling to compress its excesses into palatable punk.</em></p><p>
<em>Trashland</em> is another story entirely: hi-fi, downbeat, and lathered in heavy globs of venom. There's less militant rage and juvenile apathy, and no further attempts to suppress the band's idiosyncrasies. Munhoz transforms her sterile yelp into incantational jazz. Mouthfuls of acid surf roll in the background. Automated vocals hex fiery keyboard clusters in EMI-produced clarity. On ""Há Dez Anos Passados"", the band is nearly overwhelmed by its quirks: demonic grinding, berserk bicycle horns, and snippets of <em>Fair Warning-era shredding. If it's truly a sign o' the times, one must assume São Paulo spent the decade imprisoning killers and clowns. </em></p><p>
    Sadly, <em>World</em> excises most of <em>Trashland's more tender moments (""Angelus,"" ""MatixEA""), as though only frantic DFA-influencing party jams were suitable for inclusion. The timing of the release is also suspect. The MercexE1rias, now grayed and reunited after a 16-year hiatus, have been strutting through Brazil's TV studios in loopy leopard-skin outfits. Considering the States' propensity for Pan-American punk, I doubt we'll hear much about their impending tour and album. For now-- and until the Baltic no-wave market takes off-- this is yet another admirably warped reflection of the North's most endearingly snobbish genre.</em></p></div>"|492.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/492-the-beginning-of-the-end-of-the-world/|7.8|Alex Linhardt

From the beginning, Brendan Perry and Lisa Gerrard thought of their work in global terms, as music from any latitude and any era was fair game for appropriation and assimilation into their distinctive musical vision. Somehow, because they never lost sight of core aesthetic principals that began with their dark self-titled debut in 1984, their borrowing never seemed displeasingly imperialistic or slanted toward cultural tourism. They cared about the music that interested them and they had an intuitive understanding of how it would fit into the Dead Can Dance project.</p><p>
    
    Representative samples of almost every Dead Can Dance style can be found on this, the fourth Dead Can Dance collection and third since Perry and Gerrard parted ways in 1999. There's the soft, ethereal ambience of ""Ariadne"" which would really begin to flower when Gerrard turned her attention to film soundtracks. There's the intense, ritualistic Near East vocalizations on ""Cantara"", which finds Gerrard unleashing the full power of her amazing voice in a cavernous Wall of Sound production driven by tribal drums. ""Enigma of the Absolute"" from 1985's <em>Spleen and Ideal</em> is an excellent showcase of the band at its most gothic, with the deeply echoing production conjuring images of a medieval cathedral as dusk.</p><p>
    
    Other tracks impress simply with the strength of the tunes. On ""The Ubiquitous Mr. Lovegrove"" Perry seamlessly blends instruments from a handful of different cultures-- sitar, antara, guitar, synth, violin-- and make them work together in a conventionally Western songwriting style that could easily be translated to a rock context. Further into the pure singer-songwriter direction is Perry's voice-and-guitar showcase ""American Dreaming"", which I remember being on regular rotation on post-Nirvana ""alternative"" radio in 1995. Though the sonic experience of the band was a large part of their appeal, Dead Can Dance didn't need exotic production to get over.</p><p>
<em>Memento</em> is the fourth Dead Can Dance compilation and the third since Perry and Gerrard parted ways in 1999, but it's the only single-disc set spanning their entire career. Actually, ""entire career"" is not quite accurate, since it avoids the classically Goth debut album completely and focuses heavily on two early '90s albums that coincided with the band's breakthrough in the United States. Such a focus makes sense considering that <em>Memento</em> was conceived partly as a souvenir for those who came out for their recent reunion tour. Dead Can Dance was an intense band requiring a certain commitment, and for a lot a lot of people 70 minutes of prime music is all they will really need. For them this is definitely the place to start. </p></div>"|2212.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2212-memento/|7.6|Mark Richardson

So maybe Sub Pop signed songstress Rosie Thomas is Sarah McLachlan for the hipster haircut set; maybe her 2002 debut, <em>When We Were Small</em>, wasn't much more than mouthpiece of shy girls, given up on love, meant to flip boys off. If that's the case, it's arguably the cutest flying middle finger Sub Pop's ever seen (""So much for love, I guess/ I've been wronged but it's all right/ Cause I'm moving on/ I'm gonna drive over hills over mountains/ And canyons and boys that keep bringing me down""). Revisited, ""Bicycle Tricyle""'s still as gently lovely as it is inspiring (""I can't be the homecoming queen/ To every boy who falls in love with me""), and Thomas' voice is still the prettiest, honey-logged thing; but in the end, <em>When We Were Small</em> was little more than fleeting moments-- and followup <em>Only with Laughter Can You Win</em> fell into similar ruts.</p><p>
    
    Thankfully, Thomas, a former Seattle resident, recognized the danger in
    sounding like she does, and moved to L.A. to record her third Sub Pop
    release, If Songs Could Be Held, where inspiration was scheduled to
    strike, but passed her over. It's too bad nothing's new a third time
    around either, and Thomas-- gorgeous, emotive voice and all-- could
    still make for some teen sitcom backdrop, provided it's something
    like the late ""Dawson's Creek"". Maybe it's just that lives come in
    motifs, and recycle themselves, but talk of uncertain futures,
    homecoming queens, and outerwear needs no repeating. To its credit,
    ""Pretty Dress"" sounds unique-- kinda like Alanis Morisette doing
    ""Smooth Criminal""-- for better or worse. The effort's there, but when
    Thomas records ""Let It Be Me"" with Ed Harcourt, they end up
    floundering like a pair of white kids trying to pass as Billie
    Holliday and Louis Armstrong.</p><p>
    
    Last words of lines are too-easily guessable, but lyrics are best summed up in the familiar ones of ""Time Goes Away"": ""How do we make these moments last/ How do we get them to stay/ When everything passes and time goes away?"" It's as easy as rhyming ""crying"" with ""dying"" (see ""Death Came and Got Me"")-- as easy, maybe, as singer/songwriter stints come, requisite heartache aside. Still, time passing's the stuff of Virginia Woolf, and feelings like ""What can I say/ What can I do/ I'm still in love/ Why aren't you?"" and ""I remember what you used to feel like/ See how much has changed"" are basic but beautifully recognizable. There's the potential for something here; as of <em>If Songs Could Be Held</em>, it's yet unrealized.</p></div>"|8022.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8022-if-songs-could-be-held/|5.9|Rachel Khong

Like her hero Jim Morrison she wrote absurd verses more fit for a diary than a rock 'n' roll record, but could also follow them with lines that genuinely terrified.</p><p>
    
    Smith is the fountainhead for the punks, grrrls, rockers, and artists that have worn the shit out of this record in their most raw, needy hours, and who study and mimic everything she does with that voice-- which is all rends, tears, and bite marks, and no clean cuts. So it feels cheap not to put this fully on a pedestal, even if ""Land""'s meandering free verse makes a poor bookend for the enraged lust of ""Gloria"", and ""Elegie"" is a turgid closer. The flaws don't matter: <em>Horses</em> is an album of its time-- not because it's dated, but because it precariously captures a phase in Smith's life, and when all the raw elements fall in place, it feels miraculous.</p><p>
    
    Take ""Birdland"".  Just like in a jazz ballad, you can practically hear the band breathing in sync, and the slightest misjudgment would screw up the flow of Smith's surreal-- but straightforwardly powerful-- poem. But Lenny Kaye's guitar stretches effortlessly from post-funeral ballad to ecstatic, crazy fury, and Smith's performance is fierce and horribly unbeautiful. ""It was as if someone had spread butter on all the fine points of the stars/ 'Cause when he looked up they started to slip.""  Holy God is she a poet, and she hurls those words so accurately you want to scream and give up too.</p><p>
    
    That was 30 years ago. Today, Smith is unavoidably grown up, stuck in the canon, and well defined, and that's the artist we hear on the bonus disc in this package, a live track-by-track recital of <em>Horses</em> from the Meltdown Festival in London, this past June. She took the stage with old friends Tom Verlaine and Lenny Kaye on guitar and Jay Dee Daugherty on drums. They knocked the roof off-- but they don't match the original. ""Birdland"" is fitful and noisy, the segue from ""Lands"" back to a ""Gloria"" reprise seems like a cop-out, and Smith's wild poetess thing has settled into something a little more, hey, settled, like when she complains about how much time we spend on email and Blackberrys. ""Elegie"" takes far more meaning now that she has a list of loved ones to commemorate, like Robert Mapplethorpe, or her own husband. But play it back to back with the debut, and instead of a transformative force, you hear an old familiar voice cranking about George Bush.</p><p>
    
    Here's the thing about growing up: You don't know when it happens until later, but if you could catch it, it would be an amazingly quick moment-- like the point where you toss a ball in the air and it comes to a complete halt before it starts to fall to the ground. When we talk about youth and rock and roll, we're looking for that moment, of not being one thing or the other but of straddling both, of making mistakes that are above and beneath us, of a crest of energy as the ball gets ready to stop. We're talking about Smith changing from the twentysomething poet who decided to add guitar to her readings, and about an artist who can ape the last generation even as she spawns the next one. Or a performance like her old take of ""My Generation"", where she and John Cale knock the shit out of the by-then-ancient Who classic and Smith wraps with the wail, ""I'm so young, I'm so goddamn young""-- and she's still, barely, right.</p></div>"|7277.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7277-horses-30th-anniversary-legacy-edition/|9.4|Chris Dahlen

Electro-ironic soul music. Tongue-in-ass hip-hop. 
    DF-Ay-Ay-Ay! There are all sorts of wonky titles we could create to 
    describe Hot Chip, Joe Goddard and Alexis Taylor's perplexing electronic 
    British outfit. Hell, Goddard even looks like a mellow James Murphy. Their 
    full-length debut, <em>Coming on Strong</em>, was released in Europe more than a 
    year ago and warmly if not exasperatingly received. This slightly reconfigured 
    U.S. issue comes off at first like slight pop-- novelty even. But extended 
    listens reveal a goofy sincerity and romantic insouciance.</p><p>
    
    Hot Chip wear 
    influences like yellow Livestrong bracelets-- quietly, gallantly, but a 
    bit too noticeably. The Beach Boys, Prince, Ween, 60s girl groups, Dr. Dre, 
    Devo, Stevie Wonder, Madlib: Each hallmark has their moment, or idea borrowed. 
    The sum of inspiration isn't always rectitude, but 
    Hot Chip make it work for them. American heavyweight counterparts LCD 
    Soundsystem, a more forceful, knowing act, are clearly an influence, and ""Down 
    With Prince"" is Hot Chip's ""Daft Punk Is Playing at My House"". Admiration is 
    draped all over the production-- clipped hollow snares, noodly bass line, 
    funk keyboards-- and it's impressive that they don't get us rolling on the 
    ground with an opener like ""I'm sick of motherfuckers tryna tell me that 
    they're down with Prince."" The desperate Purple allegiance is pretty 
    apparent though. Someone oughta FedEx this record to Paisley Park. These 
    guys have the gall.</p><p>
    
    ""Keep Fallin'"" is the big scandal (""I'm like Stevie Wonder, but I can see 
    things."") and the funniest thing here. Built on a simple groove, Taylor, 
    whose fragile vocals guide much of the album, drops all kinds of bombs on 
    us. He nods at obvious lyrical influence Ween and daintily moans ""Give up 
    all you suckers, we the tightest motherfuckers and you never seen this 
    before, now."" The decision to end many of the unrhyming couplets with ""now"" 
    usually signals amateur. Hard to say how much Taylor and Goddard are lampooning things, though. The whole pop-satire gag is a tidy 
    little safety net to throw at critics. Chemical Brothers meets Art Brut or 
    something like that. The synthesis isn't perfect yet though, like on the groan-worthy ""Shining Escalade"". Some of the 
    melodies, the mortar of these attacks, are occasionally less than cocked, as 
    well: They're all simple, keyboard-based splashes and once in a while the 
    bottom of the paper bag gets too wet.</p><p>
    
    Lyrics are sung so delicately-- fogged up in the cushiness of 
    the production-- it's hard to make out the gangsta-lite gags. This 
    complicates the consternation over 
    whether these guys are ""serious"" or not. But in a world where 12-year-olds quote 50 Cent to their aunties at Thanksgiving 
    dinner, it's not hard to understand why Goddard, the rap fan with the 
    baritone, would consider dropping a chorus like the one on ""Playboy"": 
    ""Driving in my Peugeot, yeah yeah yeah/ 20-inch rims with the chrome now, 
    yeah yeah yeah/ Blazin' out Yo La Tengo, yeah yeah yeah."" Everyone likes 
    everything these days, Cam'Ron to Ira Kaplan. That's why a group like this 
    makes sense. It's what separates them from the likes of Goldie Lookin' Chain 
    and Kidz Bop.</p><p>
    
    Hot Chip's songs are lazy, or at least leisurely, but they're unafraid to 
    roll up on you in the most unsuspecting ways. ""Keep Fallin'"" ends with a 
    kazoo solo. ""Baby Said"" closes madly, with 30 seconds of honking Casio 
    and buckwild kick-drumming after four minutes of parlor room 
    mellifluousness. It's only really a tease, flirting with the concept of 
    upbeating their sound. Four on the floor quaking seems to be their next 
    goal. Hot Chip's new album, scheduled for a 2006 release, already has the 
    danceteria types excited just on the strength of lead single ""Over and Over"" 
    b/w with, fittingly, the DFA Remix of ""Just Like We (Breakdown)."" So, enjoy 
    serenity now. The backbeat reigns supreme soon.</p></div>"|4028.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4028-coming-on-strong/|8.0|Sean Fennessey

    and the Residents and every jackoff noise chancer in history part of ""the
    continuum,"" but people were pretty hostile to Men's Recovery Project when
    they crawled out of the wreckage of Born Against. As their early singles landed on the desks of ungrateful
    reviewers for <em>MRR</em> or <em>Heartattack</em>, people scoffed and snooted. There was the
    stink of ""art"" about it, you see. So the band did the only classy thing and
    recorded a Regan Youth tribute 7"" on Kill Rock Stars with lyrics about
    <i>The New York Times and riding in boats and aeroplanes.</i></p><p>
    From this reviewer's admittedly tweaked perspective, their <em>The Golden
    Triumph of Naked Hostility</em> compilation is one of the key documents of the 1990s. (So buy that first.) A track like ""Man, Urinating Laughter""--
    collected here on the LOL-iciously titled <em>The Very Best Of</em> along with
    40 other tracks-- is just what it says on the tin. There's the sound of
    piss hitting porcelain and some very creepy canned laughter. ""The Couch"" is
    a monologue about a living loveseat that absorbs the feelings and lives of
    those who sit upon it, only to expire, heartbroken. Between the cracked
    electronics, occasional flailing hardcore guitar, and Sam McPheeter's
    hectoring delivery (performing from under a trash bag or in a Revolutionary
    War costume), I can only imagine the audience's response when they opened
    for Autechre.</p><p>
    The work MRP and other acts on McPheeter's Vermiform label were vomiting up
    in the late 90s now feels very prescient in a world where Load is the new
    Merge (or something). ""Thaw Walt"" is about just that, as McPheeters imagines
    travelling to the underground Nazi bunker where Mr. Disney is frozen until
    such a time where he can take over the world. ""Get Your Dick Out of My Food""
    confronts an interloper who doesn't understand that ""it is to eat, not to
    saut\xDA your fucking meat."" Most of the time there's not much to the songs
    beyond what their titles imply, as on the cave-funk of ""Manhole"" or their
    chanted titular anthem. Some of the more, um, considered tracks from their
    Middle Eastern ""concept record"" <i>Boldies over Basra, like ""In Khartoum""
    and ""Egyptian Assassin"", feel out of place divorced from their original
    context and surrounded by stuff like a 30-second ode to one-time bass player
    Joe Preston.</i></p><p>
    ""Why We Are Lazy"" contains their non-manifesto: because the future goes to
    the bovine and the slothful, of course, and it's the wheat that gets the
    shaft and the chaff that always rises. If this was Entertainment Weekly or I
    wanted to be cheap, I'd pull out tired names-that-have-become-adjectives
    like ""Lynchian"" or ""Daliesque"". But for all their keeeeerazy, man
    affectations, MRP are shot through with a pathos and humanity that too often
    gets glossed over. As they summarized in a track title (from the aptly
    titled <i>Resist the New Way), their music was about ""The Awful People in
    the Empty City"", about trying to make sense of a wold where I'm not the
    crazy one, you're the crazy one. The whole damn system's out of order. Tilt. Check please.</i></p></div>"|5668.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5668-the-very-best-of/|8.2|Jess Harvell

He's prolific to the point where he's often docked points for not letting us forget about him for a minute, yet his output is rarely, if ever, disappointing or boring. To keep it fresh, he sidles up to the zeitgeist to hover over Madlib's cobwebs or paw at Dangermouse's fleet beats with Garfield mumbles. When he can't find a collaborator, he raps about his dinner or changes his costume. All that to say that it's usually his lyrics that are on display or in demand, his production getting less notice because the words are a maze. To remind everyone that he is indeed a formidable producer, Dumile quietly releases a volume of <em>Special Herbs</em> from time to time. Each is a collection of instrumentals, some previously-released backing tracks from his or other's albums, some unreleased beat sketches or stand-alone compositions. <em>9 + 0</em> feels more substantial than previous volumes, though, partially due to the upped quality of the unreleased material, but also because of the conspicuous selection of old tunes.</p><p>
    This latest edition starts off with ""Vinca Rosea""-- each song is named or renamed after a homeopathic medicine, usually one that soothes the bowels or eases depression-- an organ(ic) soul bouncer propelled by the mmm's and ohh's of a dusty female vocal loop, followed by the late-Doobie-ish piano and willowy keyboard line of ""Burdock Root"". Elsewhere, previously unreleased songs ""Bergamont"" and ""Yellow Dock"" prove Doom's taste for shrill brass and woodwind, with horns and clarinets crying all over chopped drums. But it's ""Coca Leaf"", the lone stimulatingly titled song, that makes one wonder how many epics Dumile's got stocked.</p><p>
    ""Coca"" is massive. It thunders down with a conflation of resolute gospel chants, a pummeling breakbeat, tumbling organ and piano hammers, and an outraged female vocal sample in an overt call-to-arms track without being all ""Jesus Walks"" on you. Hopefully, someone will see the title and do a drug rap over it, but it's so outsized that most rappers would cower. Or possibly, it's being saved for the secretive Ghostface/Doom union? That's the point with these things; they are both career retrospective and future teaser, Doom's chance to show his skills extending endlessly over the timeline.  Some instrumentals from past volumes resurfaced on subsequent records, but not all. See how fun Doom is? He's the rap Monty Hall.</p><p>
    The real gems on <em>9 + 0</em>, though, are the classic instrumentals, heretofore unavailable in compact disc or mp3 format. ""Podina"" is ""?"", a very rollerskate-y jam from Doom's first post-KMD album, <em>Operation Doomsday</em>. The beatboxed victory parade of King Geedorah's ""The Fine Print"" returns on ""Untitled (Meditation)"", and ""I Wonder"", also from Geedorah, extracts Hassan Chop's introspective lyrics, leaving the doleful strings standing in the raixC9 without an umbrellaÉ or galloshes. However, it's the final ""known"" beat that seals it. </p><p>
    This whole Doom, Viktor, Metal, King saga began with two brothers and a kid with a killer high-top fade. Back then, it was Zev Love X, DJ Subroc, and Onyx The Birthstone Kid. It was the scrawny Dumile brothers in kufis and the tall, smooth dude, kicking it to girls over a card table covered in essential oils and incense. Riding bikes in the neighborhood, Subroc sitting on the handlebars and Serch carving shit in his hair in one of the classic videos of early ""Yo!MTV"", Fab 5 early. I've listened to ""Peachfuzz"" from KMD's debut <em>Mr. Hood</em> literally 8 billion times, and I've listened to the instrumental ""Peach Extract"" a million more. It's inclusion here feels like closure, like Daniel Dumile is cool with it being out there, remembering it. Maybe it's not that big of a deal. Maybe it's just one of my favorite songs, and I like trying to remember all the lyrics. Regardless, it's here, and that's good.</p></div>"|5616.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5616-special-herbs-9-0/|7.0|Peter Macia

    years, you're familiar with Amina. Acting as ancillary members, the female quartet's
    instrumental accompaniment is partially responsible for the overwhelming
    power of <em>\xC1gaetis Byrjun</em>, <em>( )</em>, and <em>Takk...</em>, and they
    help their fellow Icelanders' translate such pointed grandiosity in
    concert. Whether fraying bows in the midst of escalating string
    frenzies or tapping on xylophones while scurrying around in
    the shadows, the foursome's contributions are undoubtedly
    ""background"" but also quite necessary. Take away Sigur Rós' stereotypically male audacity--
    the Eden-again vox and apocalypse crescendos-- and you're left with the sinewy foundations from which
    such crushing melodrama arises; you're left with Amina.
    Stripped of overstatement, this precious four-song debut EP from the new
    L.A.-based Worker's Institute label fits into the Múm-ified
    notion of modern Icelandic pop while offering some subtle shading
    and shaping of that notion.</p><p>
    All multi-instrumentalists, these four classically trained players tap
    into a sense of uncanny solace by way of precise phrasing and
    repetition throughout <em>AminanimA</em>. Utilizing traditional strings
    as well as a treasure trove of other stately-sounding tools including
    glockenspiels, bells and a glassophone, the group conjures clear-eyed
    sonic pastures that reward subtlety and reject crass adornment.
    ""Skakka"" is a soundtrack to a fairytale, but one that's decidedly
    Grimm; a crackling fire can be heard in the distance and
    Rumpelstiltskin's warped ramblings are almost palpable somewhere
    within the track's unsettling ambience. Melodies and countermelodies
    courtesy of several sprightly instruments cross over each other on
    ""Hemipode,"" which also features cooing vocals that only enhance its
    courteous gait. ""Fjarskanistan"" is the EP's most obvious Sigur Rós-lite
    moment with its longer running time and painstaking build from echoing
    chimes to echoing chimes-with-sweeping strings, but it's still more
    muted than their pals' most subdued dramatics.</p><p>
    There's an intrinsic beauty that courses through Amina's music and
    this introduction release enticingly summarizes it. <em>AminanimA</em>'s cautious
    atmospherics can sound toothlessly pleasant at points, yet the group
    largely escape such Enya-isms by lacing these tracks with an
    entrenched emotional resonance and haunting austerity that whispers
    and creeps. Working within a gauzy
    milieu and largely without the directness of a human voice, the
    quartet manage to sidestep crass whimsy and create pinhole worlds ripe with modest mystery.</p></div>"|491.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/491-aminanima-ep/|7.0|Ryan Dombal

    Mix 2005</i> collects, sequences, and beatmatches the better ones that
    the New York-based label commissioned for three of its primary artists:
    savant-noise trio the Black Dice, drizzly electro-funker the Juan
    Maclean, and dancerock flagship act LCD Soundsystem.  Later in the mix a krauty
    soundscape off Black Dice's <i>Broken Ear Record</i> called ""ABA""
    and a gorgeous unreleased Delia &amp; Gavin flutter ballad called ""#5"" rep
    as breather tracks for in-house mixers Tim Goldsworthy and Tim Sweeney,
    who turn in another typically smooth, effortless blend. People think
    DJing is easy because of these guys.</p><p>
    
    After that, we could talk about how four otherwise completely different
    artists sound at peace with one another on this mix-- about the phantom
    strand of gattaca that
    keeps them related (though DNA themselves may not be far off here) . But really, <i>Holiday Mix 2005</i> has less to do
    with the DFA, more with one small trend this year in dance music:
    strung-out, space-feeling disco-house and disco-house remixes, the
    patient, sometimes aimless explorations that dominated 2005's
    10 p.m.-12 a.m. stretch.</p><p>
    
    The kickoff means much: Goldsworthy and Luomo each stretch out Black
    Dice's impossibly compact ""Smiling Off"" like silly putty, the former
    with harder rockdrum sounds, the latter with trademark slick swaps and
    swoops. A testament to its density, Juan's ""Give Me Every Little Thing""
    appears here in four different incarnations, dubbed and drugged, clubbed
    and club'd. And in the case of LCD's ""Too Much Love"", remixers Rub 'N'
    Tug just let the disco-house track lose itself, here granting infinite
    space to the original's unsettling, claustrophobic vocal harmonies.</p><p>
    
    Stretch everything out like that, though, and the mix pretty much refuses
    momentum. The 48-minute run moves steady but stays still, if that makes
    sense. Only at the last seconds do Tim and Tim move into harder stuff:
    first Tiga and Jesper Dahlback's remix of ""Tribulations"", and finally
    into Soulwax's acidic take on ""Daft Punk Is Playing at My House"". That's
    when the party starts, really-- which makes <i>Holiday</i> something of
    a perfect, propitious calm.</p></div>"|2033.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2033-dfa-records-holiday-mix-2005/|7.5|Nick Sylvester

It was the ex-Whitehouse sound collagist and     current underground author himself who pointed Fernow out to me. Sotos     seemed a fitting facilitator for the handshake, considering the debt     Fernow owes Whitehouse for both his high-frequency noisemaking and the     linkage he shares with the group via his dark subject matter. For     instance, <i>Black Vase is decorated with photos of Fernow's girlfriend     posing in S&amp;M; gear, images of foggy/misty landscapes, and the Freudian     Buddhist quote, ""Desire is the root of all suffering.""

<p>That said, if there ever were to be a crossover in the harsh noise,     power-electronics scene, my     money would be on Prurient. Hanging with the likes of Macronympha,     Panicsville, Emil Beaulieau, Bloodyminded, Slogun, and Jessica Rylan,     the Bushwick-based one-man-band plays his     shows shirtless and, unlike many in the subterranean world of contact     mics and feed-smack, can actually pull it off. Brandishing microphones, he prostrates himself     before his amplifiers, wrestling     with sound-waves and noosed cables, more reminiscent of a tar-souled     Conor Oberst than an aging Wookie in black sweatpants.</p>
<p>Fernow's been at it a while. He started honing his assault in high     school in Wisconsin before relocating to Providence, R.I., and then     Brooklyn. This is his seventh full-length, or thereabouts, not     counting a million splits and cassettes, etc. As in the past, his     cocktail includes a heavily processed voice (shouting, growling),     electronics, and synthesizer. On <i>Black Vase</i>, there's also tribal     factory-cog percussion.</p>
<p><i>Black Vase is front loaded with the 15-minute ""Roman Shower"", a quavering     high-pitch flutter. It's not busy or big: Fernow weaves a spare     feedback strip that slips into your ear like hemlock. Even when it becomes something scruffier and the piece     takes on more strands, Fernow remains focused: The pitch increases,     but hardly fuzzes out-- the detailed tones are the whirl of a dental     drill. For the final three minutes, he blows more gusts of distortion     and then beneath it yowls, ""Two years of garbage/     zig zag to your center/ come back to me.""</i></p>
<p>The noise-zen focus on the longer tracks is admirable, but     Fernow's briefer blasts are more sugar-shocked: ""Silent Mary""     is thumping scream-o; ""Sorry Robin"" evokes     Throbbing Gristle committing hari-kari; ""Back Cuts"" pairs deep     percussion with Fernow's order, ""Face down/ On the floor""; and     ""Soft Crack"" ups the pain, sonically and otherwise, with ""Finger nails/ Riding boots/ Jalepeno pepper/ Kitchen floor."" Ouch.</p>
<p>Prurient toured with Wolf Eyes in September 2005 and, perhaps in     conjunction, Fernow released <i>The Warriors split CD on his own well     regarded Hospital Productions. For Wolf Eyes' two long tracks, ""The     Terror Tank"" and ""Human Animal"", the Ann Arbor trio doesn't partake     in their wicked-witch growls or humid jungle dub     centipede dissections. Instead, knobs spin into a grotto and just sorta suffocate. At 17 minutes,     ""The Terror Tank"" lurks within a dank cavern. ""Human Animal""'s 11 minutes ream Prurient-style     sounds like ring-tone feedback, electrocuted foil, decimated triangles. It's not Wolf Eyes' strongest showing, but it offers a fertile ambient nook.</i></p>
<p>Fernow's material for <i>The Warriors</i> was recorded in Providence in 2002;     in the liner notes he recommends playing it loud on an ""overcast     afternoon."" I've listened under those conditions, but also     at 3 a.m., and it's some of his most piercing. In general, the program's warmer     and more collagist than <i>Black Vase</i>-- because the pieces are shorter     (check out the booming 43-second burning star core quagmire, ""Rhythm     of Shovels""), there are more gradation shifts. The sound: a film     shutter exploding. Then there's ""Lime"" tripping like a pack of     corralled hell hounds stuck in a vat of lye. ""Ashen Morning Glory""'s     another choked cable of boom-hiss ear rot. For a noirish     rain-drenched thing, check out the finale, ""Stripped Swimsuit"". This     one's high on atmosphere-- the sound of water or, uh, blood on concrete-- with noise slowly sliding in subtly, for only a couple frames,     before the song goes away peacefully into the night.</p>
<p>Wolf Eyes is a bigger name than Prurient, so folks might run     immediately for <i>The Warriors</i> split. That's cool-- it's a solid     offering. But as mentioned previously, Prurient spits pure Whitehouse     <i>New Britain</i> noise, so if you're tossing off the noise-rock     training wheels for the first time, you might want to check out <i>Black     Vase, on which the added percussion offers     something to latch onto when you're wading     in Fernow's wave pool.</i></p></div>"|11808.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11808-black-vase-the-warriors/|7.4|Brandon Stosuy

Natalie Portman: ""I was proved
    fucking right!"" <em>Stubbs the Zombie</em>, the videogame, is a
    third-person cerebellum-gobbler starring Edward ""Stubbs"" Stubblefield,
    a long-slain traveling salesman hungry for revenge (and brains).
    Stubbs' tongue-cheeked horrorshow comes re-alive in a newsreel-grainy
    1959 ""city of the future"" called Punchbowl. <em>Stubbs the Zombie</em>,
    the soundtrack, reanimates innocent late-1950s and early-'60s pop
    classics with present-day noises from still-breathing Pitchfork review
    victims.</p><p>
    
    While video game music has grown increasingly vital-- spawning
    remixes, orchestral concert tours, and cover bands-- video game
    soundtrack albums have often stayed as stitched-together as the living
    dead. Discs might include instrumental suites (<em>Stubbs</em>
    progenitor <em>Halo</em>), ""inspired-by"" prog-metal (<em>Halo 2</em>), or
    vast assortments of licensed songs (<em>Grand Theft Auto</em>). While
    <em>Stubbs</em> isn't the first game soundtrack consisting of original
    pop/rock recordings-- earlier this year, <em>Tony Hawk's American
    Wasteland</em> challenged West Coast skate-punkers to exhume (and then
    attempt to cover) their punk forefathers-- it pairs a witty concept
    with mostly decent-or-better execution.</p><p>
    
    Undeath becomes the unfunny recordings best-- at least outside of a
    game setting. The Walkmen imbue the Drifters' ""There Goes My Baby""
    with their now-familiar windswept chill, restrained elegance echoing
    into raw anguish. Sock-hop pianos still kachink around the edges, but
    singer Hamilton Leithauser's soused rasp reaps greater pathos by
    omitting the dated ""whoa-oh-ohs"" of the heartbreaking original.
    Similarly, Death Cab for Cutie loses itself in the slow-dance
    sumptuousness of oft-covered ""Earth Angel"", Ben Gibbard's schoolboy
    tenor expressing the song's simple sentiment of affection better than
    it did the more death-obsessed material on <em>Plans</em>.
    Perennially overlooked, perennially Shins-compared Rogue Wave
    refashions Buddy Holly's ""Everyday"" with sad, subtle acoustic guitars
    invoking said comparisons-- better than the James Taylor version,
    even!</p><p>
    
    Still, <em>Stubbs</em>'s Punchbowl is a darkly ironic place (""Drink your
    fill of the future""). A number of songs nail the kitsch level
    appropriate given the game's gory, ""retro-futuristic"" setting. Chief
    among: Cake's understated ""Strangers in the Night"", with shameless
    schmaltzing, trumpet flourishes and a canned-sounding rhythm section.
    Flaming Lips could have recorded this delightful, surprisingly
    faithful ""If I Only Had a Brain"" in their sleep; from the sound of
    this rendition's cinematic flourishes, weird lucid-dream honks and
    munchkin giggles, maybe they did. <em>Stubbs</em>'s context makes the
    tune sinister despite Wayne Coyne's ignorant/blissful scarecrowing.
    Oranger has fun, too, with a crunchier version of ""Mr. Sandman"",
    bum-bum-bums included. The Raveonettes also did their sexed-up ""My Boyfriend's Back"" for this year's <em>Pretty in Black</em>, which weakens the soundtrack's claims about all-original content while strengthening its lineup. Too bad about the Dandy
    Warhols' nose-pinched underwater ""All I Have to Do Is Dream"", though.</p><p>
    
    Hey, Punchbowl ain't perfect (dude's snarfing brainstem, remember?)
    and neither is this soundtrack. Rose Hill Drive's Hendrixed-up,
    chops-flashing corpse-dragging of Johnny Kidd and the Pirates'
    Who-popularized ""Shakin' All Over"" is probably the worst offender.
    Phantom Planet offers up the album's lone new composition, ""The Living
    Dead"", and it's a sludgy, sneering rocker that sounds like it was
    commissioned for a video game soundtrack. OK one-liners, though:
    ""Here's some advice: Don't lose your head."" Plus on ""Lollipop"" you get
    to hear Ben Kweller do the ooh-lolly-lolly cheek-pop. Almost a reason
    to live. Again.</p></div>"|7898.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7898-stubbs-the-zombie-ost/|6.9|Marc Hogan

    barely heard. The other half, Adam Wiltzie, is off making rock records with
    Windsor for the Derby at the moment, so McBride has stepped out on his own.
    Instead of exploring other sounds, as his partner has, McBride
    opted to go even deeper into the quiet on his solo debut. <em>When the Detail
    Lost Its Freedom</em> is the sound of beauty replacing silence, as drones and
    small musical figures rise into the void and recede, creating a sort of
    oceanic pulse.</p><p>
    
    Sonically and emotionally, the result bears a fair resemblance to William
    Basinski's recent work (especially <i>The Disintegration Loops), but the
    compositions are much more directed and detailed. It's an album derived
    mostly from recordings of organic sound-- violins, trumpets, pianos,
    guitars-- but it takes those basic elements and fashions them into timbres
    that are hard to pinpoint through processing. As such, it's often difficult
    to tell what instrument a sound is emanating from, and the whole thing has a
    kind of far-away, aquatic patina, the aural equivalent of pictures of whales
    skimming below the surface in daylight.</i></p><p>
    
    Though the sound, instrumentation, and harmonic development vary from track
    to track, the basic premise of the music seems modeled on
    natural rhythms, like heartbeats and breathing, especially the latter. There
    are moments that sound like a grand piano heaving a sigh, exhausted from
    playing etudes all day. One exception stands way out from the rest, though:
    ""Our Last Moment in Song"" is a big, dreamy slo-core plodder moved along by
    rhythmic piano, slowly changing chords, whale-song guitars, and beyond-blissed vocals, mostly wordless. It's a little
    jarring coming in the middle of this record, actually, but it fits
    the tone if not the apparent mission of the rest of the tracks.</p><p>
<em>When the Detail Lost Its Freedom</em> is essentially an exploration of the
    slightly more varied territory immediately adjacent to the realm of majestic
    drone Stars of the Lid last left us in on the <em>Tired Sounds of Stars of the
    Lid</em>. In it, he finds immense, enveloping beauty and the true power of a
    whisper.</p></div>"|5669.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5669-when-the-detail-lost-its-freedom/|7.7|Joe Tangari

Guitarist Dave Stone left shortly after the band's first full length and they've decided not to replace him, raising their own sonic hell with bass, keyboards, and vocals alone.</p><p>
    
    The band do a thorough job of exploring the outermost edges of its new limitations, and is perhaps even more abrasive here than on its previous LP. The first half of <em>Ruins</em> consists of brief, cacophonous pieces of avant-garde soul-pop reeking of poverty and madness; the second half is an extended jam, testing the limits of the band's ability and the listener's patience as singer Valentine Hussar warns and begs for the ""revolution van"" to come.</p><p>
    
    The band has the instrumental prowess to back up the noise. The electric piano fills every possbile open space, complementing the rhythm while acting as a divining rod for dissonant incidental noise. Drummer Ron Avila flips tempos with ease and lays down sophisticated polyrhythms, though he's just as adept at locking into a primal groove. ""Brothers and Others"" is a concentrated taste of what they're capable of, moving fluidly from unpredicitable noise to headbang-worthy ryhthms without warning.</p><p>
    
    Valentine's lyrics are like the babbling of a coma victim who woke up after 30 years and just cracked: easy riders, black cobras, Wattstax, Evel Knievel, towels with Elvis' name, and <em>Jesus Christ Superstar</em> flood her waking nightmares. Per ""Revolution Van"", she's self-admittedly ""full moon crazy."" She's a strong vocalist who ends up being the weak link here, with a wildly exaggerated diva act that doesn't quite cement the apocalyptic soul aesthetic her lyrics suggest, but is far too strong to idly complement these free-wheeling compositions. It's a distraction, a fight between musicianship and showmanship that <em>Rollin' in the Ruins</em> never resolves.</p><p>
    
    There are only fleeting moments, like the first half of ""W.S.T.P"", when the band slows down and follows Valentine's lead, with a lurching understated beat that's gradually, systematically dismantled. The 14-minute closer, ""Don Quixote &amp; I"", is the record's most minimal moment, anchored by a throbbing drum loop while reprising ""Revolution Van"" in it's lyrics (and pretty thoroughly at that-- I got tired of hearing the titular phrase around the ninth minute.) While the first nine or 10 minutes almost qualify as cabaret, an instrumental version would be even better: After hypnotically hammering past the point where most listeners would get restless, the drum pattern variates, revealing that maybe they were live all along. </p><p>
    
    If you're a listener who thrives on this kind of orchestrated chaos, maybe you'll have the taste for this discordant vocalist/band conflict; to me, it sounds a like-minded trio rushing towards the same end without waiting up for one another.</p></div>"|3429.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3429-rollin-in-the-ruins/|6.9|Jason Crock

<p>Loads of acts still work along these woozy, languorous lines, and loads of acts traced the lines out before these turn-of-the-90s groups came along.

No, revisiting these bands is a little like trading in some modern guitar-pop for a Beatles record: The first shot doesn't sound dated, or less sophisticated, and it doesn't necessarily seem ""better,"" or more original, either. It's just a workable, fully-formed thing on its own, which might be why most of the acts that feel like Slowdive today-- say, Ladytron, Lali Puna, Broadcast, or M83-- are coming at that mood and atmosphere from very different directions.</p>
<p>A year ago, we were saying roughly the same thing about <i>Catch the Breeze</i>, a Slowdive compilation that was more Portable Summary than Best Of. Two discs, packed with long stretches from the band's three albums and most of the highlights from their singles and EPs-- this was a big enough chunk of their five-year career to make it easy to take a pass on the rest. Now comes the complete follow-through: remastered reissues of all three LPs, in full. The first two, <i>Just for a Day</i> and <i>Souvlaki</i>, come in the now-standard two-disc format, packaged with a lot of the same extras that already wound up on the compilation; the last, 1995's long out-of-print <i>Pygmalion</i>, comes back to life in its original form, which is probably the best and biggest news here. Yeah, yeah: Reissues, duplication, hard-earned money, blah blah blah. But in the long term, all those kids you see picking their noses everywhere will have two solid options for investigating this band-- the short way or the long one.</p>
<p>The gist of it: Frontman Neil Halstead has remained the same kind of songwriter throughout his career, from Slowdive's shoegazing to Mojave 3's dreamy ""country"" (someone <i>did</i> try to beat Mazzy Star!) to his solo folk; his songs are warm, uncomplicated, full of some strange weepy longing, and slowed down to a narcotic drawl. What's surprising is how many different ways he's found to present them. The best starting point is 1993's <i>Souvlaki</i>, already a bit of an Essential Slowdive in itself. Across this record, the band kicks up a swirl that matches Halstead's sleepwalking pop perfectly: Guitars stretch and swirl in slow-motion layers, and the vocals seem to be calling desperately out of them, even when they're just lazy chants. This stuff manages to be both pillowy-soft and passionately deep-- shades of the way My Bloody Valentine could blur heaviness into an out-of-focus lull, or the way Galaxie 500's drowsy strum could come out with a fist in the air.</p>
<p>A significant chunk of <i>Souvlaki</i> wound up on <i>Catch the Breeze</i>, but anyone hoping the remainder was forgettable is out of luck: Even as collaborator Brian Eno led this album off into a few dub-deep explorations, Halstead's pop songwriting hit a peak, and the album's tracks wound up good-as-""Alison"" almost straight across. (Same goes for the cover of ""Some Velvet Morning"" on the bonus disc-- just Slowdive putting the swirl on someone <i>else</i>'s dreamy, narcotic country songwriting.) It's a slightly different scenario for the band's first album, 1991's <i>Just for a Day</i>, which the anthology ignored in favor of the early singles and radio sessions that now stock its bonus disc. Not so surprising: It's a straight line from those singles and EPs to the sound of <i>Souvlaki</i>, whereas <i>Just for a Day</i> is more of a sweet-dream detour. It was in 1991 that the <i>NME</i> said Slowdive could ""make Cocteau Twins resemble Mudhoney,"" and the fluffy sprawl of this record seems to be trying to prove them right. There's a lot less weight to it, and if anything in Slowdive's catalogue will seem dated, it's the overgroomed production on these songs. Still, there's something terrifically oceanic about it-- tracks start out softly floating and then whip themselves up into gorgeous, overbearing squalls.</p>
<p>Most important, though, is the reissue of <i>Pygmalion</i>, which should knock down the album's eBay asking price by a good fifty bucks. This is a detour of the best sort, and a Slowdive album in name only: With this record, Halstead pushed the rest of the band to the sidelines, dropped the notion of a ""band"" altogether, and recorded at least two tracks that I can't imagine being rivaled-- ambient pop dreams that have more in common with post-rock like Disco Inferno than shoegazers like Ride. Some of it is all woozy layers: spare touches of guitar, vocal phrases looping and phasing around one another, slow-rolling sampled drums. Some of it takes on the warmth and empty-room minimalism of the ""folk"" Halstead would go on to make. More than just ""some"" of it appears on <i>Catch the Breeze</i>-- five tracks out of nine, from an album that's not exactly consistent. But the sound here is so singular that's much better appreciated in album form, failures and all, and there's good no reason an album this fascinating shouldn't be in print.</p>
<p>The fluffy-sweet turn-of-the-90s record: That one is fans-only. The pop-rock record with the influential swoon: Anyone whose rock tastes run to the ""dreamy"" needs it, or at least needs ""Alison"" popping up on the mp3-player shuffle. The post-rock obscurity that's worth $12 just for ""Blue Skied an' Clear"": You won't find anything else quite like it. Swooning, washed-out rock from the 90s-- why should these reissues matter?

    obvious. Should the Darkness frontman be so
    metaphysically unfortunate as to be cast down into the
    fiery depths, Lucifer would merely have to inundate
    Hawkins with reviews and articles declaring his band
    to have been nothing more than a novelty act, a joke,
    a piss-take. Flames and pitchfork-stabs the singer
    can handle, but being historically slotted next to
    Weird Al, Rappin' Rodney, and Ray Stevens would be the
    ultimate torture.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately for Hawkins, there's still a very real
    possibility of him experiencing this Hell on Earth,
    despite the Darkness' surprising
    one-year slingshot from obscurity to worldwide fame. 
    Even with millions of albums sold, the cynical legions
    still question the seriousness of the Darkness'
    intentions, often confusing the sense of humor
    apparent in the band's songs and videos with
    insincerity and winking satire. But all the
    discussion of falsettos and leotards misses the
    obvious: If the Darkness were anything less than
    completely honest devotees of the large-scale rock
    they're determined to resurrect, their music wouldn't
    be so successful or so unconditionally welcomed by the
    <em>Pyromania</em> tour-shirt-wearers that pack their live
    shows.</p><p>
    
    Thankfully, as the album title and cover image less
    than subtly suggest, the Darkness haven't forced
    themselves into an unwilling seriousness to appease
    the skeptics. But the sound of <i>One Way Ticketto Hell...and Back makes
    some concessions towards respectability, emphasizing
    the most critically reputable of their triumvirate of
    arena-rock influences: Queen, Thin Lizzy, and Def
    Leppard. By recruiting producer Roy Thomas Baker, the
    man behind the board on classic Queen albums like
    <em>Sheer Heart Attack</em> and <em>A Night at the Opera</em>, the
    Darkness set themselves up to both expand their sound
    and gently remind short-memory critics that pop-metal
    has roots deeper than the Hair Metal Era.</i></p><p>
    
    Does it succeed? Well, despite a
    choir and pan-flute album intro, there's no ""Bohemian
    Rhapsody"" to be found here, so don't get your hopes
    too high. Baker helps Hawkins slather more strings and
    horns onto his compositions than on
    <em>Permission to Land</em>, though none of the songs fully lift off into the kind of gigantic
    symphonic-rock territory that Queen reached at their
    peak. In fact, the best use of the full orchestration
    comes on what might be <em>One Way Ticket</em>'s most humble
    (and best) number, the simple hit-and-run pop song
    ""Girlfriend"", which adds giddy strings verging on
    disco to Hawkins' manic falsetto. Elsewhere Baker
    makes like Michael Kamen in conducting orchestral
    embellishments to ""Seemed Like a Good Idea at the
    Time"" or ""Blind Man"", but nothing hits the ""November
    Rain"" epic heights the band so desperately wants to
    reach.</p><p>
    
    On the other hand, Baker's primary contribution may
    have been to enable Hawkins' quest to set the
    world record for most multi-tracked vocals, as <em>One Way
    Ticket</em> uses the ""magnficio"" effect on nearly every
    track. When applied sparingly, the Choir Hawkins
    works well-- the chorus of ""Is It Just Me?"" benefits
    from the effect's metallic sheen, while it adds
    bombastic punctuation to lead single ""One Way Ticket"". But in the wrong spots-- paging ""Dinner Lady Arms""
    and ""English Country Garden""-- 20 tracks of
    full-blast falsetto is something less than
    ear-pleasing, and certainly won't persuade anyone
    already frightened off by Hawkins' head voice.</p><p>
    
    The majority of the tricks, however, come off
    as cosmetic distractions, attempts to hide that Hawkins' songwriting hasn't grown since <em>Permission to Land</em>. Many of <i>One
    Way Ticket's songs have the common second-album curse
    of being too closely related to siblings from the
    debut, and tracks that explore new territory come off
    undercooked (""Hazel Eyes"") or overripe (""Bald""). The
    material also suffers from a comparative lack of
    humor; nothing here is so amusing as ""Friday Night"" or
    ""Growing on Me"", unless you count the no less than
    three follicle-obsessed tracks present, perhaps a sly
    reference to their pigeon-holing as hair-metal
    practitioners.</i></p><p>
    
    It may benefit the Darkness to cheat over Queen's
    shoulder even further on these points; after all, <em>A
    Night at the Opera</em> was famous for having everything
    from mini-operettas to fey pop minuets to heavy-metal
    thunderstorms. The band would do well to learn that
    they don't need to always be cranked up to 11 to
    convince people of their honest intentions, that they
    can only ride the non-dynamics of full-on excess so
    far before their music all starts to blur together
    into one big sheet of multi-tracked falsetto screech. 
    Otherwise, the band runs the risk of becoming the joke
    they insist they aren't, honest intentions or no. 
    Beezelbub has a devil set aside for thee, Justin
    Hawkins.</p></div>"|2525.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2525-one-way-ticket-to-helland-back/|6.5|Rob Mitchum

Do they have Olan Mills in Sweden? Is it haunted? The eyes just follow you. But visions of some wainscoted dystopia where bands wear turtlenecks and play acoustic Kraftwerk medleys are dispelled as ""That's How You Drive Me"" pops in like a pacifier, with all of the comfort and none of the sucking. Its gauzy lilt establishes the album's tone, an effortlessly levitating pastiche of Bacharachian flourishes and precious anorak harmonies, with the faintly lingering musk of something pulled out of mothballs.</p><p>
    Major chords are accustomed to shouting, but this is how they sound when they whisper. Bandleader Johan Angergård makes sure the music doesn't get too placid to make an impression by embedding little brain-tattoos into the songs, like the giddy handclaps on ""Do What You Wanna Do"" and hipster-dork fingersnaps on ""This Heart Is a Stone"". This is a sterling example of modern twee with everything in its right place, from the flawless melodies to the droll lyrics: ""They say your middle name is trouble/ But I know it's Caroline."" Comparisons to Belle &amp; Sebastian and Camera Obscura are both inevitable and unfair, since Acid House Kings predates both. Still, it doesn't help any that the rhythm guitar on ""That's How You Drive Me"" sounds exactly like a fuller version of B&amp;S;'s ""Dog on Wheels"", or that the lead guitar on ""This Heart Is a Stone"" sounds a lot like the one on Camera Obscura's ""Before You Cry"". And how many writers have beaten me to Acid House Kings of Convenience? Whatever; that all this modern naïve-pop sounds the same is part of its appeal, although it's possible that Acid House Kings is a little more calculating than it would appear.</p><p>
    Wearing their hearts on the tongues in their cheeks, Acid House Kings presents its achingly earnest songs with such seamless artifice that it approaches performance art. It doesn't stop with the ghastly cover; the first edition of the album comes with a bonus DVD containing three videos and a <em>karaoke version of the album</em>. The karaoke speaks for itself-- realize that you can't sing after all as you watch the band play ping-pong and pull shots of espresso. It's the videos that are of interest. Somewhere between Warhol and ""Laugh-In"", their stark pastels recreate a time that might have sort of existed but probably didn't, when everyone wore cardigans and comb-overs; danced stiltedly to fey pop music; read Marx for pleasure. Post-irony or the new sincerity? Either way, the surface of the presentation (like that of the songs) is smooth as glass-- watching Julia Lannerheim smile beatifically while singing about getting her heart broken on ""7 Days"" (Amy Millan fans: This song owns you), nonchalantly dancing while her bandmates ham it up behind her, is pretty unsettling. But the simplicity of the video imbues her with a sort of iconic presence, like she's every girl who ever danced to a sad song. So what, like, Plato meets the Lucksmiths? The tragic and the adorable vie for attention, which, in this genre, is just par for the course.  </p></div>"|490.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/490-sing-along-with-acid-house-kings/|7.7|Brian Howe

Listening to the 10 sepia-toned folk songs on its debut, <em>Stay Close</em>, you can almost hear some carnival barker loudly exhorting midwaygoers to step right up and see <small>THE BOY WHO SINGS WITH THE VOICE OF A GIRL</small>. Inside the tent sit a stage, an old microphone, and an unassuming man named Joel Thibodeau gently plucking an old guitar. None of it would strike anyone as out of the ordinary...until Thidodeau opens his mouth to sing. From that masculine frame emanates a woman's voice, one that doesn't just hit the higher registers like some Appalachian castrati, but possesses an assertive feminine lilt reminiscent of Laura Cantrell or Iris DeMent.</p><p>
    
    But this isn't the typical androgyny of glam, which has no freight in the Americana traditions Death Vessel adopts. Gender isn't an issue inherent in the band's music, but is projected onto it by listeners and passively undiscouraged by the artist himself. Thibodeau-- who plays most of the instruments on the album-- doesn't write from a female perspective-- or from a male perspective either; on <em>Stay Close</em> the point of view is deliberately clouded by the delivery, which adds a layer of mystery to every note. As complex and compelling as it is, this aspect of Death Vessel proves as much a liability as an asset, often suggesting the mere novelty of a physical feat rather than actual artistry. On a few songs-- most notably the jaunty openers ""Mean Streak"" and ""Later in Life Lift""-- Thibodeau's vocal delivery sounds like an end in itself, but more often it serves the purposes of his precisely crafted melodies and obscurely out-of-time lyrics, melding nicely into the mix of acoustic guitars, banjo, fiddle, and organ.</p><p>
    
    From the hand-drawn cover art to the history-bound, occasionally impenetrable lyrics-- ""The load is unneat, sprawling oddly/ J-ing the stern, pelicanly,"" he sings on ""Blowing Cave""-- <em>Stay Close</em> has an antiquated style reminiscent of the 1999 movie <em>Wisconsin Death Trip</em>, which reenacts 19th century news stories about wintry deaths and rural despairs. Occasionally this atmosphere sounds studied and rehearsed, but moments like the coda of ""Nothing Left to Bury"" and the menacing drum-guitar interplay on ""Deep in the Horchata"" suggest a creative investment that transcends put-on airs. A mortal dread, played out with tensely intertwined guitar lines and gusts of feedback, shadows ""Blowing Cave"" and ""Tidy Nervous Breakdown"", making even the capriciousness of upbeat songs like the bluegrass ""Mandan Dink"", about a leisurely day at a place called Picnic Rock, seem precarious. </p><p>
<em>Stay Close</em> hits its stride on the last three songs, starting with his spacious cover of Townes Van Zandt's ""Snow Don't Fall"". On ""Deep in the Horchata"" he scratches out a melody on fiddle to echo his own vocals, as Daneil Mazone's drums stitch everything together. ""White Mole"" ends the album with a nearly instrumental coda, as Thibodeau's soft ooh's usher listeners out of his world and back into the hubbub of the midway.</p></div>"|2632.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2632-stay-close/|7.2|Stephen M.

By the late 1990s, most fans of the genre's second wave were abandoning it. Many of the best bands had split up, while the handful that were left were moving toward a more straightforward pop rock sound. But just as it appeared over, the scene suddenly exploded, giving birth to an entire new generation of slick, generic, mall-store neo-emo. It's like the bartender yelled last call, the house lights came on, and then at the last minute, he decided to keep the club open all night serving Cokes. So now, 20 years after Rites of Spring's only full-length album was released, we've arrived at Panic! at the Disco's <em>A Fever You Can't Sweat Out</em>.</p><p>
    
    Where does one begin to describe this steaming pile of garbage? You've already seen the ridiculous name, so let's try a few of song titles on for size. Track two is called ""The Only Difference Between Martyrdom and Suicide Is Press Coverage"", and it's followed by ""London Beckoned Songs About Money Written By Machines"". If those don't quite do it for you, check out ""I Write Sins Not Tragedies"", or my personal favorite, ""Lying Is the Most Fun a Girl Can Have Without Taking Her Clothes Off"".</p><p>
    
    But of course, the asinine song titles and the moronic band name have nothing on the actual songs. The usual guitar, bass, and drums are augmented by drum machine beats and synths that would be more at home blaring over the P.A. at your local gym than in anything one might consider enjoyable music. The production, handled by Matt Squire, a guy who is certainly no stranger to radio-friendly emo, is slick and polished. Vocalist Brendon Urie's impassioned, warbling vocals are so strained it's as if he might just burst into tears at any moment. This poor guy's heart must get broken on a daily basis or something. And if it wasn't bad enough, someone convinced him to add some fancy effects on a track or two that make it sound like someone is lightly karate chopping him across the throat while he sings.</p><p>
    
    The lyrics are just the sort of vague teen heartache you'd expect. In ""Camisado"", Urie croons, ""You're a regular decorated emergency/ The bruises and contusions will remind you what you did when you wake,"" sliding up to a falsetto while keyboards shimmer behind him. In ""Time to Dance"", which utilizes some sort of poorly realized gun-as-a-camera metaphor, he belts out, ""When I say shotgun, you say wedding/ Shotgun/ Wedding"", and ""Give me envy/ Give me malice/ Give me attention/ Give me a break."" Yeah, you and me both, kid. </p><p>
    
    It's sad that this is what emo has become. The genre's always had some irritating characteristics, but this newest batch of heartbroken heartthrobs has managed to build their careers solely out of those characteristics. The whining, the emotionally exposed lyrics, and the passionate choruses are there, but there's no sincerity, creativity, or originality.</p></div>"|6586.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6586-a-fever-you-cant-sweat-out/|1.5|Cory D.

They also bled people. However, neither of those nostrums tops the absurdity of Morcheeba dubbing their first sans-Skye Edwards album as <i>The Antidote. After a string of increasingly flawed LPs, the enticing siren Edwards bolted, leaving the schlubby Godfrey brothers in the dust with their mediocre backing music. So how do Paul and Ross replace one of the sexiest voices of the past 10 years? They throw in former Noonday Underground singer Daisy Martey; an Angela Lansbury replacing a Marilyn Monroe.</i></p><p>
    Not to start a fight, but Edwards possessed a soulful purr that wooed the staunchest critics into penning bizarrely detailed sex fantasy reviews. Martey is a hammed-up Natalie Merchant. Even worse, the Godfreys curb their toasted Internet Caf electronica for tuckered-out 1960s and 70s nostalgia. We all threw tomatoes when 2002's  <em>Charango</em> killed our high, but now even that poorly rolled joint delivers the far-out vibes that the painfully sober <i>Antidote lacks.</i></p><p>
    Opener ""Wonders Never Cease"" doubly offends with its seemingly self-important title and hokey Edie Brickell artsiness. ""Ten Men"" only continues the bohemian posturing, meshing Renaissance Faire guitar lines with a slack-jawed alt-country tempo. I mean, the whole thing has the professionalism of Michelle Branch. Don't fret though faithful ""trigger hippies,"" you'll still get your psych, only now it's watered down, attached to the beginning of tracks as curt snippets of yesteryear. Hear that sitar? Of course you don't, it stopped playing when the hunky tonk guitars came in.</p><p>
    Try as you might, searching for vestiges of the ol' Morcheeba is futile. Press releases try to plug this album as some freewheeling journey back in time, peppered with sharp-toothed blues and bouncy Bacharach melodies. Fat chance-- Martey's got neither the bite nor brio for such deft reincarnation. Sadly, this <em>is</em> your mama's Morcheeba, totally sanitized and sexless, even when supposedly tapping the era of drugs, rebellion, and free love. They could've at least changed the band's name, for legacy's sake. Somewhere, Skye Edwards must feel as if she was just ejected from a burning plane.</p></div>"|5427.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5427-the-antidote/|2.7|Adam Moerder

This seems to be an injustice on par with the Sony rootkit fiasco and the cancellation of ""Arrested Development"". Lekman is charming. He writes orchestral pop songs that swoon like silent movie damsels in distress. He rhymes ""chili"" with ""chilly."" The Swedish singer/songwriter hasn't been in a relationship for four years. Blaming the music business for his non-existent love life, he recently threatened to quit releasing records to become a telemarketer.</p><p>  Somebody hook this guy up with Nerve Personals quick-- we need to keep him around. <em>Oh You're So Silent Jens</em>, his new collection of previously released singles and B-sides, is a marvel of pure songcraft. Clichés unravel, traditional structures break down and build back up again, unpretentious witticisms sparkle. And then there are the sonics of the thing: lo-fi Phil Spector room dividers of sound, unexpected samples, and Lekman's rich, cavernous monotone.</p><p>  Lekman is often compared to Stephin Merritt (deadpan delivery, debt to Tin Pan Alley), Morrissey (melodrama, dry humor), Jonathan Richman (naiveté, simple language), and Belle and Sebastian (flowery arrangements, twee sensibility). All of these comparisons are dead on, and Lekman is worthy of the kind of slobbering devotion slathered on these artists. Granted, his 2004 debut album, <em>When I Said I Wanted to Be Your Dog</em>, was a tentative first step, relying too heavily on unadulterated cheese-- but <em>Oh You're So Silent Jens</em> is cheese, chocolate, strawberries, and something tangy to wash it down with.</p><p>  Take ""Maple Leaves"", two versions of which bookend the disc. An exploration of the difficulties of communication between men and women, it glides on pillowy strings, tearjerker harp flourishes, stately tympani, girl-group backing oohs, and celebratory wedding bells. He gets away with groan-worthy lines like, ""If you don't take my hand/ I'll lose my mind completely/ Madness will finally defeat me,"" not just on the strength of a strong melody and keen production sense, but by following it with one of the album's great signature lyrical twists: ""She said it was all make believe/ But I thought she said maple leaves."" Lekman winks through his tears. ""And when she talked about a fall/ I thought she talked about Mark E. Smith."" </p><p>  A diligent student of American and UK indie pop, Lekman knows exactly where he fits in the world-historical timeline, and he splatters his influences all over his songs. ""Maple Leaves"" borrows from the lush source material for the Avalanches' ""Since I Left You"". The fantastic ""Black Cab"" wallows luxuriously in loneliness (""You don't know anything/ So don't ask me any questions/ Just turn the music up/ And keep your mouth shut"") and samples both Belle and Sebastian and the Left Banke. On ""F-word"", Lekman ties a piece of Arab Strap's ""Kate Moss"" to stray cats pleading outside his Gothenburg window. ""Pocketful of Money"" is a spare symphony of finger snaps, pithy piano and bass melodies, and Lekman's pledge to spend a month's salary on a girl he just met who turns his legs to spaghetti-- but then Calvin Johnson's deeply intoned ""I'll come running with a heart on fire,"" snagged from Beat Happening's ""Gravedigger Blues"", crashes in unexpectedly. This off-key intrusion has the potential to be a deal-breaker, but Lekman instead turns it into a lovely counterpoint to his own soaring echo of the phrase.</p><p>  Like all love affairs, <em>Oh You're So Silent Jens</em> isn't perfect. The tracks from last year's <em>Rocky Dennis</em> concept EP are a mushy mess, and the plodding, doleful solo piano ballad ""Sky Phenomenon"" is only saved by two brilliant lines: ""At this time of year/ It's like someone spilled a beer/ All over the atmosphere,"" and, ""But I would not be accepted/ 'Cause I can't dance the funky chicken."" Lekman's faithful cover of Television Personalities' ""Someone to Share My Life With"" (""that someone could be you"") is the kind of thing that makes women roll their eyes and hop onto the back of a motorcycle driven by Tommy Lee.</p><p>  Which brings us back to the true source of Lekman's girl problems. It isn't the industry's fault that he can't find true love-- if anything, the kind of exposure his music has brought should be more effective than the best personal ad. But then, maybe his lack of a girlfriend isn't such a tragedy. As much as us ladies might fantasize about being saviors to wounded butterflies like Lekman, the reality of actually sharing a life with a guy whose desperation is so public is fairly unappealing. Who really wants a song like ""Julie"" (appearing here in jubilant, hollow-drummed remix form) written about her, even if it contains the couplet, ""Oh Julie, meet me by the vending machine/ Oh Julie, I'm gonna buy you a wedding ring""? And does Lekman truly desire a nice, boring, healthy relationship? If he found The One and lived happily ever after, he wouldn't have anything to write about.</p><p> </p></div>"|4970.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4970-oh-youre-so-silent-jens/|8.5|Amy Phillips

Their mixes piled R. Kelly, the Clash, Cash Money Millionaires, and Baltimore club atop each other with no regard for smooth transitions, genre boundaries, or copyright law.  DJs Diplo and Low Budget used roughly 200 tracks on the mix-- the result was a deliriously anarchic mess.</p><p>
    
    Two years later, Diplo is no longer an outsider. He and M.I.A. are on some new-millennium power-couple shit, he's turned baile funk into a hipster cause celebre, and he's worked with guys like Vybz Kartel and Kano. More importantly, you can go out any night of the week in New York and hear DJs mix Southern gutter-rap into new-romantic synthpop. Diplo often gets dissed as a carpet-bagging dilettante, but he's ultimately made clubland safe for carpet-bagging dilettantes like, um, me. So it's appropriate that the London club Fabric would invite Diplo to contribute to its <em>Fabriclive</em> mix series.  What compelled Diplo to turn in his most obvious, placid mix yet is another matter.  <em>FabricLive 24</em> features plenty of amazing music and finds some inspired connections, but the great thing about Diplo has always been his ecstatic embrace of chaos, and we don't get a whole lot of that here.</p><p>
    
    What we do get is the less-talked-about side of Diplo, the guy who racks up clothing-label sponsorships like notches on his belt. There's not much heavy, dirty shit on <em>FabricLive 24</em>; Diplo instead focuses on frisky, glinty electro. He sticks hard to genres that fit this side of his aesthetic (new wave, baile funk, classic house) while mostly tossing out the bits that don't (rap, Baltimore club). Copyright law probably has a lot to do with this; it's Diplo's first commercially available mix, and he certainly can't afford to jam in tracks the way he does on his underground sets.  Additionally, he's going for a European audience here, more schooled in rave than rap, and it shows; he's gotten it into his head that a DJ set should tell a story rather than just build momentum.  Problem is, he doesn't seem to have a story to tell.</p><p>
    
    The first third of the mix is dominated by a long, unbroken set of 80s electropop tracks (Cybotron, Yazoo, Debbie Deb) which, while uniformly great, are so thematically close to each other that they grow monotonous. When he segues into harder, raunchier stuff (Cajmere's acid-house classic ""Percolator"", Ludacris' bounce-twerk classic ""What's Your Fantasy?""), he does it by way of watery click-house tracks like Solid Groove's ""This Is Sick"". Later, a baile funk mini-set builds up intensity nicely for the snarl-grime energy-bomb of Jammer's ""Destruction VIP"", only to deaden its own momentum with the Cure's undanceable ""Lovesong"". And it would've been a great idea to end a dance mix with a mopey, meditative Cat Power jam if Tim Sweeney hadn't already done the exact same thing a year ago.</p><p>
    
    At its worst, <i>Fabriclive 24 is a haphazard and repetitive mix of a bunch of great tracks-- which is still not a bad thing. But it also gives us one tantalizing glimpse of what it could be when Diplo mixes Outkast's ""B.O.B."" into Le Tigre's ""Deceptacon"": two frantic, desperate, furious dancefloor anthems right on top of each other, both songs feeding on each other and finding a sense of ecstatic liberation. My jaw dropped when he pulled off the same transition at Intonation, and it nearly did again here. If this one moment of beautiful insanity overshadows the rest of Diplo's fun, competent mix CD, maybe that should tell him he needs to be doing fewer fun, competent mix CDs and making more moments like that happen.</i></p></div>"|2572.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2572-fabriclive-24/|6.8|Tom Breihan

    consciousness primarily for two things: the ""Theme from Shaft"", and his
    recurring role as an over-sexed school cafeteria chef on ""South Park"", where
    he essentially poked fun at his own lover-man image. As much as they've
    become cultural touchstones, these two things hardly epitomize the man's
    career or indicate the length of the shadow he cast on r&amp;b.; Here was a guy
    who cut a few obscure sides and then spent the next five years of his career
    as a session musician and songwriter for Stax Records, plying his craft in
    the service of others, and who also turned out to be a ridiculously charismatic
    performer in his own right.</p><p>
    
    His booming baritone and sweeping Spector-squared arrangements set the tone for a whole generation of r&amp;b; in the 1960s, while his 70s Blaxploitation
    soundtracks largely defined the genre with their chicken-scratch wah
    guitars, stabbing strings, and tough vocals. And of course he had his
    monologues-- long, sometimes rambling speeches that he unapologetically used
    to preface the meat of many of his songs. <em>Can You Dig It?</em> packs two discs
    wall-to-wall with 32 of the best tracks Hayes recorded under his own name,
    understandably leaving out the significant portion of his career he spent
    laboring for Stax, though you could certainly focus an interesting
    compilation on his early work backing and writing for other performers-- the
    guy co-wrote ""Soul Man"", after all.</p><p>
    
    The whole extravaganza kicks off with that familiar twittering hi-hat, joined by one of
    the coolest rhythm guitar parts ever, and...is it possible not to like the
    ""Theme From Shaft""? It gets something of a novelty rap, mostly as a result
    of innumerable terrible karaoke performances, but this is a truly badass
    piece of music, heinous funk rhythms and an entire symphony orchestra all
    building to a casually awesome drum fill that drops you into that
    ultra-smooth sing-rap. ""Who's the black private dick that's a sex machine to
    all the chicks?"" Hayes was talking about the Richard Roundtree character, but much of it applies to himself as well. A Google image search for the man reveals a
    gallery of way-too-cool shots of Hayes with his shaved head, perpetual
    sunglasses and shirtless displays of gold body hardware, but Hayes did more
    than his share to live up to that image in his music.</p><p>
    
    The cross-section of that music captured in this tracklisting is about as
    good as it gets. Highlights from Hayes' other soundtrack work-- his theme from
    <em>Tough Guys</em> is sweet 'n' nasty proto-disco with a synth bass part from
    another planet-- mingle with album cuts, minor hits, and a few edits of his
    longest tracks, including a seven-minute reduction of his epic reading of
    Jimmy Webb's ""By the Time I Get to Phoenix"". Thankfully, the compilers have
    left intact the entire 12 minutes of his definitive take on
    Bacharach/David's ""Walk on By"", a psychedelic funk odyssey filled with
    scorching fuzz guitar solos and grandiose string arrangements that's as
    close to perfect as any song of that length could be.</p><p>
    
    It's hard for anything to top ""Walk on By"", but Hayes hardly needs to worry
    about that when his second tier includes songs like ""Do Your Thing"", an
    essential slab of languid bongo funk, the throbbing, horn-soaked
    instrumental ""Disco Connection"", and ""Hyperbolicsyllabic-sesquadelymistic"",
    a nine-minute funk crawl capped by an out-of-this world piano solo that
    Public Enemy later snipped a portion of for the basis of ""Black Steel in the
    Hour of Chaos"". ""Joy, pt. 1"" went a long way toward establishing him as a
    master of seductive r&amp;b;, wrapping direct sexuality in a pillowy love song
    packed with flutes, strings and horns. It's actually a little jarring
    sitting next to the plaintive live version of the traditional gospel song
    ""His Eye Is on the Sparrow.""</p><p>
    
    There are only a few places in the two-plus hours of music here where not
    everything works. ""For the Good Times"" is a little too smooth, while the
    five-minute monologue that opens ""I Stand Accused"" is practically
    self-parody, and boring to boot. The need to edit down a few of the longer
    tracks is unfortunate, but understandable (if anything they could have
    lopped the intro of ""I Stand Accused""), and anyone who wants the full-length
    versions of ""By the Time I Get to Phoenix"" or ""Do Your Thing"" can simply
    scoop up <em>Hot-Buttered Soul</em> or the <em>Shaft</em> soundtrack-- you'll want to own them
    anyway. Regardless, this is a phenomenal introduction to a man whose career
    was positively elemental both to 70s r&amp;b; and funk and to the development of
    the album as a forum for stretching out and experimenting.</p></div>"|4030.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4030-ultimate-isaac-hayes-can-you-dig-it/|8.0|Joe Tangari

What if, instead of ditching these songs following the death of a close friend, Greg Dulli had finished <em>Amber Headlights</em> and released it on schedule, sometime in 2002? Would it sound any different than it does three years and two Twilight Singers albums later? Better or worse? More vital or less? Does hearing the Twilight Singers' 2003 album <em>Blackberry Belle</em> first change the way <em>Amber Headlights</em> sounds now?</p><p>
    
    The likelihood is that this album would have sounded just as disappointing in 2002 as it does in 2005. <em>Amber Headlights</em> is a step backwards after the lush beats and subdued songs of the Twilight Singers' debut, 2000's <em>Twilight</em>, but it also seems weak following the harrowing <em>Blackberry Belle</em> and even the so-so covers album <em>She Loves You</em>. The fact that it was released out of order only reinforces comparisons to the albums that would have preceded and followed <em>Amber Headlights</em>, forcing the listener to create an alternate timeline based on so many what-ifs.</p><p>
    
    The album starts with the nearly identical ""So Tight"" and ""Cigarettes"", both of which sport conspiratorial verses that peel out into racing choruses. But any momentum is tripped up by lyrics that border on parody: ""Sexy lady, she wanna play me,"" Dulli sings on ""So Tight"", ""after she get hot she starts to get a little shady."" They're the best tracks on <em>Amber Headlights</em>, but we've heard better versions of essentially the same songs on <em>Blackberry Belle</em>-- ""Teenage Wristband"" and ""Decatur Street"" are not only more pointed and purposeful, but their momentum proves more reckless.</p><p>
    
    From there it's downhill. ""Domani"" recalls <em>1965</em>, particularly ""The Slide Song"", but its swelling chorus suffers from the lyrics' forced ambiguity, which predictably compound love and drugs: ""I'm never coming down/so beautiful/no one around."" Songs like ""Early Today (and Later Tonight)"" handle romance with the rough disregard of a trashy revenge flick: all exploitation, no soul. The obvious pun of the album title doesn't help-- <em>Amber Headlights</em> = boobs! The drama that infuses Dulli's best work quickly descends to melodrama: ""I used to love you/ now I'm going to hurt you,"" he sings on ""Early Today (and Later Tonight)"". ""When We Two Parted"" it ain't.</p><p>
    
    The other downside to these necessary comparisons with Dulli's previous and subsequent work is that they reveal how limited his particular aesthetic can be. He's made a fairly solid and respectable 20-year career out of very strictly defined creative parameters, drawing on specific strains of black American music-- 1960s and 70s soul in particular-- to bolster his white rock sensibility. His best songs are swirls of dark desire, pitting Dulli against his demons; at his best and darkest, it feels like the most he can even hope for is just to keep them at bay. <em>Amber Headlights</em>, on the other hand, sounds bloodless in comparison: his most dangerous demons seem to be nicotine and the persistent urge to remind us he's got some great blow. He doesn't just revel in his dark persona; he happily confesses his seedy sins as if every listener were a priest. But there's no real danger in these songs, no conflict, no stakes at all-- so no payoff, no catharsis. No wonder Dulli abandoned them.</p></div>"|2631.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2631-amber-headlights/|4.7|Stephen M. Deusner

Beyond awful. Listen, I know a lot of people out these parts didn't dig DFA79's mini-metalisms
    on <i>You're A Woman, I'm A Machine</i>-- too hard, too soft, too boring,
    not boring enough, vaguely misogynistic, etc. You wrote these things to me
    and I have all your emails in a file somewhere.</p><p>
    But understand a simple, if not mathematical fact about this two-piece
    bass-and-drum duo: By necessity their songs have little to them. They're efficient
    bursts of less-is-more rock that ride riffs hard then cut out right before
    they stale. I'd have thought at least one motherfucker tapped for this
    turkey-shot remix project would have figured that out. Instead we get
    Justice on some reverso Advantage shit, making ""Blood on Your Hands""
    sound like the theme to <i>Super Pitfall</i>, and that game's the fucking
    worst.</p><p>
    Hey, let's talk Bloc Party's <i>Silent Alarm Remixed</i>,
    from which we might pretend <i>Romance Bloody Romance</i> took some Ps and
    Qs. <i>SAR</i>, remember, featured a different producer doing up a different
    track from the Bloc's debut. Then it came sequenced just like <i>Silent
    Alarm</i>, and a few of us (me) actually liked it <i>better</i> than the
    original LP-- more variety, less helicopters, etc. <i>SAR</i> at least made
    <i>sense</i>, since every Bloc track physically had a bunch of possible
    reconfigurations. <i>Romance</i>, meanwhile, has four telling remixes of
    ""Black History Month"" (the band's worst song), three of ""Romantic Rights"",
    an OK new song and a cover of former Peel favorite La Peste's ""Better Off Dead"".
    Inexplicably, nobody behind the papers realized after the second or third
    dude asked to remix ""Black History Month"" that maybe, <em>maybe</em>, DFA79's songs aren't
    suited for the full-on remix treatment-- they don't need it either.</p><p>
    Listen, I respect the renewed interest in tripping up rock-kid disco
    homophobia (still rampant) with these Phoned-in remix blitzes of late. Vice
    Records, seems, is fighting the good fight. But the Braxe/Falke and Dählback
    joints here are so flimsy, that vocoder'd out Makuziak futuro-disco bullshit
    so obnoxiously tongue-in-cheek, I can't imagine anybody really psyched to
    hit up his neighb Fixed or Making Time party to try out his new Diesel
    hightops on the dancefloor. Final Fantasy's string arrangements for ""Black
    History"" have their charm, sure, but only Trash's Erol Alkan turns in the
    album's non-bomb, a simple edit of ""Romantic Rights"" that overlays
    percussion tracks for an intro and flips the vocal track a disorienting
    half-step early. Which is saying something: If the game is to make rock
    tracks playable in clubs, why fuck with them more than you have to? What's
    so bad about disco edits?</p></div>"|2588.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2588-romance-bloody-romance/|0.5|Nick Sylvester

The Beginners Guide to Understanding the Roots, Vols. 1 & 2|3599.0|The Roots|['Rap', 'Pop/R&B']|0.0|0.0|0.0|['Geffen']|2005-11-22 00:00:00|2005|2016-06-11 20:51:48.461920|"<div class=""contents dropcap"" data-reactid="".jlwl5mosg0.1.6:0.1.0.$6835/=1$6835.0.3.2.0.1.0.1""><p>There's not much to understand, really. The only song you really need-- and, blasphemy!, you're getting this out a Philly cat-- is ""Push Up Ya 
    Lighter"", from 1996's <i>Illadelph Halflife</i>. The Roots 
    band never came closer to that tight-wound, RZA-squared minimalism, and they did it there without compromising their looser jazz/soul/funk sensibilities (check the watery, monkish keyb progression). The Roots 
    worked a few years behind New York's producers in the beginning, but 
    when records like ""Clones"" or ""Concierto of the Desperado"" hit, they 
    made comparable Alc and RZA tracks sound demo.</p><p>  
    
    Allmusic loves dropping the Stetsasonic bomb when time comes to squash 
    the ridiculously common ""Roots are the first hip-hop band"" belief among 
    those who first saw the Roots at their college 
    SpringFest (same kids on facebook who like ""hip-hop for 
    dancing."") But that doesn't mean live instruments lost their cachet, 
    especially for ingratiating 1990s hip-hop to rockies and jazzbos. Remember, too, that 
    the Roots put Jay-Z in that <i>Unplugged</i> game, and I don't think 
    anybody has taken the time to mine that moment for its music-cultural 
    relevance.</p><p>
    
    And yet as much as they shine musically, Roots MCs Black Thought and to 
    a much lesser extent Malik B struggle with the pen. 
    ""Lighter"" covers all the topics and touchstones: coming to terms with modern hip-hop's 
    rags-or-riches come-up; repping Philly; repping hip-hop's Blackness; 
    loving ladies right. Vaguely conscious, literary insofar as he was a 
    tad sophistic, Black Thought spouts truisms in deft internal rhyme 
    schemes, but after a decade dude still doesn't have a single memorable 
    line, and that's foul. The better Roots mic moments 
    have always been on the guest spots, and lady Bahamadia's work here 
    (""Inclined to rap about facts, I never fake jacks/ Shit is real like E 
    packs"") recalls past upstagings from Common, Dice Raw, Mos Def, Talib 
    Kweli, Cody ChestnuTT, Q-Tip, usw.</p><p>
    
    Pride's a bitch, though. Had this band thought of themselves as producers and made 
    records with different rappers rather than convince themselves of some 
    personal unfuckwithable aesthetic, they could have killed. <i>Home Grown!</i> 
    should kill me on nostalgia alone, but all I can think of is how the 
    Roots refused to back Jay-Z at Live 8, some snub factor or another, and 
    how in retrospect the only reason I liked them was because they're a 
    band, and at 13 that made it the only rap music I could play in my 
    parents' rap-is-not-music cars. (Hey, that's how Beth and Barry roll.)</p><p>
    
    Otherwise, sorry, the Roots never mustered much consequence-- musically 
    speaking, this is a completely insular career of mostly great beats and 
    half-realized rhymes. They have a loyal following the same way Dave 
    Matthews or Pat McGee or moe. have them, and surely their loyal fans 
    picked up all the rarities and unreleased these and those along the 
    way-- maybe even off that triple-disc bootleg that was on the shelves 
    for a minute this time last year. The rest of you might like to know 
    that the band remixed ""Don't Say Nuthin'"", last year's worst rap single 
    by a kilo, which I take as tacit admission they thought the same. The 
    dub take on neo-dull song ""Break You Off"" ain't bad, and the live medley 
    of ""The Seed/Melting Pot/The Web"" has this nasty snare-on-quarters 
    backbeat for ""Seed"" that's worth talking about. Still, I don't know why Geffen 
    split this into two separate volumes except for the obvious $$$ reasons, 
    and I don't know why, after culling pretty evenly from their studio LPs, 
    the Roots left off ""Push Up Ya Lighter"". Criminy. Maybe then I would have read the liners.</p></div>"|6835.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6835-home-grown-the-beginners-guide-to-understanding-the-roots-vols-1-2/|6.9|Nick Sylvester

Someone in the crowd requested their 2001 electro favorite ""Hand to Phone"", which wasn't so strange. Nicola Kuperus said she was sick to death of singing that song, which wasn't so unusual either. But then-- then she <i>did</i> start singing it, in an eye-rolling parody of her old robot monotone: hand to phone, hand to phone, blah blah blah.</p><p>
    
    I can't think of much better shorthand for the group's career arc-- abandoning those pitch-perfect light-speed electronics and diving off into a world of potentially embarrassing basement trainwrecks. Kuperus traded icy drone for the kind of witchy yelping not much heard since Bauhaus's prime. Adam Lee Miller traded clean-line synth flash for nasty bass-guitar buzz. They added a guitar player; they spazzed out. And as much as each new release came out like a total mess, there was something in each of them that's totally fascinating, as if each of those risky sounds-- from cyborg post-punk to cheerleader pogo goth-- was one wobbly, perilous step in the direction of something much greater. The only question: when-- or whether-- they'd ever break past the wobbles and come out with whatever that great thing was.</p><p>
    
    Is that thing <i>Gimme Trouble</i>? Not quite-- but this is a whole lot closer than anything we've heard so far. For one thing, there's the sound, which has perked up beautifully. Drum machine pump, bass blurt, synth clatter, guitar screech-- they all mesh clean and shiny here, and on some tracks they take on a slanty, minimalist bounce that practically breaks a smile. ""Bad Idea"" kicks off sounding like early Devo, something from an era where weirdoid punk and synthesizers got along naturally. The go-go drum machine and one-note guitar on ""Still Waiting"" leave the whole thing feeling vaguely like an early B-52's rave-up. Half the rest sounds like X-Ray Spex or Siouxsie and the Banshees-- there is vintage new wave rawness and goth-inflected bounce all over this thing, and it manages to leave this band in fresh-sounding territory that's somehow miles away from most everything today's ""new wave revivalists"" and/or ""electro-punks"" have even thought about trying. Best of all: no mess. No little time-trials, or side-notes, or half-formed clatters-- just 12 songs that, while somewhat lacking in super-blazing stand-outs, present a giant step up in coherence.</p><p>
    
    That's good news: It doesn't feel so ""confrontational"" anymore, does it? With their last full-length, <i>Anxiety Always</i>, it sounded like they were challenging us, deliberately nag-nag-nagging us with the shriekiest, most paranoid rumble they could muster. That was fun, in its way, and it's certainly not as if they've dropped that agenda. But the Adult. on this record can be ""fun"" in a much more pleasant, straightforward way-- the same jump-around-and-screech-along way their early electro singles could be. The only thing that still worries me is the memory of them on stage, with Kuperus posing and sneering and genuinely trying to act out the cretinous-vampire schtick the band's been working its way through. Are we going to have to get Devo and Fred Schneider to come wave the landing lights and guide them to the sweet spot? This isn't scary tough-guy muscle, guys-- it's spazzed-out pogo geek-punk, and it's almost nearly there. Cover ""Rock Lobster"" if you have to.</p></div>"|58.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/58-gimme-trouble/|8.0|Nitsuh Abebe

    tied to how seriously you can take the idea of Sinead O'Connor singing 
    reggae. No one debates that O'Connor can sing. Nellie Hooper's barely-there 
    backing of ""Nothing Compares 2 U"" throws her quivering, gorgeous voice right 
    up in your ear. Also, no one should doubt her love of this music; don't 
    forget that when she pulled the crazy pope-ripping stunt on Saturday Night 
    Live it was to the tune of Bob Marley's ""War"". And reggae, the most 
    non-secularized pop music on the planet, often chapter-and-verse on record, 
    is an apt vehicle for a woman who left music in order to become an ordained 
    priest in a non-traditional Catholic denomination.</p><p>
    
    And <i>Throw Down Your Arms is certainly authentic. It was recorded at 
    the Marley's Tuff Gong studios in Kingston, and produced by Sly &amp; Robbie, 
    one of the five or 10 most smoking rhythms sections ever, in or out of 
    reggae. And here's the thing you're probably most worried about: no, she 
    doesn't sing it in cod-patois. Her voice is the same as always, that 
    ringing, lilting Irish clarity. So thank God (or Jah) for small favors and 
    good taste. Anyway, it's hard to fuck up a song like Peter Tosh's 
    ""Downpressor Man"", and O'Connor doesn't. The band gets deep in the pocket, 
    bass and drums on equal footing with voice as with actual reggae, and 
    O'Connor sticks mostly to fire and brimstone roots like Burning Spear's 
    ""Door Peep"" and the hectoring anthropomorphism of Lee Perry's ""Vampire"". She 
    stretches out on Perry's charming ""Curly Locks"", made famous by Junior 
    Byles, a sweet tale of a dreadlocks in love with a girl whose father will 
    let her having nothing to do with him.</i></p><p>
    
    At the end of the day, though, I'm a bit puzzled over why the world needed 
    an album of Sinead O'Connor reggae covers. If anything she's too reverential 
    and deferential. Nothing here betters the originals, and nothing takes them 
    out into new, unexplored terrain. There's no way O'Connor can match the 
    dread of Burning Spear's original ""Marcus Garvey"", to say nothing of the 
    fact that music here never stretches its legs out to the wobbly dub 
    versioning of ""Garvey's Ghost"". (Seriously, if you don't own the <i>Marcus 
    Garvey album, run to the record store yesterday.) The world of reggae is 
    so vast, with so many great records to explore, that unless you're a huge 
    Sinead O'Connor fan, this isn't much more than an enjoyable curio.</i></p></div>"|5945.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5945-throw-down-your-arms/|6.8|Jess Harvell

Six months later, they're offering the second side of the      album, <i>Hypnotize</i>, which is meant as a companion piece; <i>Mezmerize</i>'s      ""Soldier Side Intro"" begins what <i>Hypnotize</i>'s ""Soldier Side""      ends 23 songs later.</p>
<p>System of a Down have always evoked strong love/hate feelings from listeners. They ride the line separating thrash metal and more      radio-friendly fare, with some hardcore metal fans believing the band      isn't metal enough, and fans of more straightforward alterna-metal finding      them too leftfield. The band's oddball characteristics are even more upfront on <i>Mezmerize</i>, with the group shifting styles unexpectedly and incorporated more non-Western sounds than ever before.</p>
<p>The songs generally gravitate toward one of two extremes-- rapid-fire, full throttle thrash songs, such as      <i>Mezmerize</i>'s ""Cigaro"" and <i>Hypnotize</i>'s ""Attack"" and      ""Dreaming"", or slow, heavy songs like <i>Hypnotize</i>'s title track and ""Holy      Mountain"". <i>Mezmerize</i>'s strongest moments are when the band drops the eccentricities      and just rocks out: On the two-minute ""Cigaro"", Serj Tankian's      dominating vocals go from growl to howl while the band thrashes along      behind him, and single ""Question!"" morphs from whispery and acoustic to loping and      menacing.</p>
<p>For the most part, the same holds true on <i>Hypnotize</i>, with      musical mannerisms working best when they're accenting songs rather than      controlling them. As the less ambitious of the two albums,      <i>Hypnotize</i> is at once more aggressive and more restrained. ""Dreaming"", one of the strongest tracks from either album,      builds layers of vocals, varying rhythms, and harmonies over blast-      beat drums.

<p>The biggest problem on both of these albums is the increased vocal      presence of guitarist/primary songwriter Daron Malakian. On the band's      second album, 2001's <i>Toxicity</i>, Malakian's voice was a welcome      accent to front man Serj Tankian's commanding, operatic howls and      barks. But now, Malakian sings on every      song, in some cases as the lead vocalist. Tankian's voice has always      been one of the most unique aspects of the band, and to hear him step      aside for Malakian's whiny, nasally drawl is a disappointment. The      fact that his voice is generally clear and easy to understand only      accentuates an underlying problem that has haunted the band from day      one: terrible lyrics.</p>
<p>At some point, the words just become unintentional comedy. At their best, they're nonsensical and garbled; at their      worst, they're full of forced rhymes, juvenile shock      tactics, and failed intellectualisms. <i>Mezmerize</i> give us ""B.Y.O.B."", with lines      like ""Why don't presidents fight the war?"" Later we get ""Violent Pornography"", which sidesteps actually      attacking the degrading of women for lines like, ""It's a violent      pornography/ Chocking chicks and sodomy/ The kind of shit you get on      your TV."" <i>Hypnotize</i> is no better. On the plaintive ballad ""Lonely Day"", Malakian croons, ""The most loneliest day of my life/ Such a      lonely day/ Should be banned/ It's a day that I can't stand."" He never       reveals what this day is, but my theory is that it's when he got a failing grade on his 9th grade poetry project.</p>
<p>As with any double album, the question inevitably arises as to      whether or not this could've been pared down to a single.      Admittedly, there are a few tracks that just don't work.      <i>Mezmerize</i> could do without ""Old School Hollywood"" (a failed      attempt at new wave, with confounding lyrics about a celebrity      baseball game) and ""Violent Pornography"", while the only real blunder on      <i>Hypnotize</i> is the simplistic ""U-Fig"", which is far too      repetitive in the verses, and never quite takes off. So, while these      albums aren't likely to change the mind of dissenters, the band's      voice remains ferocious and unique, even if what they're actually      saying isn't necessarily worth hearing.</p></div>"|11839.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11839-mezmerize-hypnotize/|7.1|Cory D.

Six months later, they're offering the second side of the      album, <i>Hypnotize</i>, which is meant as a companion piece; <i>Mezmerize</i>'s      ""Soldier Side Intro"" begins what <i>Hypnotize</i>'s ""Soldier Side""      ends 23 songs later.</p>
<p>System of a Down have always evoked strong love/hate feelings from listeners. They ride the line separating thrash metal and more      radio-friendly fare, with some hardcore metal fans believing the band      isn't metal enough, and fans of more straightforward alterna-metal finding      them too leftfield. The band's oddball characteristics are even more upfront on <i>Mezmerize</i>, with the group shifting styles unexpectedly and incorporated more non-Western sounds than ever before.</p>
<p>The songs generally gravitate toward one of two extremes-- rapid-fire, full throttle thrash songs, such as      <i>Mezmerize</i>'s ""Cigaro"" and <i>Hypnotize</i>'s ""Attack"" and      ""Dreaming"", or slow, heavy songs like <i>Hypnotize</i>'s title track and ""Holy      Mountain"". <i>Mezmerize</i>'s strongest moments are when the band drops the eccentricities      and just rocks out: On the two-minute ""Cigaro"", Serj Tankian's      dominating vocals go from growl to howl while the band thrashes along      behind him, and single ""Question!"" morphs from whispery and acoustic to loping and      menacing.</p>
<p>For the most part, the same holds true on <i>Hypnotize</i>, with      musical mannerisms working best when they're accenting songs rather than      controlling them. As the less ambitious of the two albums,      <i>Hypnotize</i> is at once more aggressive and more restrained. ""Dreaming"", one of the strongest tracks from either album,      builds layers of vocals, varying rhythms, and harmonies over blast-      beat drums. Later, on ""Holy Mountain"", the band syncs up, firing      every beat, every stroke, and every syllable together, punching their      way through the track.</p>
<p>The biggest problem on both of these albums is the increased vocal      presence of guitarist/primary songwriter Daron Malakian.

What at first seems to be nothing more than a  contractual obligation thing is actually an embarrassment of riches. In addition to the 20-track concert film featuring the  latest incarnation of the Queens performing at the Brixton Academy in  London, there is bonus footage of various band configurations and a  14-track live CD culled from the London show featuring tracks that  aren't on the DVD. Not content with just giving folks straight-up  concert footage (complete with hi-tech A/V jazzhanding-- more  split-screen!), the Queens opt to have director Chapman Baehler  interweave shots of the band frolicking around Europe (with and  without animal masks), as well as some old studio and live footage.</p><p>  The film's intro-- Josh Homme on a poorly lit cobblestoned street,  playing ""This Lullaby"" on acoustic guitar, with various archival Queens  footage interspersed throughout-- is the high point of the non-concert  footage. Unless, that is, you're fond of WTF skits involving a guy in a wolf mask  being harassed by drunk British yobs, or grainy black'n'white clips of  the Queens frolicking in Europe. Instead, give me more of  Homme on stage calling a pissant heckler a cocksmoker, please. The  archival footage is great as well, although the trips down memory lane can be distracting.  Hearing the current Queens charge through ""Song For the Deaf"" and ""No One  Knows"" is great, but cross-cutting that with footage of Dave Grohl doing  damage (on the former) and Nick Oliveri dropping down low (on the  latter) doesn't do right by Homme's current posse.</p><p>  For those of you still sighing for what once was, there's also the bonus  material, a handful of live tracks from each Queens lineup. First album-era Queens is represented by grainy footage of the group performing  ""Mexicola"" and ""The Bronze"" at an outdoor festival. The <em>Rated R</em> Queens  get three tracks-- ""Autopilot"", ""Better Living Through Chemistry"", and  ""How To Handle a Rope"". The Queens that MTV learned to love receive a  whopping five full tracks: four from <em>Songs For The Deaf</em>, and  ""Quick and to the Pointless"" from the previous album. Finally, nu-Queens  fans get to watch ZZ Top's Billy Gibbons join in on a Mark Lanegan-lead cover  of the Top's ""Precious and Grace"", as well as some wicked ""Burn the Witch""  solo action. It's all great stuff, despite the dodgy quality of the  audio and video.</p><p>  Oh, and the actual reason this thing exists-- the Brixton Academy  concert footage-- is great as well. There are some speed bumps-- ""Feel  Good Hit of the Summer"" hits more like the novelty its naysayers claim  it is, and some of the longer tracks from <em>Lullabies to Paralyze</em> live up to the name of their  originating album in the worst way possible. Don't mind the guitar/drum solos/piss breaks, either. Those duff moments are easily offset  by the rest of the set. In addition to hitting all the high points of  the Queens catalog, this set includes some <em>Desert Session</em> cuts (like the  fuck-friendly ""I Wanna Make It Wit Chu"") and the previously unreleased  ""The Fun Machine Took a Shit and Died"", a long and winding circus jalopy  that would've been a welcome addition to <em>Lullabies</em>. As an  extra special secret bonus, there's a performance of ""First It Giveth""  by Homme &amp; Oliveri hidden after the credits that tugs at the We Want  Nick heartstrings. But that was then, this is now, those Queens  are dead, long live these Queens, blah blah blah. As a tribute to what  once was, and a testimonial to what now exists, <em>Over The Years</em> is  the good stuff.</p><p> </p></div>"|6608.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6608-over-the-years-and-through-the-woods/|7.6|David Raposa

Volume 2|0.0|Various Artists|[]|0.0|0.0|0.0|['Virgin', 'Purple Ribbon']|2005-11-21 00:00:00|2006|2016-06-11 20:51:52.880535|"<div class=""contents dropcap"" data-reactid="".1ae06gxapds.1.6:0.1.0.$1184/=1$1184.0.3.2.0.1.0.1""><p>The first release from an artist imprint should never be the second  volume of anything. That's just confusing. <em>Volume 1</em> of <em>Got Purp?</em> was actually  called <em>Got That Purp</em>, and it was a successful DJ Drama mixtape released earlier  this year that combined languorous, blissful lily pad r&amp;b with punishing 808  body-rock. This ""official"" release is softer around the edges and it's a  maddening exercise in label familiarization. If the artists on a comp are  unknown, the format makes sense. Problem here is the crucial artists on Big  Boi's Purple Ribbon are known, cult-like figures, ripe with fluid,  engrossing backstories.</p><p>  Purple Ribbon is the successor to Andre 3000 and Big's failed vanity label,  Aquemini. Most of its artists will likely never get a whiff of a solo  album, let alone another high-profile showcase. This is the way artist  imprints work. Aquemini was ill-fated, releasing only Killer Mike's  sincerely disruptive <em>Monster</em> and a disappointing LP from Slimm Calhoun before dissolving in the swirl of label  politics. Now Mike, a constantly infuriated Ralph Kramden figure, Bubba  Sparxxx, Organized Noize's beatific crooner Sleepy Brown, and reportedly a  reformed Goodie Mob (with Cee-Lo) will headline the label's studded, studly  new roster. Of course, Killer Mike's album missed its November release date,  Bubba's album has been pushed back twice, and Sleepy Brown can't catch a  whiff of the shine he's deserved for some time. This assemblage only goes so  far in rewarding the begging and pleading of pre-Crunk Georgia hip-hop  acolytes.</p><p>  Antwan Patton aka Big Boi possesses arguably the sturdiest, most resolute  flow of any rapper working today. He handily owns the album's lead single, ""Kryptonite  (I'm on It)"", methodically riding the Egyptian  juke joint's quivering drum track. He also embarrasses Killer Mike and  members of Konkrete, a fledgling group featuring his brother James, in the  process. Big is a technician, fast but smooth, never overwhelming, always  relentless. He effortlessly replicated that flow at a live show earlier this  year, practically sweating charisma. ""Kryptonite (I'm on It)"" is a space-age  frozen rope, clearly and succinctly sunk into the hearts of banger-aware  heads. They be on that kryptonite, but only steered by Big. It's a shame the  rest isn't as transcendent.</p><p>  Other highlights appear, if erratically. On ""Dungeon Family Dedication""  Killer Mike mourns the once-mighty collective over Outkast's ""Aquemini""  beat, questioning the state of biting and fighting. He asks ""Is it only me  or does Pharrell sometimes remind niggas of Sleepy Brown back in '93?,""  notes Cool Breeze created the term ""Dirty South"" only to have it stolen by  perhaps less deserving hooligans, and grieves the absence of Witch Doctor. There's lots of r&amp;b as well, from Sleepy Brown's luminous  ""Me and My Baby and My Cadillac"", which sounds like so many glasses of  lemonade in the desert, to Tony Tone Toni sound-alike Scar who's ""U Got  Me!!!"" is a completely incongruous sunspot but welcome nonetheless. Less  interesting cooing comes courtesy of stock Tearri-whatever songstress Janell  Monae, who do-do-do-dos her way through the electro-camp of ""Time Will  Reveal"" and ""Lettin' Go"".</p><p>  Bubba Sparxxx, a beleaguered titan forever confounded by visions of mud  fights and overalls, calmly delivers ""Claremont Lounge"", a sweet Georgia  peach about strip clubs, laced thick with reverberating bleeps and a  cameo from the dearly missed Cool Breeze. Big Boi's ""808"" featuring Bun B  and Boy n Da Hood Big Gee, was already featured on <em>Volume 1</em>. It's fierce,  but old news. And Goodie Mob does, in fact, reunite here. ""Hold On"" is  classic Mob music, at once gruff and melodic over horns and snares. It's  about time Cee-Lo came back, too.</p><p>  Interestingly, the interludes here keep this mish-mash afloat most of the  time, reminiscent of Organized Noize-helmed Outkast records of old. They  meld the scattershot productions. Nostalgia is a flighty bitch, though. More  than anything, <em>Got Purp? 2</em> makes me sad. Sad that Society of Soul and  Jim Crow never blew up. Sad that smart + throwed doesn't necessarily compute  these days. Sad that Sleepy might never get another album. Sad that a guy as  smart as Big Boi led with <em>Volume 2</em> of a damn compilation. Quoth Killer Mike:  ""Man, rap need a doctor/ Which doctor?/ Bring back the Witch Doctor, feelin'  me?""</p><p> </p></div>"|1184.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1184-big-boi-presents-got-purp-volume-2/|7.2|Sean Fennessey

    made his living as a Brill Building songwriter. You probably know the
    hits he penned for others (""I'm a Believer"", ""Red Red Wine"") as well
    as the many he emblazoned with his distinctive gravel-and-fireworks
    baritone. Yeah, the dentures-foaming fervor he inspires in his fans
    has made him an easy joke-butt, but that's why <em>12
    Songs</em> arrives with such a perfect Hollywood pitch. Rick Rubin, who
    helmed Johnny Cash's acclaimed final recordings (of which <em>American
    III: Solitary Man</em> was named after a Diamond tune), was supposed to
    pull pop's consummate showman out of the shadow of his own glitz,
    shining new light on the man and, especially, his songs.</p><p>
    
    Well, it don't walk. As an exhibition of Diamond's songcraft, <em>12
    Songs</em> can be forgiven for eschewing covers, even though spare
    renditions of unlikely material contributed to the success of Cash's
    Rubin-produced efforts (belt me ""Terrible Lie"" and I'll spot you two-tenths of a ratings point, Diamond). The songwriting, however, is the
    problem. While the man behind 1973's character-album <em>Jonathan
    Livingston Seagull</em> and the star of <em>The Jazz Singer</em> certainly
    used to be a master of sublimely kitschy melodrama, and a levelheaded
    reappraisal of his best pop-- ""Forever in Blue Jeans"", ""Cracklin'
    Rosie"", ""Brother Love's Traveling Salvation Show"", ""Sweet
    Caroline""-- is overdue, Diamond once told Barbra, ""Used-to-bes don't
    count anymore/ They just lay on the floor.""</p><p>
    
    The bulk of <em>12 Songs</em> tends toward the somber, ""Girl, You'll Be
    a Woman Soon"" variety of Diamond hit, except with self-important
    pseudo-wisdom instead of <em>Pulp Fiction</em> creepiness. Rubin
    dresses-down the compositions in sparse, close-miked arrangements
    Boomerized with softly picked acoustic guitars, unobtrusive strings,
    and ""Like a Rolling Stone"" organs-- the type of production many
    listeners still mistake for lack thereof. It's been said that
    Diamond's style could use more adornment than it gets here, but
    Rubin's actually done a masterful job; mawkish break-up ballad
    ""Evermore"" starts with an illusion of intimacy-- studio banter, solo
    strums-- then glides into a processional rhythm before ramping up to maximalist strings, horns, and that
    goosebumps-desperate croon. The song still doesn't bring me flowers:
    ""Was it love or just illusion?/ All I see is our confusion"".</p><p>
    
    Rubin's got experience aplenty coddling codgers-- Cash, Jagger,
    Cuomo-- but Diamond doesn't wear imminent mortality gracefully. ""Hell
    Yeah"" is a ""My Way"" misfired near Cat Stevens' ""Father and Son"", all
    stream-of-consciousness platitudes and vain posterity-posturing. The
    point is, hell yeah he knows he'll be missed when he's dead, and that
    he's running out of time. Still, he's lived a life full of love (""love's
    a gift that's made for giving""), ""a life that's made for caring"", in a
    fishbowl on shaky ground up in the clouds. He also ""walked the line,""
    oops.</p><p>
    
    Interestingly overlooked in the raft of positive press already
    greeting this album is Diamond's ""A Man of God"", in which he sounds
    just like a senile, self-righteous deathbed convert. I like Diamond's
    voice as much as the next guy, but dude tells us he thinks it's God's.
    He also confidently assures us he's going to heaven when he dies
    (phew) and that apparently he's ""a man of peace."" What, no
    Presidential Medal of Freedom? Diamond's ""faith is something you can't
    see"" line is second only to ""a friend is someone you need"" from
    <em>E.T.</em>-inspired 1982 Diamond schmaltzfest ""Heartlight"" for
    boneheaded obviousness.</p><p>
    
    Not all of Diamond's new songs go awry. Most just go away, their
    melodies dissipating, their lyrics flimsy even through those
    tremendous pipes. ""Delirious Love"" is the most uptempo tune, bouncing
    on the ""then spring became the summer"" side of ""Sweet Caroline"" (a
    special-edition bonus track includes Brian Wilson in the delirium).
    Diamond intones that ""love is all about we"" and ""it can keep you dry
    on a rainy day"" on the closing ""We"", which oompahs like Sir Paul's
    ""When I'm 64"". Of course, Macca is currently shilling for retirement
    services-- something even the most accomplished songwriters might
    eventually want to consider. Today!</p></div>"|2630.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2630-12-songs/|4.1|Marc Hogan

But wait, it gets better: his older sister is none other than Blevin Blectum, formerly of the incendiary scatolotronica duo Blectum from Blechdom. ""It's true,"" confirms Blectum. ""We grew up together in rural environments playing with Legos and listening to <em>Star Wars</em> disco records."" Ok, so that's where the disco comes from, not to mention the snap-tight arrangements.</p><p>
    
    Polar's biggest hurdle, though, is disco: doubly so since he juices up his arrangements with tasteful strings-- they're nothing like Russell's rumbling, one-line arguments, but neither are they Philly's cheesy sweeps-- trebly so since disco's hipster ascendancy in the past half-decade. But it would be a shame to write this off as <em>disco nouveau</em>, or whatever damning with faint categories we'd like to pull off. If you listen with your Italo goggles off, you'll hear uncanny references to Matias Aguayo's recent Kompakt album, for instance-- the refrain ""I can't wait 'til you're back here in the dark,"" from ""Tyurangalila"", could easily be one of Aguayo's do-ya-think-I'm-sexy-because-I'm-not-sure mantras-- while the hooks jutting through every song's cheek and jowl are as pop as Annie or Mylo. Which is to say that <i>Love Songs of the Hanging Gardens is yet another surprising, ambitious release whose primary intent is the pursuit of </i><i>songform, all other genre trappings aside.</i></p><p>
    
    There's no denying, of course, the very Environ-ness of the album (in part because Polar's string arrangements for Metro Area helped cement the sound), from the sparseness of the compositions-- every sound seems to exist in its own bubble, with soapy friction foaming up when they collide-- to the analog drum machines and bass lines. But other details, from rhythm sounds to spry arpeggios to vocal tics, nod variously to Alter Ego, <em>schaffel, and Erlend Oye's fey delivery. But none of this speaks to the </em><em>wholeness</em> of <em>Love Songs</em>, which arises in part from the foamed-milk consistency of the thing, and in part from Polar's facility with the line, threading a single morphing idea through chord change after chord change, song after song. Minor becomes major and major turns ostrich-headed just as swiftly, lunging deep into dark soil. Too much music these days (not to mention music criticism) gets hung up on the nouns and adjectives, and forgets to pursue the verbs: on the sparkling cello and oogly bass lines, instead of the means by which they become something other than a collection of patches and sequences, a clever set of memory jogs. That's the beauty of Polar's hanging garden: It's not a Zen arrangement to be appreciated for its static beauty. Every vine's alive, wrangling and untangling, via black holes of recent musical history and the clever now-ness of the best pop, its way clear to sunlight. </p></div>"|6585.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6585-love-songs-of-the-hanging-gardens/|7.8|Philip Sherburne

It doesn't diminish Stevens' accomplishment to say that it took me a long time to warm up to it. It was so utterly poised that it came off with a certain sterility-- the seamless contours of its surface held the listener at a remove. Page France's warm and inviting <em>Hello, Dear Wind</em> has the same striking imagery and deft arrangements with none of the remoteness. Michael Nau's earnest voice sweeps achingly over subtle folk-pop crescendos. Simple acoustic chord progressions accumulate deft touches of glockenspiel and burbling organs, swooning harmonies and majestic percussion, lurching gracefully toward the sublime.</p><p>  Nau is a true prodigy-- at age 21, he's writing songs with uncommon theological complexity. Let's spell it out in no uncertain terms-- in 21st century America, Christianity has been hijacked by some evil men. Jesus said that it's easier to fit a camel through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter Heaven. But in an age of mega-churches that lavish money on high-end AV equipment and contributions to PACs that would undo every social program designed to counteract uneven wealth distribution, Jesus' central teachings of compassion, forgiveness, and charity have been forsaken. His national face has become that of a cruel tyrant, peering down upon humankind with the miser's disdainful grimace.</p><p> <em>Hello, Dear Wind</em> accentuates the common traits of Christian music that is able to penetrate the secular world, with an unfettered joy that would scan to conservative Christians as almost pagan. It deploys Christian tropes poetically and not pedantically, brimming with reiterative Biblical imagery -- angels and burning bushes and trumpets, but also circuses, kings and crowns, wind, trees, and fruit. Here's an excerpt from ""Chariot"", Nau's take on the Rapture, locating all of its poetry in hallucinatory animation, not dread: ""Dance like elephants as he comes to us through a fiery golden rain / With a violin and a song to sing as he brings for us our wings/ Now he's one of us, plays the tambourine, breaks the bread for us and sings.""</p><p>  Nau's Jesus would rather sing and dance than condemn. He ""will come up through the ground so dirty/ With worms in his hair and a hand so sturdy""; he ""will dance while we drink his wine/ With soldiers and thieves and a sword in his side."" Nau also prefers celebration to judgment, and he eschews Christianity's frustrating certainty along with its guilt. On ""Dogs"", he sings, ""I'm not sure what happens when everything here ends/ But I hope it's like they said, and I hope it never ends."" It's a statement of inward belief, not of outward censure. Nau understands what so many conservative Christians can't or won't: That to hate God's human creations, whatever their lifestyles or religious beliefs, is an affront on God; that to distort Jesus' teachings for personal and political gain is the gravest sin of all. ""Praise to you, praise to me,"" Nau sings on ""Glue"", restoring a measure of spiritual generosity to a faith that's losing its confidence in humans. </p><p> </p></div>"|3352.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3352-hello-dear-wind/|7.8|Brian Howe

    camera/your eyes. There's no boudoir photography, no exposed belly or freed 
    boobs; nothing but her face (and the explicit lyrics warning, of course). 
    It's an interesting, if obvious, tack from a woman out to make her 
    ""confessional"" album; a woman who has spent most of her professional career 
    simultaneously infuriating/heartening feminists. It's hard to imagine the 
    woman who spit so ferociously on ""Suck My Dick"" or ""Custom Made (Give it To You)"" is letting someone else call the shots. On the other hand, one viewing of the ""How Many Licks?"" video is enough to make you join your local Andrea Dworkin fan club.</i></p><p>
    
    As most everyone knows, Kim is currently serving a year and a day bid 
    for perjury and conspiracy in a widely publicized case, which involves 
    standing by men not worth sticking up for. (There's a whole mess of 
    contradictions at work here that would be impossible tease out in a record review-- not the least of which being the trope of staying true to your 
    crew vs. an urban environment so currently hostile to law enforcement that 
    murderers walk.) So, needless to say, 
    she's pissed. Among those who end up in her crosshairs are 50, the entire 
    New York judicial system, and, of course, the Junior M.A.F.I.A. boys.</p><p>
    
    When Kim's worked up, as on the ""Welcome to Jamrock""-flipping first single ""Lighters Up"", she sounds unstoppable. The utterly venomous ""Shut Up Bitch"" recalls those early, scalding singles, including the astounding line ""your mouth's a cage for your tongue if you just close your teeth."" The beats are similarly hot, from the stomping fake dancehall of ""Durty"" to the sleazy rework of Shocking Blue's ""Love Buzz"" on ""Kitty Box"". Occasionally Kim's quest for the most outrageous sexual lyrics possible leads her into the realm of the plain dumb: ""I'm the only bitch in the world that got two pussies."" (Though she's beaten by Bun B for sheer ""holy crap"" on ""We Don't Give a Fuck"": ""bitch I been trill ever since the day I come out my momma's cunt."")</p><p>
     
    As always, it's a good idea to program out the skits, nearly a quarter 
    hour's worth and none particularly funny or interesting. Likewise a few of the tracks are a bit of a drag; you understand she's going 
    through hard times. Unfortunately it's hard to rally behind her when she 
    sounds as enervated as she does on ""Quiet"". On ""All Good"", she freaks a Big line into a decent hook, which sounds good (as Biggie's voice almost always will), but doesn't do much for those who feel she's been riding his coattails ever since his death. On the other hand, if a male MC-- like, say, the Gift of Gab-- affected the flows of as many other rappers as Kim does here (from Big to Eminem to Damian Marley), he'd be called an ""encyclopedia of MC styles.""</p><p>
<i>The Naked Truth isn't quite the masterpiece everyone is angling for in this middling year for rap, when the post-50/T.I. deluge of young bucks with increasingly stupid puns for dealing reached saturation point. Even <em>The 
    Source</em> awarded it a frankly ridiculous five mics, mostly notable because that mag isn't known as a hotbed of female empowerment. While the 
    market is incredibly hostile to female rappers-- though it's 
    heartening to see Crime Mob')""Stilettos (Pumps)"" finally make MTV's Jam of the Week-- </i><i>The Naked Truth may be better than 80% of the other rap albums to be released in 2005, but that don't make it another </i><i>Ready to Die.</i></p></div>"|4995.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4995-the-naked-truth/|7.8|Jess Harvell

    Lyric of the month, easily. And Paul Duncan is true to his word, keeping the yakking to a minimum throughout <em>Be Careful What You Call Home</em>, instead allowing his voice to mingle with the other instruments as just another
    useful wave-form. In fact, this album is so subtle that the first time you
    listen to it, it barely registers, like a ghost whisper or a beige amongst
    browns. But it leaves you with a pleasant sensation and sucks you back for
    more spins, and by the third or fourth time through, it's difficult not to be
    hooked on its blend of pastoral beauty and electronic abstraction.</p><p>
    
    As the album develops its gently experimental approach, Jim O'Rourke and
    Fridge spring to mind as good comparison points, and like them Duncan's drum sound
    warrants its own little mention as a thing of rare beauty. The rest of the
    sonic palette is comprised of Rhodes, bass, glockenspiel, strings, and other
    soft things that sound great put up against the boom of the drums, which
    Duncan chops into new shapes as he sees fit. Duncan's voice is a soft and
    tuneful tenor that slides into that texture as if on a river of Vaseline.</p><p>
    
    ""Oil in the Fields"" is the best distillation of the album's
    overall aesthetic, riding a thumping kick drum, brushed cymbals
    and pretty Rhodes chords, synth counter-melodies tumbling like snow behind
    Duncan's impressionistic verses. ""I remember father's ring/ Remember
    mother's hair/ Don't remember the color of her eyes/ Until I look at mine""
    he sings, and the song follows a free-form structure from there, breathy
    vocal harmonies rising in the middle and glockenspiel leading the walk to
    the end.</p><p>
    
    In a time of hyperactive music, quiet beauty like this is a welcome chance
    to calm the caffeinated nerves. If <em>Be Careful What You Call Home</em> is uniform,
    it's uniform in the right way, wringing a satisfying listen out of a simple
    premise.</p></div>"|2629.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2629-be-careful-what-you-call-home/|7.8|Joe Tangari

Patients have no problem identifying other acquaintances, but the ""imposter"" can drive them to dementia. Coincidentally, Tangiers administers a similar mindfuck. I know, I know, indie has basically engulfed the garage-rock sub-genre since 2002, but that's not assuaging my concerns that <em>The Family Myth</em>'s the Strokes or Walkmen in Tangiers-face. For some reason, Albert Hammond, Jr. can rip Wire and Television riffs helter-skelter, but as soon as Tangiers encroaches on anything pre-1980, whistles blow. Unfair, yes, but that's just the biz.</p><p>
    
    To compensate, Tangiers plays up their ""underdog"" status to a T, which is fine, except the diamond can only hide in the rough for so long. So, in a deft move, the whittled-down songwriting duo of frontman Josh Reichmann and singer/bassist James Sayce have stopped fumbling over tinny Strokes production and instead deliver the raw mod album the Mooney Suzuki never had the sobriety to create. Thus, the underdog becomes alpha wolf as Reichmann and Sayce display an newly discovered authority over their songs.</p><p>
    
    Opener ""Crack Valley"" would've been shackled by half-assed Clash guitars and boombox-quality drum tracks on 2004's <em>Never Bring You Pleasure</em>. Fortunately, the band checks their DIY tendencies at the door, bringing mostly melody and unpredictable tempos to the party. Not to malign their previous catalog, which certainly trumps most of today's post-punk regurgitates, but <em>Family Myth</em> proves fewer studio tricks lead to tighter songwriting. All soulful melodies and tender keyboards, ""That Russian Bastard"" woos the ear enough to excuse the Casablancas mimicry and curiously anti-Russo sentiments. Likewise, ""A Winter's War"" conjures a cuddly Smiths sans sad bastardy and nasal blockage.</p><p>
    
    However, Tangiers hasn't troubleshot all their stylistic errors, namely the anachronistic psych musk creeping through <em>Family Myth</em>. One-dimensional tracks ""The Coast Guard"" and ""I Suggest a Crypt"" sound like the Coral pranking Tangiers, swapping 70s energy with lysergic homogeny. Nevertheless, Tangiers make a good first impression on their Frenchkiss debut, settling comfortably into their status as Canada's ripple-- not direct answer-- to the U.S. garage boom. Props to 'em, but even more power to the hordes of indie taxonomists who can stop fretting over which buzz bin to file the band into.</p></div>"|7936.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7936-the-family-myth/|7.7|Adam Moerder

    is the rare once-was not angling for such faint kudos. Nope, the
    erstwhile Cars front-skinny-man opts with <em>Nexterday</em> for overlookable adult-pop
    sophistication, a humble homemade comedown from its Billy Corgan-produced
    1997 predecessor, heavy near-miss <em>Troublizing</em>. A record for the
    pre-converted, Mr. Porizkova's latest aims not to wow or to woo but
    to waft, stripped down, in the conditioned chill of compact guitar
    squiggles, reverby vox, fastidious drum machines, and pleasant-enough
    platitudes.</p><p>
    
    The for-the-fans approach goes farthest when the geezer in question indulges
    the idiosyncrasies that made him beloved in the first; see Jonathan
    Richman's ongoing efforts. OK, sleek and tight were always Ocasek
    trademarks, but lean doesn't mean bony, and <em>Nexterday</em> wins when
    Ocasek strikes out into quirkier territory. The familiar synths
    are a good start, particularly on catchy ""Come On"", where a classic
    Cars line meets <em>Tango in the Night</em> sparkle. Playful lyrics crop
    up intermittently, as on ""Don't Lose Me"", with couplets like ""Don't
    let me down/ Don't take my red chromium cup"", and ""Carousel"", where
    clean guitar revolves carousel-like around a child-simple bass
    and Ocasek's still-Louie ""Silly clown/ There's rain in your shoes.""</p><p>
    
    But while Ocasek may play most of the instruments here, the songs
    often could be anybody's; see the lowlights of last year's Finn
    Brothers' return. ""I just want to hold you tight/ Make sure everything
    it feels all right,"" Ocasek opines over too-pristinely chugga-chugging
    guitars on ""Bottom Dollar"", sounding more like a neutered Tom Petty.
    Soft-loud dynamics on opener ""Crackpot"" are torpedoed by excessively
    inoffensive production. ""Please Don't Let Me Down"" echoes ""Don't Lose
    Me"" (""don't let me down"") and ""Carousel"" (""I'm going round and round"")
    in regretful guitar ballad form. Sometimes dude's entirely half-assed:
    On ""In a Little Bit"", with a ""Down Under"" rhythm, Ocasek's all, ""In a
    little bit you will know/ If it's all just rigmarole.""</p><p>
    
    Then again, an old new waver who has it all and a bag of Circuit City
    royalty checks can be expected to sound a little complacent-- almost
    excused for it. Especially when he buries a couple of subtle pleasures
    toward the end of the album: Best Hiccupping Chorus goes to simple,
    catchy love ditty ""Heard About You"", and Best Guitar Solo (in a
    Lindsey Buckingham role) goes to closer ""It Gets Crazy"", which
    <em>Nexterday</em> unfortunately never does. Maybe tomorrow?</p></div>"|5935.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5935-nexterday/|6.2|Marc Hogan

Elvis had hit merely 18 years prior; Janis Joplin, Jim Morrison, Jimi Hendrix, and the Beatles had died or called it quits only three or four years earlier. Bob Dylan had been at it for a while and potentially seemed dated, though he was still only 33. The weight of pop music history was something that could be shrugged off, and with so much unexplored territory, bands felt an obligation to see where rock music might yet go.</p>
<p>In this environment Springsteen was just 24, still a kid; he'd been hailed as the New Dylan and had recorded two quirky albums but he wasn't a star. He had talent and ambition in equal measure but the thing that would put him over was his vision. Springsteen believed like no one else in the power and possibility of rock, which led him to places that seem strange and maybe even awkward to those who grew up with MTV and everything punk came to symbolize. His naïve but inspiring outlook found its purist expression in <i>Born to Run</i>, which Columbia has now reissued in a deluxe <i>30th Anniversary Edition</i> packaged with two feature films-- one documentary and one concert-- on DVD.</p>
<p><i>Born to Run</i> is a distinctive record, even in the Springsteen canon. Its world is one of impossibly romantic hyperrealism, where the mundane easily becomes fantastic, and it all happens line by line. Picture the depressed state of the Jersey Shore in the early 70s, the dull sense of an era gone, and then check Springsteen's description in the title track: ""The amusement park rises bold and stark and kids are huddled on the beach in the mist."" This could have been a couple of bored teenagers sitting on a bench bullshitting, but with Springsteen's imagery, some glockenspiel, and a deep sax drone, it's transformed into filmic splendor. The next phrase ups the ante: ""I want to die with you, Wendy, on the streets tonight in an everlasting kiss."" From one angle it's the kind of line that can make you wince, at best a silly emo cliché. The way Springsteen sang it in 1974, it wasn't a dorky diary confessional; it was unhinged expressionism, Kerouac with a bottle of red wine in his stomach. While everyone was zoning out in front of the TV this scruffy dude saw an opera out on the turnpike and a ballet being fought in the alley.</p>
<p>He wants to know if love is wild and real, he says, but reality isn't a particularly useful concept in the context of this record. A masterpiece <i>Born to Run</i> may be, but only on its own terms. Springsteen at this point didn't know much about women or relationships (""She's the One"" is powerful and catchy but fails as a portrait of an actual person) but he had an instinct for drama, and his stories focus on plot and circumstance rather than character. Nearly every song touches on the central mythical image of the rock'n'roll era, the ideas of escape and abandon. The protagonist in ""Thunder Road"" thinks everything will change if he can make it out of town. The workers in ""Night"" suppress their daily rage by disappearing into a dark theater of sex after the whistle blows. Conflicts are all man vs. environment and man vs. society; Springsteen would get around to man vs. himself later, after he'd settled down and lived a little more.</p>
<p>The size extends to the sound, greatly improved on this reissue with the first wholesale remastering since it was first released on CD. Phil Spector was a well-known obsession of Springsteen's at the time, a logical complement to the room-sized thematic canvas he'd stretched. ""Jungleland"" and ""Backstreets"" are famously epic, but shorter songs like ""Thunder Road"" and ""She's the One"" seem constructed as mini-suites, with tinkly intros building to immense climaxes. The title track was Springsteen's ""Good Vibrations"", toiled over endlessly in the studio and smothered with endless layers of god knows what before finally being abandoned, flawed and perfect, to the loving arms of radio. His voice would never sound quite this strong again-- perhaps he never pushed it as hard-- and the slap-echo trailing a split second behind adds to the effect.</p>
<p>The first DVD, a complete 1975 show from the Hammersmith Odeon, is a major find. For someone like me who never got over the disappointment of only one song from 1975 on the <i>Live 1975-85</i> box, this film is a revelation. The opening piano and harmonica version of ""Thunder Road"" is the scene setter, with a dim spotlight on Springsteen alone on a darkened stage and Roy Bittan playing somewhere behind. When the rest of the band joins him they have a ball, with a performance in turns earnest, theatrical, melodramatic, and clowning. It's an absolutely essential item in the Springsteen discography.</p>
<p><i>Wings for Wheels</i>, the VH-1-ish documentary on the making of the record, is a third too long and will be of only marginal interest for anyone other than committed fans, but there's still something important here. If you can get past the repetitive and fawning testimonials from the band, producers, manager, etc., there's a wealth of information about the technical process of the album, with demonstrations of how songs evolved over time. Hearing the various parts of the dense ""Born to Run"" picked apart, for example, just the acoustic guitar or saxophone isolated, is like a mini course on how songs are mixed.</p>
<p>There's also Springsteen's own commentary on the songs-- what they mean and how he wrote them-- which is interesting if not always consistent with how I hear the record. When he says toward the end of the film that <i>Born to Run</i> was ""the album where I left behind my adolescent definitions of love and freedom-- it was the dividing line,"" it seems to me he's exactly wrong. A dividing line may be visible, but <i>Born to Run</i> lies entirely on the dreamy and reckless side of maturity and is all the better for it. Every young person should be so lucky, to have a time in his or her life when the inflated romanticism of <i>Born to Run</i> makes perfect sense.</p></div>"|7728.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7728-born-to-run-30th-anniversary-edition/|10.0|Mark Richardson

Modest Mouse's music, more so than with many other bands, is nearly inseparable from the musicians themselves. Isaac Brock's spitting delivery determines the vocal melodies and his particular hardluck perspective determines his logic-puzzle lyrics. But his voice and words are only two gears in a much larger mechanism, and as such, for better or worse, they depend on the other cogs to turn them-- the rangey guitarwork that trails through the songs like sparks off a campfire, the staggering and surprisingly melodic basslines of Eric Judy, the strength and fluidity of Jeremiah Green's drumwork.  They don't attempt many versions of others' songs, either; in fact, their only recorded cover to date is an instrumental-- Santo &amp; Johnny's ""Sleepwalk""-- to which they added dreamy vocals, nocturnal lyrics, and a descending arc of guitar notes to offset the moody original.</p><p>
    
    Suffice it to say, Kozelek gets mauled on <em>Tiny Cities</em>. He attempts 11 covers, including tracks from every Modest Mouse full-length-- from <em>Sad Sappy Sucker</em> to <em>Good News for People Who Love Bad News</em>-- but his band only takes one or two musical elements from the Modest Mouse originals, so the songs sound pale and diminished compared to your memory of their source. Like Modest Mouse, Sun Kil Moon work best when Kozelek controls every aspect of their music, from the lyrics to the arrangements to the instrumentation. Brock's lyrics only highlight Kozelek's limitations as a singer: He has a commanding voice but molasses phrasing, which restricts the versatility of his interpretations. And Sun Kil Moon don't show as much range on <em>Tiny Cities</em> as they did on their debut, <em>Ghost of the Great Highway</em>. Their tasteful Americana is long on atmosphere but short on real dynamics: Most of these tracks sound more or less uniform, which is odd considering the variety of the Modest Mouse versions.</p><p>
    
    Divorced from their original contexts, Brock's lyrics don't fit easily into Sun Kil Moon songs. ""Tiny Cities Made of Ashes"" suffers worst, trading the original's bizarre bass bounce and aggrieved alienation for a lackadaisical pace and chiming vocals. Kozelek punctuates each line with an awkward two-syllable theme, sung in a slightly higher register-- ""oh no"" or ""my throat"" or ""coca-COLA"". It's an awkward fit for elements that didn't translate well. Nothing else is quite so egregious, but most of these tracks sound silly as they try to anchor Modest Mouse's otherworldly songs to an earthly sound. ""Dramamine"" and ""Convenient Parking"" attempt to churn up dark tension, but fall flat. On ""Never-Ending Math Equation"" Kozelek switches out the accents and long notes in the vocal melodies, but it's ruined by the mumbling chorus that attempts to literalize infinity. And the closer, ""Ocean Breathes Salty"", sounds particularly guileless and mopey in this strictly acoustic setting, a coffeehouse encore that carries little impact.</p><p>
    
    Despite the stumbles, Kozelek does get a few good hits in before the bear devours him. A short take on ""Exit Does Not Exist"" contains a hint of an overture: Atop a gently plucked guitar, Kozelek sings, ""I hear voices insinuating/ Feeds me words to this song that I am singing""-- using Brock's words to explain and maybe even apologize for the project. The string arrangements stand out on ""Space Travel Is Boring"" and ""Jesus Christ Was an Only Child"", suggesting the weightlessness of the former and the infinite uncertainty of the latter. ""Grey Ice Water"" comes across as the most successful undertaking: Against a snare drum rhythm that scratches out a steady march tempo, Kozelek plays up the song's implied narrative, creating the sense of a long distance traveled-- which recalls the road-trip aesthetic of Modest Mouse's <em>This Is a Long Drive for Someone With Nothing to Think About and </em><em>The Lonesome Crowded West</em>. But such moments are very dim lights in a dark space, and only serve to highlight the major flaw of <em>Tiny Cities</em>: These tracks are botched experiments that can't even function as interesting failures.</p></div>"|7723.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7723-tiny-cities/|3.0|Stephen M.

    off in the distant consciousness, naturalist in ethos, quiet and
    precise in sound. Fuck a myth though (if you must, ""the music is
    organized around the conceptual theme of birds constructing nests""),
    and a wood cult too, cause the coercion just cheapens it. What's
    there is enough-- tired three-chord progressions, ineffable human noises,
    long silences, and longer delays: <i>Stories for Owls</i> finds its
    real charm in the absence of dictation.</p><p>
    
    The pieces fall out, nametags pre-applied, with Ben Chasny (Six Organs
    of Admittance) and Deerhoof refugee Rob Fisk at work together as
    Badgerlore from as far back as 1998, here with two new players, Tom Carter
    (Charalambides) and Pete Swanson (Yellow Swans). Sound expansion's
    the upside, extra blood yielding an easy interplay between warbling
    organs and guitars, wordless vocals, and gentle tape manipulations.
    Organic sure, but the <i>Stories for Owls</i> touchstones are, in
    their intellectualism and breadth, surprisingly more art than folk,
    recalling Eno's <i>Ambient</i> series, Laurie Anderson's warmer vocal
    narcissism, and even John Cale's early, occasional organ visitations.</p><p>
    
    At their most bare, as on ""Stone Stick Earth Brick"", Badgerlore
    stitch full-grown songs out of one or two aural ideas. The jump-off's
    a lackadaisical three strums, the gaps between iterations filled in by
    sympathetic note clusters and, later, by falsetto harmonies. The
    vocals, gradually manipulated, circle up and up, filling space
    formerly uninhabited and stark. Less
    structured and more purely ambient is ""String Wrist"", anchored by
    organ that fades off away from the speakers, the echo buoyed by two
    guitars and epic delays. Even the silences go long, interrupted only
    by fragile bursts of keys, pulling together, with only a few sounds,
    an almost subconscious logic. ""III"" follows the same meandering path:
    broken teeth piano, shimmering and bent guitar, banging away with
    what's at hand.</p><p>
    
    But all good intentions to one side; the medium, round here, is the
    message. Meaning inclusive, back-to-nature forest music must include,
    or it's cruel before it's kind. So credit the appeal, on top of a
    very generous sound, to a rare transparency. In the record's silences,
    you can actually hear hands on strings, and then the pluck, pull and
    plectrum that give rise again to their unadorned sound. The harmonica
    of ""Your Discomfort, My Happiness"" is not so much played as breathed
    in and out of; the only song to feature remotely traditional playing
    (a sort of bare-bones raga gesture), the players are all nearly as
    audible as their instruments. This melding goes literal in the all
    vocal, all four players farewell ""Building a Nest"", which bypasses the
    instruments entirely in favor of the instrumentalists. Otherworldly
    is not the word, though it's tempting; fact is, it's easy to see where
    <i>Stories for Owls</i> comes from.</p></div>"|525.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/525-stories-for-owls/|7.4|Zach Baron

Known primarily for their 
    contributions to <i>Totals <em>2</em> und </i><i>3-- the anti-gravity ballad ""One, Two, 
    Three (No Gravity)"" and the fat, chiming techno of ""Departures"", 
    respectively-- the duo of Dirk Leyers and Matias Aguayo also released the criminally ignored </i><i>After Love. The 
    thick, throbbing electro (which sounds right on time in 2005) of </i><i>After 
    Love was a Trojan horse for Aguayo's lecherous whispers, which ranged 
    from dirty (""ride ride me baby"") to plain bizarre (""day by day I love to 
    shave myself""-- wtf?).</i></p><p>
    
    When Closer Musik quietly imploded, the generally held belief was that 
    Leyers was responsible for the musik and Aguayo for the sleaze that elevated 
    it beyond straight techno/electro. Leyers' 2005 single ""Wellen"", also for 
    Kompakt, reveled in the bubbling, melodic strains of CM tracks like 
    ""Departures"" and ""Maria"". So it's unsurprising that Aguayo's debut album 
    under his own name continues in the minimalist grind he brought to ""Closer 
    Dancer"" and ""Ride"". Aguayo describes his music as ""for the city and for the 
    night,"" and <i>Are You Really Lost? definitely fits that description, for 
    better or worse.</i></p><p>
    
    Aguyao produced the album himself with help from Marcus Rossknecht, and the 
    sound is noticeably thinned out from the Closer Musik days (no more wormlike 
    basslines or bright, toppy melodics). This is a record designed for 
    headphones; listened to at normal volume on a stereo, large swathes of it 
    are swallowed up by its own dynamics. Aguayo's voice isn't quite so affected 
    anymore; unfortunately, this has stripped his delivery of some of its charm 
    and directness. Plus his lyrics are still largely nonsensical come-ons, that 
    is when they're not husky breaths or sexual nonsense delivered as if it was 
    going to magically unzip flies. When it works, as on the title track or 
    ""New Life"", it's as odd and shivery as the Closer Musik material. When it 
    doesn't, as on ""Radiotaxi"" or ""So in Love"", it just feels forced.</p><p>
    
    Like 2005's other electro-sleaze notable, Chelonis R. Jones' <i>Dislocated 
    Genius, Aguayo's debut isn't wholly successful. Sometimes in all the 
    skittering rhythms and thick, musky, dusky production murk you long for a 
    big fat hook. But Aguayo's vision is still creepy and seductive, especially 
    when viewed through the de-sexualized lens of so much European house and 
    techno. It's a bit like Ralf leaning over to slip his tongue in Florian's 
    ear.</i></p></div>"|489.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/489-are-you-really-lost/|6.9|Jess Harvell

Dios have erased their charming West Coast psychedelica, full of carefully furrowed details and clever Beach Boys tributes. It's as if conceding to Ronnie James Dio and adding a parenthetical to their name meant conceding to make more populist middle-of-the-road rock, because their second self-titled (but not redundantly titled) record turns the dial from Brian Wilson to Joe Walsh.</p><p>
    
    Opener ""Feels Good Being Somebody"" throws out several leaden one-liners (""I take drugs/ But sadly I can't afford 'em"") over stilted muted chords, then adding a bright jangle to lyrics about singing ""a little song called marijuana in the sun"" and, finally, ""see how they run."" From there the songs go through several inventive instrumental shifts, though they all recall the broadest touchstones of late-1960s and early-70s rock. ""Say Anything"" turns a gentle guitar pluck and drum machine into nondescript navel-gazing ""Dear Prudence"" clone, and there's a bit of swing to the southern-fried guitar licks of ""I Want it All"", but the swaying campfire strum of ""So Do I"" is a sterling example of why artists should never build rhyme schemes around the word ""high."" (Chorus: ""I get high/ So do I!"") Were there some variation to the flat-footed rhythms, were the guitar parts and organ flourishes not so predictable, they might get away with it, but the lyrics are always the focal point.</p><p>
    
    Further into the record, the band invests in smaller details, and when it does the songs overcome the lyrical shortcomings. The lurching tempo changes and keyboard effects of ""I Feel Fine all the Time"" elevate its simple melody, and the joy of studio manipulation is more palpable here, perhaps because the structure's a little looser. ""Goin' Home"" shares that same informal feel, with a layer of radio static reinforcing adding a claustrophobic air to the words (""I'm over everybody/ I've got no patience left""), and the band dynamics feeling less rehearsed and stiff, tempos dropping and picking up while a few jagged guitar lines dart in and out.</p><p>
    
    It's difficult to hold the rest against them, because the approach hasn't changed, really-- feeding 60s rock through an earnest, austere indie filter. The lyrics from the previous self-titled album didn't merit a Nobel or anything, but they weren't this distracting. Rock isn't poetry, and there's always a balance between clever and phonetically pleasing lyrics; But when playing in a style this broad and predictable, you ought to say more than dios (malos) do in ""Grrl:"" ""I'll love you to the end (2x)/ Psyche, I'm just kidding.""</p></div>"|2545.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2545-dios-malos/|6.1|Jason Crock

Back then they smirked at the world from underneath green hair dye, and goaded suburban children into gleeful mud fights. More than a decade later, their superstardom is a mascara-clouded mess of sloganeering, middle age, and punk rock lip service, and the firebrand moments in 2004's <em>American Idiot</em> diminish with every millionth unit shifted. Sure, there was the thrilling riff and yawp of the album's title track, way back when. That one had some curled lip. And ""Holiday"" had its ""HEY!""s and ""AMEN!""s. Those never go out of style. But by ""Wake Me Up When September Ends"" it was unclear what <em>Idiot</em> was supposed to mean in the first place. The record still had its thematic scope, and subtitled set pieces, but with the singles played to death it was starting to sound really, really flat. ""September"" itself was the soggiest, a melodramatic wallow in the vein of ""Good Riddance"". And it contained none of the danger and fun that Billie Joe Armstrong had congratulated himself for bringing back to rock 'n' roll during his acceptance of the Best Rock Album Grammy for <em>American Idiot</em>.</p><p>
    In theory Green Day's still singing to those suburban mudslingers, the '90s kids who grew up to find only apathy, fear, and nothingness beyond the fast food wrappers and blaring televisions. But <em>American Idiot</em>'s rage seems more like artifice now, especially when it's performed from a stage of Stonesian proportions. That's what the band's new CD/DVD set <em>Bullet in a Bible</em> documents, recounting their show this past summer at the National Bowl in Milton Keynes. ""I'm not a part of a redneck agenda!"" Armstrong rails at the disc's outset, and the crowd of 65,000-plus go completely bonkers. Green Day continue through the ""Jesus of Suburbia"" suite, ""Holiday"", and ""Are We the Waiting"" before throwing in ""Longview"" for old times' sake, which leads into ""Brain Stew"" and ""Basket Case"" for the only stretch when <em>Bullet</em> sounds really alive. At least those songs are from an era when Green Day sounded like a band that didn't give a shit. With <em>American Idiot</em> they have a real problem, because, as <em>Bullet in a Bible</em>'s very existence proves, their big Message Record is also a Monstrous Hit. They might have meant to beat against the Head Redneck's agenda, might have wanted to bury a punk rock pipe bomb at the intersection between populist politics and the Blue Collar Comedy Tour. But here's <em>Bullet in a Bible</em> just in time for the holidays, the commercialistic addendum to Idiot's supposed apathetic anthems. Now everybody do the propaganda.</p><p>
    Green Day can't go backward. They can't return to <em>Dookie</em>'s frolic, can't preach danger and fun when all they're really making with <em>Bullet in a Bible</em> is a Green Day'd version of Running on Empty. (There's nothing here as hilariously cheesy as ""The Road"", but a few of Armstrong's interview segments on the DVD have the clichéd ""I don't know/We do so many shows in row"" air of the traveling rock superstar.) The set is loud, and Tré cool's bass drum often resounds like he's banging a huge pedal on the side of Texas Stadium. But <i>Bullet in a Bible is just self-indulgence packaged as memory. Green Day's new suburban fans will buy it; they don't remember the band's bratty days, and instead fell in love with Billie Joe's pegged pants. But whatever the band was selling with <em>American Idiot</em> didn't keep. If anything, <em>Idiot</em> and </i><i>Bullet make Green Day's next move even more pressurized. Can they be effective punk revivalists when their biggest hits sag with the ennui of middle age? Can they once again make us believe they care about our worthless trash culture lives when the records they write contribute to that superficiality? Doubtful. </i></p></div>"|3569.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3569-bullet-in-a-bible/|3.0|Johnny Loftus

    the music of Junior Senior, I wouldn't have pegged
    them as Neil Young fanatics. When the Danish duo came
    dancing across the water with their giddy 2003 debut
    <em>D-D-D-Don't Stop the Beat</em>, their message was one of
    gleeful disinhibition, hopscotching their way through
    any genre that falls under the wide umbrella of ""dance
    music."" Neil Young? He's more into songs about
    apocalypses, overdoses, and genocides.</p><p>
    Nevertheless, indie rock refugees Jesper ""Junior""
    Mortensen and Jeppe ""Senior"" Laursen invoke the Chief
    Rustie's ode to Johnny Rotten as the title to their
    sophomore effort, the crucial addition of a ""yo yo""
    bending the original song to fit their mission
    statement: It's better to freak out than to mope away. Sadly, there are no soul-funk-disco-garage reworkings
    of ""Like a Hurricane"" to be found on <em>Hey Hey My My Yo
    Yo</em>, though there are certainly echoes of the pure,
    simple joy found in the famous one-note solo of
    ""Cinnamon Girl"". You see, Junior Senior loves to
    dance, yeah. Yeah? Yeah.</p><p>
    Those who never saw Junior Senior, with their sexual
    preference goofing and affected stuttering, as
    anything more than a gimmick might be surprised they've issued a second record, much
    less one that improves on their debut. But skeptics be damned that's
    just what <em>Hey Hey My My Yo Yo</em> is, an improvement and
    distillation of the duo's sound. It might not have an
    icebreaking single like ""Move Your Feet"", but
    it's much more consistent. Chalk it up to
    Junior and Senior easing off the genre promiscuity and
    settling on a sound that shopping-sprees its way
    through dance-floor history: The sequined strings of
    disco, the driving guitars of funk, the shout-along
    backing vocals of girl-group Motown, the dopey-rhyme
    silliness of early rap, and handclaps, handclaps,
    handclaps.</p><p>
    After graciously thanking us, Jay-Z style, for buying
    our album, ""Hip Hop a Lula"" serves as the thesis
    statement for their proud new musical cocktail, right
    down to the evolution-charting name of the song.
    Trading in hokey rhymes (""Take me down to the parallel
    city/ Where the music's loud and the boys are pretty""),
    the track's aspect ratio widens out to Go! Team-like
    cop-show fanfares and violin crescendos then shrinks
    down to crisp, percussive electro, all in the time it
    takes to microwave popcorn.</p><p>
    The Danes also spruce up their sound with guest vocalists-- female singers recruited from other bands, and the
    band's own Velvelettes-- who appear on the mic as often
    as Junior and Senior themselves. Grrl-group Le Tigre appears on no less than five
    tracks, returning the favor for the awesome
    Junior Senior remix of ""Nanny Nanny Boo Boo"" currently
    working the DJ circuit. The Tigres sound like they
    haven't had so much fun since their politics eclipsed
    their playfulness, whether singing backup on ""We R the
    Handclaps"" or enthusiastically dueting with the leads
    on the crisp synth-funk of ""Can I Get Get Get"" or the
    delirious ""Dance Chance Romance"". ""Take My Time""
    takes an even more direct nostalgia-mining route,
    recruiting Cindy Wilson and Kate Pierson from the
    B-52s for some cross-generational party-rock.</p><p>
    Throughout <em>Hey Hey My My Yo Yo</em>, Junior Senior
    repeatedly thwart the impulse to perceive them as
    disposable or disco-era re-enactors,
    resisting the novelty label at every step. It's easy
    to forget that underneath the often silly lyrics lies a
    great deal of musicality, with the band tackling the
    Cinerama sounds of disco and Motown accurately and playfully.
    But most importantly, Junior Senior have fun and are
    funny without ever falling back on a wink; like the
    Darkness, their passion for neglected genres is too
    infectious to scoff at even when they plainly,
    earnestly proclaim ""I Like Music"" on the album's best
    track. Such a statement may not carry the hipster
    cache of ""rock and roll will never die,"" but it's no
    less clichéd, and certainly just as true.</p></div>"|4318.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4318-hey-hey-my-my-yo-yo/|7.9|Rob Mitchum

    acclaim from self-released obscurity in a matter of months. For a lot
    of bands, the vault to fame (at least fame in the world of blogs and
    webzines and music junkies) would be either paralyzing or ego-inflating, but
    neither affliction seems to have come over them. They simply took their
    time, toured a bit, re-issued their debut on a label, and refined their
    craft.</p><p>
<em>Under an Hour</em>, Menomena's honestly-titled second album (it's 54 minutes
    long), is frankly so different from their debut that it's hardly worth
    comparing the two. For one thing, it's made up of three long instrumentals
    composed to soundtrack the work of a dance troupe called the Monster Squad,
    a nominal association that seems almost too perfect. Menomena originally
    played these three compositions over a three-day span at the T:BA:04
    time-based art festival in Portland, Ore., each one accompanying a different
    Monster Squad routine-- judging from the photos on their website, it was an
    interesting series of performances. The titles of the songs
    straightforwardly describe the foreign materials used during each dance:
    ""Water"", ""Flour"", and ""Light"".</p><p>
    
    Of course, when you listen to the album, you can't see anyone dancing, so
    how cool it all looked and sounded when it was happening is somewhat moot.
    That's okay; unlike many soundtrack/installation pieces, it's quite
    listenable on its own, falling roughly in the same chamber music realm as
    Rachel's or Max Richter, though more stretched out and less orchestral.
    In a way, it's a logical extension of the way the band uses shifting
    textures and musical juxtapositions in the service of its pop songs. Each piece embodies a handful of themes and cycles its way unhurried
    through them, returning to them occasionally and slowly altering the
    instrumentation. Each piece has multiple tension points and crescendos to
    keep your ear engaged for a hard listen, but it honestly works best as
    background music.</p><p>
    
    ""Water"" is, humorously, the most fluid piece on the album,
    opening with a disarming banjo part and relying primarily on piano for its
    backbone. Acoustic guitar and what sounds like violin but might not be give
    the music heavy emotional weight, but the lack of a sturdy rhythm track
    makes it simultaneously dreamy and inviting. ""Flour"" is the most
    rhythm-conscious song, built mainly around a staccato sax figure and
    featuring some stunning crescendoes built around cymbal-heavy drumming.
    Glockenspiel tinkles in the background, balancing the aggression of the sax
    part and smoothly introducing the piano-dominated mid-section. ""Light""
    layers long guitar and organ drones for more than five minutes, flirting
    with unsettling dissonance. Rhythm slowly begins to emerge through mild
    interruptions until finally we're left with nothing but a steady morse-code
    pulse, which the band then builds into the next section with clipped
    percussion samples and, ultimately, live drumming.</p><p>
    
    Luckily, Menomena's artistic success doesn't seem
    to be changing them a great deal. Their website is still absolutely
    mind-melting, they've applied a superfluous parental advisory sticker to
    their album art, and they're as musically adventurous as ever.</p></div>"|5556.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5556-under-an-hour/|7.9|Joe Tangari

Earlier this year, the former Royal Trux monarch released <em>All-Night Fox</em>, the first CD credited to his new combo the Howling Hex. For their follow-up <em>You Can't Beat Tomorrow</em>, Hagerty and company have heedlessly raised the ante, combining a CD of new material with a DVD containing the ""pilot episode"" of the Howling Hex's new variety show. It all makes for a package as inexplicable as it sounds, but it might be the most consistently engaging music of Hagerty's post-Trux career.</p><p>
<em>You Can't Beat Tomorrow</em> isn't Hagerty's first foray into the video arts. In 1992, he and Royal Trux-partner Jennifer Herrema made the paranoiac, drug-addled rockumentary <em>What Is Royal Trux?</em> wherein, among other things, the duo was pursued by Nixon-masked government agents. By that chaotic standard, the video presentation of <em>You Can't Beat Tomorrow</em> seems relatively subdued, featuring a vivid collage of newspaper clippings, stock footage, and crude animations alongside the Hex's staged musical performances. This pilot sports the type of dimly-lit, shot-on-VHS production one might identify with late-1980s cable access programming, which does give the proceedings a certain homely, DIY charm.</p><p>
    
    The DVD's longest non-musical segment is a rudimentary cartoon that follows the activities of what appears to be a monkey (the protagonist from Hagerty's 1997 novel <em>Victory Chimp</em>, perhaps?) and his friends working down at Henry's bar. Amusing though it is, if this diversion was intended to have some larger overriding point I'm afraid I missed it. Elsewhere, though, Hagerty does make a few clumsy attempts at satirical media commentary, such as on the short, nonsensical ""making-of"" documentary or the Howling Hex's 2003 TV commercial that the DVD includes as ""extras."" If the rest of this disc is intended as a broad media lampoon, however, it rings hollow and strangely anachronistic, as perhaps somebody should gently inform Hagerty that variety shows such as he's spoofing aren't really produced any more, if they ever were.</p><p>
    
    The Howling Hex fare considerably better on <em>You Can't Beat Tomorrow</em>'s musical portion, although characteristically Hagerty's new material sounds almost totally unlike that on All-Night Fox. Hagerty is here backed by the Texas roots-rock outfit The Theater Fire, who augment these songs with banjo, accordion, fiddle and trumpet. As can be seen on the DVD, tracks like ""Cobra Heart"" feature as many as four guitarists, yet the album retains a tinny, sepia-toned veneer, as though all of the musicians were forced to perform gathered around a single vintage microphone. Nevertheless, songs like the atmospheric ""No Numbers"", or the instantly catchy title track are as appealing as any Hagerty's cut in years, with the expanded group's grainy tang landing somewhere between the Allman Brothers and <i>The Basement Tapes. As with <em>All-Night Fox</em>, the highlights here are enough to suggest that perhaps Hagerty has turned yet another artistic corner, and to spur on the fading hope that at some point he'll again be able to squarely direct all his flighty ambitions into one decisive (and preferably musical) statement.</i></p></div>"|4004.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4004-you-cant-beat-tomorrow/|6.9|Matthew Murphy

    their brilliant debut, <em>Poems to a Pawnshop</em>, a lot has changed for the band. 
    The group moved from the indie music Mecca of the south-- Athens, Georgia-- to Brooklyn, while at the same time the shaggy-haired style of that debut-- rollicking guitars, catchy leads, sing-along choruses and slightly off-key harmonies-- has been marginalized in the current indie landscape. Over that time, the Mendoza Line have slid toward alt-country while retaining a great deal of their initial charm.</p><p>
    
    Seventh album <em>Full of Light and Full of Fire</em> isn't exactly a concept record, but it's definitely held together by a few running lyrical themes. Songs bounce between narratives about love and loneliness and more sociopolitcal topics such as women's rights in Saudi Arabia and President Bush. Fortunately, band's primary songwriters, Shannon McArdle and Timothy Bracy, are adept at presenting heavy topics with a light hand. Nothing here feels like soapboxing; instead, the lyrics are subtle and poignant, with as much emphasis on storytelling as dissent.</p><p>
    
    The songs addressing more personal matters are especially affecting. ""Water Surrounds"" deals with a single mother suffering from post-partum depression who is afraid to tell anyone how she feels. McArdle's delicate voice 
    gives life to the lyrics, and the sadness surrounding the song's 
    narrator is apparent. On ""Settle Down Zelda"", Bracy sings of a fiery, 
    life-hardened woman dealing with the hand that's been dealt to her. 
    Perhaps she finds the right companion in the end, however, as Bracy 
    croons, ""Hey baby it don't mean shit to me/ That you got a history/ 
    God knows that we've both been around,"" in his typically nasal fashion. </p><p>
    
    Musically, the disc runs the gamut from slow, dusty ballads to tight, 
    barroom rock songs. ""Rat's Alley"" recalls the Pretenders' ""Middle of 
    the Road"", and slaps catchy acoustic leads over upbeat, jangly indie 
    rock. ""Golden Boy (Torture in the Shed)"" is a driving, mid-tempo 
    beast, with squealing, noisy guitars and a drumbeat that relies 
    almost solely on snare drum. McArdle's stark vocals are front and 
    center, demanding attention. One of the best assets the band has is 
    the dueling male/female vocals, best exemplified on closer ""Our Love Is Like a Wire"", a tender love 
    song about an elderly couple recounting the years 
    they've spent together. The applause that begins and ends the track 
    conjures visions of couples like Johnny and June Carter Cash, singing 
    to one another, almost oblivious to the crowd in front of them. It's 
    a sweet end to a disc full of songs of bitterness, loneliness, and 
    disillusion.</p></div>"|5228.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5228-full-of-light-and-full-of-fire/|6.6|Cory D. Byrom

Buried in this applause a female voice shouts, ""Conor, I love you!"". Not ""you rock,"" not ""I love your music,"" but ""I love <em>you</em>."" It's a helpful clue toward understanding his widespread popularity-- Oberst's intimate, earnest music is calibrated for maximum personal identification; it's an invitation for fans to feel not just privy to his private life, but complicit in it. The magnetism of the music is in its jolts of recognition, those moments when mental states that one thought were private, from within the solipsism of youth, are revealed as universal.</p><p> 
    Another telling audience response occurs during the quiet rendition of ""Landlocked Blues"", when a smattering of cheers follows the line ""If you love something, give it away."" It could refer to Oberst's songs, with their tacit promise to not simply entertain, but to unveil something of the messy humanity of their author. In fact, it's a summary of Oberst's entire lyrical perspective and the collective twentysomething suburban worldview it excavates, an expression of the tension between two conflicting desires: For lasting security and galvanizing change. Musically, Oberst finds himself in a similarly transitional state, somewhere between the tortured no-fi manqué he was and the mellowed country singer he's becoming, and the same tension that enriches his lyrics creates some minor hitches in his musical delivery.</p><p> 
    The Bright Eyes I grew up with-- literally, we being the same age-- was always best on his own. I must've seen him play at least 10 times in my late teens and early twenties, and the most memorable performance of them all was a post-<em>Fevers and Mirrors</em> solo show where he shuddered, sweated, whispered, and howled over shattered-glass chords. Emotional and musical nudity make good bedfellows. And while all those vocal tics are still intact, they've been subdued-- probably for the best, in the long run. But for now, he sounds like he's still working out a new way of singing that suits the thicker country-rock arrangements he began to favor on <em>Lifted</em>, sometimes faltering in a sort of stifled mid-range. </p><p> 
    His band is tight, but Oberst sounds a bit tense and weighed down on heavily embellished tracks like ""At the Bottom of Everything"" and <em>Lua</em> B-side ""True Blue"". The tuneless protest song ""When the President Talks to God"" is another hat that doesn't quite fit, although it's pretty clearly included for political and not musical reasons, and draws approving screams from the audience. Oberst trips over a cover of Feist's wonderful ""Mushaboom"", failing to really own its tripping melody, faring better on Elliot Smith's ""The Biggest Lie"". But the most glaring example of Oberst attempting to overwrite the old Bright Eyes comes with <em>Fevers and Mirrors</em>' ""A Scale, a Mirror and Those Indifferent Clocks"", here tellingly billed simply as ""Scale"". Instead of reproducing its original muzziness, he couches it in <em>I'm Wide Awake, It's Morning</em>'s genial country style, and it sounds good, if a little defanged. </p><p> 
    Barring ""True Blue"" and ""When the President Talks to God"", each of which weds overly clever lyrics to lackluster arrangements, nothing on <em>Motion Sickness</em> falls terribly flat-- the several uncertain-sounding tunes are simply a bit tepid, and the remainder are lovely. Oberst sounds great on ""Make War"", against its lean backdrop of guitar, pedal steel and light percussion, working the dreamy melody with aplomb and timing his screams effectively with the musical crescendos. On ""Landlocked Blues"" he seems relaxed, comfortable amid the barely-there guitars. His voice softens and opens up, threading a tremulous quaver through its easy melody. When the horn section makes a late appearance, it's effective, punctuating the quiet expanse that came before it. ""Method Acting"" plays well, avoiding swollen gestures in favor of sharp, driving rock, and ""Southern State"" is terrific, as Oberst sings confidently over a gentle arrangement including a horn solo that's expressive, not bombastic. He simply doesn't wear bombast as convincingly as he once did, and seems to know it-- this album finds him maneuvering toward a new equilibrium, one that's shaping up, judging from its most successful tracks, to be as measured and deliberate as his old songs were anarchic and accidental. </p></div>"|945.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/945-motion-sickness/|7.0|Brian Howe

    eras of revival, but without the original contexts in place, the full-fledged whallop of revelation
    just isn't there. Even if the listener's approaching the sounds for
    the first time, they've ineluctably heard the ingredients' echoes. To at least maximize the effects
    of an aesthetic overlap, the timing of the reissue ought to be
    dead-on. So, though welcome and much appreciated, thank you, Lilith's
    officially licensed reissue of Brian Eno's 1978 <em>No New York</em> No Wave
    sampler, which he did for the Island subsidiary Antilles, has appeared
    a tad late. (It's more than surprising that sans some Japanese bootlegs,
    the compilation hasn't yet been given the royal treatment-- hey Rhino,
    where were you?)</p><p>
    
    Yes, bands are still exhibiting No Wave tendencies (and thanks to
    labels like Audika, Acute, and Table of the Elements classic Lower
    Manhattan music of all sorts is making the rounds again), but it was
    circa 2002 that the post-<em>No New York</em> moment bubbled most briskly. 
    S.A. Crary's 2004 documentary, <i>Kill Your Idols, covers that time
    period, pairing grainy live footage and interviews with the old guard
    (Suicide's Marvin Rev, Glenn Branca, Lydia Lunch, DNA's Arto Lindsay)
    and '80s noisemakers (Thurston Moore, Lee Ranaldo, Michael Gira) with
    newer technicolor footage and Q&amp;A;'s with 2002's acolytes, the Yeah
    Yeah Yeahs, Black Dice, Liars, et al. If you missed the film, you
    still might've caught some of this via the call-and-response of Vice's
    <em>Yes New York</em> compilation. Also around that time, the resuscitated Ze
    Records reissued its 1981 <em>Mutant Disco</em> compilation and other samplings
    on </i><i>N.Y. No Wave and various James White/Contortions reissues. Soul Jazz
    provided the even more extensive (and less disco-flavored) </i><i>New York
    Noise, 1979-1982 and last year No More Records' popped-up to offer the
    definitive 32-track </i><i>DNA on DNA, which includes all of the DNA tracks
    from <em>No New York</em>. Ditto for Mars' </i><i>The Complete Studio Recordings: NYC
    1977-1978, out on G3G/Spooky Sound in 2003.</i></p><p>
    
    No Wave itself sprung up namelessly circa 1977 as a reaction to punk, new wave, and New York City itself. One of No Wave's more
    outspoken progenitors, Lydia Lunch famously dissed punk as no more than
    ""sped-up Chuck Berry riffs"". James Chance has said that ""No
    Wave"" came from the name of the compilation, but it's also supposedly
    first coined by the <i>Soho Weekly News, the ""no"" turning ""new wave""'s glossy
    dance party into nihilistic shorthand. Whatever the proper christening
    date, Eno was taken by the scene and compiled and produced <em>No New
    York</em>, which featured four tracks each from four bands-- James Chance and the Contortions, Teenage Jesus &amp; the Jerks, Mars, and DNA. Eno recorded it
    lo-fi and cracked to fit with the bands'
    on-stage ravages. In the original pressing, the lyrics were hidden on the
    inside of the record sleeve, so you had to take the sleeve apart if you want
    to sing along. Stylistically, the bands scowled through a paranoid
    blitz of spastic free-jazz, art noise, jarring vocals,
    anti-melody, sweaty
    sexuality, shredding guitar, a technically adept amateurism, and Dadaist deliveries that fucked with disco
    (check out DNA's synth) and funk to create a sort of mangled punk
    avant-garde.</i></p><p>
    
    When held up to close scrutiny, <em>No New York</em>'s stars are more different
    musically than genre masturbators would have you believe, but they
    were connected through friendships and shared hangouts like CBGB's and
    Max's Kansas City. Original DNA member Gordon Stevenson left the band
    to play bass for Teenage Jesus &amp; the Jerks. DNA's named came from a
    song by Mars. Lydia Lunch and James Chance were dating-- he quit
    Teenage Jesus in '78 to do his own thing. Bands who weren't as
    intrenched in the loop-- Red Transistor, Static, Theoretical Girls-- were left off the comp. The
    whole thing didn't last very long or produce much of a paper trail. 
    Sumner Crane's brilliant boy/girl quartet Mars released a 1980 live EP
    and a 1986 compilation, <em>78+</em>, though the band had dissolved by 1978. 
    Besides last years' compilation-- and impossible-to-find 7""'s-- DNA had only one 10-minute
    full-length, 1980's <em>A Taste of DNA</em>. Lydia Lunch and James Chance have
    been better represented, especially Lunch who became a regarded spoken-word artist and author.</p><p>
    
    This compilation begins with the most accessible participants, James
    Chance &amp; the Contortions. Skronking through sax-based punk-funk,
    Chance is often compared to James Brown, but I'd rather look into my
    magic ball and say ""Jon Spencer."" Sporting a pompadour and Was (Not
    Was) suits, he made a suitable poster boy for the movement, and
    appeared on the cover of the first issue of the <em>East Village Eye</em>. As a
    performer, he was known for being confrontational, which got him rejected from straight-up jazz circles. Musically, he tends to grab an idea and stick with it,
    as on ""Dish It Out""'s unrelenting bass, drums, guitar, organ, and sax
    overlay. ""Jaded"" delves into freer jazz implosions and ""Flip Your
    Face"" shreds sounds over mid-tempo beat. His signature tune, ""Contort
    Yourself"", isn't here, but Eno's production makes these tracks some of
    my favorite in the Chance/White/Black oeuvre-- some of the later
    material felt too slick.</p><p>
    
    Darker and less colorful, Teenage Jesus and the Jerks
    were fronted by vocalist/anti-guitarist Lydia Lunch, who was 16 when she
    joined the band in 1976. Early reviews dismissed Lunch as dreadfully amateur;
    nowadays, she sounds pretty tuneful screaming her gritty,
    anti-suburbia salvos. Teenage Jesus was known for frantic, tossed-off
    10 to 15-minute sets, but here they keep it molasses slow, Lunch
    screaming her vocal lines over tribal drumming and
    minimal fuzziness. The pace pick up for the excellent 34-second
    rampage, ""Red Alert"", but otherwise expect a claustrophobic plod.</p><p>
    
    One of the more intriguing sets comes from the least known crew, the
    boy/girl quartet Mars. The band's founder, Sumner Crane, who died from
    Lymphoma in 2003, was one of the true visionaries of this period. You'll find
    <em>Daydream Nation</em> and Lightning Bolt hiding out in the moody guitar riffs of the
    excellent opener ""Helen Fordsdale""; ""Hairwaves"" drifts to China Burg's
    ambient vocals over a fractured and spacious backdrop; ""Tunnels"" is a Crane-like static; ""Puerto Rican Ghost"" is shouting, repetitious drum rolls, and all sorts of chaos.</p><p>
    
    DNA shows up in early guitar/drum/synth form. Later, when Robin
    Crutfhfield left to form Dark Day, he was replaced by Pere Ubu bassist
    Tim Wright, and the group became both sturdier and more fucked up. These
    pieces hit like shrapnel, though Lindsay doesn't display the more
    crazed (and autistic) vocal exercises of A Taste of DNA's ""Blond Red
    Head"" or ""Lying on the Sofa of Life"" or Mori's
    drumming-to-something-else-in-a-different-room percussion. On
    ""Egomaniac's Kiss"" Lindsay scowls (""trying to eat that self real
    slow"") and rattlesnake shushes along with catchy synth, simple drums.
    More caustic, ""Lionel"" and ""Size"" ride regurgitated
    synth-- the instruments shift focus halfway through, as if
    following the fissures of a non-demarcated fault-line. ""Not Moving"" is
    Joy Division stuck in a factory cog, slowly quartered.</p><p>
    
    The most remarkable quality on these recordings is this
    unselfconscious feel, something painfully lacking in the star-fucking
    neo-No Wave groups. In <em>Kill Your Idols</em>, it's
    interesting to see Lunch, Lindsay, and others speak so
    eloquently about what it was they were trying to do. They have the benefit of hindsight, but as it unfurled and
    quickly disappeared, No Wave was still a real reaction plugged into a time/place. In part because there's less product, No Wave hasn't been as festishized as
    punk. Around 1982, bands had disappeared or sub-divided and different fragments of No Wave ended up in places like the Downtown jazz scene of John Zorn, Fred Frith, Bill
    Laswell, and Elliott Sharp; the noise crews of Swans, Sonic Youth, Live Skull; and dance-punk disco via Bush Tetras, Golden Palominos, Konk, Liquid Liquid, Arthur Russell, and ESG. Compare that and that to <i>Yes New York's already dated cast of the
    Strokes, Radio 4, Longwave, the Natural History, and the Fever, and you'll
    realize New York really hasn't seen anything of the likes of these
    folks (and that includes No Wave's neighbors and
    offspring) since the last bits of that early, less gentrified Lower
    Manhattan feedback dried up.</i></p></div>"|2105.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2105-no-new-york/|8.3|Brandon Stosuy

Hunter's ""Farm, CA"" appeared on 2004's <em>Golden Apples of the Sun</em>, the neo-folk compilation Banhart curated for <em>Arthur</em> magazine, and earlier this year the two singer-songwriters shared a split album on Troubleman. Now comes Hunter's first solo album, <em>Blank Unstaring Heirs of Doom</em>, which is also the inaugural release for Gnomonsong, a new label run by Banhart and Vetiver's Andy Cabic. Professional links notwithstanding, it would be a shame to write Hunter off as a mere Banhart disciple or freak-folk footnote, as her captivating debut reveals a new, quietly radiant voice with its own strange, feverish luster.</p><p>
    Recorded predominantly on two-and four-tracks, <em>Blank Unstaring Heirs of Doom</em> features Hunter performing almost entirely alone, collecting songs written over the course of a decade. Had it appeared 10 years ago, it would likely have been bundled alongside the lo-fi brigades rather than as part of any broadbased folk movement. Although primarily constructed of Hunter's vocals and non-electric instruments, these songs otherwise owe very little to folk tradition, and instead draw much of their disheveled allure from her deliberately grainy, inorganic edits and overdubs. Her performances here brim with a heightened, lonesome yearning that summon the faintest trace of country twang, at times suggestive of Edith Frost's demo material as transmitted via an erratic dashboard AM radio.</p><p>
    Prior to going solo, Hunter was a member of Matty &amp; Mossy, an Elephant 6-like combo that put out an album of psych-pop on Houston's Fleece label. And though there are few overt psychedelic gestures on <em>Blank Unstaring Heirs of Doom</em>, Hunter moves with a hazy, disorienting logic on multi-tracked, a cappella numbers like the opening ""All the Best Wishes"" or ""The Earth Has No Skin"", whose enveloping folds can recall Tara Burke's work as Fürsaxa. ""The New Sane Scramble"" is spiked with the distorted cry of a distant fiddle (or at least the electronic shadow of one) while on the sideways lurch of ""Untitled (Hanging Around)"" Hunter's in-the-red vocals slowly dissolve into a multi-hued, disembodied blur. </p><p>
    The still-enchanting ""Farm, CA"" makes another appearance here, as does the brief handclap goof of ""Laughing and Crying"", which also surfaced on the Banhart split LP. But despite this album's loose and protracted creation, these songs all hang together with a natural, cohesive grace, sounding as if they had all simultaneously occurred to Hunter in one seismic burst of production. The sole exception might be the closing ""K"", which ends the album with an unexpected Casio blip of early Magnetic Fields style pop, as she sings ""I'd love to sell your backbone to my friends/ I'd be your favorite cartoon."" And though one suspects this to be a lyric Banhart wishes he had written, nowhere is it more apparent that Jana Hunter is her own artist; ready and deserving to be considered on her own singular merits.</p></div>"|4026.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4026-blank-unstaring-heirs-of-doom/|7.7|Matthew Murphy

Now, Oranger more closely echoes indie acts such as Pavement or Modest Mouse rather than cardboard CA cutouts like Brian Jonestown Massacre or the Warlocks. Forget the dense layers of fuzz and acoustic strumming, these guitars have two settings-- clean and distorted-- and if you're lucky you'll get a mellotron in the background. This ain't your stoned older brother's Oranger.</p><p>
    
    If 2003's <em>Shutdown the Sun</em> felt like a sweet slice of straightforward indie pop, <em>New Comes and Goes</em> may be lethal for diabetics and pregnant women. The melodies are Beatlesque only after being filtered through the scrappy likes of early 90s lo-fi and ennui. Frontman Mike Drake curbs his strung-out Anton Newcombe affectations in lieu of Stephen Malkmus slackerdom, half-singing, half-slurring lyrics like ""outta touch"" and ""whacha holden."" Opener ""Crooked in the Weird of the Catacombs"" launches the band's revamped sound, bouncing along on spindly guitar riffs and tinny percussion. The proceeding title track demonstrates the ideal effects of the band's minimalist change, tapping nostalgic bits of John Lennon and Roy Orbison before dirty power chords signal an up-to-date emo chorus.</p><p>
    
    The band's faux-Pixies tracks really take the cake here. ""Haeter"" swaggers all space-lounge, <em>Bossanova</em> style, with cosmic chord changes too energized to simply plop down below the melody. On the flip side, ""Garden Party for the Murder Pride"" flaunts tacky <em>Trompe Le Monde</em> metal riffs juxtaposed with obtusely sunny hooks. While portions of the album recall unpleasant grunge-upchuck like Local H or Nada Surf, these guys hit a homer with the ""less is more"" strategy. Not to get all sappy, but mechanically following a band from mediocrity to above-averageness reaffirms the belief that bands can significantly improve, and not every musician from San Fran has to pay homage to the Dead.</p></div>"|6023.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6023-new-comes-and-goes/|7.5|Adam Moerder

    Road</em> bumped grime into the ""next shit"" express line. Since its
    rapturous reception, <em>RtR</em>'s perfect snapshot of a starving scene
    has paid dividends in the form of Kano's stunning <em>Home Sweet Home</em> LP
    and Lady Sov's continuing streak of munchkin tales along with her
    recent Stateside Def Jam deal. So, as the chorus to <em>Run The Road
    Volume 2</em>'s icebreaker aptly asks, ""Who's gonna be next with 16
    lines?"" With the jaw-smacking wtf?! factor vastly diminished, this
    sequel offers a slightly wobbly answer to that question by
    attempting to expand its predecessor's definition of grime in new,
    sometimes dubious directions.</p><p>
    
    Perhaps a bit tired of the Wembley-sized arcade crunk sound, those pushing
    <em>RtR2</em>'s brazen buttons try for a little more polish and nuance.
    The epic introduction, ""Get Set"", proves that such ambitions have the
    potential to be fruitfully realized. Stinging strings counteract the
    track's deep-digging bass while wailing backing vocals offer some
    cinematic shading. The song also boasts <em>RtR2</em>'s most
    impressive union of mic fiends as golden boy Kano competes with Ghetto and Demon for infinite rewinds. Coming off like a
    grime version of Puffy's ""Victory"", ""Get Set"" successfully takes the
    young hybrid genre to uncharted levels of grandiosity. It also stands
    well above the rest of <em>RtR2</em> in scope and execution.</p><p>
    
    The rest of the record is hardly a failure but, next to its progenitor
    and sprawling opener, it gets stuck underneath a grey cloud that rains
    whispers of inferiority. Ghetto once again pounces and plunges into
    the beat with his quick tongue on ""Run the Road""; too bad the
    Destiny's Child leftover r&amp;b; hook falls woefully flat in its attempt
    for some kind of crossover push. Although JME shows lyrical promise on
    ""Serious"", his one-note bitching about emcees discussing
    shanks and breasts quickly becomes just as trite and pointless. And No
    Lay's ""Unorthodox Chick"" seems to exist only as a lesser
    foil to her previous <em>RtR</em> stomper, ""Unorthodox Daughter"". Even
    when the record goes way out of its comfort zone as on Klashnekoff's
    Nas-style, grime-free ""Can't You See?"", the track's Yank tendencies
    are clearly second-rate.</p><p>
    
    As <em>RtR2</em>'s final two tracks suggest, maybe it was too
    early to tinker with grime's blood-rush Space Invader bombs. Featuring
    the boisterous, appropriately dubbed Bear Man, ""Drink Beer"" doesn't
    pussyfoot around its titular purpose as it wildly veers off the
    rails drunk off six pints of Strongbow. Same case with Dynasty Crew's
    mobster-horn blaring ""Bare Face Dynasty"", which offers a
    spiritual-- and sonically appropriate-- successor to <em>RtR</em>'s
    completely mad ""Destruction VIP"". Both tracks revel in the chaos that
    much of <em>RtR2</em> lacks. Still, this comp doesn't indicate grime's
    death knell or anything-- just its to-be-expected semi-awkward growing
    pains.</p></div>"|2059.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2059-run-the-road-volume-2/|6.5|Ryan Dombal

Her ability to transform herself from song to song and from album to album became a proclamation of self-nullifying empowerment, giving her the ability to create a stationary persona out of shifting identities. However, by the start of the 1990s, Madonna's transformations appeared more calculated as she aged and fell behind the curve, trying to predict the next dominant style instead of confidently setting it.</p>
<p>With <i>Confessions on a Dance Floor</i>, her 14th album, Madonna again reinvents herself, and it appears she's nearly lapped herself. Her latest iteration is a pre-Madonna (prima donna?) disco vixen, basking in a '70s musical style that she herself, among others, helped to morph and displace in the early '80s. Allowing her to accessorize creatively (love that wrap-around top), this new persona has the potential to be immensely entertaining, but there's something a little sad about it too. At 47 Madonna is playing the role of someone 25 years younger, and those retro space leotards and that feathered hair only make her look more mature and matronly, like your friend's mom dressed up embarrassingly for Halloween.</p>
<p>If the outfit depresses, the music on <i>Confessions</i> accomplishes the feat of making her sound young again. Kicking off the album, ""Hung Up"" is an impressive and enjoyable single, strong enough to have everyone trying to figure out if it's her best since ""Ray of Light"" or since ""Like a Prayer"". The main groove is lifted from ABBA's ""Gimme! Gimme! Gimme (A Man After Midnight)"", but used in such a way that it resembles a brilliant mash-up rather than a lazy sample. Credit is due Stuart Price of Les Rhythmes Digitales, who builds a warehouse-size wall of sound for Madonna's songs, allowing her to revel in the shameless mirrorballsiness of it all.</p>
<p>That collaboration stays strong over the first half of <i>Confessions</i>. On ""Get Together"", as Price's synths ebb and flow moodily, Madonna asks the eternal pop question, ""Do you believe in love at first sight?"", over a tripping vocal melody. The cascades of sound wash directly into ""Sorry"", setting up the song's panlingual apologies and shifting bass tectonics. These songs have a deceptive lyrical vacuity that hints at greater depths, but leaves them to the listener to consider. On the other hand, ""Future Lovers"" begins with similar escapism, as Madonna warmly exhorts, ""Let's forget your life, forget your problems, administration, bills, and loans."" But it's no simple call to the dancefloor: Over a prismatic vocal theme, she unequivocally equates music with spirituality, dancing with religious ritual.</p>
<p>This impressive momentum, unfortunately, is interrupted by ""I Love New York"", which stumbles over mad-glad-bad rhyme schemes and dumb-ass lyrics like ""I don't like cities but I like New York/ Other cities make me feel like a dork."" It sounds like a transparently targeted post-9/11 valentine to the Big Apple-- odd coming from an ex-pat. Inanities like ""If you don't like my attitude/ Then you can eff off"" are at least partly excused by Price's production, which builds from the beat up to incorporate rock elements that could be a nod to Brooklyn hipster dance punk.</p>
<p>Despite Price's best efforts to infuse these songs with motion and finesse, <i>Confessions</i> never quite reaches its earlier heights after ""I Love New York"". When Madonna actually starts confessing, the album loses its delicate balance between pop frivolity and spiritual gravity. ""Now I can tell you about success, about fame,"" she intones at the end of ""Let It Will Be"", as if that's all she knows anymore. She proselytizes the Kabbalah on ""Isaac"", but despite the controversy that song has created, it's remarkable only for Price's two-note pendulum string sample and a hummed melody that could have been lifted from ""Frozen"".</p>
<p>The young Madonna pops up repeatedly on <i>Confessions</i>, a foil to her older self. ""How High"" plumbs the motives behind her headline- and crotch-grabbing behavior of yore, but it only reveals how deeply she has embedded herself into the establishment. The album title recalls her contentious relationship to Catholicism on ""Papa Don't Preach"" and ""Like a Prayer"", and that pop visionary subversiveness makes her reverence to the Kabbalah seem tame by comparison. There's no conflict between her and her new faith, so there's no journey. As <i>Confessions</i> weighs down with more of her personal baggage, the songs become, despite Price's inventive and mercurial production, less inviting and less danceable, as if Madonna wants the dance floor all to herself.</p></div>"|5030.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5030-confessions-on-a-dance-floor/|6.2|Stephen M.

""When I look at the cassette today,"" he writes, ""I see that it is almost a recipe of ingredients for Galaxie 500."" Jonathan Richman is on it, and Joy Division and Moe Tucker and Shockabilly, all of whom would impact the band in various ways. ""If you cut random bits of this tape together,"" adds Krukowski, ""you'd probably come up with an alternate version of the first Galaxie 500 album.""</p><p>
    
    Throughout their history Galaxie 500 always had a fondness for covers; from the beginning they positioned themselves firmly in the tradition of independent/underground rock. All members had good record collections and remained committed to a specific musical narrative that began with garage rock and the Velvet Underground. By plucking elements from the leftfield records that mattered to them and adding a highly personal spin, Galaxie 500 became part of the history they loved.</p><p>
    
    Galaxie 500 made two visits to the BBC studios to record material for John Peel's show and the eight tracks cut are collected here. Half are covers and, as with the many the band had recorded and played live, they manage to make them sound like Galaxie 500 songs. The way they had their sound honed at this point, with Wareham's unsteady wail and spare guitar, Yang's clean, elegant basslines and Krukowski's texture-over-beat drumming, they couldn't have sounded like anyone else if they'd tried.</p><p>
    
    This being the case, even the opening cover of Sex Pistols' ""Submission"" from the October 1990 has a viscous and dreamy lyricism. It's uptempo-- Galaxie 500 didn't always play slow-- but cool and controlled, and fits easily with the <em>On Fire</em> song ""When Will You Come Home"" from the same session. The Young Marble Giants' ""Final Day"" is, on the other hand, slowed by half, and though Yang's voice bears a similarity to YMG's Alison Statton, she finds a hint of British folk inside the song's simple melody. Buffy St. Marie's ""Moonshot"", which Wareham would later cover in his low, half-spoken voice on his album with Britta Phillips, is handled a third higher than Buffy herself sang it, with Wareham selling that upper register quaver like only he can.</p><p>
     
    The September 1989 session, recorded a month before the release of <em>On Fire</em>, had a higher proportion of Wareham songs, the only cover being the G500 concert staple and Jonathan Richman original ""Don't Let Our Youth Go to Waste"". The opening one-two of ""Flowers"" and ""Blue Thunder"" is simply breathtaking, with every element of the Galaxie 500 sound perfectly in place. To hear these two songs one after another is to hear the best evidence on record of why this band meant so much to people at the dawn of the '90s, and ""Decomposing Trees"" is almost as good. <em>Peel Sessions</em> is allegedly the final piece of the Galaxie 500 story, the last recorded evidence of any significance that will be released. It's a fittingly strong ending for a band that did almost everything right.</p></div>"|3382.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3382-peel-sessions/|8.4|Mark Richardson

Flip it over: There's Hell almost 30 years later, hair grown out and dyed, face filled out, looking over his shoulder through tinted glasses at three decades of music, mistakes, band breakups, and at least one certifiably classic document of the CBGB's punk scene, <em>Blank Generation</em>.</p><p>
<em>Spurts</em> is not the first time Hell has compiled his own material. He collected the odds-and-sods <em>R.I.P.</em> when he ditched music to pursue writing in 1984; it was later expanded and repackaged as <em>Time</em>-- inexplicably omitting ""Blank Generation"" on both occasions. This time, the package features interview-style liner notes between Hell and critics Robert Christgau and Carola Dibbell giving background info on every track, and includes Hell's material with Dim Stars, recorded in the early 1990s with Thurston Moore, Steve Shelley, and Don Fleming. Hell himself claims this compilation should be ""his only album,"" a definitive release that would ""cut straight through"" like any album would.</p><p>
    
    The Neon Boys were a precursor to the band Television; Hell was kicked out before they recorded their first album under the new name, but he was magnanimous enough to include two Neon Boys tracks at the start of the disc (not to mention close it with a live version of ""Blank Generation"" as played by Television). The preliminary version of ""Love Comes in Spurts"" had music written by Television's Tom Verlaine, and has next to no resemblance to the version on <em>Blank Generation</em>. But Hell's remix shows no signs of a bruised ego, pushing the guitars way up and his vocals down, serving the song well. The Stones-like fury of the rhythm guitar is well captured, and Verlaine's brief-but-inspired ascending lines can be felt in the back of your teeth.</p><p>
    
    From Hell's time with Johnny Thunders' Heartbreakers, he only includes the cream of the crop, ""Chinese Rocks"". Instead, the lion's share of <em>Spurts</em> leans on the Voidoids' <em>Blank Generation</em> and <em>Destiny Street</em> records. The <em>Blank Generation</em> work has aged best, coupling punk fury with eccentric delivery and rhythm that's not afraid to swing. It also features some inspired anti-guitar hero moments from the inestimable Robert Quine on ""Liars Beware"" and ""Love Comes in Spurts"". <em>Destiny Street</em> would show a slightly poppier and more contemplative side to the band, though ""Kid With a Replaceable Head"" is infectiously sinister and ""Time"" and ""Ignore That Door"" show Hell's songwriting growing more frank and direct.</p><p>
    
    Hell returned to recording in 1992 with a Dim Stars EP preceding one proper album. The songs chosen here mostly sound like jam sessions, like the two-chord ""Dim Stars Theme"", over which Geffen-era Thurston Moore scrawls recklessly while staying within the lines, bending the compositions but not breaking them, keeping a foothold for Hell's lyrics. ""Monkey"" is Hell at his most forthright, and the distorted guitars in the background seem incongruous with the popping clean chords and his newfound tenderness (""I swear I held my own hand pretending it was yours"").</p><p>
<em>Spurts</em> includes one more late-era compilation track from the Voidoids, ""Oh"", and two previously unreleased tracks, the Dennis Cooper-inspired ""She'll Be Coming"", which combines drum loops, Eastern tones, and a forced hillbilly accent, and the aforementioned Television of performance of ""Blank Generation"". The first side of <em>Spurts</em> is a righteous blast of indignant punk, and the second half indulges in some experimentation, some mood pieces, and some glances at hard-earned maturity. The best of his many compilations, and certainly the best place to start for the unfamiliar, <em>Spurts</em> flows as well as any original album. People still listen to those, right?</p></div>"|4027.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4027-spurts-the-richard-hell-story/|8.6|Jason Crock

    dusty copy of Gasp's 1998 full length <i>Drome
    Triler of Puzzle Zoo People</i> waiting to be discovered. In an era
    that's seen the rehabilitation of the criminal (Gary Higgins) and the
    criminally neglected (Vashti Bunyan), Gasp is to date less in line for
    rehab than for a first round of addiction. So it's perhaps surprising that we're seeing every vinyl and unreleased Gasp track from
    their short (1996-1999) and mythic (the only ""psychedelic
    power-violence"" band of all time) incarnation, neatly packaged as
    <i>An Earwig's Guide to Traveling</i>.</p><p>
    
    In their day, on splits with Deerhoof, Noothgrush, and Volume 11, Gasp
    mixed Man Is The Bastard power-violence with Nautical Almanac tape
    manipulations/loops, pure psychedelic meditations, and gurgling noise. <i>An Earwig's Guide</i> contains all of the above; it is also full
    of nods to early and mid-1990s emo, replete with blast beats,
    speeded-up guitars, and full throat screams. Two songs in particular,
    ""Love for the Retarded Strands"" and ""Crawl Back into the Hole"", are stuffed with emo lyrics and voice-cracks, melodic guitar lines, and
    condenser mic overload. But the sludge, doom, and gloom that Southern
    Lord has now brought out of the mud are also more than presaged here;
    ""Shit Colony"" and ""Sore for Days"" out grief Grief, ringing out ominous
    chords and slugging, one-a-minute tom hits. If anyone remembers Gasp
    today, it would be the aging and stoned Southern California rock kids.</p><p>
    
    Yet that was Gasp only about half the time. As an impatient college
    radio DJ, I recall skipping around their records trying to find the
    rock songs; yet every time the needle landed, they were off exploring
    outer space or locked-groove tape loops. <i>An Earwig's Guide</i>
    more than bears this recollection out. The opener here (""Where Astral
    Port Splits"") is delicately noisy enough to recall Boris' guitar and
    drone explorations, and this effect only grows (louder) on later songs
    like ""Conceived on the 3rd or 4th Satellite"". Even further out there
    are the eerily calm, warbling tape cries of ""Uranus Is Heaven"" and the water-drenched gurgle of ""Castle Sounds for the Electrical West"". Enigmatic and distracted now as they were
    then, Gasp's songs refuse to settle or
    come into focus. Their moment seems only slightly more likely to arrive now; perhaps, in another
    five or ten years, we'll be ready.</p></div>"|3670.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3670-an-earwigs-guide-to-traveling/|7.4|Zach Baron

Really hard. There is no way that music as
    intensely spastic as his could be anything less than totally honest. As the leader of Cap'n Jazz, Owls, Joan of Arc, Friend/Enemy, and
    now Make Believe, Kinsella has made a whole landfill's worth of extremely unique music that has passion on its side but little else.</p><p>
    
    Make Believe is basically Joan of Arc, the rock-ish version. It's still
    disjointed, pretentious, and frequently unlistenable, but it now at least
    coheres occasionally into something you can latch onto and get inside of,
    usually just before sliding right back apart into a primordial mess. The
    music basically works on a principal wherein any knotty
    guitar riff, killer bass line, or cogent drum part must dissolve into grating
    chaos before it becomes too meaningful or, God forbid, straightforward.
    Opener ""Amscaredica (the Beautiful)"" sticks mostly to a nicely tweaked,
    limping groove taken from the mid-1970s King Crimson handbook, but the bits
    where it leaves that groove sound absolutely lost. Guitarist Sam Zurick does
    intriguing things with knotty rhythms, and the songs are at their
    best when he's in the driver's seat, picking through his little tone
    clusters. Otherwise, the album is like walking through a Guitar Center, with
    two dozen amateurs hammering away on various instruments independently.</p><p>
    
    Kinsella is Kinsella, through and through-- what else would you expect him to
    be? The chorus of ""Say What You Mean"" is transcribed in the lyric booklet as
    ""How-eee-yah-oo-oowow--oo/ Hay-ee--ee--ay,"" which doesn't quite capture
    the ragged psychosis conveyed in his unhinged delivery. The lyrics involving
    actual words are scarcely more scrutable, though intriguing imagery
    does occasionally pop up out of the gobbledegook, like the suddenly lucid
    line ""she crossed her legs and made a show of dangling her shoe from her
    toe"" in ""Fumio Nambata Had a Farm Ee-I-Ee-I-O"". On ""One Zero"", he's ""making the bed with you in it,"" while on
    ""Small Apartment Party Epiphany"", someone's ""taught the cat to moonwalk, and
    now he's becoming a real showoff.""</p><p>
    
    Do I really need to spell out that anyone who never liked Kinsella in the
    first place shouldn't bother with this? As relatively direct as it is, <em>Shock
    of Being</em> is still hideously overwrought. On the other hand, Kinsella's past
    fans aren't going to be stepping off the wagon here, either, so the album
    doesn't really advance the plot on either front. Rather, it's just another
    bizarre curio from a guy who, as much as I'd like to root for him, can't
    seem to make a record I want to listen to more than once.</p></div>"|5650.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5650-shock-of-being/|4.8|Joe Tangari

    reality, not the thing itself. Yes, Virginia, studio enhancements are
    as old as the form, but the presentation extends to which songs are
    chosen, which banter snippeted, and indeed, even which phase of a
    performer's career gets chosen for immortalization. This distinction
    between art and archive is a crucial one for Wilco, as each of the
    band's albums has represented a progression, or at least a
    transition-- a unified statement of the group's identity at the moment
    that it was recorded. <em>Kicking Television: Live in Chicago</em>, a 2xCD live album recorded last year in the Second City's Vic Theatre, is no exception.</p><p>
    
    In its 10+ years of existence, Jeff Tweedy's post-Tupelo project has
    cycled through several lineups and styles: alt-country, Beach
    Boys-splashed Americana, Radioheaded abstraction. Then, after 2002
    masterpiece <em>Yankee Hotel Foxtrot</em> came last year's confusingly
    lateral move to listener-unfriendly classic-rock, <em>A Ghost Is
    Born</em>; ""I will turn on you,"" Tweedy sang in ""I'm a Wheel"". The
    tables turn again with <em>Kicking Television</em>,
    which casts its predecessor's songs in hotter light and serves as a
    coming-out party for Wilco's newest, six-member incarnation: a
    drinking man's avant-jam band.</p><p>
    
    Where I work, ""continuous improvement"" is part of the mission
    statement, and hey it's apparent in Tweedy's guitar soloing, as well.
    Both he and Nels Cline torture their six-strings as if
    the Vic were a covert U.S. detainee camp in Eastern Europe: piercing
    the infernal night in ""Hell Is Chrome"", cavorting Grateful Deadward on
    ""Handshake Drugs"", and sprawling across the dark center of the
    universe over the Neu!-like drone of ""Spiders (Kidsmoke)"", which
    reinvigorates the studio version and is the release's crowning
    achievement. So this is what <em>A Ghost Is Born</em> is supposed to
    sound like.</p><p>
    
    Indeed, the tracklisting is heavy on Wilco's latest studio effort,
    for better and worse. ""Hummingbird"" is where the shelved DVD version
    of the album would come in handy, as the song's straightforward ""Penny
    Lane"" piano allows Tweedy to go guitarless for once. ""The Late
    Greats"", which sounded like a jangly obscurantist afterthought at the
    end of <em>A Ghost Is Born</em>, could probably have been trimmed here,
    as well. ""At Least That's What You Said"" opens with hushed electric
    guitar, rather than moody piano, then crashes into a jagged
    mountainside of swirling guitar noise in its massive breakdown. The
    punky title track, however, an <em>A Ghost Is Born</em> castoff with
    washer-and-dryer guitars, is a letdown even if it allows Tweedy to
    utter, ""I'm serious/ I've been working on my abs.""</p><p>
    
    Though the band loosens up the new songs, the
    <em>Yankee Hotel Foxtrot</em> numbers remain consistent with previous
    live renditions-- that is, still awesome. Tweedy's clenched voice is consumes by noise on ""I Am Trying to Break Your
    Heart"", xylophones ever-tinkling. ""Let's get this party started...with some midtempo rock,"" he jokes, then fulfills his pledge with
    ""Jesus, Etc."", slide guitar replacing violins on the chorus and the
    verses sprinkled with reggae-tinged synths. He tries humor again
    leading into ""I Am the Man Who Loves You"", announcing, ""This is my
    favorite part of the show: I love you!"" before unleashing an erection
    of guitar noise and a porno-funk intro to an uptempo performance with
    bright <em>Sgt. Pepper's</em> horns. Faithful renditions of ""Radio
    Cure"", ""Ashes of American Flags"", ""Poor Places"", and poppy ""Heavy Metal
    Drummer"" round out the second disc.</p><p>
    
    Wilco's Nonesuch albums get preference here, but earlier highlights
    appear, as well. <em>Summerteeth</em> murder ballad ""Via Chicago""
    elicits a slow surge of that's-us-dude applause. From the same album,
    ""A Shot in the Arm"" is always welcome, its straining pop grandiosity
    hinting at the classic record to follow. <em>Mermaid Ave. Vol. II</em>'s
    ""Airline to Heaven"" is a live favorite for its pastoral stomp,
    as is <em>Vol. I</em>'s sleepy ""One by One"". There's also a farewell singalong cover of ""Comment (If All
    Men Are Truly Brothers)"", originally by 70s funk figure Charles
    Wright.</p><p>
    
    Press clippings indicate that Tweedy's laconic stage presence has
    grown more easygoing, but the banter here is mostly as ho-hum as my
    earlier examples. ""How dignified is it to come from Kansas City to
    Chicago to see Wilco?"" Tweedy muses at one point. Of course, the
    truly important part of this presentation is the music, and there
    Wilco rarely disappoints. On the first track, <em>Being There</em>
    opener ""Misunderstood"", with a jubilant crowd singing
    along, Tweedy's dry-paper voice rasps a few magic words-- ""Do you
    still love rock 'n' roll?""-- and thanks us all for ""nothing/ nothing/
    nothing/ nothing/ nothing.""</p></div>"|8682.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8682-kicking-television-live-in-chicago/|8.3|Marc Hogan

Have you heard Sov's latest 12s? Soft as
    Baby MC's ace, with beats, rhymes, and life dumbed down for what, Radio 1
    and ""Top of the Pops""? Sov's turned (nearly) from
    splendid young emcee to Young MC on splenda. And yes, I am dissing her
    ""9-5""; it just ain't her twist.</p><p>
    
    So while Sov haggles in rap vs. pap identity crisis, this <i>Vertically
    Challenged</i> EP, her first release available stateside, packs all the
    hard, grimey shit, a comp or even history of sorts of her raggest-taggest
    jams. ""Random"" has her best bitchslaps, mostly on American rappers, over
    kicks and bass zoom we'd expect from Timbo-- in 15 years. In other words,
    Sov's mean schooling us, flipping our scripts and taunting from afar that
    she, a 19-year-old London hoodrat, does hip-hop better than hip-hop. I just
    assumed somebody would bark back-- provided they knew she even existed; instead Jay-Z signed her to Island/Def Jam.</p><p>
    
    The why-care of all that won't resonate without knowing Sov's grime scene
    backstory. There in that fast-paced, viciously insider culture of/for/by
    Brit-teens boasting neckle but not much else, Sov found a strong
    chip-on-shoulders identity, however racially/sexually (un)determined. From
    grime, so far only Dizzee's vibe has come as fully formed. If ""Random"" meant
    war, ""Ch-Ching,"" her remix of the ""Cheque 1, 2"" garage anthem, first read
    like personal declaration: ""Me na have 50 rings/ But I got 50 things to say
    in a cheeky kinda way.""</p><p>
    
    Forty-eight more to go: ""Random"" and ""Ch-Ching"" are two of the best singles of the past couple of years, and Sov recorded boys vs. girls posse cut
    ""The Battle"" and ""A Little Bit of Shhh!"" before ""Ch-Ching"", so they don't
    count (though they're great and on here, with meh remix filler too). She has
    rap knees on their heads-- why jump shark? To be frank I don't know what the
    fuck's going on here, who Sov's talking to, why she's holding back on us.
    ""Fiddle With the Volume"", the EP's one new original, beatstanks durty but,
    sorry, Bryan Adams did the waking up the neighbours thing better, and that's
    saying something. Right now I'm stuck on one line of ""Shhh!"": ""Here comes
    the press!!/ Nuva damn reporter/ Obsessed wid my disorder/ Diagnosis please
    whats wrong wiv her Bill? She's ill."" Give shit interviews, fine, but on wax
    don't stamp yourself out. Please?</p></div>"|4994.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4994-vertically-challenged-ep/|6.5|Nick Sylvester

    Ladd got married and became a father (in Paris, no less). You might be 
    tempted to expect a calmer, more reflective Ladd in the wake of fatherhood, 
    but you'd be way off. <em>Father Divine</em> is his grittiest, rawest, 
    furthest-in-the-red album to date, leapfrogging through dub, punk, electro, 
    and soul, all while still rooted in hip-hop. Ladd is notoriously fond of 
    overarching concepts, and he cooked up two for <em>Father 
    Divine</em>: one revolving around the title figure, the founder of the 
    not-quite-a-cult Peace Mission Movement, the other around an attempt to 
    recapture the saturated, dirty sound of the old ROIR punk and dub cassettes, 
    especially that of the self-titled Bad Brains album.</p><p>
    
    The Father Divine thread seems mostly (perhaps mercifully) to have been lost 
    along the way, apart from a mention on the outer space dub track ""So 'N 
    So"", but the second goal is definitely achieved-- as synths buzz, the 
    compression pushes the bass right up into the front of the mix and the album 
    generally crackles with volcanic energy. Ladd has assembled a crack band 
    that draws in players from hip-hop (Antipop Consortium's High Priest on 
    keys), jazz (pianist and frequent collaborator Vijay Iyer), rock (TV on the 
    Radio's Jaleel Bunton on guitar), and dub (Raz Mesinai), among other styles. 
    The diverse musical backgrounds of the players serve Ladd's 
    deconstructionist approach to hip-hop perfectly, as they approach every 
    genre and song they attempt with seat-of-the-pants vitality.</p><p>
    
    Thanks to the band, the album's instrumental tracks are nearly as crucial to 
    the album as the vocal ones, especially ""Crooner Island"", which opens as a 
    stuttering dub cut, slathered in bass and broad synth strokes from French 
    producer Gymkhana, eventually morphing into a pumping shard of 
    Thunderdome electro. Still, the vocal tracks are the focus, and Ladd is 
    fucking righteous on ""Awful Raw"", which swings violently between a 
    repetitive bhangra chorus and blaring swirls of synth. That chorus is 
    addictive, as Ladd doubles himself singing ""Gotta get me channel on/ Gotta 
    get my channel free/ Gotta get my channel on channel channel on"" over tweaked 
    tablas and what might be a Bollywood sample.</p><p>
    
    If there's any palpable result of Ladd's recent life changes, it's most 
    clearly felt in a pair of tracks about women, a subject he's rarely touched 
    upon in the past. ""Barney's Girl"" is a buoyant remembrance of a girl from 
    back in the 80s in Ladd's home of Cambridge, Mass.: ""She was a whole lotta punk and a little hip 
    hop,"" he says, on his breeziest track to date. The other ""girl"" track, ""Murder Girl"", 
    could be prime Prince with Ladd's falsetto chorus and splashy synth hits, 
    channeling His Purpleness in verses broken up by an ominous bit of echoing 
    bass that feels like a reference to Pink Floyd's ""One of These Days"".</p><p>
    
    Like any Ladd album, <em>Father Divine</em> is stuffed with tracks worth talking 
    about, and it's nice to see that Ladd isn't afraid to 
    lay aside his conceptual tendencies in the name of just getting down and 
    nasty, and <em>Father Divine</em> does just that-- it's a record played in the red, and 
    it's not afraid to have a good time there.</p></div>"|4625.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4625-father-divine/|8.4|Joe Tangari

Seriously, is a no-frills psych band from San Francisco such an oddity just because they don't associate themselves with the Dead or sing about drugs? Sorry, dude in the Warlocks shirt, Gris Gris piss on hyphenated Sam Goody mongrels like ""psych-punk"" or ""trip-rock,"" but can I interest you in this poster with a marijuana leaf on it? At the same time, Gris Gris's sober take on the genre isn't exactly an intrepid musical statement. On <em>For the Season</em>, Frontman/songwriter Greg Ashley seems to acknowledge his own trope, and if he's slapping reverb and heady lyrics on tracks and calling them psych, why not come clean?</p><p>
    
    Whereas their self-titled debut indulged in several lengthy anti-jams before finally locking into incense-laden melodies, <em>For the Season</em> cuts the fat, delivering more focused, tripartite song structures. To minimize rigidity, each track gradually bleeds into the next, segueing with blistering distortion squelches and/or barely audible echolalia. In a sense, <em>For the Season</em> resembles a subtle solidification of its predecessor's spiraling ideas. Ashley no longer hides behind layers of reverb, but rather challenges them with more pristine vocals and warmer instrumentation, often foregoing lysergic mysticism for clean campfire sing-alongs.</p><p>
    
    Both ""Pick Up Your Raygun"" and ""Medicine #4""-- respective spin-offs of earlier songs ""Raygun"" and ""Medicine #3""-- outline the band's fine-tuned songwriting approach. The former shaves down its prototype's protracted kookiness and dives headfirst into rumbling toms and exotic Middle Eastern scales. ""Medicine #4"" sweetens the dusty acoustic strumming of #3, reversing the pop clock almost far enough back to resemble ""Earth Angel"" at the Enchantment Under the Sea Dance.</p><p>
    
    Not to worry though psych purists, the Gris Gris aren't about to stray too far from 1967, for better or worse. Much like their first album, <em>For the Season</em> doesn't stir up much in regards to energy or emotion, and nothing's surprising. ""Skin Mass Cat"" and ""Cuerpos Haran Amor Extrano"" accurately rehash smokey van aesthetics to the point of Scooby Doo absurdity, and the title track's faux-sitar riffs practically proselytize on behalf of Buddhism. That said, the Gris Gris's finer attention to detail fills in the cracks where their debut stumbled. Lacking the emotional knack for jaw-dropping singles, the band succeeds in consistently churning out songs that would be solid filler on an amazing album-- a <em>Magical Mystery Tour</em> comprised solely of ""Blue Jay Way""'s.</p></div>"|3659.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3659-for-the-season/|7.4|Adam Moerder

Considering the wealth of detailed lyrics and quirky lo-fi maneuvers that distinguish Dondero's songs, it's weird how often they send his critical admirers rummaging through the cliché bin, exhuming the phrase ""road-weary troubadour"" and all the belabored imagery that attends it. It's probably just because there's so much content to absorb: While the music is sparse, Dondero's wordier than teenage webzine reviewer. He reels off lyrics quickly and almost constantly, inundating the listener with a dense tide of imagery and vernacular.</p><p>
    On his sixth album, Dondero beats Sujfan to the punch by making a record about Florida, the country's extended middle finger and the place most like home for the wandering singer. The concept is clearest in geography-heavy songs like the title track and ""Brownsville Revival"". The latter is a lugubrious acoustic dirge that makes its religious iconography work overtime to contain a ponderous narrative about a bereaved father who asks a church congregation to bring his daughter back to life. The former, a sort of sociopolitical essay set to mellifluous guitars and elegiac horns, brims with purple skies and orange trees, air so thick you have to cut a slice to breathe, aquifers and swamps, hollowed out high-rises, and $30 beachfront motels. Dondero's affection for the physical aspects of Florida is apparent as they scroll dreamily through the visual frame, and his politics fill in the gaps: An appeal to muggers that ""if you're poor like me then let poor people like me be"" and a lament for the formerly artistic Cuban district, ""now a mall-like atmosphere, homogenous and insincere.""</p><p>
    But Dondero's lyrical ambition sometimes leads him astray, and for ever finely-turned image-- the South Beach mannequins smelling of coconuts and Coppertone, for instance-- there's a conceit that's uncomfortably proud of its cleverness, like the predictable rags-to-riches-to-rags arc of gambling yarn ""Laying Low in Eli, Nevada"". And for every time Dondero nails the honest straightforwardness that's become his métier (""You could sing a simple song and still get lost in the complexities,"" he sings over the psychedelic hitches of ""Let Go the Past""), another lyric teeters on the brink of triteness. Still, Dondero's able to turn out striking images and concepts in his quest to forget the past and keep the future supple, from biting into a lightning bolt on ""South of the South"" to the willed amnesia of ""Journal Burning Party"" to the vivid language of his ode to a codependent relationship, ""Pornographic Love Song"", with its ""circus riding hips"" and ""desperate puke stained grin."" Dondero's better when he focuses more on his facility with language, less on puns and recycled sentimentality, but these deceptively rudimentary songs charm even when they don't exactly wow. </p></div>"|2529.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2529-south-of-the-south/|6.5|Brian Howe

Departing from the Libertines' work by slowing-down, shaping-up, <em>Down in Albion</em> doesn't out-do <em>Up the Bracket</em>'s gritty unruliness (and the less said about the self-titled follow-up the better), but doesn't
    flop as self-indulgently/destructively as it could, either</p><p>
    Doherty appropriates William Blake's Albion here; his motifs are death, drugs, fucking. Oasis once intoned immortality-- ""You and I are gonna live forever""-- but ""Fuck Forever""'s the mid-90s anthem's morbid antithesis, death and glory's fuzzy meridian. The second of 16 tracks, Doherty's ""fuck forever, if you don't mind"" should've usurped the inane ""La Belle et la bete"" (featuring the vocal stylings of Kate Moss-- la bete?) as <em>Albion</em>'s enthroned first-song, flipping off ""Live Forever""'s na\x95ve cheer. Even if Doherty's an asshole for saying so, someone had to: ""Now is not the time to cry"" for some guys, but when life's lousy-- fuck it, kick shit over, send it flying, cry your eyes out.</p><p>
    Coming across as shambolic and rough'n'tumble can be both a blessing and a curse; here, it's blessing first: If ""Fuck Forever""'s meant as counterpoint to ""Live Forever,"" most of the album's other songs are doubles, scruffily reinterpreted. ""Back from the Dead"" is ""Lust for Life"" weary from having come full-circle and gotten its wish; ""What Katy Did Next"" is a revamped ""Wishin' and Hopin'"" (""So if you're thinkin' of havin' true lovin'/ All you've gotta do is hold him and kiss him/ And squeeze him and love him/ Do it, and after you do you will be his"") meant for you-know-who. The catchier stuff retrofits 60s acts, while ""The 32 of December"", ""Killamangiro"", and ""8 Dead Boys"" are looser, weirder Clash and Pistols. </p><p>
    So when Babyshambles try pulling shit like ""Pipe Down""-- a crappy ""Fuck Forever"" for kids still missing Kurt Cobain-- swagger uninspired through ""Up the Morning"", misstep with from-nowhere reggae stunts ""Sticks and Stones"" and ""Pentonville"", the whole precariously fragile mess is busted and broken. In parts, <em>Albion's shambolism is stunning, but that's no excuse for moments of total sloppiness. Production's tidied to a fault; vocals stray too often-- perfect in doses, exasperating otherwise. Cut shorter, <i>Down in Albion</i> could've topped </em><em>Up the Bracket</em>, with its fed-up rock star-cum-zombie-isms-- feelings we commoners know better. As it stands, <em>Down in Albion</em>'s charm lies mostly in its tenuousness and tightrope-walking; an unfussy love coming in spurts.</p></div>"|1182.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1182-down-in-albion/|7.7|Rachel Khong
0|http://cdn4.pitchfork.com/albums/1174/homepage_large.3f4de886.jpg|At This Time|619.0|Burt Bacharach|['Pop/R&B']|0.0|0.0|0.0|['Columbia']|2005-11-10 00:00:00|2005|2016-06-11 20:52:14.785353|"<div class=""contents dropcap"" data-reactid="".23sug46wjcw.1.6:0.1.0.$1183/=1$1183.0.3.2.0.1.0.1""><p>After nearly six decades in the music business, <em>At This Time</em> is the first album Burt Bacharach has written lyrics for, without the guiding collaborative input of, say, Hal David or Elvis Costello. Normally, Bacharach's the go-to guy for melodies and arrangements: Ever since his days in the famed Brill Building-- where pop music was a suit-and-tie profession-- he's been known for composing supple and sophisticated music that elevates familiar sentiments. Over the years he developed a sheen of affectionate kitsch that has nevertheless made him an unironic hero to younger generations. So, with Bacharach writing the songs, theoretically <em>At This Time</em> should be a major statement, especially given its inspiration: Worried over the state of the nation, Bacharach addresses an unjustified war, a treacherous administration, and society's ingrained potential for violence, trying to sound hopeful despite his worst fears.</p><p>
    
    But real insight is scarce on <em>At This Time</em>, as are lyrics of any kind. To be touted as his first lyrical effort, this is nearly an instrumental album, with full emphasis on lite-jazz orchestration and poignant arrangements. Over largely anonymous loops and beats from Dr. Dre and Prinz Board, Bacharach crafts miniature soundtracks like ""Dreams"" and ""In Our Time"", with flourishes of trumpet (courtesy of Chris Botti), bland saxophone, and garishly canned strings. The mood is inquisitive and subdued, but there's no variation across these 11 tracks. A little righteous anger might have added a little spark more than a few of these songs. ""Who Are These People?"" brings in dramatic horns, pounding tympani, and a howling Elvis Costello, but the result is closer to show tune than protest song.</p><p>
    
    Bacharach's arrangements dominate <em>At This Time</em> so heavily that when the vocals come in, you listen all the more closely-- which is not such a great idea. Bacharach's lyrics rely on flimsy bromides and rhetorical questions, which range from startlingly direct (""Who Are These People?"") to head-scratchingly vague: ""The sun and the moon are crying/ The stars and our hearts, crying,"" Bacharach sings on ""Please Explain"", which really does demand some sort of explanation. Bacharach seems a little flummoxed by his subject matter. He's angry at the state of the world, but only in the most general terms, which means that <em>At This Time</em> could be adopted by liberals angry at Bush or conservatives angry at wartime dissenters. I'll give Bacharach the benefit of the doubt, though: his overgenerality never feels commercially calculated to move more units to a broader audience.</p><p>
    
    On ""Where Did It Go?"" he claims he's worried about riding the New York subways, and remembers when he was a kid, he could ride the subways ""and never, ever be afraid."" This seems like a relatively small problem these days, one more suitable to the 1970s. Bacharach's much more convincing talking about his children and wondering what their futures will hold; the concrete specificity (he even tells us their ages) of this act of paternal protectiveness contains the album's heart, and it's the only time Bacharach sounds directly engaged. It's affecting, albeit only briefly so.</p><p>
    
    Aside from ""Where Did It Go?"", Bacharach provides vocals on only a few songs. His voice proves surprisingly calming-- a little quieter and quivery with the years, but still smooth, strong, and sober. Unfortunately, he relinquishes the bulk of the vocal duties to what he calls a ""Greek chorus"" of backing singers. Sounding overly professional, they lack the personality to put these songs and their intended messages across. Only Rufus Wainwright, who sings ""Go Ask Shakespeare"", invests his part with any energy, in the process redeeming the saccharine lyrics.</p><p>
    
    Overall, <em>At This Time</em> sounds strangely disconnected from our time. It has the straitlaced edge of Bacharach's 60s material, but without any of the charm. Instead, the album feels like it comes from someone at arm's length from the world, for whom celebrity has made the world's real problems merely abstract. <em>At This Time</em> sounds more inspired by upsetting headlines and sensational news reports than real experience. There may be real anger, disappointment, and frustration behind these songs, but you'd be hard-pressed to hear it.</p></div>"|1183.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1183-at-this-time/|4.0|Stephen M.

And although the majority of the group's performances have occurred within the confines of the Hint House, their communal headquarters, echoes of their earthy, protean sprawl can be easily detected in the work of such contemporaries as Sunburned Hand of the Man, Wooden Wand and the Vanishing Voice, and the MV &amp; EE Medicine Show, as can their policies of utilizing non-traditional venues and maintaining an inclusive membership. So too have No Neck (or NNCK) long been pioneers in the now-fashionable art of the unwieldy discography, as they've left an extensive and virtually untraceable trail of glorious, privately-pressed recordings in their wake. With the relatively high-profile release of the potent <em>Qvaris</em>, however, perhaps the time has come for the always-secretive group to allow a hint of revealing light to penetrate their fragrant, self-generated smokescreens.</p><p>
    
    As with much of their recent work, <em>Qvaris</em> was again recorded at Hint House, and is at the very least the collective's most refined and convincing statement since their epic 2001 <em>Sticks and Stones May Break My Bones</em> on John Fahey's Revenant label. Obliquely informed by the supernatural texts of such early 20th century authors as H.P. Lovecraft, Algernon Blackwood, and Lord Dunsany, <em>Qvaris</em> is a shadowy hymn to imminent oblivion, with NNCK's familiar post-tribal landscapes coursing with some of their heaviest, most resolutely rock-centric streams to date. The album cracks open with the Sunburned-like, backwoods rumble of ""The Doon"", a title that Dunsany might've translated to mean ""The End"", before the choogle of ""Live Your Myth in Grease"" continues the ceremony with its burnished, intertwined guitar figures.</p><p>
    
    From there the album quickly turns to directly address the void with ""The Black Pope"", a swirling eddy of spookhouse keyboards, scraped strings and unmoored spirits. Awaiting at the far end of this wormhole are the locomotive likes of ""Boreal Gluts"", a supercharged, Beefheartian tussle, and later the lyrical ""Lugnagall"", which carries a pure whiff of Avalon Ballroom psych on its tradewinds of guitar, organ, and far-off vocal ecstasies. Interspersed among these lengthier tracks are four distinct variations of the ""Qvaris Theme"", a quirky little tune first introduced with chirping keys and rattling hand percussion. By album's end, even this modest piece has expanded into the fractured electronics of ""Vaticon Blue (Theme End)"", a placid throb that sounds as if it might've strayed over from John Fell Ryan's NNCK spin-off, Excepter.</p><p>
    
    The album's sole misstep-- and no NNCK album could be considered complete without one-- is ""The Caterpillar Heart,"" a quietly tinkling 11-minute sequence of silverware percussion and miniature nibbling teeth that stands in unflattering contrast to many of the record's bolder movements. This overlong departure aside, <em>Qvaris</em> showcases its self-assured cast of veteran outlaws and wayfarers seamlessly conjoined in tireless pursuit of their unnameable quarry, and you'd do well to spend some quality hours awaiting oblivion in its presence.</p></div>"|5818.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5818-qvaris/|8.0|Matthew Murphy

    lo-fi folk-pop in his Greenpoint bedroom after hearing just enough
    Iron &amp; Wine. Dude has talented, arty friend who adds just enough
    arboreal, backwards-reverbed oddness to draw comparisons to the latest
    local avant-garde ""scene"" (other than noise, of course). The hirsute
    and horn-rimmed hordes rejoice; dudes reissue debut album with a disc
    of snazzy remixes by all their cool neighbors, plus some non-locals. Crotchety Pitchfork critic makes gratuitous opening
    Brooklyn references, claps hands, says ""dude"" too much.</p><p>
    
    Much of <em>Horn of Plenty</em>'s sheepish beauty lay in Christopher
    Bear's eccentric blurrings of Edward Droste's naturally melodic,
    one-microphone campfire koans. At times <em>The Remixes</em> sharpens
    the focus on Droste's songwriting, which was often submerged in Bear's
    abyssal touches; Safety Scissors, for instance, accelerate the
    syrup-sopped ""La Duchesse Anne"", add buzzing, intermittently shuffling
    beats, and expose a catchy ""do-do-do"" leftfield pop gem. Simon Bookish
    makes the most immediately satisfying turn, adding a goofy new verse
    about ""London Calling"" and file-sharing to a clatteringly optimistic
    take on the wounded ""Eavesdropping"". Still other tracks-- such as
    Son's fuzzy ""Shift"" or Circlesquare's coruscating expansion of the
    same song (whistle-choir front and center, natch)-- serve to further
    abstract the originals.</p><p>
    
    Either way, <em>The Remixes</em> serves as a revelatory set
    of reinventions, while not a song-for-song do-over like Bloc
    Party's latest thingy. Listeners old and new are likely to find
    remixes they'll prefer over their forebears: not just Bookish's
    ""Eavesdropping"", but also Final Fantasy's ""Don't Ask"", which takes one
    of <em>Horn of Plenty</em>'s most conventional tracks and dresses it up
    in strings and snug melodrama. Soft Pink Truth takes ""A Good Place""
    all over the damn place-- underwater vox, ""Slave 4 U"" stripclub
    rhythms, meowing pet-store horn samples-- while concentrating on the
    song's evocative ""blow by blow"" lyric. And get me Jimmy Tamborello:
    Dntel does ""Merge"" as pulsing, wistful ""Chariots of Fur"" laptronica.
    Efterklang's opening ""Campfire"" rattles the halls of Rivendell with
    triumphant woodwinds that neuter the orig by comparison.</p><p>
    
    Helps, too, that so many of the artists featured aren't among
    remixing's usual suspects. First-time second-mixers Ariel Pink offer a
    droning, crackly ""Disappearing Act"", like ""Our Prayer"" Brian Wilson
    collaborating with Syd Barrett and then vanishing like the drum fills
    amid reverent, one-chord acoustic strums. Castanets apparently took
    ""Deep Sea Diver"" literally, plunging into three minutes of groaning,
    rippling guitar noise-- The Life Subaquatic! As in real fairy tales,
    freak-folk's emperors are sometimes accused of lacking clothes;
    Grizzly Bear's songs beguile however they're adorned.</p></div>"|3667.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3667-the-remixes/|7.4|Marc Hogan

Records had been defunct for more than a quarter century. It's back now, resurrected by Verve as a reissue hearth and a home 
    for legacy acts like Alice Coltrane. It's a shell of the free jazz behemoth 
    it used to be. More like a vanity project really, for compilations like 
    this, with remixes from nouveau-chic producers and beatsmiths. Reverential 
    stuff, to be sure, but it's all sort of one-note. Which is the opposite of 
    its original incarnation actually, a place where Pharoah Sanders and Albert 
    Ayler and most famously John Coltrane recorded abstract, crunching jazz 
    music. <em>Impulsive!</em> now exists as a way for avant glitch-hop 
    Derrida-jackers like Prefuse 73 to pay homage. Which is fine. It should be 
    paid.</p><p>
    Only problem is there's no improving, or even expanding on something like 
    Mingus' ""II B.S."" It's seminal, flittering around that stiff-loose bass 
    line. Some people use the word ""groove"" 
    improperly. ""II B.S."" still grooooooves. One of the biggest coups on 
    <em>Impulsive</em> is the presence of RZA dropping his remix/re-imagining/re-clunking 
    of ""II B.S."" A nice sentiment from a guy who knows a bit about flittering 
    bass lines, but it's inconsistent and awkwardly chopped up. Remixing a song 
    like ""II B.S."" is dangerous enough; rushing through it is unfortunate. Sa-Ra Creative 
    Partners take George Russell and his darting horns on ""A Helluva Town"" and 
    make them sound more like Arthur Russell on crank. There's a blitzkrieg 
    going on with the busybody double-time drums and it's easy to take at first. 
    They've at least made it a new song, keeping the original sense of 
    structure. But it's still just a deconstructionist rip-off.</p><p>
    There's successful stuff here, too. Germany's Boozoo Bajou lets Sandersâ 
    startlingly pretty ""Astral Traveling"" breathe a bit under some island 
    rhythms before taking it out to the park and dancing all over the melody 
    with overpowering percussion. DJ Dolores inherits the freewheeling grace of 
    Chico O'Farrill and Clark Terry's ""Spanish Rice"" and gives it a 
    glide-then-stomp rhythm. It's incredible sidewalk music. As in, ""Move I have 
    the street power."" Prefuse does a pretty good job with Gabor Szabo's 
    ""Mizrab"", one of the few guitar-based songs on the comp. By the time Scott 
    Herren's done with it though, it resembles what <em>Surrounded by Silence</em> 
    needed to sound like: tuneful with squealing overtones, not vice versa.
    Blackalicious' Chief XCel and Kid Koala drop 
    veneration, too, making what amounts to the exact remix you'd 
    expect from these two, highlighted by the 
    power of its drum sound. Rather than the pacesetter they act as on Archie 
    Shepp's ""Attica Blues"", XCel bumps the drums way up, skittering the pounding 
    everywhichwaybutloose. Koala works in the opposite vein on ""Bamboo Flute 
    Blues"", splicing and looping endlessly, using that unmistakable turntable 
    wobble he's known for. Except it makes me want to hear Kid Koala, not Yusef 
    Lateef, which defeats the purpose, we think.</p><p>
    All said, <em>Impulsive!</em> takes the worn-out 
    remix philosophy that damn near killed Motown and The Isley Brothers for me, 
    and flips jazz records, some classic, and some lesser known. I fully expect 
    some chucklehead to try to rework <em>A Love Supreme</em> or <em>Mingus Ah Um</em> 
    soon. That is when I will declare war.</p></div>"|2104.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2104-impulsive/|7.0|Sean Fennessey

Just months after their generous two-disc set <em>Church Gone Wild/ Chirpin' Hard</em>, the duo have dropped yet another mammoth package on your doorstep: <i>Concentration Face</i>, the group's first live DVD, which contains a whopping three hours of footage from Hella's 2004 Japanese tour, as well as the <em>Homeboy</em> EP, which features four new blasts of the duo's distinctive spazz-rock mayhem.</p><p>
    
    Directed by Ryan Walker Thomas, the <i>Concentration Face DVD is divided roughly into two halves: The first is a standard, closely-edited tour film following Hella from city to city; the second presents a complete live set recorded in Tokyo. Both halves are packed with the duo's explosive instrumental music, and feature remarkably little in the way of stage banter or dialogue. As such, the collection makes no effort to introduce either of the two musicians as personalities, instead focusing resolutely on capturing Hella's fierce live show, a choice that seems rather debatable given the duo's static, minimal stage production. On record Hella have grown increasingly reliant on Nintendo-inspired electronic textures, but here they spend the bulk of their time in full metallic shredder mode, facing each other down like a couple of long-lost, hyper-adrenalized Van Halen brothers, while their attentive Japanese audiences stand and vibrate politely.</i></p><p>
    
    For casual fans, the first half of <i>Concentration Face will prove to be the more compelling, as it intersperses this live concert footage with a montage of Japanese city scenes, train rides, and children's television shows. The band also unselfishly includes excerpts from the sets of supporting acts like Ari Morimoto and M.A.G.O., some of whom prove intriguing enough to nearly upstage the headliner. Throughout the disc, one can't help but marvel at Hella's insane chops, and the relentless ferocity of drummer Hill in particular. It's obviously music of extreme physical demands, a point emphasized by a segment that depicts a sweat-drenched Hill examining his kit after a show, looking as though he and the entire area had just been soaked with a firehose.</i></p><p>
    
    After more than an hour of such footage, however, the concert that comprises the DVD's second half might seem a tad redundant. Drawing heavily from 2002's <em>Hold Your Horse Is</em>, Hella pummel the likes of ""Cafeteria Bananas"" and ""Biblical Violence"", their sound a repetitive, delirious blur of finger-tapped fretboards and stampeding hoofbeats. Essentially presented as a real-time event, for some reason they've gone so far as to even retain several lengthy pauses between songs while the duo quietly tinker with their equipment, an inclusion that does little to relieve the set's advancing monotony. </p><p>
    
    Such is <i>Concentration Face's bountiful overkill that the 29-minute, four song <em>Homeboy</em></i> seems positively miniature in comparison. Roiling opener ""Gothspel For You Not Them"" is one continuous discordant crescendo, while the choppy ""Madonna Approaches R&amp;B; Blonde Wreckages"" adds loopy keyboard tones for a brief swirl of Playstation-prog. The short set closes with the perfectly titled ""If I Were in Hella I Would Eat Lick"", a track of ridiculous density that, as with the best moments on <i>Concentration Face, reveals Hill and Seim's almost telepathic interplay, an intense connection that can make them seem oblivious to the presence of an audience. And as <em>Homeboy</em> illustrates, the twosome might just be at their most effective when, for once, they're able to exercise a little portion control. </i></p></div>"|11758.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11758-concentration-facehomeboy/|6.8|Matthew Murphy

Having spent some time recently wondering if the woman responsible for so much haunted, supernatural music might be producing some beacon of artistic integrity that would shine through layers of anticipation and cynicism, it was difficult to not be let down by the mundane discovery that, in fact, she's merely being herself here, writing more about everyday epiphanies than great cosmic truths.  It's a pretty Zen lesson in expectation when I think about it, teaching me a thing or two about the pitfalls of hanging onto anything other than gradual enlightenment and a zero-sum world.</p><p>
<em>Aerial</em>, a double album separated into chapters of <em>A Sea of Honey</em> and <i>A Sky of Honey, is Bush's answer to a world outside expecting fireworks. That is, <em>Aerial</em></i> is no answer at all except to illuminate her love for her son, her life, and various distractions (everything from Elvis, to the joy of washing clothes, to the digits in pi). Musically, this is reflected in a uniformly low-key backdrop of piano, pastel rhythm section, and, of course, her own lush palette of vocal textures.  Initially, many of the songs seem muted, passive, dated-- hardly reminiscent of Bush's previous adventures in hi-fi. Digging deeper, while the arrangements are hardly explosive-- a Renaissance string arrangement for ""Bertie"", birdsong in ""Aerial Tal"", subtle electronic touches in ""Joanni""-- they're not so much dated as understated, as efficiently tied to their creator's idiosyncrasies as any in Bush's canon. Of course, that doesn't necessarily mean they will leap out and grab unconverted listeners as the best moments on <em>Hounds of Love</em> or <em>The Dreaming</em> did, but then I wonder how many unconverted listeners are still following Bush's sensual trail these days.</p><p>
<em>Aerial</em>'s first disc (<em>A Sea of Honey</em>) begins in nondescript fashion with a torch song to Elvis (!) and a molasses-laden backing of big fat 80s rock drums, wispy synth cluster, electronic gamelan ping, and the driest rhythm guitar skank I've heard in 20 years. Still, there's a mysterious air about the song, especially as Bush cries, ""the wind is whistling, the wind is whistling through the house."" This song was chosen as a single, for what reasons I can't really imagine, but is a nice setup for the more interesting character study of the man with the ""obsessive nature and deep fascination for numbers"" on ""Π"". In fact, it's Bush's reading off the digits of the number that most interest me, stretching out some, crowding others into rapidly sung groups, all with some of the most expressive singing on the record. Likewise, on the piano-led ballad ""Mrs. Bartoluzzi"", she manages to sound fascinating while simply repeating the phrase ""washing machine,"" and backing herself with superficially silly things like ""slooshy sloshy, slooshy sloshy."" I can't say I'm as taken with ""Bertie"" (about Bush's son) or ""Joanni"" (for Joan of Arc), both of which seem totally sincere, but overrun in pleasant, ""tasteful"" arrangements that never quite compel me enough to go back for repeated listens.</p><p>
    
    The second disc (<em>A Sky of Honey</em>) seems a bit more adventurous, which is fitting given that it's a song-cycle on the natural ebb and flow of life and the seasons. Beginning with a ""Prelude"" and ""Prologue"", Bush eases into her most subtly symphonic music on record, backing herself with only piano and soft, modulating synth pulse. Her teasing lines, ""it's gonna be so good,"" referring to the passing of summer into fall, are both poetic and playful, and fit perfectly the sense of effortless euphoria throughout the disc. Still, I might have wished for a bit more spark: ""An Architect's Dream"", ""Sunset"", and ""Nocturn"", despite maintaining the narrative of her concept, are a bit too steeped in uber-light adult contemporary sheen for my tastes. By the time of the closing title track, my ears are lightly glazed over, and its frail ""rock"" section does little justice to lines like ""I want to be up on the roof, I feel I gotta get up on the roof!"" At one point, Bush trades cackles with a bird's song, suggesting she's quite happy with her simple life as a mother and artist. Far be it from me to criticize happy endings, but in musical terms, a comfortable, even-keeled existence sometimes comes out as isolated and ordinary art.</p></div>"|1181.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1181-aerial/|6.4|Dominique Leone

Their debut album, <em>Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables</em> was originally released in 1980 on the UK label Cherry Red, and has since been re-released by several other labels, including IRS, Alternative Tentacles, and Cleopatra. The newest reissue-- the special 25th anniversary edition-- features the original artwork and a bonus 55-minute DVD documenting the making of the album as well as the band's early years.</p><p>
    The packaging here is fantastic: The once grainy, indistinguishable burning police cars that don the cover now appear in much sharper detail. For the original pressing, the band requested the flames look orange, and as a result, the entire cover was printed orange on white. After that pressing, strict black and white was used, and most versions looked like something produced on a gas station copy machine. The tri-fold digipak offers a pull-out replica of the original collage/lyric sheet, featuring newspaper clippings, advertisements, and political diatribes all infused with the bands usual biting sarcasm and bizarre humor. Ronald Reagan grins out at you despite his drawn-in Hitler mustache and the fact that someone has written ""sex"" all over his face. The label from a can of salmon with <em>Taxi Driver</em>'s Travis Bickle pasted over it sits above a marching line of breakfast foods. You could spend an hour looking over the double-sided poster and still miss things.</p><p>
    Unfortunately, there are no bonus tracks. The original 14 songs are here; the album is still barely over a half-hour long. It is remastered, but considering that this is a 25-year-old debut recording by a punk rock band, don't expect it to suddenly sound impeccable. It is what it is, and the group's amateurism showed more on this record than on subsequent ones. Even some of the songs fall prey to the band's younger, less focused outlook. ""Kill the Poor"", the album opener, is fun to sing along with, but at its heart it's a generic rock song hiding behind satirical lyrics and low-fi production. The final track is the ill-conceived cover of ""Viva Las Vegas"", which seems tame after the 13 originals that precede it. </p><p>
    There are several classic DK tracks here though, most notably ""California Über Alles"" and ""Holiday in Cambodia"", both of which still sound powerful and fresh. The opening bass notes of ""Holiday in Cambodia"" are some of the most sinister sounds punk rock ever produced. Of the lesser-known tracks, ""Drug Me"" is one of the band's faster songs, and it strongly hinted at where the band would head with their next EP. ""When Ya Get Drafted"", ""Let's Lynch the Landlord"", and ""Your Emotions"" all show off the group's ability to blend upbeat, light-hearted music with sinister satirical lyrics.</p><p>
    Over the years, the Dead Kennedys' lyrics and vocals have recieved the most attention. Jello Biafra's over-the-top warble is instantly recognizable, and no one used sick and twisted humor to deliver such serious messages-- many are still applicable today -- with the same level of skill. ""Chemical Warfare"" predicts bio-terrorism that hits too close to home, or perhaps I should say too close to the country club. ""Holiday in Cambodia"" mocks the poor little rich kid who thinks he's got it bad with lines like, ""You'll work harder with a gun in your back/ For a bowl of rice a day."" </p><p>
    The bonus DVD offers little for the serious fan, mostly interviews with East Bay Ray, Klaus Flouride, a couple of radio DJs, and other people connected with the band in its early days. Little attention is paid to the actual creation of the album; most of the interviewees just find various ways to talk about how great it is. Included are six live performances, all filmed with the original line-up. Most of the footage here has been widely available, either on the <em>Dead Kennedys: The Early Years Live</em> DVD, or on various VHS tapes throughout the years. But these early performances are interesting if you've never seen Biafra's bizarre pantomime-style antics (or his obsession with green plastic gloves), but some clips just go to prove that watching any band try to entertain 20 or 30 people who seem completely uninterested can be painful-- even if the band went on to become legendary.</p></div>"|2626.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2626-fresh-fruit-for-rotting-vegetables/|7.0|Cory D.

For a while it seemed as though the records sounded too much alike, but Dirty Three found ways to change up the sound through multi-tracking and shift of focus, so that's not quite it.</p><p>
    The weariness has I think more to do with the inherent drama and love of dynamics in the trio's approach to their respective instruments. You think violin, guitar, and drums, and you figure there's something in there that might work as background music, but Dirty Three albums ask a lot. With their inevitable crescendos, every song eventually butts its way into whatever you're doing. You're either paying close attention or you're listening to something else.</p><p>
    On <em>Cinder</em>, Dirty Three seem ready to pare back and let the songs inhabit comparatively modest worlds. Most of these 19 tracks are relatively short mood sketches that will likely be pushed in grander direction in a live setting. There's a bit more instrumental variety, too, with Warren Ellis adding mandolin and piano to some tracks, and Mick Turner contributing bass and organ. ""Doris"" surprises by beginning with huge drums (turns out Jim White knows how to play a straight backbeat) and angular, almost funky guitar, before reaching a moment of jubilation with a jagged blast of bagpipes from guest Mark Saul. ""The Zither Player"" is an extrapolation of a theme by Hungarian fiddle player Félix Lajkó, and its jittery upbeat rhythm and Gypsy melody is unusually danceable for the D3. On the other end of the spectrum are quiet set pieces like ""Ever Since"" and ""Amy"", on which restrained playing by Ellis allows the simple beauty of trio's group interplay to gel.</p><p>
    Another first: <em>Cinder</em> has vocals. ""Great Waves"" has Dirty Three backing Chan Marshall to lovely effect; as with her 1998 record <em>Moon Pix</em>, Marshall's hushed ethereal leanings sound particularly convincing stitched up in the rhythms of Turner and White. And she remembered to bring her newly sharpened sense of melody. Sally Timms' wordless cooing on the shapeless ""Feral"", on the other hand, is far less satisfying, bordering on pointless. Still, on their seventh album, any expansion in approach is welcome, and even the excesses of traditional D3 builders like ""She Passed Through"" are easy to swallow. If much of it is merely pretty, this is easily the most diverse and wide-ranging Dirty Three record yet, absolutely the right thing for them to be doing at this time. It doesn't ask for or promise nearly as much, which is just the breather needed.</p></div>"|2332.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2332-cinder/|6.7|Mark Richardson

The moment the first strains of the
    first song off <em>Lick of the Tip</em> issued from the
    speakers, I flashed forward to a later track, the name of
    which had already made me grin without hearing it--
    ""Power to the Pixies"". Circulus, their debut album's
    weirdly suggestive title aside, are the kind of band
    who will sing about transfering actual power to actual
    pixies. You just made me listen to a medieval folk-revivalist
    record.</p><p>
    
    We're talking tights. We're talking woolen dresses.
    We're talking capes and floppy hats and all the
    Society for the Creative Anachronism accoutrements
    that, glimpsed across the Diag lawn, used to make even
    the mild-mannered me feel the stirrings of a bully
    inside. We're talking a ""Britain's foremost
    medieval-influenced progressive psychedelic folk
    band,"" per recent befuddled profile in <i>The Guardian.</i></p><p>
    
    In all fairness, the songs on <em>Lick</em> are not
    strict interpretations of Elizabethan music-- in fact,
    Circulus like to see themselves as hip pariahs in the
    stuffy world of what they call ""lute mafia."" While
    they retain basic features of medieval folk-- the
    structures, the melodies, the now-novel plaintive
    intervals between the lead and backing vocals-- they
    also slather the record with signifiers of
    psychedelia. Squelchy synth lines compete with flutes
    for the high frequencies, and the low end is certainly
    more muscular than anything normally heard around a
    maypole. Circulus are not even above a wailing
    pentatonic guitar solo or two. </p><p>
    
    The album gets going, via ""Miri It Is"", with a classic
    fakeout-- a Middle Earth chant suddenly sprouts an
    angry beat, over which grows a layer of ELO-style
    organ wanking. The disorientation is dizzying and not
    entirely unpleasant. There is, however, a glue that
    holds all this fiddle-faddle together and gives it a
    certain inner logic. Although it remains
    unacknowledged directly, that glue is, of course,
    drugs, and plenty of them. </p><p>
    
    Whatever the reason, stoner music is forever dancing
    around a miniature Stonehenge, and Circulus's hybrids
    are technically no weirder than the usual Celticisms
    of the heavy metal parking lot. So it makes total
    sense that Circulus are signed to Rise Above, a
    doom-metal label, and marketed with a bit of a snicker
    (ask yourself how the hell did the album wind up at
    Pitchfork). The only thing I fail to peg is the band's
    own attitude toward their schtick. Are they more
    Napalm Death or Goblin Cock, so to speak? They do play
    it relatively straight, and there's nothing overtly
    campy about <em>Lick</em>. At the same time, Circulus
    are known to book hipster loft parties and rock them
    in full regalia, feigning obliviousness to the nature
    of their freak appeal. Something about this is
    upsetting in a very elemental way. Is it still a joke
    when its butt is absolutely every party involved?</p></div>"|1822.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1822-lick-on-the-tip-of-an-envelope-thats-yet-to-be-sent/|6.2|Michael Idov

    pulsing salsa/samba/ethno-jam ""Root Down"" and the backpacker-luring ""Get It Together"".  On <i>Solid
    Gold Hits' extricated format, nestled between a clunky Fatboy Slim remix and hip-hop crossover
    ""Fight for Your Right (to Party)"", it sounds a lot like what it is: a rap-rock song.  Forget the
    Spike Jonze video (it's on the bonus DVD); this </i><i>is</i> rap-rock, alive with shambolic drums
    and Ad-Rock's inimitable goblin-howl.  And it's splendid-- timeless, even.  But let's not kid
    ourselves: It helped spawn some miserable music.</p><p>
    
    Here's the problem with hits compilations: They really force you to look at hits closely, unguarded
    by the whipping propeller of the new. A facile concept, maybe. Thing is, institution acts-- of which
    the Beasties hang with the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Beck and Metallica and Pearl Jam-- either get a
    free pass or make ""great"" albums buoyed by the times they exist in. Compilations require magnifying
    glasses. The Beastie Boys are best seen with binoculars and the sound way up.</p><p>
<em>Solid Gold Hits</em> knowingly hopscotches from era to era. But there's
    no purpose, other than to infuriate and flaunt diversity, maybe. The coldest, meanest beat Ad-Rock,
    MCA, and Mike D ever rapped over can be found on ""Pass the Mic"", an aggro-jaunt that changes tempos
    so effortlessly it sounds like three different songs. It also happens to be one of the most fiercely
    rapped songs in their catalogue (""Everybody rapping like it's a commercial...""). To follow it up here
    with the saccharine ""An Open Letter to NYC"" from last year's <em>To the Five Boroughs</em> only amplifies
    the trio's diminished skills and creeping irrelevance.</p><p>
    
    Three songs are included here from the Beasties' quasi-infamous debut LP <em>Licensed
    to Ill</em>. Last year, in light of the album's reissuing, Pitchfork's Dominique Leone wrote, ""Okay, so
    it isn't the music or all the rhymes that translate beyond the scene of the crime. What, then? Probably
    just that the Beasties didn't give a fuck-- AND AMERICA DESPERATELY NEEDED TO BE SHOWN HOW NOT TO GIVE
    A FUCK."" With respect, place my hat in the ""giving a fuck"" ring because ""No Sleep Till Brooklyn"" did,
    does, and always will sound horrendously lame.  Hey, they were kids. Me, too. Unfortunately, the album's most durable gems (""Hold It Now,
    Hit It"", ""Rhymin and Stealin"") are absent here. Worse, <em>Paul's Boutique</em>-- theirs and the Dust Brothers'
    masterpiece-- is underrepresented at only two songs.</p><p>
    
    Without ax-grinding, if this were my Beastie Boys CD-R I'd take ""Shadrach"" and ""Neogtiation Limerick File""
    over ""Triple Trouble"" and ""Ch-Check It Out"" (though the Miss Piggy gag is great in retrospect).  Of
    course, hits are hits are hits. Which means their pre-succcess single ""She's On It"" is nowhere to be found. Still, I can't quarrel with the magnitude of the best of these songs: ""Sure
    Shot"" is a superb lesson in pick-and-roll rap; ""Shake Your Rump"" is ripe with nonsensical quotables;
    ""Intergalactic"" is robotically charming. New listens even reveal a sublimely downmixed organ that really
    sustains the breakbeat.</p><p>
    
    All said, 1999's 2xCD <em>The Sounds of Science</em> is a far superior collection of songs, both essential and
    superfluous. It's not much more expensive-- plus it doesn't have a title as MOR as <em>Solid Gold Hits</em>.
    For the novice, this is a quaint introduction, but one that fails to recognize the congealing brilliance
    of the Beastie canon. Their albums-- even the overstuffed ones-- have a hypnotic groove to them.  There's
    no point in fucking that sort of thing up.</p></div>"|609.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/609-solid-gold-hits/|7.5|Sean Fennessey

Even as the most ordered and poppy band in the Jewelled Antler constellation, which curates all things fractured and sublime (from droning field recordings to improvised psych-folk), Skygreen Leopards' music is similarly effaced, favoring a quaint and trippy aura over slick veneer. Naturalistic process is paramount; albums come with pithy back-stories haloed in hazy traceries of light, flickering with pastoral forest music, and whispering tape-hiss sprites.</p><p> 
    
    The story here involves a visit to an acquaintance of Arlo Guthrie, a shed containing an ""ancient drumset"" and a ""cobwebby electric guitar,"" an all-night jam session, and daughters dancing in the moonlight. Skygreen Leopards recognizes the power inherent in old things, not just in the sounds they can make, but in the way their dormant charge of history (all that music, built up inside them) can detonate in the mind of the reverent user, blowing open the doors that lead away from self-consciousness and toward spontaneous states where music occurs as naturally as rain. And maybe they also found an ancient Xerox machine in that shed, all splintery wood and rusted iron gears, and used it to run off the ghostly, barely-there text in their one sheet. Readability would definitely take a back seat to the authenticity of the antique with Skygreen Leopards.</p><p> 
    
    Since Skygreen Leopards' experiments hinge more on the magic moment-- a ""first thought, best thought"" impulse the Beats would've admired-- than the deliberate path, and because their naturalistic-bordering-on-mystical aesthetic is firmly established, <em>Jehovah Surrender</em> falls within their usual parameters: Six brightly misty psych-pop relics that barely hang together, reveling in organic now-ness instead of professional precision, charting another little section of the sun-baked pasture of Donovan Quinn's and Glenn Donaldson's collective mind. </p><p> 
    
    The percussion has three modes, all of them similar: shambolic, faltering, and clumsy, although the dropped beats are part and parcel of their authenticity-of-imperfection vibe. On ""Jehovah I Surrender"", jerky rhythm guitars stab at approximate drum fills; a soaring vocal bleeds pastel light; a fuzzy psych-rock lead trudges woozily across the scene with weary grandeur. Standout track ""Apparition of Suns (aka The Ferryman's Long Arms)"" is full of bleary harmonies, with a terrifically druggy, weightless vibe. On ""I Was a Thief"", a throttled fuzz-bass line climbs and hovers in mid-air, and on ""Let the Lion be Swallowed by a Dove"", bleating foghorn-like guitars break like dawn over a jaunty strum. If Black Mountain is a cryogenically-frozen Velvet Underground awaking crusty-eyed but unbowed in the new millennium, Skygreen Leopards is Syd Barrett after the same long nap. Urban legend has it that anyone named Donovan's birth certificate comes printed on a handsome paisley stock; this stuff is hardwired into them. </p></div>"|7761.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7761-jehovah-surrender-ep/|7.4|Brian Howe

    too good to be true. So this Sumpner guy, schoolteacher by day, folk DIY whiz by
    night, shacks up in the boondocks of England and records an LP in his kitchen
    using nothing but a four-track. To further thicken this Disney-movie plot,
    Sumpner originally just sat on the recordings, neglecting to
    solicit any potentially interested labels. According to legend, eventual label Fat Cat
    received the demos in 2002, but only recently managed to contact Sumpner due to
    his mysterious vagabond lifestyle. Fortunately scouring all of England for this
    self-titled debut proves worth the wait, and Sumpner's nuts and bolts approach
    further enriches Fat Cat's already impressive folk booty.</p><p>
    
    As its conditions suggest, <em>Songs sounds distinctly removed from any current
    trends. If Animal Collective is Fat Cat's frenetic, avant-garde weapon of
    choice, Songs plays the trusty old revolver role to a T. The lo-fi recording
    quality harkens back to 60s staples like Simon &amp; Garfunkel or Nick Drake, not
    to mention Sumpner's haunting pastoral imagery. The dude sings what he knows,
    and nuts to anyone averse to songs about trees, night, day and love. Opener ""I
    Am Daylights"" awakens the senses like a Maxwell House commercial, harnessing an
    improbably healthy blend of corny guitar plucking and angelic harmonies. Sumpner
    ain't all about lovey-dovey ephemeral stuff though, and at times he resembles
    the sharp melodic mettle of Sufjan Stevens. ""Nightfall (For Boris P.)"" and ""Knulp"" aren't exactly ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"", though both feature catchy melodies delicately playing off equally gossamer acoustic riffs.</em></p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, the Sufjan similarities end there. The patchwork <i>Songs often succumbs to attrition, lacking enough swirling builds and surprises to sustain its initial birr over 10 tracks. Balking at choruses and complex song structure in general, Sumpner flattens his debut into one sedated, 40-minute campfire outing. True, folkies wear such minimalism like a badge, though <em>Songs</em> begs the question of whether Sumpner's a better songwriter or aesthetic-catcher-- or worse, just a feel-good story attached to a mediocre artist. Regardless, hats off to a folk musician who literally embodies as much lore as his mystical music, and it's exciting to think what this guy could do with a nice eight-track, let alone a full-blown recording studio.</i></p></div>"|7836.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7836-songs-of-green-pheasant/|7.3|Adam Moerder

In an artistic progression strikingly similar to that of former Eric's Trip bassist Julie Doiron, Smithson has crafted a home-recorded, bittersweet songcycle in reverence of solitude. Utilizing a skeletal, percussion-less backdrop, the album centers its hermetic gaze upon Smithson's serene vocals and intimate, plainspoken lyrics to create an inviting haven, while coolly ignoring the fact that in music such safety is not necessarily the highest virtue.</p><p>
    
    ""I may not be happy/ At least I know I'm Safer Here/ Nothing to fear,"" Smithson sings on the opener and title track, setting the album's melancholic tone of resigned isolation. And despite tasteful contributions such guests as Rex Ritter (Jessamine, Fontanelle) and Brian Foote (Fontanelle, Nudge)-- in addition to Smithson's skillful vocal and instrumental overdubs-- tracks such as ""Somewhere Far"" and ""How Thoughtless"" still sound resolutely isolated, as though constructed miles apart from gainful human contact. Unfortunately, however, Smithson's performances here lack the ecstatic fervor of Kranky labelmate Christina Carter's solo works, or the soul-plumbing intensity of Cat Power, and instead too often settles into rather faceless bedroom indie-strum.</p><p>
    
    Perhaps the roots of the album's retreating solitude are exposed on tracks like the heartsick ""Nowhere Near"" (""I remember wondering how I'd ever get over you""), or the angry ""Letter to the Empire"", which delivers politically-charged journal entries like ""I prefer to trust my eyes/ And all I see is pointless death,"" or ""When you say liberate, you're lying"" with a lullaby coo rather than a bullhorn. This overriding sense of disillusion and loss reaches a depressive apex on ""Ticking Away"", whose narrator seems trapped in defeated stasis, lamenting ""While the seasons turn/ I just stand here watching/ Waiting for something to push me on,"" over an acoustic guitar that chimes with the nagging regularity of a grandfather clock.</p><p>
    
    On the layered ""Speak Through Me"", Smithson adds a toothsome dissonance to her overdubbed vocal roundelay, and David Farrell's synth swells provide ""A New Day"" with a graceful drone. Such flourishes do wonders to spruce up <em>Safer Here</em>'s spare sonic terrain, and as the album draws to its uncertain finish on ""Crossroads"" (""So much is wasted/ I can't look anymore/ For fear I might drown""), it seems reasonable to conclude that next time, Smithson might be well served-- musically and otherwise-- to stray much farther from her erstwhile comfort zone. </p></div>"|7835.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7835-safer-here/|6.8|Matthew Murphy

    John Peel was. And if you know who Peel is, you also know that as a ""tribute to
    John Peel"", this two-disc set is kind of wanting. Maybe if they had titled it
    <i>A Hipster-Approved Guide to John Peel I'd be more sympathetic. Because
    Peel was as famous for his ""bad"" taste as his ""good."" Yes, he loved Joy Division,
    made a cause out of the Fall, and recorded a session for nearly every indie rock
    band of note during his too-short time on this earth. But when in doubt, Peel
    would play a happy hardcore record-- and not ironically.</i></p><p>
    
    Peel was infamous as the man who took grindcore to the masses, when it was still
    just a bunch of spotty teenagers showing off for their friends in a northern pub.
    And he loved it not only for the humor inherent in seconds-long songs like Napalm
    Death's ""You Suffer"", but because it seemed like a direct extension of his love
    for punk rock. He tried to bring acid house to his listeners when they were otherwise
    getting a steady diet of the Wedding Present. (He tried to do the same a few years
    later with jungle when his audience preferred Britpop.) He was once asked by critic
    David Stubbs which he preferred, Joy Division or the shambling Bogshed-- a band
    arguably no one but Peel listeners remember-- and he replied ""Bogshed."" And he
    wasn't kidding. Even up to the end, he was giving equal time in his famous sessions
    to Soundmurderer, the Bug, and Hot Snakes.</p><p>
    
    As music, of course, you can't fault this record. (That's what happens when you get
    to cherry-pick the best records from a four-decade broadcasting career.)  And though
    it does flag a little bit by the end-- sorry Delgados, you were no Jimi Hendrix,
    don't feel too bad about it-- there are only a handful of songs that are less than
    great. Arranged more or less chronologically, you can almost imagine parents and
    their disaffected teenagers bonding over it, Dad and daughter swapping Faces for
    Super Furry Animals. It'd be a veritable fucking WB moment.</p><p>
    
    Peel got his start on pirate radio in the 1960s, and that's where the collection
    begins as well. A goodly chunk of the first disc is straight off of classic rock
    radio. David Bowie's ""Life on Mars?"" and the Doors' ""Five to One"" jostle for space
    with non-King Biscuit Flour Hour staples like Captain Beefheart's still jaw-dropping
    ""Big Eyed Beans From Venus"" (""Mr. Zoot Horn Rollo, hit that long, lunar note"") and
    T.Rex's ""Debora"" (watch the scales fall from the eyes of the young Devendra fan in
    your life). Try not to choke up a little bit during Tim Buckley's ""Song to the Siren"".
    Punk is represented by sprinkling of Big Names like the Clash and (of course) Joy Div.</p><p>
    
    Peel's fave song of all time, the Undertones' ""Teenage Kicks"", kicks off the second
    disc. This one comes off more like the March of Britpop (Slight Return), stretching
    from the Smiths to Pulp, taking in both the populist (Blur's ""Song 2"") and anti-populist
    (Billy Bragg's surprisingly enjoyable ""A New England""). Peel's deep, abiding love for all
    forms of Jamaican music is reduced to one song, Culture's ""Lionrock"". Likewise, apparently
    Orbital's ""Chime"" is our representative electronic dance record. This is not to say the
    disc isn't rotten with good music-- reinsert my comments Re:Tim Buckley for Robert Wyatt's
    ""Shipbuilding""-- it's just a little...uniform.</p><p>
    
    Maybe a disc where Extreme Noise Terror was butting against the Soft Machine was butting
    against 808 State wouldn't work from a salability perspective, but that's not what Peel's
    shows sounded like, nor why he broadcast. While <i>John Peel: A Tribute is 40 tracks
    of lovely, listenable music, I can't help thinking Peel would view it with a bit of
    suspicion. But then, he'd probably view any kind of tribute to his humble self with a
    bit of suspicion. He was just a guy who played records for a living, after all.</i></p></div>"|2103.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2103-john-peel-a-tribute/|8.4|Jess Harvell

Perhaps it's because his best albums are as intimate and affecting as a cloistered club gig. Or perhaps it's because this album comes only one year after </em><em>I Am a Cold Rock</em>, a vapid tribute album, and <em>Greatest Palace Hits, a compilation with embellished renditions of some of his best-known songs. The latter was contrived and caustic, employing stately session musicians in the service of mechanized self-parody. Unlike </em><em>Palace Hits' cryptic assortment of sterile performances, </em><em>Southeast</em> summons all the power and potency of a competent backing band without suffering any homogenization. Brash and unhinged, Oldham is able to evade the polished sheen that diffused his earlier effort; for a musician whose erratic solo shows often fail to evoke the vitality of his records, this is a delightfully drunken racket of tangled guitars and thunderous percussion.</p><p>
    
    The album captures an anger and regret intense enough to nearly bruise listeners and attendees, but also manages to preserve the pristine trembles in Oldham's throat. Imagine the forceful clarity of <em>Superwolf</em> applied to Palace's entire catalog: vaporous guitars elevating frail backwoods ditties into tornadic Texan epics. ""Blokbuster"" and ""Break of Day"" are vastly more impressive than their studio counterparts, paying tribute to Kranky ambiance and Neil Young's lassoed solos.  The band-- which here includes Matt Sweeney and David Bird on guitar, Paul Oldham on bass, and Pink Nasty (author of the inestimable ""What the Fuck"") on back-up vocals-- often veers toward some fascinating experiments in prog mysticism (""A Sucker's Evening"", ""O Let It Be"") and convulsive psych (""Madeleine Mary"").  The vaudeville ragtime of ""I Send My Love to You"" cops as much from the Mekons as Mr. Kite, while those in search of vintage Bonnie gloom will find solace in the glazed keyboards and crumbling voices of ""Wolf Among Wolves"" and ""Nomadic Revery"".</p><p>
    
    Oldham's willingness to navigate his band through odd tones and genres can also end in noxious mediocrity, though: ""May It Always Be"", one of <em>Ease Down the Road</em>'s best songs, gravitates around flaccid punk riffs at an absurd volume.  And at its worst, the album approximates-- however bizarrely-- <em>Yield</em>-era Pearl Jam.  Fortunately, most of the album's other blemishes are veiled blessings: What could be more ingratiating than a Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy album with poor fidelity, giggling herbs, trampled Rolling Rock bottles, and reams of static? Where else can you hear the abashed elation of an entire club singing ""Death to Everyone"", or Oldham mumbling that he ""got clown in his face,"" or an asshole, surrounded by cackling girls, advising the band to ""play hard"" as Oldham wanders into the tender sorrow of ""I See a Darkness""?  <i>Summer in the Southeast</i> is far from perfect as an aesthetic statement-- or even as a recording-- but as a document of Oldham's irresistible occultism, it could hardly be more effective.</p></div>"|704.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/704-summer-in-the-southeast/|7.1|Alex Linhardt

Here was a guy who'd come out of      nowhere with an endlessly hypnotic slurpy singsong flow spitting      unbelievably hard, violent street shit and naming names. He'd put the entire      rap world on blast in ""How to Rob an Industry Nigga"", he had impeccable      mixtape credentials, and he already carried himself like a star. He received the backing of Dr. Dre and Eminem, and there was nothing to      stop him from just destroying wack candy rappers like Ja Rule and running      wild all over the industry. And then, of course, he became the biggest rap      star on the planet. He endorsed video games and vitamin water and doo-rags.      He started meaningless feuds for no good reason. Earlier this year, he      released <em>The Massacre</em>, an album bloated with maddeningly half-assed      asshole-rap that will probably end up being the biggest-selling record of      2005.</p><p>And now he's made a movie. <em>Get Rich or Die Tryin'</em> is 50's attempt to      make his own <em>8 Mile</em>, right down to the legend-building      loosely autobiographical story, respectably middlebrow director, and      grainy verite cinematography. We'll know next week whether it's as boring as      <em>8 Mile</em>. But 50's done something surprising with the <em>Get Rich</em> soundtrack. If      the movie is his respectability move, the soundtrack is a direct anti-pop      move, a record full of hard, grim, liquid NYC street-rap-- woozy flanged      guitars and swollen horns and nonchalant bloodlust. All the rappers here come from 50's G-Unit camp, and most of the beats come from no-name      producers like K.O. and B-Money. And the oddly coesive result is the best G-Unit album      since Young Buck's <em>Straight Outta Ca$hville</em>.      There are sex-raps and party-raps here, but the R&amp;B elements are played down      to the point where they sound just like the gangsta tracks, all bleary      windswept glistening soul samples, not a ""Candy Shop"" in sight. And      sometimes, as with the monstrous foghorn tuba stomp on ""I'll Whup Ya Head""      and the magnetic descending Spanish guitar on ""You Already Know"", the tracks      find an irresistibly hazy widescreen throb.</p><p>Maybe the experience of playing his younger self onscreen has helped 50      recapture some of the hunger he had a couple of years ago. Throughout the      album, 50 keeps all the confidence he had on <em>The Massacre</em> but little of the      arrogance. His murder-talk threats have a real bite: ""Let's ride around,      find a nigga stuntin' on Front Street/ With the shines on, niggas be      lookin' like lunchmeat."" And his boasts have a nonchalant      irreverence: ""If I wore a suit everyday like Jay-Z/ Niggas would think I      bumped my fuckin' head and went crazy."" Occasionally he lapses into      hegemonic self-parody (""I see something special when I look in ya eyes/      With ya legs way back, I say this pussy is mine""), but for once that's the      exception.</p>
<p>Nearly all of 50's backup guys play their roles to perfection. Lloyd      Banks returns to his mini-50 tauntingly mannered mumble-flow. Young      Buck steals a couple of tracks with his hard-as-fuck predatory drawl. M.O.P.      makes a dependably bananas gutter-stomp appearance on ""When Death Becomes      You"", nicely offset by 50's slinky hook and the song's lush, dramatic      production. Mase, probably 50's biggest influence as a rapper, gives a      tantalizing glimpse of what might've happened if he'd never abandoned      street-rap. Even the crew's two worst rappers, Tony Yayo and Spider Loc,      prove effective in small doses, their flaws camouflaged by excellent      production and better rappers. Only the Mobb Deep guys, Havoc especially,      get lost, their dead-eyed nihilism not making the transition to the album's      cinematic hardness. Not everyone can do this movie-thug thing.</p>

In his new history of the band, <em>Guided by Voices: 20 Years of Hunting Accidents in the Forests of Rock and Roll</em>, James Greer tells of a copy that eventually sold for more than $6,000. It's not hard to see why these records are so costly and coveted: Only 500 were pressed in 1992, and band members and assorted hangers-on decorated each of them by hand, mimicking Robert Pollard's collage-style graphics, in the process making each one unique.</p><p>
    
    In its 13 years of existence, <em>Propeller</em> has been much more lovingly preserved on vinyl than on compact disc. For years, I only knew it as the other half of <em>Vampire on Titus, which always made me recall Big Star's </em><em>#1 Record</em> and <em>Radio City</em> (both bound together on the same disc, still awaiting separate deluxe reissues). That's good company, and an appropriate connection, but for me, <em>Propeller</em> always suffered the proximity of the disinviting <em>Vampire on Titus</em>, as fanged an album as its title implies.</p><p>
    
    Now, with Scat Records reissuing <em>Propeller</em>, the emphasis is again squarely on vinyl. The CD version has nice new packaging featuring several of Pollard's collages, essentially enabling you to choose your own cover. But it pales in comparison to the LP itself, which includes an insert with 81 of the original collage covers and reproduces the #14 cover (""50 EGGS"") and the boxing diagrams in their original 12""x12"" dimensions. Despite its release during the heyday of the compact disc, <em>Propeller</em> seems to be an album primarily intended for vinyl and its enthusiasts; any other medium remains an afterthought.</p><p>
    
    The music that goes on vinyl also comes from vinyl: <em>Propeller</em> sounds like a sonic collage gathered from what would seem like an exhaustive collection of 70s rock LPs-- Cheap Trick, Kiss, Led Zeppelin, Todd Rundgren, John Lennon, maybe even some Wings. On <em>Propeller</em> these period-rock influences are closer to the surface than on subsequent GbV albums. It's Pollard's first big rock statement, from the crowd chants that open side one to the anthemic guitar chords that end side two. As such, it's a little rough here and there, its slight imperfections alternately amplified and pardoned by its lo-fi sound, but ultimately it remains insistent and compelling. <i>Bee Thousand is written about more often and exalted more devotedly (and rightly so), but <em>Propeller</em> proves just as essential to the Guided by Voices mythos. More than that, it's just a solid rock album, one that gives you all the tools you need to understand and appreciate it. Enjoying it should be easy.</i></p><p>
    
    ""G! B! V! G! B! V!"" the crowd chants at the beginning of ""Over the Neptune"", and presumably it's Pollard who yells, ""Are you ready to rock?"" That's a bold, somewhat self-deprecating kick-off for a band whose audience at the time barely extended beyond Ohio and who were pressing only 500 copies of what they wanted to be their breakthrough album. But that introduction not only predicts the obsessive cult that would gradually surround Pollard, but it also prefaces a medley (""Over the Neptune"" bleeds neatly and dramatically into ""Mesh Gear Fox"") that contains the whole of Pollard's large and complex philosophy about rock and roll and about the inspiration he derives from a live crowd (""It's the way you look it's the way you act when you're near me,"" he sings at the song's climactic push). Those chanting voices are the ones that guide him, and here they usher you into Pollard's world, where you learn to decipher his coded lyrics and speak his rock language.</p><p>
<em>Propeller</em> achieves what Pollard calls on ""Weedking"" a ""violent pace."" That song picks up where ""Over the Neptune/Mesh Gear Fox"" leaves off-- in full rock anthem mode. It begins with the rallying cry, ""Long live Rockathon"", which is both a shout-out to the band's fledgling minilabel and a concise summation of a credo for long, beery live shows. With its affectionately re-created Beatles harmonies, the chorus of ""Quality of Armor"" reappears precipitously throughout the song, slyly inverting the come-on of ""Drive My Car"". ""Metal Mothers"" bleeds pop melancholia, and the popping guitar melody of ""Unleashed! The Largehearted Boy"" creates a bouncy momentum that carries into ""Exit Flagger"", with its unannounced and powerful racing=death metaphor.</p><p>
    
    After the perfect adolescent wistfulness of ""14 Cheerleader Coldfront"", <em>Propeller</em> trails off as it makes its way to the finish line. Still, after the odd collage ""Ergo Space Pig"", ""Circus World"" and ""Some Drilling Implied"" give the band a chance to run through more guitar solos, breakdowns, rock dramatics that you'd think lo-fi was capable of sustaining. But the sound preempts any chance of irony-- all those rock anthems, monumental choruses, and microphone windmills are completely from the boy's large heart. That's the key to the band's appeal, the factor often missed or simply left unstated: Pollard believes in rock and roll, and <em>Propeller</em> is his sacrifice on the altar. And that lo-fi sound is essential: it preserved the illusion of connection between performer and listener, hinting at an intimacy that Pollard knows doesn't exist, but damned if he isn't going to try.</p></div>"|3602.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3602-propeller/|9.2|Stephen M.

    by listing stuff they never played on it:
    Slint, Sentridoh, Zappa, Beefheart, Can, The Residents, VU. See any metal in that list?  Neither do I.  Was Rob Crow managing to hear some metal anyhow?  You bet your ass. Is Goblin Cock as ""joke-metal"" as it sounds like it should be? Just about. Its chugging, Tolkien-core centerpiece is an ode to ""Kegrah the Dragon Killer"". Plus the liner notes include lyrics written in runes.</p><p>
    
    Goblin Cock never quite goes Spinal Tap, though; this is by no means your
    simple ""Metal is pretty funny"" put-down record. There was always a seriousness of chops and a whiff of that gloriously bloated prog- and/or death-metal surrounding 90s-Crow projects Heavy Vegetable and Thingy, and
    <em>Bagged and Boarded</em> is the noxious encroaching cloud that whiff's blossomed

""Gee, our bodies are complicated, aren't they Dad?"" It's hard not to laugh and
    cringe simultaneously.</p><p>
    
    Great Uncle GWAR would be so proud. Lord Phallus, Bane Ass-Pounder, King
    Sith, Braindeath, and keyboardist Loki Sinjuggler drop that imaginary line
    between humor and horror down front and center, forcing listeners to
    straddle it with them. On ""Revenge of Snufalufagus"", ""Sesame Street'""s gentle Snufalufagus directs
    his murderous, vengeful bloodlust toward Mr. Hooper and/or Big Bird. ""The Werewomb""-- Cannibal Corpse outtake though that may sound-- is about the
    closest the record comes to unearthing a nugget of vintage mid-90s Crow.
    ""Winkey Dinky Donkey"" (not a Raffi cover, amazingly) might hold that same
    distinction but for its opening minute of double-tracked vocals and riffs
    that, melodically, live right next door to Metallica's <em>...And Justice For
    All</em>.</p><p>
    
    What I can't do is honestly recommend any of this to your strict Pinbackers
    or serious metalheads in want of some inroad into either indie or Rob Crow's byzantine bandscape. The
    somewhat brittle production, dearth of any blast beat/guitar screed
    overkill, and lax musicianship will offend a good deal of those hardened
    listener's ears even if Goblin Cock's upfront skewering of metal's silliest
    conventions fails to. As comic book collectors will recognize the moment
    they read the album title, a sense of humor going in is utterly, 100%
    required.</p><p>
    
    One glance at the cover sears this image into your retina:
    Goblin Cock as iconic heavy metal D&amp;D; bad guy's purply veined phallus. The
    band's name is also a sly pun on the performance of enthusiastic fellatio.
    Still, it's just as funny to picture
    Goblin Cock as the biggest, meanest, ugliest armored black rooster in the
    history of Things Frank Frazetta Never Got Around to Painting, and a
    leather-clad Rob Crow strumming
    distorted power chords to the rhythmic fall of his steed's ghastly red
    talons.</p></div>"|3687.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3687-bagged-and-boarded/|7.3|Judson Picco

That's like putting ringers on your company softball team-- you're just admitting that no one in your office can connect bat with ball. But I doubt the compilers were thinking that way when they put together this 42-song tracklist; on the contrary, their aim is to show how the Bloodshot aesthetic has spread beyond the label's modest stable of artists into the wider indie realm.</p><p>
    
    However, <em>For a Decade of Sin</em> works on a much smaller scale; it's not so concerned with the larger state of the field as much as the confines of alt-country, a genre it didn't create but helped rear. This compilation doesn't present a unified Bloodshot aesthetic because there is no such thing: the songs show just how wide ranging alt-country can be, and the artists sound very different, despite grazing the same pastureland between country and rock, punk and a little bluegrass. So many cattle, so many different brands.</p><p>
    
    Some of these artists take a direct route and solder country sounds onto rock momentum. The results can be amazing-- or not. Bobby Bare Jr.'s ""Ocean Size"" gets by on the singer's unpretentious charm and vast longing, and Catfish Haven's catchy ""Tell Me"" heralds their Secretly Canadian debut next year, but the Deadstring Bothers' ""Where Are All My Friends?"" is weepy and self-absorbed and ""Harridan of Yore"" by Graham Parker &amp; the Figgs just sounds like lo-cal Dylan. Other artists take a different tack and pick up where country tradition left off, reviving it faithfully or with an ear for how it never was. While dramatically different, Sally Timms' dusky version of ""Tumbling Tumbleweeds"" and Wayne Hancock and Hank Williams III's tear through ""Juke Joint Jumping"" sound like they could have been recorded in any of the previous four decades. Unfortunately, artists like Scott H. Biram, 16 Horsepower, and Nine Pound Hammer take one or two aspects from whichever tradition and exaggerate them to cartoonish extremes, but these eminently skippable tracks are partially redeemed by Mary Lou Lord, Cordero, the Court and Spark, Crooked Fingers, and Richard Buckner, whose sound is so natural and unfussy as to have very little obvious regard for any particular strain of influence.</p><p>
    
    Covers abound on <em>For a Decade of Sin</em>, showing a range of influences both old and new. Dollar Store turn in a limp retread of the Soft Boys' ""I Wanna Destroy You"" and Porter Hall TN do Jim Carroll's ""People Who Died"" note for obvious note. But My Morning Jacket's version of ""Behind That Locked Door"" possesses a sad gracefulness, and the Sadies help Andre Williams recover his classic ""Shake a Tail Feather"". The collection's best track-- cover or otherwise-- is courtesy of Milton Mapes, who finds a gem in the Cowboy Junkies lament ""Now I Know"". </p><p>
    
    All this variety suggests that Bloodshot is doing something right. It has made a name for itself in a niche market while at the same time proving that niche isn't so small. But what makes for a successful label doesn't always produce a good compilation. <i>For a Decade of Sin is full of ups and downs and even a few sideways, and so lacks transitions and fluid sequencing. You'll probably listen to the whole thing all the way through only once or twice; after that, you'll most likely burn your favorite 10 to your iPod-- 15 if you're a real fan. Only about half of those songs will be Bloodshot recording artists.</i></p></div>"|2102.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2102-for-a-decade-of-sin-11-years-of-bloodshot-records/|6.0|Stephen M.

    blue</a>-- 21 for the vinyl. Such is the bitch of imports, but shit, such is
    the lure isn't it-- why more American indie labels don't ghostprint from
    Europe shocks me. All's to say, Output keeping itself overseas might have
    been the best thing to happen to Colder aka Marc Nguyen Tan. Now, and for
    his sake hopefully forever, this gentleman weaver has import sticker
    authority, peddling flimsy replicas of rock history to the American lookyloo
    demographic who faithfully support the New and Obscure but still haven't
    heard a fucking note of Joy Division or Suicide. It's a killer business
    model: Two years ago this Colder guy came over here for CMJ and played at
    the Canal Room, stuck behind a smoke machine, chumming one chord and
    whispering ""it's getting...COLLLL-DERRRR"" for like, 10 minutes
    straight-- and people clapped! Time to get this guy a rap deal and watch the
    ""French Mike Jones"" flow like whatnots.</p><p>
    
    Listen, I have a big heart for clumsy stuff, the fake stuff even more. In
    some probably incriminating way, I like a good deal of the fake stuff-- e.g. the beat and a-go-go frequencies from South-East
    Asia, <em>Radio Pyongyang</em>, assorted gimmicks-- more
    than the real stuff, precisely because the language
    barrier and tooth'n'nails recording and palpably high stakes make otherwise
    straight Beatles rips pretty damn unsettling, and I value that. Maybe, maybe
    some of Colder's stuff could hit me that way, Paris on Curtis, what have
    you. But sorry, ""Oh yeah tonight oh yeah that's right to-night""-- the song's
    called ""Tonight""-- ain't clumsy, or fake, just bad.</p><p>
    
    So beyond Colder's better-formed lyrics, which somehow make them worse
    lyrics, what's changed from his debut <i>Again</i>? To his credit, now he
    has a few songs that DJs can play, like ""Wrong Baby"", a midtempo sway that
    fits nicely between Kraftwerk's ""Numbers"" and ""Bizarre Love Triangle.""
    Colder's got better guitar sounds too, and on ""Losing Myself"" they shimmy
    enough that maybe MTV will find room for a clip in whatever Road Rules
    segment it is where people come back from a dive bar or fight snakes in the
    desert or something. The album's last three tracks go back to mine, loungey
    numbers to cool down <i>Heat</i>'s (wait for it) burners; had Colder picked
    one instead of three (my vote is for the painfully alone casiotones of ""Fade
    Away""), he might have been onto something.</p><p>
    
    But vanitas motherfucking vanitatum, compare any of Colder's one-pace,
    quiet-loud, fizzy-ending jams to a Soulwax nite version-- there's nothing
    beyond the signifiers. Again though, that's the triumph of this whole
    operation. ""To the Music"", ostensibly Colder's coolest track, has all the
    things kids want right now-- guitars, ""80s synth,"" stiff beat-- but proceeds
    like a knock-off vitton vendor, as if it's getting away with something.
    Maybe because it is.</p></div>"|1739.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1739-heat/|5.1|Nick Sylvester

The band's second live release, <em>Scab Dates</em> is culled from performances between 2003 and 2005, in which the group streches already epic-length songs like ""Take the Veil Cerpin Taxt"" and ""Cicatriz ESP"" into extended jams that, like many of the pieces on last year's <i>Frances the Mute</i>, have to be segmented across different tracks (""Cicatriz"" alone is in five parts totalling almost 40 minutes). Needless to say, the album is unlikely to win over anyone who bristled at the extended solos and song suites of <em>Frances the Mute</em>-- and yet, not one song from that album appears here; the bulk material is culled from the band's 2003 full-length <em>De-Loused in the Comatorium</em>.</p><p>
    
    ""Veil Cerpin Taxt"" and ""Cicatriz"" comprise most of <i>Scab Dates</i>; what looks like 12 tracks is little more like three. Excepting the track taken from the <em>Tremulant</em> EP (""Concertina""), the record offers ""Abrasions Mount the Timpani"", an introductory sound collage played over an intercom while a few notes of guitar tantalize the audience, and ""Cavigula"" and ""Haruspex"", both mostly wordless jams that serve as tension builders and palette cleansers. Yes, Mars Volta show more than a fair share of instrumental prowess and flash, with licks that would make aspiring metal musos look up from their fretboards and nod in thoughtful approval; but like me, that person probably wants a little more from a live album than back-to-the-audience noodling from a rock band with modest improvisational skills.</p><p>
    
    ""Take the Veil Cerpin Taxt"" opens with a rhythm section adding urgency to the band's complex riffage. Divisions between the segments seem arbitrary, with a space-exploring instrumental break and a show-stopping unaccompanied guitar riff appearing before Part A even kicks in. While the band maintains the energy through the three different sections of the jagged ""Cerpin Taxt"", it eventually dips into ambient textures and dull instrumental passages during the marathon version of ""Cicatriz"" that closes the album. The first section-- eight minutes of organ solos and wah-pedal guitar-- would be over-doing it as it is. Throw in a slower, psychedelic interlude for Part I, reverberating vocal nonsense and muffled blues soloing for Part II, a part III that sounds a whole lot like Part I, and a slow moody 20-minute jam that crawls, and you have a new level of pushing the rock form past all levels of patience. Save a tossed-off Bowie reference in the mire of part III, there's nothing engaging or revealing added to these tracks. They're just a whole lot longer.</p><p>
    
    To beat a dead horse, these songs don't need to be streched to be understood-- what remains desperately missing from the Mars Volta is context for their musings. Burrowing into these impenetrable instrumentals and decoding lyrics could be half the fun, but what's the point of ending the record on another sound collage that merges the final (20-minute) moody jam on <em>Scab Dates</em> with what sounds like backstage patter? That's an artful allusion to what-- an encore break? Given which songs are chosen and when this is being released, <em>Scab Dates</em> is a neither a concession nor a step forward, revealing inclinations that feel half as indulgent as they should when following a record like <em>Frances the Mute</em>, and about half as interesting to listen to. For this album to follow <em>De-Loused in the Comatorium</em> would at least have made some sense; now it's just more of the same. </p></div>"|5119.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5119-scab-dates/|3.5|Jason Crock

Opener ""Down River"" sounds different from the off, with pronounced drums and an ominous low-end, a minimal, slowly unfolding riff, and few words getting in the way of its distorted climax.</p><p>
    
    ""Velvet Cell"" is the biggest digression, a sleek Interpol clone with quick, clean downstrokes, Talbot's voice clear and plaintive while introducing the album's macabre preoccupations: ""To understand a killer/ I must become a killer/ Now I've tasted hatred, I want more."" ""Animals"" holds back musically but keeps the dark streak lyrically, a quiet strum of clean guitars, hushed cymbal crashes, and pale organ, not to mention a killer opening line: ""They descend upon the city like flies/ Spring their eggs into a dead dog's eyes/ It's England on a Saturday night."" Suicidal laments and a blues guitar solo follow.</p><p>
    
    Eventually Gravehurst return to their comfort zone, offering the heart-stopping acoustic waltz ""Nicole"" and ""Cities Beneath the Sea"", a gothic-tinged sea-shanty with an oddly cheerful bass part and droning church organs. ""Songs From Under the Arches"" further explores the band's post-rock influence over 10 minutes of protracted morbidness, and the record closes with a cover of the Kinks' ""See My Friends"", which is given leaden underwater atmosphere that devolves into a loose jam session. </p><p>
    
    Talbot's voice keeps me back from total immersion in the album's dark source material. Sure, low-key villains can be plenty creepy, and there's something to be said for juxtaposition, but not a shred of angst or aggression ever enters Talbot's voice. It all just seems so pleasant. <i>Fires in Distant Buildings</i> bears the calling cards of previous Gravenhurst albums-- the chilly atmosphere, the detached vocals, the attention to detail both instrumentally and lyrically-- but there's much emphasis given to new sounds that are well-executed but clearly indebted to other artists, and the murder ballads feel forced with Tobias' squeaky-clean delivery. The expansion of their sound is refreshing, and the subject matter lends the record a dark singularity, but <i>Fires in Distant Buildings</i> feels more like a transitional album than anything else.</p></div>"|3642.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3642-fires-in-distant-buildings/|7.1|Jason Crock

This was right before the 2001 release of <em>Satellite Rides</em>, and the band seemed happy to be performing new material like ""Rollerskate Skinny"" and ""Book of Poems"". Plus, they were playing a run of hometown shows after a long absence, so the crowd was excited to have their local heroes back for a few nights. Packed into the Tea Room shoulder to shoulder, fans sang along with every word of ""Busted Afternoon"" and ""Big Brown Eyes"", and at least attempted singing along to ""Doreen"". They fed off the band's excitement, and in turn the Old 97s fed off the crowd's rambunctious energy. Ken Bethea deployed his perfectly compact solos, Rhett Miller did some of those mini-Pete Townsend windmills on his guitar, and Murry Hammond stepped up for awkwardly graceful versions of ""West Texas Teardrops"" and ""Valentine"".</p><p>
    
    That show completely erased the distinction between the Old 97s' early alt-country material and their later power-pop songs-- a distinction that's been particularly divisive among fans and critics and that once seemed impossible to resolve. No longer: <em>Alive &amp; Wired</em>, the band's first live release, duplicates this feat, finding a Texarkana middle ground between the two genres. Granted, there have always been traces of pop in the nerd-country of their first three albums, just as there has always been a little lingering country on <em>Fight Songs</em> and <em>Satellite Rides</em>. But if these two sides of the band once seemed fairly neatly divided on studio albums, the live setting helps Old 97s collapse them completely.</p><p>
    
    Recorded at Gruene's just outside of New Braunfels, Texas, <em>Alive &amp; Wired</em> collects songs from each of their six albums, along with B-sides ""The Villain"" and Hammond's cover of Merle Haggard's ""Mama Tried"". The band's energy ebbs on slower songs like ""Lonely Holiday"", but crests on faster numbers like ""Melt Show"" and singalongs like ""Rollerskate Skinny"". By culling from early releases and rescuing tracks from last year's tepid <em>Drag It Up</em>, the band showcases a surprisingly deep and ridiculously rich canon of loser anthems (""Wish the Worst""), dark ballads (""Salome""), odes to romantic doubt and suspicion (""The Other Shoe""), cowboy calls (""West Texas Teardrops""), and frenzied barnstormers (""Doreen"")-- all written and played with generous humor and genuine exhilaration.</p><p>
    
    Granted, <em>Alive &amp; Wired</em> can't live up to the Old 97s' Tea Room show, in the same way that no live album can match the experience of actually being there. The record lacks the sensory elements that make such performances so memorable-- the glare of the neon signs on the wall; the smell of body odor and beer; the rough, rhythmic jostle of the packed crowd; the acrid taste of cigarette smoke. These sensations inform and infuse the band's songs-- not just the romantic desperation and confliction of Miller's lyrics, but the snap of the music-- to such a degree that an Old 97s live album seems incomplete without them. </p></div>"|5967.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5967-alive-wired/|7.0|Stephen M.

Still, it's just as easy to under-credit them-- they're no Coppolas (bosom buddies, though), but dismissing them as lucked-out industry offspring's a piece of cake, too: Bassist Charlotte Froom is daughter of producer Mitchell Froom; drummer Tennessee Thomas is daughter of Pete Thomas (drummer for Elvis Costello); vocalist/guitarist Z Berg is daughter of Geffen hotshot/producer Tony Berg. They're living teen-girl pipe dreams, straight-out-of-another-teen-movie plots: the Crossroads classmates started up in 2001 at the ages of fifteen and sixteen-- Charlotte had been playing bass for two weeks-- are buddies with uber-pretty boys Maroon 5, Rooney, and Phantom Planet, and have really great legs.</p><p>
    
    Jump to whatever conclusions, but thank God, anyway, they're not a shemo band playing bitter-bitch rock; if we're to die at the hands of the Like, it'd be something like death by mosquito net-- <em>Are You Thinking What I'm Thinking?</em> is a bundled-up, gauzy deathtrap of the prettiest of bug-deterrents. The hiccupped sweetness and light of Berg's pipes draws apt comparisons to the Sundays' Harriet Wheeler; her lower-ranges drop into sexed-up, Bjork-like bottom-scraping; it's all terribly charming.</p><p>
    
    Too bad lyrics are straight from soporific bio class margin-notes-- initials in hearts, Mr. So-and-So, Mrs. Actually. ""June Gloom"" could be as glumly endearing as any Throwing Muses tune, if it weren't for its cited sunsets and hazy grey skies, trite as the stuff of Freddie Prinze films (""Wish that I could save you/ Wish that I could stop this""). The Like never turn saccharine, but seldom delve much deeper than recess romances: ""Bridge to Nowhere"" and ""You Bring Me Down"" are the dreamiest of gripes-- ""I can't be who you wanted me to be""; ""Once Things Look Up"" is typical Like-- just courting ideal, stopping just short-- and catchier tracks sometimes teeter close to excellent: See ""Falling Away"", poised to morph into Republica's ""Ready to Go"", like some woozy tilt-a-whirl that won't make you hurl chunks. ""Waves that never break"" sums it up best-- Berg sings, ""Break me or something/ 'Cause I'm fading away/ Am I waiting for nothing?"", all the while we're waiting for some killer hook that never comes. (""What I Say And What I Mean"", the closest the Like ever get to a memorable pop single, sounds perilously akin to Ashlee Simpson's ""Boyfriend"".) </p><p>
    
    But maybe <em>Are You Thinking What I'm Thinking? is all it professes to be: misunderstanding, indecision, ambiguity. Here's miscommunication, talking past, boys not getting the difference between what girls say and what they mean; here's oft-thought sentiments like the ones on ""Under the Paving Stones"": ""Hey haven't you heard you have the right to make a move?"" The Like would do best to heed their own advice-- take a few risks of their own.</em></p></div>"|4993.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4993-are-you-thinking-what-im-thinking/|6.8|Rachel Khong

Dig Test Icicles: The UK trio is hard, fast, and viciously catchy, but above all scary. Guitars don't chug and wail; they whinny and scream. Carnival organ gallops ghoulish frequencies on ""Pull the Lever"". ""Catch It"" is just a scrambled nightmare with a psychosexual thrust. Yup, it's about the most chilling thing going next to Skateboard P's verses.</p><p>
    But the band puts some jaunt to its haunt, namely in frontman Sam Merrann's vocals, which are dynamic but uniformly hair-raising. For those who think acid-throated vox are the province solely of American bands like Blood Brothers, here's a Brit who would give any stateside howler a run for his money in a Drano-drinking contest. The vocal venom sits well on opener ""Your Biggest Mistake"", whose distortion-eaten guitars call, respond, and scorch the earth. Elsewhere, the singer proves versatile, carrying subcutaneous melodies and bratting-up his quieter spit.</p><p>
    When the band's slash-and-burn post-hardcore finally yields beautiful hooks, the screams can be corrosive. Merrann serves up Carengie Deli portions-- ample multi-tracking and agile trade-offs ensure no measure goes unaccompanied by voice, no lyric unechoed by a scream, and no guitar kick unaccented. But havoc and harmony learn to coexist, most harmoniously on ""Circle Square Triangle"", whose guitars punch thick upbeats despite an ungainly note count. ""Pull the Lever"" takes a rare indrawn breath, then spits the album's silkiest (and sickest) chorus.</p><p>
    So obviously the boys have tools like a baby LeBron. But are their acrobatics more catchy than contrived? The lead singer's fucking nicknamed ""Dangerr,"" and the band name is one of the worst this side of Panic! at the Disco. Next you're gonna tell me Test Icicles play lipstick pink guitars and claim 15,000 Myspace friends. Without the übertight chops and huge choruses on 24-hour call, those facts might matter. Instead they're harmless gimmicks, more easily ignored than derided.</p><p>
    For development's sake, the band ought to call Frenchkiss, which has this kind of slanted and chanted dance-punk all but vertically integrated. Screening Purposes would benefit from more voluminous production, especially on a song like ""Your Biggest Mistake"", which packs several fast-moving parts into a shallow sonic field. The effect is disorienting, like trying to focus on a single buzz in a bee-box.</p><p>
    The more linear numbers have a better sense of equilibrium, but the straightest-- ""Catch It,"" which cuts a robotic beeline, and ""Maintain the Focus""-- are the least musically compelling. After a torrid opening sweep, the record starts to unravel, connecting its component dots rather than synthesizing them. Fifty minutes-- with only a gauzy organ-droning interlude for a bathroom break-- is a cross-country haul with a record that's all forte, all the time. But the hooks stick long after windedness wears off.</p><p>
    Though the single's called ""Boa vs. Python"", Test Icicles are all cobra. Quick-tempered and ready to pounce at the drop of a double-time bridge, the band splits the difference between cockney, cocked neck, and <em>coq au vin</em>. The total package suggests a less test-icicular, dancefloor sympathetic Glassjaw-- which means show-goers would do well to train hard and eat a big pasta dinner before hitting the parquet. But asking the band to slow down would be like ticketing Tony Stewart.</p></div>"|8304.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8304-for-screening-purposes-only/|8.1|Sam Ubl

    Official DJ Mix for Indie Kids-- aka the Erlend Øye
    Award-- the frontrunners have already been set. In the first gate, the pop diva of choice for American hipsters, spinning a mix of Norwegian
    compatriots and remixed indie superstars, it's Annie! 
    (5:3) Running in the adjacent lane, sometimes beatmaker for 2005's other underground
    diva M.I.A., he's already been on the indie-mix radar
    with his Hollertronix and Favela sets, the man who
    wears winter coats even in sweat-hot clubs: Diplo!
    (7:2)</p><p>
    But is there a dark horse in the running? One glance
    at the tracklist stats for down-under label Modular's
    <i>Leave Them All Behind, and you've got to be thinking
    upset: Death From Above 1979, Cut Copy, the Fiery
    Furnaces, Bloc Party, even crossover du jour the
    Killers. All bands on the precipice of being solid
    indie-friendly dance music, just looking for the right
    remixer or laptop jockey to gently coax out their
    inner discotheque. Given the proper presentation,
    it's a lineup that could easily become this season's
    go-to cheat sheet for indie-dance night DJs.</i></p><p>
    Of course, this is because all the bands listed above
    are first-and-foremost rock bands, as is pretty much
    everyone in attendance on <em>Leave Them All Behind</em>. Rock
    bands taking enthusiastic part in the current boom
    industry of new-wave revival, sure, and rock bands
    given club-ready makeovers by electronic sympathizers
    like Mylo and Phones, check. But the mix's crossover
    potential is based on the prevalence of guitars and
    drums throughout, gently holding the rock kids' hands
    and showing them the disco lights.</p><p>
    Most of the remixes included are pretty stellar, with
    the producers (Freddie Prinze Jr.) drawing out the
    hidden, all-that rhythmic beauty of wallflowers
    (Rachel Leigh Cook), like tracks from the Rakes and the
    Kills. Cut Copy and Phones, each of whom revise two
    tracks here, both have the uncanny Midas-like ability
    to make everything they touch sound like Duran Duran,
    a worthy demonstration for any and all re-enactors of
    the early 80s. The effect is powerful enough to help Midnight Jugganauts overcome their
    disastrous band name on Cut Copy's retooling of ""45 &amp;
    Rising"", good enough to bring Bloc Party's ""Banquet""
    to the kind of limbs-akimbo fervor their album only
    fleetingly reached.</p><p>
    However, a mix is more than just the sum of its
    component parts, and, surprisingly for the label that
    first brought us the Avalanches, this facet is where
    Modular falls behind its competition. With its
    extremely uniform tracklisting (""we have both kinds of music:
    disco-punk and dance-punk!"") the opportunity is there
    for some AP collaging, but transitions throughout the
    mix are largely of the fade-in/fade-out variety. 
    Songs start to bleed together more convincingly by the
    mix's latter half when housier Mylo and Jagz Kooner
    remixes pop up, but intriguing-on-paper transitions
    like the Fiery Furnaces' ""Single Again"" into Tom Vek
    sound disappointingly like nothing a plug-in couldn't
    handle.</p><p>
    Especially galling is the presence of the Killers'
    ""Mr. Brightside"", not out of some ""what is this
    mainstream bullshit doing here?!?"" kneejerk tantrum, but because it's
    not <em>moree</em> integrated into the mix. Surely the
    track could've been put to better use than sitting
    isolated at the end of the album, looking suspiciously
    like mere shrinkwrap sticker bait; as the best
    top 40 single to come out of the new new wave thus far-- and with a quite good Jacques Lu Cont remix that could have been included-- it deserves better.</p><p>
    Underdogs know they can't pull off the big upset by
    playing it safe, and the Killers' quarantine is just
    the kind of move that dooms <i>Leave Them All Behind to
    the second division. In the final tally, Diplo and
    Annie's mixes sport too much more diversity in their
    selections and much more creativity in presentation, whereas the narrow focus of a
    genre snapshot like <em>Leave Them All Behind</em> almost
    necessarily handcuffs the final product. So, sorry
    Modular, no Øye Award for you this year, but take
    heart: It's an honor just to be nominated.</i></p></div>"|2101.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2101-leave-them-all-behind/|7.2|Rob Mitchum

There is something about the
    gene pool of New Zealand's southern island that predisposes bands to
    longevity and likability. You look at pictures of bands like the Clean and
    the Chills and the Bats and the Verlaines taken throughout their
    intermittent multi-decade careers together and it's just evident that these
    are nice, honest people who love making music and would like for you to
    please listen to it if you have a sec. Thankfully, they've always made that
    easy as well.</p><p>
<em>At the National Grid</em>, the Bats' sixth full-length in 23 years and first
    since 1995, is immediately
    inviting, opening with some barely comprehensible studio banter and slipping
    into the floating, percussion-less twee pop of ""Western Isles"" almost by
    accident. Robert Scott's guy-next-door vocals invite you in while
    bassist/guitarist Kaye Woodward sings little ""doot-doo"" backing vocals and
    Paul Kean's bass comes in to give the song a rhythmic nudge quite casually,
    as though it just stopped by for tea and decided to stay for a few songs.
    The album slips into its groove on ""Horizon"", a bouncy slice of jangling
    indie pop with some nice, subtly tricky stickwork by drummer Malcolm Grant.</p><p>
    
    From there the album endears through a mixture of acoustic/electric jangle
    and friendly jamming, the latter of which contributes the album's only real
    low points. The band's almost off-handed interplay is one of their major
    strong points, but fuzzy instrumentals like ""Hubert"" are just a bit too
    stretched-out and meandering to complement their more tightly composed
    brethren. It's a small concern given how many songs go in the complete
    opposite direction. ""Things"" rides a surging rhythm section, nudging Scott's
    melancholy vocal forcefully into your memory banks, while ""Single File"" is
    the Bats at their most psychedelic, with garage organ piping tinnily in
    behind the bubbling guitars and harmonies.</p><p>
    
    In the 10 years since we last heard them on <em>Couchmaster</em>, the Bats have kept
    themselves busy, with Scott keeping the highest profile in a couple of
    fruitful reunions of the Clean, but they don't really skip a beat on <em>At the
    National Grid</em>. If anything, the album has more in common with their
    ultra-loose early albums, unafraid to slip into a noisy rave-up as they do
    at the end of ""Flowers &amp; Trees"" or just explore a jam for a few minutes. The
    approach doesn't make for a perfect album, but it's a lovely one
    nonetheless.</p></div>"|1180.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1180-at-the-national-grid/|7.6|Joe Tangari

While the onset of such an affliction would likely have most guitarists-- of any age-- thinking about retiring to other pursuits, for Bailey it has simply presented another new opportunity to continue his lifelong exploration through the possible vocabularies of his instrument. Following his diagnosis, Bailey chose to forgo invasive surgery and instead, in attempt to ""find a way around it,"" began the slow process of teaching himself to play using his right thumb and fingers instead of a pick.</p><p>
    
    And so it is that <em>Carpal Tunnel</em>, Bailey's first solo record since 2003's <em>Ballads</em>, comes to closely resemble a patient's journal, monitoring the progress of his self-prescribed therapy. The album contains six brief improvisations that were each recorded three weeks apart, giving the listener an unvarnished aural timeline of Bailey's development as he painstakingly masters his new technique. Understandably, this all makes for an occasionally hesitant and rather scrappy affair, but one that should prove to be a rewarding document for established fans (and, I guess, for physical therapists with an academic interest in hand injuries).</p><p>
    
    The album commences with ""Explanation and Thanks"", something of an audio letter addressed to an unidentified ""Carol"", on which Bailey wryly explains the project and issues a preemptive apology for his ""desultory and inaccurate"" playing. Of course, given Bailey's legendarily idiosyncratic playing style, very few listeners will be able to detect exactly which of his eccentric notes the guitarist considers to be inaccuracies. Throughout his career Bailey has exhibited a unique ability to simultaneously treat the guitar as both a familiar and an alien object. And with its tracks liberally seeded with his characteristic atonal, non-idiomatic digressions, pick or no pick Carpal Tunnel proves him to be incapable of sounding like anybody but Derek Bailey.</p><p>
    
    On this opening track, as well as the following ""After 3 Weeks"", Bailey's playing is slow and methodical, stroking out one note at a time like he's dropping pebbles into a jar. Each of these early tracks opens with a similar Eastern-tinged figure, with his crisp, dry tones sounding very close to the twang of a banjo or even a Japanese koto. As the weeks advance, he becomes audibly more assured in his technique, and by ""After 9 Weeks"" has begun to incorporate more electricity into his playing, using his familiar volume pedal to variously dissolve and sustain his carefully-chosen notes, and allowing ""After 12 Weeks"" to close the album out on a satisfied wave of feedback.</p><p> 
    
    Over the years, Bailey has famously professed an aversion to recordings of improvisational music, which seems somewhat ironic considering the dozens and dozens of available titles in his back catalog. And though <em>Carpal Tunnel</em> can hardly be considered the most essential item in this vast discography, it might well prove to be his most revealing work, as it seems the purest distillation yet of his musical personality: ornery, inventive, comic, and above all, persistent as the tides.</p></div>"|532.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/532-carpal-tunnel/|7.0|Matthew Murphy

    Later</em> is unsurprisingly unsurprising. Like a teetotaler's Pete
    Yorn, Pond and his PAs here dour up the mid-Atlantic with the type
    of mature, restrained, polished yup-pop
    that ultimately made <em>Tracks</em> make tracks. Sure, MPPA's latest
    may <em>seem</em> like something a newly savvy freshperson might gladly
    play in Dad's Lexus RX that first Thanksgiving home, but somewhere beneath their grown-up
    cellos, glistening vibes, and tenderly yearning vocals, surely there
    lurks a drooling gonzo freak who isn't playing with a full quiver.
    Please?</p><p>
    
    If Pond has a dark side, the first clue would be his 2003 move from
    Philadelphia, cradle of liberty and Cheez Whiz, to Brooklyn, home of
    feculence and chicanery and irony's much-feted fetid corpse. But
    ostensibly NYC-inspired fare like ""City Song"" and ""Brooklyn Stars""
    proves devoid of all gothic Gotham horror: The former is a
    strums-and-strings soft-rock ballad; the latter a mellow midtempo
    plodder with a <em>White Ladder</em> electronic intro. Then again,
    perhaps Pond's vocals employ some sort of sinister code: ""In complete
    dark-NESS/ I lose ba-LANCE,"" he somehow rhymes, shortly thereafter
    referring to ""mor-NING."" And just try playing it backwards!</p><p>
    
    ""Heard it's modern to be stupid,"" Pond intones on opener ""Halloween"".
    Modernly, on the subsequent ""So Much Trouble"", he adds, ""I don't think
    I wanna think about it."" All the while, his eminently competent band's
    glossy four-four thrum could just as easily back the newest from Josh
    Rouse or Joe Pernice. ""Concepts are embarrassing,"" Pond intones with
    pinched throat over staccato guitars. But whoa-oh-oh, sleepy ""Is It
    Safe"" dips a toe into the topic of, could it be, sex: ""We'd slip
    behind the pool and go with nature/ We'd lie beside the chlorine
    bottles."" Um, OK?</p><p>
    
    So maybe Pond really is just another ordinary-guy exemplar
    of the ongoing post-Coldplay adult contemporarization of indie, as his
    ordinary arrangements and ordinarier songs would attest. The
    catchiest among them is the wistful title track, on which Pond
    tells himself, ""I told myself not to remind me."" While ""Emblems""
    scores classic rock points for possessing the title of the previous
    album, all you really need to know about <em>Several Arrows Later</em>
    is finale ""Devil in the Water"". Yup, this is the type of disc that
    would close with a hushed duet and ponderous ""it's over"" refrain.
    Creepy.</p></div>"|5156.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5156-several-arrows-later/|4.0|Marc Hogan

How these men and women are siphoned of their meaningful juice after
    the age of 32 is a mystery. I have no answers for this. Rock and r&amp;b; stars make
    comebacks all the time, proving force into their thirties, forties,
    beyond, and debunking over-the-hill-isms. Rap,
    eh, not so much on the revitalization tip. Rakim, LL Cool J, Marley Marl,
    Kool G Rap, et al-- titans the lot of them-- seem
    incapable of conjuring the fire they had in their youth. It's baffling. Public Enemy, a group so long on
    importance they have actually become hyperbole ipso facto, have struggled for
    more than 15 years to make anything as resounding as their first three albums.</p><p>
    
    Their newest record-- with the stupendously stupid title <em>New Whirl Odor</em>-- opens
    with the same sort of blustery black-conscience quote that marked previous
    albums. Instead of Dr. King or Bobby Seale, they have employed the booming
    bridle of Rev. Al Sharpton-- a telling move clearly bound to questions of
    relevance. Quickly, a familiar voice, the at-attention roar of Chuck
    Ridenhour booms. ""I smell a new whirl odor! I smell a new whirl odor."" As a
    punny Maytag commercial, this is genius. As rapt political commentary it's
    lacking depth. PE is a group the world direly needs right now. Not simply
    as culture police or Karl Rove rovers-- and not to combat bling technocracy -- but to enliven dialogue, keep it in check maybe, but mostly
    to play social ping-pong. Paul Wall and PE should have fun together.
    Sniping is for suckers. Throughout the album, Chuck D often goes all Bill
    Cosby on us: Over the cheap Casio production of ""Makes You Blind"" he raps:
    ""Radiation of a radio TV movie nation/ On yo Goddamn mind, makes you
    blind!/ You don't matter, and they don't mind/ Cause these be the things that
    make you blind."" Gah. There's a fine line between deflating institutional
    bullshit and a curmudgeon's condescension. PE fell prey to the latter
    years ago.</p><p>
    
    Musically, the album is sorely missing the Bomb Squad's Jenga-stacked
    whirlwind compositions, replacing the Shocklee Brothers and Eric Sadler with
    Squad utility players Johnny Juice and Abnormal. It's not all bad, just mostly copycat stuff. Most of the
    songs start with that familiar blitzkrieg intensity. ""MKLVFKWR"" and
    ""Preachin' to the Quiet"" in particular slam through at the outset. It
    quickly becomes clear, however, that there's not much variety in these
    producer's repertoire. A song like ""Night of the Living Baseheads"" has so
    many elements, it's like getting dragged through a mine field every time you
    hear it. By contrast, here we get ""Makes You Blind"", the worst metal song of
    the year. Maybe the decade. Chuck needs to stop this fixation right now.
    Professor Griff needs to stop rapping, too-- his flow is broken.</p><p>
    
    It's no fun disliking this album, but it's no fun to listen to, either. If you align
    yourself with Public Enemy, you'll be thrilled with all the shouting and
    sloganeering. But that's precisely what they should be combating:
    homogenization, t-shirt politics, musical uniformity. Instead they get
    closer to Fiery Cover Band status. The cracks really start showing when the
    phrase ""Power to the people cuz the people want peace"" starts to mean
    nothing. What could once move the crowd, now just sounds empty.</p></div>"|6503.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6503-new-whirl-odor/|5.9|Sean Fennessey

What Black loves about the song above all are the drum fills at the end of each verse. This is where Black looks for the most powerful emotions on <em>Blonde on Blonde</em>, and he says that those fills can have him close to tears. Black's response popped out for me because the idea of ""emotional"" drumming resonates and yet you don't see mentioned often. Rare is the music where the percussion does this sort of lifting, but when it happens, the effect is striking.</p><p>
    
    Richard D. James' single greatest talent may be his ability to program drums that convey feeling. He's always had a gift for melody and texture, obviously, but how these components work against his drums is what I'm always listening for. Which is, perhaps, why I've never much rated <em>Selected Ambient Works Vol. II</em>. To me it sounds like only half the Aphex Twin picture.</p><p>
    
    In 1995, James' music was climbing along a Moore's Law curve, one release after the next filled with strange and adventurous sound that made the future of electronic music seem terribly exciting. In October, a few months after the release of <em>I Care Because You Do</em>, Warp put out two limited vinyl singles titled ""Hangable Auto Bulb"". These 12-inches featured James' first experiments in pairing his unusual melodies with stuttering, chopped, jungle-influenced drum programming, which wound up defining his sound in the second half the 1990s. Both releases were limited and have been widely sought by collectors since; 10 years later Warp has released both together on CD.</p><p>
    
    James was fond of percussion that didn't even pretend to sound like real drums. The spastic taps going through the title track sound like a pair of scissors banging on a metal desk, with no timbral body to speak of. But the failure to reference proper instruments (or even previous digital approximations) gives an extra squeeze of the ""alien"" quality noted by so many attempting to describe James' style. Then on ""Wabby Legs"" the drums are constantly sent into a roll so fast they are transformed into another kind of instrument, a highly tactile buzz that seems to breathe. When this sound duets with a real or imaginary thumb piano as the track comes to a close, another aesthetic plateau is reached and the music's place in time becomes fuzzy.</p><p>
    
    ""Custodian Discount"" is the only track that makes obvious use of ""bass"" part of the drum'n'bass equation, with a huge balloon of low-end bouncing between the finely cut beats. In general James was too obsessed with balance to let the bass dominate. The swooning, half-sick synth lines that overlap on ""Laughable Butane Bob"" hint at the classical sensibility that would be tweaked and brightened on <em>The Richard D. James Album</em> the following year, while ""Every Day"" brings the tunefulness even further forward with a hypnotic distorted synth ""singing"" lead. Everything here is memorable and at eight tracks over 34 minutes <em>Hangable Auto Bulb</em> leaves you wanting more.</p><p>
    
    Compared to how hectic James and others would get with the drill'n'bass template, <em>Hangable Auto Bulb</em> is very restrained-- serene, even-- despite beats that can never stop twitching. The drums throughout seem strangely alive, full of energy but fallible, ready to take off at the slightest provocation. That tension, between the otherworldly yet effortlessly tuneful melodies purring along beneath drums that constantly struggle to frame them, is what the ensuing era of James' music is all about, and <em>Hangable Auto Bulb</em> is a hell of an intro.</p></div>"|239.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/239-hangable-auto-bulb/|8.9|Mark Richardson

    optimistic liner notes (""Wherever you are, welcome home""), for
    wondering if <i>Welcome Home</i> was another visit to the new
    millennial digital drum circle. Because hey, your parents may hate
    the laptop grinding, but Brooklyn noise is all Woodstock these days; warm and fuzzy's the new old norm. Except, not exactly. Carlos
    Giffoni, Venezuelan collaborator (Thurston Moore, Jim O'Rourke, Chris
    Corsano, Nels Cline, etc.) and show-thrower extraordinaire (No Fun
    Fest), has more on his mind than either holding hands or making ears
    bleed.</p><p>
    
    Clocking in somewhere between Japanese/RRRecords brutality, John Wiese
    granular ADD, and cuddly States Rights laptop love, Giffoni has shown
    up ready to synthesize and bridge gaps. That said, don't expect to
    put this on at bedtime. The least exciting but default mode of
    <i>Welcome Home</i> is big morphing computer riffs, such as
    opener ""Welcome Home"", full of buzz-saw high end and an infinite sea
    of hiss and click. While intricately patterned/planned, only the most patient and
    masochistic of listeners will find much home in the antagonistically
    barren opening stretch.</p><p>
    
    But then comes ""Bushwick"", glitching,
    pulsating, head-nodding, rhythmic and full of adrenaline-- a song worth an album alone. Giffoni
    finds the human urge buried in the sound (in this case, a primal
    satisfaction of cascading rhythm) and brings it to the fore.
    Sometimes he's even able to do this for his own machines: ""The Bold &amp;
    The Mad"" revs so out of control, moving first way up and down and then
    (even more improbably) side to side that it actually gets itself sick
    and has to crawl right out of the frame.</p><p>
    
    In contrast, the digital carnival of ""Who Is Home?"" is entirely human,
    working as a question that provides its own answer. Over 12
    tracks, <i>Welcome Home</i>'s rootlessness looms,
    a potential shipwreck on the shores of ones and zeros threatening to
    leave the listener searching for something remotely
    familiar to grab and hold. Well, this track is safe harbor. The
    cracked carousel melody is as much a home as any hideaway, built of
    warm tones ground up and bathed in, the sound inviting and impossibly
    soft. Even as Giffoni starts breaking it up, he does so with a
    trilling birdsong of an interruption, and when the granular wash does
    comes back, it is shockingly without malice. The sendoff ""Departure
    Time"" is just as cheery, a pleasant analog synth rotation of the now

Among other things these records reverse the vague perception that lands with tyrannical governments and tight media control cease cultural production; in spite of politics, they say, music somehow finds a way.</p><p>
    
    This assemblage of music and radio transmissions from North Korea is in some respects the most intriguing Sublime Frequencies set so far. The Korean peninsula undoubtedly has a rich tradition of folk and pop music, but none of that is on display here. For the last half-century in the North, tradition has been subjugated to the ""functional"" art ordained by party leadership. This music is a propaganda tool with songs relentlessly cheering on the glory and accomplishments of the state and, above all, promoting the unimaginably grandiose personality cult of Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il. By all accounts Kim Jong considers himself an aesthete; he is said to have a personal collection of 15,000 films or more, and in the '70s he had South Korean director Shin Sang-ok kidnapped and brought North to produce dramas infused with the correct sort of propaganda. Even under the rule of his father, Kim Jong-il took a special interest in the country's cultural output, reportedly writing several operas. At this point an entire nation's output of music more or less proceeds according to the tastes of one man.</p><p>
<em>Radio Pyongyang</em> was assembled and edited by Christaan Virant from store-bought tapes, short wave recordings from Voice of Korea, television programs, and live performances taped while he traveled as a tourist. Opening with the ""Motherland Megamix"", <em>Radio Pyongyang</em> confirms that, as with the military, the popular music of North Korea doesn't square with the reality of crushing poverty and a population frequently on the brink of mass starvation. The production is positively enormous, plush as one of the great leader's palaces, with mass choirs drenched in reverb exploding forth from the speakers to praise their benefactor. As a purely sonic spectacle, <em>Radio Pyongyang</em> fascinates like the lobby of a top-drawer Vegas hotel.</p><p>
    
    Styles are all over the map, with frequent operatic touches, a heavy Eastern European influence courtesy of the political leadership's obsession with Stalin, syrupy enrichments of folk melodies, bizarre show tunes, and homegrown responses to Western pop. Virtant's quick-cut editing on the ""Megamix"" gives the music the flavor of a prog-pop suite, with military bands banging into sweet female vocalists cheerily singing along to a polka beat. And then six minutes in a frighteningly sanguine chorus is interrupted by a static-ridden blast from one of North Korea's numbers stations, a grim reminder at the diseased and dark heart beating at the core it all.</p><p>
    
    It's pure kitsch, obviously-- a peculiar mix of crude militarist bullying and Lawrence Welk without budget constraints-- but Virant's brilliant editing keeps an ominous thread running throughout. It's a disorienting ride; unlike other Sublime Frequencies releases, which come to celebrate the sometimes accidental genius inherent in every country's throwaway pop culture, <em>Radio Pyongyang</em> seems like a running critique of itself, sheepishly letting the guilty pleasures of runaway nationalistic fervor bubble up even as it reminds us how frightening the whole enterprise is. On the one hand it's music made down the barrel of a gun, but on the other, you imagine the individual people making it, who probably wound up in these jobs because they love to sing or play. Every contradiction imaginable is happening at once throughout <em>Radio Pyongyang</em> and there is layer upon layer to unpeel. I don't know where the music comes from or what the songs mean, and certainly some of this stuff is laughable, but in spite of it all this CD is a weirdly fascinating work of art.</p></div>"|2047.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2047-radio-pyongyang-commie-funk-and-agit-pop-from-the-hermit-kingdom/|7.2|Mark Richardson

That record was one of the freshest, most unique statements the punk or hardcore scene had seen in years, and it brought on a great deal of disappointment when the band disbanded almost immediately afterward. Lyxén wasted little time before returning with The (International) Noise Conspiracy, and although it's worth giving him credit for trying something new rather than simply recycling his old band's style, this new project retained little of the excitement and fire that he'd so recently shown.</p><p>
    The (International) Noise Conspiracy have continued to release albums, slowly growing in popularity, and they even scored involvement from big names like Rick Rubin, Benmont Tench, and Billy Preston on their most recent effort, 2004's <em>Armed Love</em>. But, much like Refused's early work, the band suffers from being too derivative. Their garage rock'n'soul sounds too meticulous, too calculated. The authenticity, the swagger, and the sex is missing.</p><p>
    Unbeknownst to many, however, The (International) Noise Conspiracy hasn't been Lyxén's only output since Refused bit the dust. In 1999, he began recording as the Lost Patrol, releasing an album of political themed folk songs called <em>Songs in the Key of Resistance</em>. Now, six years later, what was once merely a solo project has grown to a full band (hence the slight name change) and released its self-titled full-band debut (Lyxén's third overall). Unfortunately, but not surprisingly, the disc suffers from the same symptoms that have ailed most Lyxén releases: It's unoriginal, uninspired, and uninventive. The style may be different, but the song remains the same. </p><p>
    This time around, Lyxén has focused his sights on the new wave and power-pop styles of the late 1970s and early 80s. Tight guitar hooks, doodling moog melodies, and catchy, sing-along choruses practically smother the life out of the disc. Two songs stand out: Opener ""Feels Like Drowning"", a toe-tapper that recalls the Raspberries and the Knack, and ""Pick Me Up"", a subdued, straightforward pop song that uses the synthesizer and a simple, compact beat to drive the verses and jangly guitar for the choruses. Elsewhere, there's not enough to set the tracks apart. ""Golden Times"", ""Hanging On"", and ""Let Me In"" are all rushed and essentially interchangeable. ""Get Ready"" and ""Can't Stand the Quiet"" are generic new wave. None of them are complete failures, but none offer anything to get excited about either. The album's one obvious blunder is ""My Heart Is Still a Mess"", a ballad-esque tale of woe that oozes with forced sentimentality from the pervasive acoustic guitar to the wedding chapel style organ. </p><p>
    It's a shame that a voice that was once a part of a band responsible for such a strong, original album now seems stuck in a cycle of rehashing decades-old styles. For a man who has put so much effort in being a revolutionary, Lyxén's music is about as status quo as they come. </p></div>"|4992.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4992-the-lost-patrol-band/|4.7|Cory D.

The hook: Big     guy with angel's voice. Live, wearing a black Mascis wig as camouflage,     Antony does tower over his bandmates, but the body police fail to note     that his physiognomy renders the gender play so much more exquisitely     plaintive because, well, there just aren't many women that tall. And despite     his colorful backstory, it seems time to drop the two-bit caricatures and     puff pieces and return to the brilliant, unearthly voice that earned     Antony his accolades in the first place-- his three most recent singles     offer a good place as any to instigate a frequency shift.</p>
<p>Functioning as Antony 101, <i>The Lake</i> was released three months     prior to <i>I Am a Bird Now</i>. Offering a glimpse of things to come,     the cover image is a detail from Peter Hujar's 1974 photograph ""Candy     Darling on Her Deathbed II"". Musically, it opens with a studio version     of the title track, Antony's Edgar Allen Poe jam. The song appeared in     a live version on <i>Golden Apples of the Sun</i> and was initially found     on the Current 93/Antony 2003 split <i>Live at St. Olave's Church </i>EP.     ""The Lake""'s studio version, however, features Kevin Barker of Currituck Co.     on guitar and Antony regular Julia Kent playing cello. Compared to the     earlier configuration, it's crisper and a tad slower with more pronounced     instrumentation-- especially Barker's crystalline chords.</p>
<p>Next comes ""A Fistful of Love"", a jazzy, horn-heavy stomp beginning with     a spoken intro courtesy of Lou Reed. This paean to rough sex/love nicely     prolongs Poe: ""The Lake"" is an adaptation of an Edgar Allen poem and Antony     sings on Reed's <i>The Raven</i>, a concept album about the soused     19th-century author. The EP closes with ""The Horror Has Gone"", a     lilting ballad that finds Antony in full vocal tremolo. Kent's cello     again rallies the beauty around Antony's piano, drums and what sound like     female backing vocals (though I was assured by label folk that's it's     actually Antony layering himself into tizzies). The lyrics inject some     hope-- ""I found my baby/ I lost my bird and I know it seems crazy/ But     now I feel we were one""-- but Antony's exquisite performance-- and the     macabre final flourish, in particular-- tempers the cheer.</p>
<p>Keeping his aesthetic thematically tight, the <i>Hope There's Someone</i> EP opens with the title track, a piece about the fear of dying alone,     among other things. (The death rattle is supplemented with a bed-ridden     video directed by Glen Fogel and starring Joey Gabriel. A still from     the video is used as the cover art, connecting it to Candy Darling.)     The other two tracks are previously unreleased recordings from the     <i>I Am a Bird Now</i> sessions. The strongest of these-- and one of     Antony's best-- is ""Frankenstein"", a full-on love song complete with     gothy gospel-esque choir. The most stirring moment occurs when Antony     goes a bit Aretha-- ""When I was a young boy, my mama said you better     watch out for your fall, but now that I'm a grown woman/ I know I know     I know""-- accompanied by rollicking, beautifully recorded drums. The     finale, ""Just One Star"", feels like a minute-and-a-half clipped from     some Broadway musical, Antony crooning along to his ivories: ""I am     just one star, born of grace and soon to die, but if i can just learn     how to love then I could live."" Continuing to find bridges between     each single, the last few notes echo a moment from ""The Lake""'s piano     line.</p>
<p>The recently released third EP pairs ""You Are My Sister"", a moving duet     with Boy George, with three more unreleased songs recorded during the     <i>Bird</i> sessions. ""Poorest Ear"" fits and starts, but never flows,     ending with ""Little Drummer Boy"" snare and Antony's approximated     Riverdance. Fortunately, ""Forest of Love"" is more successful. Sung     from the perspective of a five year-old girl, the narrative follows     her requests for the return of her brother from all sorts of possible     evils. It begins gorgeously, but lacking Antony's usual effortless     magic it plods into vaguely new age territory: Its saving grace is     the description of the landscape, teeming with water snakes and trees.     Both ""Forest of Love"" and ""Poorest Ear"" rely too much on Antony's voice     and not enough on solid songwriting.</p>
<p>Missteps are forgiven, however, upon hearing the excellent final track,     ""Paddy's Gone"". Stripping accouterments for spare piano and multi-tracked     voice, Antony presents a heartbreaking three minutes of ecstatic barbershop     quartet; he careens within himself variously (""Paddy's gone for a long time/     Love that man/ Scared without him""), and like the dusky vocal variations of     Elliott Smith's ""I Didn't Understand"", it could loop for an hour and still     hold my interest.</p>
<p>Since I reviewed <i>I Am a Bird Now</i> last February, the album's grown even     more astounding to my ears. In that sense, it's legitimately intriguing to     yawn through some of these non-album stinkers. But hell, Antony's human-- I     was starting to think of him as some kind of perfect, enraptured Downtown     deity.</p></div>"|11655.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11655-the-lake-ep-hope-theres-someone-ep-you-are-my-sister-ep/|7.5|Brandon Stosuy

Filled with tapes of home-recorded demos and unreleased songs, it was a lower-than-lo-fi trip through the underbelly of the band's overwhelming output. <em>Suitcase 2</em> picks up where the first <em>Suitcase</em> left off, documenting and releasing a seemingly bottomless trove of unreleased Pollard tracks. Even the art on the spine stretches across all four discs: You'll listen to all four in their entirety and you'll fucking like it, says Pollard.</p><p>  A few things that anyone who's given a shit outside of <em>Bee Thousand</em> and <em>Alien Lanes</em> will care about: The wonderful packaging, and a newer batch of outtakes extending to 2005 post-breakup material.

In the <em>Watch Me Jumpstart</em> documentary, Pollard describes sitting in the back of a high-school art class, creating cover art and band names long before Guided By Voices had been fully realized. <em>Suitcase 2</em> makes that daydreaming concrete: Every panel of the booklet and CD is a sleeve design for Skag or Bug-Eyed Mums or one of the other never-were bands credited on <em>Suitcase 2</em>.</p><p>  The box is scattered, as expected, but the songs collected go a long way to indicate that, contrary to popular belief, Pollard has a measure of control over his songwriting. As the author of an estimated 5,000-plus songs, it's easy to see him as beer-swilling savant, committing everything to tape with no regard to quality. The <em>Suitcase</em> boxes indicate that he is not only a diverse songwriter, but a keenly self-aware one as well. The demos from <em>Isolation Drills</em> in particular stick out, showing how consciously Pollard had changed his style and what a weird record <em>Drills</em> is-- songs like ""Headache Revolution"" and ""Daughter of the Gold Rush"" come fully-formed with an undercurrent of melancholy. Older pre-band tracks are steeped in the shadow of 70s rock radio, but songs like ""It's Only Up to You"" are rare chances to hear Pollard sounding vulnerable. Not everything works, like the ridiculous western accent on ""Lonely Town"", and there's more heaving than singing on ""My Dream Making Machine"", but the elegiac ""Two or Three Songs"" actually pulls off the navel-gazing, and the rallying call of ""no trash at all, I'm gonna throw it all out"" from ""Sacred Space"" shows he's conscious of the process at the very least.</p><p>  Sure, there are extraneous instrumentals, and some of the inebriated fun is more inebriated than fun (""The Golden Pickle"", ""Zarkoff's Coming""). Pound-for-pound, song-for-song, it doesn't live up to the first box, but <em>Suitcase 2</em> provides the same kind of thrills and spills as its predecessor: blow-the dust-off gems that poke our anthropological pleasure centers (""Stingy Queens"" is another unearthed burst of brilliance from the aborted <em>The Power of Suck</em> concept album), the gleefully raucous (""Bye Bye Song""), the cast-offs (""Tainted Angels and Butter Knives"", later issued under its working title, ""Jason Lowenstein's a Wanker"") the don't-fits (""I Am Decided"" was recorded for <em>Under The Bushes, Under the Stars</em> sessions and was so good Kim Deal had to steal it for The Amps' only record), the alternate versions (""Paper Girl"", ""Proud and Booming Industry""), the songs-in-progress (""Rocket Head"" is a hilarious embryonic ""Teenage FBI""; ""Sacred Space"" would become ""Office of Hearts""), and a rambling answering machine message (""What About The Rock?""). Curiously thrown in are outtakes from Pollard's first solo record, <em>Not in My Airforce</em>, further blurring the line between where Pollard stops and GBV begins.</p><p>  One Pollard criticism can't be deflected here, however-- Pollard's peak was the mid-1990s, culminating with the <em>Under the Bushes</em> sessions, when he was ridiculously prolific and consistently inspired. ""Stingy Queens"" and ""I Am Decided"" tower over most of the material here, and the <em>Not in My Airforce</em> demos, recorded near the same time, hold their own against the few outtakes from the band's back-to-back acknowledged classics (""You're Not the Queen Anymore"" alone reps <em>Alien Lanes</em>). The hiss-covered early tracks are way more fun than any myth-building behind-the-curtain ephemera should be, and the <em>Isolation Drills</em> demos show he could shift and change, but the mid-nineties material is what's worth going back to. But I've always felt that the tape experiments and ramblings are more an inclusive joke than an annoying distraction, and a laugh is better than a half-baked melody. The problem isn't that the four discs are too much; the thing that's really fucking infuriating is that if you spend the time, you will find those scattered brilliant songs. It's not that Pollard's releasing trash or writing too much for his own good, it's that only a very few highly organized and highly devotional non-family members can hope to keep up with him.</p><p> </p></div>"|3601.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3601-suitcase-2-american-superdream-wow/|7.0|Jason Crock

Plaintive acoustic guitar weeps a line of Frankensteinian despair, too weak to cry, while a monastic chant implores us, ""awaken."" This is not the same Family who welcomed us into its hovel last spring, and whose infectious bonhomie salved a disorientingly unfocused album.</p><p>
    
    After that murmur of an opener, it can only be nap or nuke. ""Moment"" goes the latter route, blindsiding those who came for the pastoral folk with a dizzying free-punk mortar blast. What? This match-made-in-enchanted forest oozed possibilities, but barrel-rolling drums, cold Unwound harmonics, and soaring off-key anthems were not in the cards. Nor was a simultaneous expansion and focusing of scope. The band embarks with eyes open wide, but by centerpiece ""Future Myth"" they're practically bulging out of their sockets. Two minutes of crescendoing chords, mimetic glockenspiel, and twittering synths simulate the sunrise we never got. The six ensuing ticks fold in climactic guitar riffage, a horn biting Sufjan biting Glass, and at least one surprisingly adroit hip-hop beat.</p><p>
    
    Akron/Family's debut was a potluck affair-- more trash than treasure, multifariousness its biggest appeal. Low-lying nylon-strung verdure cohabited the same space as vocal powwows, a move straight out of the Neutral Milk Hotel gratuity bible. But the neighbors rarely spoke until now. Drippy with the band's wonted choral free-for-all and syrupy back-porch bends, ""We All Will"" shifts but doesn't rift. ""Dylan pt. 2"" circles back to ""Market""'s bombastic drums without dropping later-established threads like the twang slang. In positioning for climax, the band sets up imminent disappointment. Stripped of expectation, then, ""Raising the Sparks"" is a surprising power stroke. Pinned by snare/tom stomp, a glitzy guitar harmony does its best Steely Dan as the song stampedes ""na na na""ing into the night.</p><p>
    
    Akron/Family love looping simple melodies and patterns ad infinitum, but the repetition is seldom epicentral; instead, it's space for their orchestral fog machine to fill. Backing Gira on his five-song set is a much different drift. Instead of hazes we get lines, instead of drum circles, studio snares, as the band services its patriarch's works with sure-footed reverence. </p><p>
    
    Gira's originals play second banana, occupying the record's back third. Dylan's ""I Pity the Poor Immigrant"" is rendered drunk by the crooner's loopy lower registers, Akron kicking a listless shuffle. ""The Provider"" builds off creeping metallic upbeats and consonant strings create a quicksandy murk over which Gira towers, never sinking. His star backing band even comes forward for a final surge, somehow managing to understate ululation. None of the tracks are more noteworthy than anything on <em>Sing ""Other People"", Angels' latest and straightest LP, and the foreshortened format disables development. But Gira's fatherly measuredness is a nice foil to Akron's hyperkinetic mini-opera-- at this point, he may be overparenting, but damnit they'll thank him someday. </em></p></div>"|189.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/189-akronfamily-angels-of-light/|8.0|Sam Ubl

While many theories exist on this naming peculiarit, no other ""wolf"" band adheres to as many definitions of the word. Dictionary says ""one that is predatory, rapacious and fierce"", check; ""A harshness in some tones of a bowed stringed instrument produced by defective vibration"", check-plus, something's sounding harsh here; and ""A man giving unwanted sexual attention to women"", check infinity (the album title translates to ""Non-stop I fold you in two"").</p><p>  Not to kickstart the Montreal hype machine yet again, but <em>Non-Stop</em> is the kind of unique mid-stratum album that substantiates a ""scene"" as something more than two shit-lucky bands from Anytown, USA. That said, We Are Wolves sound nothing like Arcade Fire or Wolf Parade. The trio treats their jittery dance-punk like a mad science experiment, haphazardly fusing club-ready basslines with uncomely electronic raucous. While Non-stop adheres to Devo's school of mechanical, futuristic garage rock, there's a stronger, dehumanizing emphasis on instruments rather than melody. The main victim of this dynamic, Frontman Alex Ortiz, sounds trapped in a cyborg factory, screaming and yelping to no avail over analog beeps and buzzes.</p><p>  Opener ""Little Birds"" uploads the infectious octave riff of ""My Sharona"" into the Matrix, eschewing fun and lechery in lieu of Orpheus-style precision. Ortiz's indignant howls try to instill some human emotion though helplessly merge with the song's inescapable noise phalanx. ""Vosotros, Monstruos"" (Spanish for ""You, Monsters"") further flaunts the band's multilingual skills, yet musically these cosmopolitans take a cue from French techno. The track's purring carburetor bass recalls Vitalic's ""My Friend Dario"", and with the wise omission of vocals, the track creatively wanders, unfettered by structure.</p><p>  Although such techno via dance-punk via noise arouses the genre insurgent inside us all, the band's minimalist attitude occasionally strands them in an electro no man's land. ""La Nature"" comes packed with ideas but bewildered in aim. Refusing to follow a gradual techno swell or establish a smug high-hat jam, the song simmers but never boils as each individual component sounds completely self-contained from the other. Still, these guys are a nearly ideal reincarnation of bands like Dance Disaster Movement or Numbers, hedging their sonic volatility with playful 8-bit melodies. Oh, and did I mention they're from Montreal?</p><p> </p></div>"|8807.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8807-non-stop-je-te-plie-en-deux/|7.4|Adam Moerder

    Ragtime and ""jass"" were bequeathed to him by
    the last words of Dr. Chattanooga Red, a mysterious mentor who allegedly told Rose to ""not let the ragtime die, and to bring it into the 21st
    century""-- twin missions that produced Rose's 2003 homage to his
    teacher, <i>Opium Musick</i>. True or not (not), it's a nice story,
    and the myth does seem operative-- Rose often plays as if the
    health of ragtime rests on his shoulders alone.</p><p>
    
    Maybe it does. John Fahey and Takoma Records are gone, and Rose's modern
    compatriots (Ben Chasney, Kevin Barker, Sir Richard Bishop, etc.) are
    increasingly seduced by the East, by psychedelics, and by a
    ""freak-folk"" that owes less to American Primitive than it might claim. Although Rose is no stranger to the raga form-- or to the near 20-minute composition (2004's <i>Raag Manifestoes</i> had both of these
    in spades)-- his tools are firmly those of the past. While the new
    century's novel folk has already seen significant definition, Rose is
    largely alone in talking new century ideas with the old language.</p><p>
    
    Thus, <i>Kensington Blues</i> is derivative and at the same time
    nearly brilliant. The styles Rose employs are diverse: twelve-string
    virtuoso shows, a slide guitar that alludes as much to the sitar as to
    the blues, solid traditional Takoma ragtime and folk. Out from latter
    comes a Fahey cover, ""Sunflower River Blues"", which (not surprisingly)
    works as the soil from which the rest of the record grows. The
    original was predicated on Fahey's impeccable timing; Rose's take
    amplifies the feeling and melody, and then runs with it. Hence the stunning ""Kensington Blues"", a song full of clarity and syncopation, elegant and well composed. Two others,
    ""Rappahanock River Rag"" and ""Flirtin' with the Undertaker"", are less
    weighty, more jaunty deliveries of Rose's signature modern ragtime.</p><p>
    
    But Rose is more than a traditionalist, and the other tracks on
    <i>Kensington Blues</i> veer sharply into newer territory. ""Cathedral
    et Chartres"" uses twelve strings to abstract the melodic clarity so
    abundant elsewhere on the record, speeding it up and then sending it
    into a droning, buzzing finale. This idea is fully worked out in his
    closer, ""Calais to Dover"", in which Rose transfigures the raga into a
    kind of Dream Music, deep listening project, vibrating his way past
    individual notes and sequences and arriving at something more akin to
    pure tone and texture. The minimalist affinity is no coincidence:
    Rose's folk is not the least bit free, even as he explores freak sonic
    terrain, and control is his technique, no matter how many notes he
    stacks.</p></div>"|6952.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6952-kensington-blues/|8.0|Zach Baron

After a five-year hiatus and even more time languishing in obscurity, Seattle quartet Harvey Danger have returned, not too sick but not too well. One-hit wonderdom does funny things to a band, as evident when Harvey Danger's street cred was forever damned upon that first sardonic verse ""I had visions, I was in them, I was lookin' into the mirror."" Ya see, these brainy college cutups, with their cheeky puns and witticisms, were simply too smart for their own good, and against their will, ""Flagpole Sitta"" catapulted them infinitely higher than expected on the cultural totem-pole, almost to the point of absurdity.</p><p>
    
    The interesting thing about the band's first two albums was how they tip-toed around the 90s monoliths while sampling their shticks at the same time; noisy but not Nirvana, geeky but not Weezer, quirky but not Pavement, raging but not against machines. In other words, throw your 10 fave 90s indie albums in a blender and poof!-- Harvey Danger. Unfortunately, <em>Little by Little</em> wobbles without these coeval moors (Weezer's dead to me), leaving us with delightful vestiges though ultimately sounding like a Ben Folds album.</p><p>
    
    I guess it's in some holy scripture that indie artists gotta go soft by age 35, but <em>Little by Little</em>'s lack of fuzzy axes is heresy. Pop-punk gem ""Cream and Bastards Rise"" throws us a smart-ass bone, but the band leans a bit too heavily on tickling the ivories. All ""Eleanor Rigby"" staccato and self-pity, cathartic opener ""Wine, Women and Song"" makes the most sense of the sedated bunch as singer Sean Nelson apparently comments on his 15 minutes of fame: ""Wine, women and song/ I've tried them all it did not take me long/ To figure I'd unlocked the door to happiness/ I figured wrong with a capital 'R'.""</p><p>
    
    Problem is, Nelson's wrenches his gut to the point of emo, ceasing the whole peanut gallery sniping that's separated these guys from, say, Primitive Radio Gods. ""Little Round Mirrors"" and ""Diminishing Returns"" lay on the sap and sweeping choruses, building to anti-climactic lines like ""You love all your little round mirrors/ See yourself reflected in one/ There's a hole in the middle you can't seem to fill"". When I heard the Danger was back, I prayed for a great anachronistic, Rip Van Winkle-like record adding yet another wrinkle to the band's outre act. Instead, <em>Little by Little</em> (save two or three tracks) reads like a carbon dating test, displaying the band's decaying sound gradually assimilating with its exhausted surroundings.</p></div>"|3753.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3753-little-by-little/|6.9|Adam Moerder

Dubious. The label's feel-good aura seems completely out of step with the weird, tortured Craig Wedren we know from the glammed-up D.C. post-punk of his old band, Shudder to Think. How would the man whose sickly-sweet falsetto once wrapped around lyrics like ""A doodle of some ancient mother fucking her son"" fit in with the Willy Masons of the world? Has he forfeited his dark allure for a slice of the teen-angst alt-folk pie?</p><p>
    
    Shudder to Think weren't the hardest rocking band or weirdest band to emerge from the fertile 1980s D.C. punk scene, but their combination of the two produced some of that period's most unique music. After releasing several terrific records of haunting, pop-infected post-punk on Dischord, Shudder to Think recruited new drummer Adam Wade and the inimitable guitarist Nathan Larson, signed with Epic, and released the career-defining <em>Pony Express Record</em>. Beautifully damaged arpeggios slithered and spiked over oblique rock riffs, and Wedren's voice was exquisite, sliding frictionlessly between glassy falsetto, velvet purr, and operatic howl to invest his elliptical poems with a nauseating magnetism. But after the polished glam of the underappreciated <em>50,000 B.C.</em> didn't perform commercially, Shudder to Think was just a few indie film scores away from dissolution.</p><p>
    
    Wedren's kept busy messing around with his arty pop band Baby, cabaret troupe the Citizens Band, and scoring more films, but since <em>Lapland</em> features songs that would've been on the next Shudder to Think album (if they'd stayed together) in addition to one-off film contributions, it's the Wedren project that most obviously begs for comparison to his old band. Make no mistake-- <em>Lapland</em> is a mainstream pop record; ""One Man's Heart"" and ""Do You Wrong"" were co-written with Jimmy Harry, who's penned songs for Britney Spears and Kylie Minogue. Even with the poppier, more accessible turn Shudder to Think took with <em>50,000 B.C</em>, it's difficult to imagine them playing these charming but strictly MOR pop ditties. </p><p>
    
    So there's predictable bad news and good news. The bad news-- the serpentine guitars and scary lyrics are gone, replaced with unflashy reverb and genial platitudes. Hey, our man's all growed up now. The good news is that even though the wind-tunnel vibrato is mostly absent, Wedren's voice sounds terrific, an expressive and formidable instrument. He's using it more traditionally, but his blend of eerie falsetto and soulful croon remains striking. If most of the tunes on <em>Lapland</em> blend pleasantly into the background (it's easy to see why some of them have been picked up as incidental music for television and film), certain moments leap to the foreground: The majestic vocal crescendo of the bridge of ""Do You Harm"", for instance, and the various times on songs like ""Wanna Drive?"" and ""Fifteen Minutes Late"" when Wedren's voice suddenly takes flight into the wordless, chilly upper regions of his range. Some diehard Shudder to Think fans will hate <em>Lapland</em> for its unapologetic softening, and new Wedren fans who delve into Shudder to Think's back catalog on its strength will be in for a nasty shock, but if, like me, you're still mesmerized by <em>Pony Express Record</em> a decade after the fact, it's a must-cop. </p></div>"|8809.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8809-lapland/|6.3|Brian Howe

    her best to convincingly sulk and pout. The next, she attempts to
    out-cloy every AOR merchant of schlock with a Lilith Fair ticket stub in
    their jewelry box. Throughout the rest of <i>Speak For Yourself, Imogen
    Heap nervously flits between these two poles, envisioning a world where
    Sarah McLachlan, Shirley Manson, and Björk do each other's hair and sing
    into hairbrushes. The results of this musical terraforming are at once
    both gorgeous and bland.</i></p><p>
    It's not for want of trying, though. Heap actually mortgaged her London
    flat to finance the making of this record, and the go-for-broke attitude
    is evident. This record is produced within an inch of its life, sounds
    on top of sounds topped off with a gauzy candy-coated sheen that's, at
    times, too much to bear. Ornate baubles like ""Clear the Area"" and ""The
    Walk"" threaten to collapse under the weight of all their finery. Most
    of the tracks are a sticky-sweet conglomeration of piano and other
    sparking sounds-- synth air rushing in, Dopplered voices fading away.
    Sometimes these sounds are abetted by fuck-off guitars (like ""Daylight
    Robbery"") or big-beat drum machines (like ""I Am In Love With You"").
    Invariably, most of the tracks find a samey safe spot between the
    unrepentant Nelly Furtado-esque chirping of ""Goodnight and Go"" and the maudlin
    yearning of ""Just For Now"".</p><p>
    And then there's Heap's voice, an ephemeral elastic thing that more
    often than not disappears into the music. It's hard to believe that
    someone executing these vocal gymnastics can also evaporate so easily. Sometimes, she gets lost within her own songs; sometimes, she gets lost within her own round-robin multi-tracking
    trickery. The pouting on ""Daylight Robbery"" is as loud as she gets, and
    even that's soft as silk. More often than not, the listener is caressed
    with whispers and sighs and innocuous vowels-as-words attached to lyrics
    that are often as airy as her vocals. There's also Heap's tendency to
    indiscriminately toss in those little yelp-sighs that some singers
    (hello, Ms. McLachlan) lean on until it turns from ""charming
    affectation"" to ""offputting tic"".</p><p>
    Having said that, there's no reason why this album can't be the subject
    of a torrid aural love affair. Her ostentatiousness is
    endearing, if you can swallow both the musical and vocal flourishes.
    And when Heap's personality shines through all the trappings and
    inadvertent emulations (somewhere before the chorus in ""Goodbye and Go"",
    for example), it's a welcome breath of fresh air. And it's not like the
    songs are bad. They're just too much, and pity the fool with no
    patience for pretty frou frou stuff listening to any of this. The black
    sheep of the bunch, ""Hide and Seek""-- aka That Song From ""The O.C.""-- best exemplifies the strengths and weaknesses of this album. The track
    consists of nothing but a Vocoder and her voice singing stuff about crop
    circles and sewing machines. It's gorgeous, it's impressive, it's
    grandiose, and it's barely there at all-- just Heap's voice darting and
    divebombing, making itself scarce, disappearing into itself.</p></div>"|4025.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4025-speak-for-yourself/|6.4|David Raposa

Two years ago, when Brooklynites Stellastarr* turned up fresh out of art school in the wake of Interpol's <em>Turn On The Bright Lights</em>, the foursome seemed considerably less like copycats and more like the lesser of two partners-in-crime ripping off New Wave big names. Both debuts resembled soundtracks to somber dance parties, but Stellastarr*'s had crappier lyrics, and Amanda Tannen's sweet hollabacks.</i></p><p>
    
    So <em>Harmonies for the Haunted</em> is nothing new; it'd be easy enough to nail the band for repeat offense of poor-man doubling. But they're first-rate mocks-- as deft as dead-on cover bands come. Virtually all the LP's tracks flaunt role models plainly, but they draw from even fewer sources this time around. ""Lost in Time"" already plays uncannily reminiscent of the Cure's ""Closedown"". ""Sweet Troubled Soul"" is Bloc Party's ""Helicopter"" for drama kings who fancy their queens sweet and troubled-- ""I want to suffer in your arms/ And when you're naked in the dark/ I want to see your face in the reflection of my bedroom stereo/ We'll take it slow."" No room for jokester Kinks shit here-- especially since Christensen's pipes are Ric Ocasek's gone through two extra rounds of puberty.</p><p>
    
    Bitter singles going door-to-door caroling on Valentine's day would sound something like ""Damn This Foolish Heart""-- dissolving into earnest rounds, all while Christensen's crying ""no no no no."" Speaking of histrionics: ""Love and Longing"" and ""When I Disappear"" channel the All-American Rejects-- picture lead singers' eyes closed, belting ""I won't regret you."" Christensen's puppy dog wails seem as recycled as the music itself. Even the Rejects camouflaged better.</p><p>

His voice has a hypnotically fluid precision and a weary authority, and Bun delivers his rhymes with enough inventive eloquence to even make street-rap clichs sound fresh. His latest album, <em>Trill</em>, is full of solid, workmanlike beats from guys like Mr. Lee and Mannie Fresh, and only occasionally succumbs to mainstream rap's fetish for pillowy r&amp;b; sonics. Bun is comfortable working a lot of different styles, from the pitbull threats of ""I'm a G"" to the catchy plastic fake-Miami bounce of ""Git It"". As a slapdash multiple-producer singles-and-filler album from a B-list rapper, <em>Trill</em> succeeds; there are certainly many, many worse ways to spend your rap money.</p><p>
    But here's the thing: It's not enough for <em>Trill</em> to be a competent mainstream-rap album. It's the first solo album from Bun, and it comes at the first bright moment of an epically long career. Bun is half of the Texas duo UGK, a group contracted early in its career with Jive, a label that had no idea how to market it, and still hasn't managed to extricate itself. And so the group's albums never sold what they should've. But UGK's underground fanbase was strong enough to drive its 1996 release <em>Ridin' Dirty</em> past gold, and Bun and his partner Pimp C made what should've been a career-making guest appearance on Jay-Z's ""Big Pimpin'"" in 1999. Unfortunately, the duo's follow-up album took too long to come out, and it never managed to capitalize on either of the duo's career landmarks. In 2001, Pimp C went to prison for violating his probation, and the group looked dead. But Bun responded by going on a tear, making ridiculously cold guest appearances on virtually every Southern rap album to come out in the last two years, and he managed to build his name up more than he ever had in UGK, especially after Houston rap blew up huge earlier this year. This should be Bun's moment, the light at the end of the tunnel, the time when he steps up and delivers the genre-defining classic he's always promised. Instead, he's made a pretty good rap album.</p><p>
<em>Trill</em> is not a well-sequenced album; every transcendent moment is immediately followed by an embarrassing travesty. ""Pushin"", a gorgeously sad drug-talk reminisce with Scarface and Young Jeezy, comes immediately before the irredeemably cheesy squeaky-synth Jazze Pha collaboration ""I'm Ballin'"". The triumphant all-Houston posse cut ""Draped Up (H-Town Mix)"", which includes the ecstatic surprise of Chamillionaire and Paul Wall appearing right next to each other, is followed by ""Late Night Creepin'"", and inexplicable collaboration with the guy from the Transplants who isn't Tim Armstrong. But the most egregious misstep comes right after ""The Story"", Bun's crushingly honest and endlessly fascinating retelling of the entire UGK story. On that track, he raps for six minutes straight with no hook, uncovering every inside detail of his tremendous career. It's one of the best things Bun has ever done, but then its momentum is halted by the following track, the tedious and awkward r&amp;b; love-rap ""Hold U Down"".</p><p>
    And so the album goes, derailing its great moments with sad missteps. Bun wastes guest appearances from Jay-Z and Young Jeezy on the ungainly, uninspired track ""Get Throwed"", and on ""Who Need a B"" he gives us the spectacle of a middle-aged married man talking explicitly about pimping. And so <em>Trill</em>, for all its strengths, is a missed opportunity. Bun probably still has another classic on the level of <i>Ridin' Dirty in him; we might find out a couple of months when Pimp C goes up for parole and maybe returns to crafting the woozy soul tracks that Bun loves.</i></p></div>"|1179.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1179-trill/|6.9|Tom Breihan

""Not all of it's great,"" she admitted. ""On those tapes are everything from shitty collages to some pretty stunning, awe-inspiring acoustic songs to stupid, fucked-up shit.""  In 2004, just in time for Christmas, bits from Love's infamous cache of cassettes appeared on the <em>With the Lights Out</em> box set, a collection of 61 tracks with a list price of $60-- the supposedly definitive postscript to Kurt Cobain's April 1994 suicide.</p><p>
<em>Sliver: The Best of the Box</em> is a pared-down version of <i>With the Lights Out</i>, adding three tracks that didn't appear on that set.  Without getting too deep into shifty-eyed corporate conspiracy theories (the previously unreleased demos included here are said to be ""freshly"" unearthed), it's difficult to see <em>Sliver</em> as anything more than a sneaky swindle designed to aggravate Nirvana completists who already own the box set and don't otherwise require another non-self-compiled best-of.  But no matter how much slack you're willing to cut Geffen, <em>Sliver reeks of manipulative marketing.  Granted, posthumous releases are always delicate ground-- publishing Cobain's private journals, for instance, made plenty of his followers squirm-- but this is excessive.</em></p><p>
    
    What's worse, none of <em>Sliver</em>'s three new songs are particularly revelatory or dynamic: The long-sought-after rendition of ""Spank Thru""-- which, strikingly, has never even been available on bootlegs-- is pure artifact, hinting at an embryonic Nirvana.  While diehard fans are no strangers to the song itself (a later version appeared on the legendary <i>Sub Pop 200</i> compilation, while 1996's <i>From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah</i>-- already the second posthumous Nirvana release-- featured a live cut), <i>Sliver</i>'s version appeared on 1985's infamous ""Fecal Matter"" demo tape, and features a throaty, 18-year-old Cobain on guitar and vocals, backed by the Melvins' Dale Crover on drums and bass.  Oddly, the quality of the recording is stellar in contrast to the rest of the album's material, and every vocal tic and nuance is instantly palpable.  Still, complete with mid-song coughs and ridiculous electric guitar wrestling, ""Spank Thru"" was obviously never destined to hit record stores, and while it's an interesting anthropological bit (and a charming ode to jerking off), <em>Sliver</em>'s melodramatic unveiling of the track is somewhat insulting to Nirvana's devoted legions. </p><p>
<em>Sliver also offers a demo of ""Come as You Are"", supposedly recorded for Butch Vig in 1991 before he began working on </em><em>Nevermind</em>.  Unsurprisingly, it sounds shitty, and nothing new or particularly interesting transpires in its four minutes.  The most worthwhile of the three bonus tracks is a 1990 studio demo of ""Sappy"", a version of which appeared as an unlisted track on the 1993 charity compilation <em>No Alternative.  (The song, which had no official title on that disc, was often referred to as ""Verse Chorus Verse""-- even now, dissenters wrestle over which version of the song deserves which title).  Here, it's studio-quality, and, though slightly more plodding than the </em><em>No Alternative</em> version, still a great track.</p><p>
    
    Chances are, most Nirvana fans are hungry for rare and unreleased songs, not scrappy demos of singles or semi-absurd teenage wankery.  Still, there is a bit of good news.  As plenty of critics and fans agreed in 2004, <i>With the Lights Out was overstuffed, curated without care, and bloated by poorly recorded, destined-for-the-recycling-bin demos and unflattering vocal portraits.  <em>Sliver</em> fulfils its promise to cull ""The Best of the Box"" (see: ""Do Re Mi"", ""Old Age"", and a live ""Floyd the Barber""), and though it may be irritatingly superfluous, as a collection of B-sides, demos, and outtakes, it lives up to its subtitle.</i></p></div>"|5812.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5812-sliver-the-best-of-the-box/|6.8|Amanda Petrusich

In America, they enlivened an 18-month stretch of our lives with frat electronica, surprising no one when they disappeared forever. In the UK, they were one of the biggest pop bands of the 1990s, epitomizing a whole mess of
    sociocultural malarkey. That they can be both is a big chunk of Howlett's
    ""genius,"" and <i>Their Law is the kind of all-killer/no-filler collection
    that only someone with half an eye on the avant-garde and the other
    one-and-a-half in the gutter can produce.</i></p><p>
    
    Early Prodigy tracks are a bit like chasing your Lucky Charms with
    chocolate milk. ""Charly"" sampled a kiddie safety PSA along with an
    oompah-loompah synth riff and, in England, went all the way to No. 2. ""Jericho"" and ""Everybody in the Place"" speed headlong like crash test dummies on runaway breakbeats. Best-ever Prodigy track is ""Out of Space"", which throws Max Romeo and Kool Keith into the back of a Jeep while Howlett does donuts in the shopping mall parking lot. Personally, I could never part with all of the malformed, day-glo vinyl mutants from the early days of rave, but for the rest of you, their <i>Experience album will work a treat.</i></p><p>
    
    Howlett quickly saw the writing on the wall for the one-hit-blunder dance
    single as a career-- as well as sensing the pop limitations of the
    underground (which probably wouldn't have him anyway). The result was the
    1993's <i>Music for the Jilted Generation. Suddenly, the former clown
    prince of pacifier rave was being hailed as an auteur, ditching the squeaky
    voices and writing a quasi-concept record about the Criminal Justice Act.</i></p><p>
<i>Jilted has taken a bit of a reverse drubbing in recent years from
    </i><i>Experience partisans as a cheesy ""maturation"" move. But the singles
    are still great, chewy with cornball menace, though not quite as over the
    top as those of a few years later. Guitars make their first appearance on a Prodigy record here, on ""Their Law"", and ""Voodoo People"" and ""Poison"" are hairy, greasy cousins to ""proper"" techno. Best of all is ""No Good (Start the Dance)""-- jungle in slo-mo replay.</i></p><p>
    
    1997's <i>Fat of the Land went to No. 1 in the U.S., which
    prompted ad execs, record company PR stooges, and </i><i>Spin to foolishly
    presume ""electronica"" was poised to clean house in the floundering final
    days of alt-rock. ""Firestarter"" sounds like Trent Reznor in one of his
    all-too-rare moments of self-aware humor, like the Bomb Squad at +5 with a
    pink-haired British bulldog bellowing about how tuff he is. ""Breathe"" is
    just ""Firestarter 2 (the Quickening)"", And then there's ""Smack My Bitch Up"",
    which divorced from its ""controversial"" video is a really good big beat
    track.</i></p><p>
    
    And then...nothing. For eight long years. Finally, outta nowhere, came
    <i>Always Outnumbered, Never Outgunned in 2004. Maxim Reality and Keith
    Flint (the shouty ones) were MIA. It got panned, stiffed (at least in the
    states), and generally gave no indication that Howlett wasn't actually
    washed up. Maybe it's just surrounding context, but the </i><i>Always singles
    on </i><i>Their Law actually sound pretty darn good-- ""Girls"", especially, is
    awesome, like crunk IDM or something that sounds similarly awful on paper
    but comes out sounding like an air-raid warning on Howlett's laptop.</i></p><p>
    
    Bonus disc edition is largely useless, a string of live tracks (eh) and
    B-sides (eh-to-hey-not-bad). Remixes range from ""why?"" (Audio Bully's take
    on ""Out of Space"") to ""holy farking hell"" (Pendulum's blitzkrieg drum &amp; bass
    rework of ""Voodoo People""). Sadly missing: Their wind tunnel and WMD's remix
    of Method Man's ""Release Yo' Delf"" (second best-ever Prodge moment). But the
    main disc is satisfying like a 72-oz. steak or half a case of beer: Knowing
    you should know better just adds to the fun.</p></div>"|6487.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6487-their-law-the-singles/|9.1|Jess Harvell

As someone who grew up cranking Kiss and AC/DC, I'm instantly leery of any band that relies too much on irony and kitsch when playing this style. Perhaps as an attempt to curtail those concerns, the one-sheet that Matador sends along with two-man metal band Early Man's debut full length goes to great pains to make the band seem authentic. As much space is devoted to describing their gear as the band members themselves, one of whom sports a Kreator t-shirt in a recent press photo. It felt like they were trying a little too hard. There's even a quote about how Conte only uses a standard tuning ""mainly for the sake of pissing off the nu-metal world."" Let the music speak for itself, guys; especially when it works this well: For everyone who misses traditional, heavy rock, Early Man has come to assure you that you aren't alone.</p><p>
<em>Closing In</em> is a classic guitar-driven heavy metal record. It's a throwback to early 80s thrash, the era before speed often became a substitute for creative ideas. Every song is built around galloping riffs and booming power chords. The album's opener, ""Four Walls"" sets the tone with explosive chords giving way to a crunchy, palm-muted rhythm. The chorus, which layers reverb-sodden, call-and-response vocals with a catchy guitar lead, is one of the strongest on the record. ""Death is the Answer"", which also appeared in a slightly different form on the band's self-titled EP issued last summer, begins as a bludgeoning, Sabbath-esque metal-march, with echoing vocals and lyrics revolving around the crowned prince of heavy metal, good ol' Satan himself, before picking up the tempo midway through.</p><p>
    
    The album's primary weakness is its uniformity. There's only so much that can be done with mid-tempo, riff-driven metal, but the album is well-paced, with strong tracks sprinkled from start to finish. ""Like a Goddamn Rat"" appears at the midpoint, and its hi-hat heavy, almost-dance beat just begs for some serious head nodding. On ""Evil Is"", Conte trades in his smooth croon for a gruff <em>Kill 'Em All</em>-era Hetfield-esque bark to great effect. </p><p>
    
    Younger listeners who are looking for artists comparable to the newer, speed-and-fury style acts that cover the metal landscape may be turned off by Early Man's old-school vibe, as will anyone looking for silly theatrics and camp. But as someone who still appreciates the keep-it-simple-stupid attitude of classic 70s heavy metal, <em>Closing In</em> is a resounding success. </p></div>"|2928.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2928-closing-in/|7.7|Cory D.

    Middleton verges on something even more
    surprising from a member of Scotland's slow-drunk-fuck-folk duo: happiness. Of course, the feeling is mostly superficial,
    manifesting in jaunty melodies and bright acoustic guitar as Middleton
    burrs morosely about more-typical Strap fare-- loneliness, insecurity,
    cursing-- and it doesn't last. Yet <em>Into the Woods</em> shows
    Middleton's growth since 2003's awkward <em>5:14 Fluoxytine Seagull
    Alcohol John Nicotine</em> into a witty, self-effacing, and
    eager-to-please singer-songwriter.</p><p>
    
    The troubadour Middleton most resembles is fellow happy-sad Glaswegian
    Gary Lightbody. ""Loneliness Shines"" leans on Snow Patrol's
    gussied-up-MBV noise squalls, while ""Choir"" picks up <em>Final
    Straw</em>'s search for the hugely, glisteningly anthemic in fragile
    personal details. Reindeer Section's Jenny Reeve even guests on the
    catchiest track, ""A Happy Medium"", an all-grins jolt of jingling
    dance-floor folktronica. ""My face is a disease,"" Middleton spits out
    incongruously. It's such bitter lyrics that distance <em>Into the
    Woods</em> from Lightbody's bands. On ""Autumn"", Middleton addresses the
    season as ""you fucking cunt"" over gloomy piano straight from Gary
    Jules' rendition of ""Mad World""; ""Burst Noel"" recounts a Christmas
    spent watching ""EastEnders"" all alone after getting knifed.</p><p>
    
    Middleton tends to indulge in songs about songs, which, like reviews
    about reviews, can be either a crutch or a coup, depending on
    execution. Splashy opener ""Break My Heart"" plays this game fairly well
    with lovelorn pop's eternal catch-22: If the girl doesn't break the
    singer's heart, she'll ruin his career. It's
    hard to fault the song's gamely cheerful piano and upbeat tune, and
    it's easy to envision crowds lapping up its nice-guy sweetness. Amid
    finger-picking, clouds of distortion, and Celtic strings, ""Monday Night
    Nothing"" makes a more pedestrian self-reference, as Middleton
    confesses, ""I don't know how to finish this song""; by the
    Notwist-esque electro-pop of ""Solemn Thirsty"", dude's speaking
    teen-romance-movie: ""How do I write a song and give it to the girl?""
    Then finale ""A New Heart"" pokes fun at itself and Arab Strap's
    well-documented profanity by neatly dodging dirty rhymes.</p><p>
    
    None of this explains Middleton's bear fixation (a number of the
    species' representatives rear their heads throughout the album), but
    why quibble? In the ultimate sensitive-singer-songwriter move,
    Middleton depicts himself as a guy who's just looking for the perfect
    girl but can't seem to find her.</p></div>"|5667.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5667-into-the-woods/|6.8|Marc Hogan

Like Nina Hagen, Ford has the technical skill to sing anything she wants-- opera, cabaret, rock, whatever. And like Hagen, what she wants to do is to wail out unhinged, demented werewolf gurgles free of structure or accessibility. In short, she's a potential deal-breaker.</p><p>
    
    Celebration is the fourth band Ford has started with her husband, multi-instrumentalist Sean Antanaitis, after Jaks, Love Life, and Birdland. The couple seem to change their band-name every time they switch collaborators, and now they've found a new guy in drummer David Bergander. More than any of Ford and Antanaitis' past bands, though, Celebration seem to exist entirely to allow Ford to go as nuts as possible. Antanaitis and Bergander create off-kilter Halloween funhouse tracks, all spooky whistling organs and busily shuffling drums and unbalanced time signatures. And Ford uses the tracks as launching pads, unleashing her voice in all its glory. It's stunning and virtuosic, but it's not especially emotionally resonant.</p><p>
    
    Celebration are probably best-known for theur association with TV on the Radio; Ford sang on ""Staring at the Sun"", and TVOTR's David Andrew Sitek produced <em>Celebration</em>. Sitek also plays on the album, and Tunde Adebimpe and Kyp Malone provide vocals. TVOTR are probably also the reason Celebration are signed to 4AD. Celebration has little of TVOTR's melodic heft or cascading warmth; they simply expand on that band's warped, proggy intensity. And that fractured sense of grandeur serves Celebration well; the band sounds something like 4AD's entire catalogue being chopped up and fed through a meat-grinder, those glistening synths and ethereal harmonies and lilting whale songs agonizingly mashed into an ugly, Frankensteinian chamber-jazz. Nearly every track begins with a deceptively calm and fluid keyboard melody before slowly piling on more and more elements, becoming denser and more chaotic while Ford gets further and further from anything resembling pop music. It's a neat trick, one that stays interesting over the course of the album, but don't expect it to keep you warm at night.</p></div>"|1821.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1821-celebration/|6.7|Tom Breihan

And now, with the release of her second album <em>Lookaftering</em>, Bunyan has completed a comeback more reminiscent of pre-war country blues artists like Dock Boggs or Bukka White, whose performing and recording careers were resurrected during the 1960s folk revival, rather than anyone from the pop/rock era. Like those old folk and bluesmen, Bunyan returns to a musical landscape that's been unrecognizably altered. But unlike the later recordings of those performers-- which consisted primarily of reworking their older material-- <em>Lookaftering</em> represents the full-fledged reawakening of a still-vital talent, ready to cast aside her decades-long artistic hibernation and re-ignite her creative fires.</p><p>  At that time, after the small initial pressing of <em>Diamond Day</em> failed to find an audience, a disheartened Bunyan left the city and music behind, packing her wagon to quietly raise children and animals in the Scottish Borders and rural Ireland. In the meantime, however, her album slowly built a reputation as a lost classic. So when <em>Diamond Day</em> was reissued in Britain to great acclaim in 2000, Bunyan commenced her gradual return to the spotlight. Since then she's made cameo appearances on albums by such fans as Devendra Banhart and Piano Magic, and earlier this year partnered with Animal Collective on the charming <em>Prospect Hummer</em> EP.</p><p>  On <em>Lookaftering</em>, it comes as a relief to hear not only how pristine Bunyan's delicate vocals remain but that she has retained her understated abilities as a songwriter, despite going decades without picking up a guitar. Taking its title from a self-invented word that refers to taking care of something or someone-- as well as to the process of looking back on the past-- <em>Lookaftering</em> deftly covers both these themes in ample measure. In many regards, this collection seems a wistful, measured reflection upon the long-ago daydreams of <em>Diamond Day</em> and the sweet sadness of all that goes by, while managing to retain the same tranquil, out-of-time intimacy that has allowed her debut to age so gracefully.</p><p> <em>Lookaftering</em> also features tasteful instrumental contributions from such guests as Banhart, Joanna Newsom, and Mice Parade's Adam Pierce, but Bunyan's most crucial collaborator proves to be producer Max Richter. Throughout the album, Richter's impeccable orchestrations of piano, strings, and woodwinds (co-arranged by Bunyan) masterfully echo Joe Boyd's classic work with Nick Drake, Fairport Convention, and on <em>Diamond Day</em>; as well as Larry Fallon's chamber-folk arrangements on Nico's <em>Chelsea Girl</em>. As with <em>Diamond Day</em>, this careful balance is critical to the album's success, since Vashti's feathery, near-whispered vocals could be easily capsized by a heavy-handed production.</p><p>  ""Indifference is the coldest hand/ It is the wave that clears the sand,"" sings Bunyan on ""Turning Backs"", an exquisitely orchestrated track she has said was written with Nick Drake in mind, but that might also provide insight into the reasons behind her long absence. Her frustration with the domestic life also crops up on ""Wayward"", on which she describes ""days going by lost in clouds of flour and whitewashing,"" before later sighing, ""I wanted to be the one with road-dust on my boots.""</p><p>  Elsewhere, though, these songs look on the past with a shivery, almost tangible longing. ""Here Before"", is an elegant ode to the happy mysteries of parenthood (""Once I had a child/ He was wild in the moonlight/ He could do it all/ Like he'd been here before"") while on ""Against the Sky"" she depicts a city-dweller nostalgic for her old farmstead (""The hill behind the old house/ I can trace it with my finger."") For some listeners, such nostalgia might teeter uncomfortably close to sentimentality, but even on personal tracks such as the brief elegy ""Brother"", Bunyan keeps her touch impossibly light, reflecting only for a moment before quickly turning another page. <em>Lookaftering</em> closes with a wordless reprise of ""Wayward"", as she quietly hums the song's melody as though unaware that anybody might be listening. But, hopefully, with the arrival at last of her stunning second album, Vashti Bunyan need no longer worry about her music going unheard.</p><p> </p></div>"|1136.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1136-lookaftering/|8.5|Matthew Murphy

A large number of its songs are widely loved, of course, but to many critics and listeners, the peak of girl-group music (roughly 1962-65) is considered an era of frivolity and disposability, a manufactured post-Payola placeholder rightfully eradicated from the airwaves by the British Invasion.</p>
<p>Granted, the girl-group sound <i>was</i> cynically designed to be ephemeral, the work of highly competitive yet mostly faceless songwriters working out of Brill Building cubicles. Little concern was given to artist development, and the singers themselves-- many of whom were black-- were rarely promoted as vigorously as their rock'n'roll progenitors, partially due to labels' fears that television performances would reveal their skin color and thus alienate potential listeners. The music, however, has persevered, even proving itself massively important and influential, despite its marginalization by an industry that mythologizes and profits from the past by lionizing larger-than-life personalities and/or album-oriented artists rather than pop singles.</p>
<p>Rhino does its part to make amends for some of that marginalization with its lovingly compiled 4xCD, 120-track girl-group box <i>One Kiss Can Lead to Another</i>, a near-perfect combination of quality, necessity, song selection, sequencing, informative liner notes, and packaging. Crucially, the compilers were liberal with their definition of girl-group music, incorporating not just doo-wop- and/or gospel-influenced female vocal teams such as the Chiffons, the Shirelles, the Cookies, and the Shangri-La's but also combos and solo artists from a variety of musical styles, including R&amp;B, garage rock, country, proto-psych, and Northern and blue-eyed soul. British singers such as Petula Clark, Sandie Shaw, Cilla Black, and Dusty Springfield are afforded places here-- as are, ironically, tracks made popular by Brit Invasion artists such as the Beatles, Hollies, Moody Blues, and Herman's Hermits. Familiar artists such as Cher and Dolly Parton appear in atypical guises, but most of the widely recognizable names are working behind the scenes: Keith Richards, Jimmy Page, Brian Wilson, Neil Diamond, Jimmy Webb, Randy Newman, and Cat Stevens all feature in the liner notes, alongside Brill Building songwriting staples such as Goffin/King, Mann/Weil, and Barry/Greenwich.</p>
<p>The most notable absence is Phil Spector, whose dense Wall of Sound production style and proclivity for melodramatic lyrics were the benchmarks and templates for much of girl-group music. But then, that's just as well, since anyone willing to purchase this affordable set will also want to own Spector's <i>Back to Mono</i> box, which includes the major hits by artists like the Crystals, the Ronettes, Darlene Love, and others. Of course, the inability to license Spector's tracks made it impossible for the set's creators to compile a definitive genre box; wisely, they instead cast a wide net and included mostly non-hits, unearthing a collection of tracks that will appeal to both girl-group neophytes and acolytes.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the most common subject matter on a set of girl-group songs is boys-- boys who lie and cheat, boys who drive a wedge between girls and their parents or friends, boys who feed off of dependency and low self-esteem, boys who trick girls into thinking it's love when it's lust. As the title implies, one kiss leads to two, two kisses can lead to three, and eventually it can lead to doing more than a good girl should. On <i>One Kiss</i>, it can also lead to rationalizing distress (the uncommon diet advice on the Fabulettes' ""Try the Worryin' Way""), long-lasting emotional scars (P.P. Arnold's ""The First Cut Is the Deepest""), becoming trapped in cycles of emotional abuse and dependency (Lesley Gore's ""What Am I Gonna Do With You?"", on which she guesses ""I'm just the girl you stay with/ To see what you can get away with""), and heartache (the Flirtations' Northern soul classic ""Nothing But a Heartache"", among many others). At its most extreme, one kiss can also lead to unwanted pregnancy (the Lovelites' ""How Can I Tell My Mom and Dad?"") and even murderous jealousy (the Whyte Boots' vicious girlfight in ""Nightmare"").</p>
<p>Crushes entail risk, like an emotional choose your own adventure, but risks can also pay off, and it's that belief that colors many of the tracks. The heartache of the set's most melodramatic tracks is balanced by happy endings, improbably joyous and exuberant music, and the power of self-actualization and empowerment. It sounds quaint today, but a teenage girl building an identity, making her own choices, and gaining measures of self-respect were still largely new ideas in the 1960s. The protagonists here might make a lot of wrong decisions-- from the Shangri-La's lamenting their bad boy gone good in ""Out in the Streets"" to Evie Sands offering herself mind, soul, but mostly body on ""Take Me For a Little While""-- but simply having the opportunity to voice their thoughts or follow their hearts and minds are things their mothers couldn't sometimes do. This spirit is reflected in songs like the Chiffons' psych-tinged anthem ""Nobody Knows What's Going On (In My Mind But Me)"", the pent-up struggle between lust and loyalty in Elle Greenwich's ""You Don't Know"", Twinkle's death ballad ""Terry"", the What Four's sex-as-a-weapon track ""I'm Gonna Destroy That Boy"", and Wanda Jackson's sexually charged ""Funnel of Love"", each of which are revolutionary in their own quiet way.</p>
<p>In the past 40 years the music featured on <i>One Kiss</i> has served as a touchstone for a wide variety of artists, most notably 1970s New Yorkers (the Ramones, Bruce Springsteen, New York Dolls, Blondie, Martin Scorsese), 1980s Brits (the Smiths, Jesus &amp; Mary Chain, the Field Mice, the Cocteau Twins), and contemporary indie stars (Saint Etienne, Magnetic Fields, the Avalanches, the Concretes). We've even enjoyed a lengthy post-Spice Girls/Aaliyah resurgence of girl-group music via hip-hop/R&amp;B, dance- and electro-pop, teen pop vets, and UK chart acts such as Girls Aloud and Sugababes.</p>
<p>One of the saddest quirks of rock criticism is that the hopes, dreams, and fears of teen girls are frequently considered frolicsome fluff while the rage and defiance of teen boys is miscast as the articulation of free thinkers. And yet, it's the girls-- in part, because they're more likely to function as mouthpieces for adult songwriters-- who examine universal subjects such as love, romance, self-actualization, self-confidence, and personal politics, while young rock bands often simply reject growing up, fight responsibility, and wear that struggle as a badge of pride. Both approaches can work, of course, but unlike a sneer, a kiss never goes out of style.</p></div>"|1973.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1973-one-kiss-can-lead-to-another/|9.8|Scott Plagenhoef

At the song's 0:37 mark, though, the strings swell, becoming fuller and more detailed, as if a black-and-white film has suddenly erupted into Technicolor brilliance. This moment, which is the first of many unexpected sonic hooks on the album, not only sets the tone for the dozen songs that follow, but also reintroduces Pinetop Seven after a five-year absence, serving as a tangible transition from 2000's subterranean-dark <em>Bringing Home the Last Great Strike</em> to the more varied sound of <em>The Night's Bloom</em>. In that half-decade interim, the band has grown from being Darren Richard's more-or-less solo project into a collaborative ensemble that has cut its teeth on small tours and ambitious new scores for old silent films like <em>The Wind</em> and <em>Laugh, Clown, Laugh</em>. Those exercises have proved instructive: <em>The Night's Bloom</em> should place the band alongside Iron &amp; Wine and Calexico as the best of bewildering and beautiful Americana.</p><p>
    
    As if to live up to the sonic possibilities of the word ""bloom,"" the album is much more ornate than previous efforts: songs are dense with instruments, which intermingle in surprising ways. On ""Easy Company"", Nate Walcott's muted trumpet and Richard's vibraphone slink around Mack Hagood's piercing slide guitar and Andy Rader's circling bassline, and the effect is eerily noir, bubbling with tension and possibility. Snapshot-size fanfares herald ""Born Among the Born Again"" and ""A Mouthful of Expensive Teeth"", echoed in Richard's iridescent backing vocals. Melissa Bach's string arrangements-- played by members of the Chicago-based Quartet Parapluie-- add to the widescreen scope of ""Witness"" and the private heartbreak of the mournful ""Made a Whisper Out of Me"". This arsenal of instruments permits more intricacy and versatility in the arrangements, which in turn bolster Richard's vocal melodies and expands the songs' emotions into a full spectrum of grief, anger, desire, disdain, and horror.</p><p>
    
    Still, despite the collaborative dynamic on <em>The Night's Bloom</em> (most of the string and horn arrangements are credited to cellist Bach and/or trumpet player Walcott), Pinetop Seven still feels like Richard's brainchild, with the music scoring soundtracks for the short films in his head. Setting his story-songs in the region Ray Bradbury once described as ""the October Country"" (""that country where it is always turning late in the year, that country whose people are always autumn people, thinking autumn thoughts""), Richard proves a confident storyteller who fully inhabits his hard-luck characters and knows precisely which details to disclose and which to withhold. His voice soars, but it does so solemnly, resonating with the intensity of a projector's arc light as he relates these black comedies of humiliation that evoke the tragedy of being someone else's fool. ""June"" (a cousin of ""A Black Eye to Be Proud of"" from <em>Bringing Home the Last Great Strike</em>) follows a couple on a fateful trek into the woods: I ""won't tell you what we did,"" the narrator says, ""don't know the word for it."" But he has ominously ulterior motives: ""They'll never look at me again that way."" Sung in the voice of a love-starved outsider who just wants to show a sympathetic woman ""what I'm capable of,"" ""A Page From the Desert"" is a murder ballad without the murder, and ""Witness"", with pop-song dee-dee-dee's illuminating its chorus, relates a story of petty revenge that builds to an ending worthy of Flannery O'Connor. </p><p>
    
    Distinguishing between the band's music and Richard's lyrics, however, seems largely beside the point. As with any good soundtrack, <em>The Night's Bloom</em> derives its power from the interaction between sound and story-- how the racing-heart conclusion of ""His Aging Miss Idaho"" embodies the precarious intensity of love; how the quiet strings and unsteady vocals reinforce the intimacy of ""Made a Whisper Out of Me""; how the descending guitar triplets on ""Fringe"" mirror the whistled theme of ""A Page from the Desert"". All the elements intermingle with one another to put bloom on the night, and the result is perhaps the most evocative and sweeping realization yet of Pinetop Seven's particularly cinematic aesthetic.</p></div>"|6306.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6306-the-nights-bloom/|8.4|Stephen M.

    albums on Southern Lord and Load plus a remix 12"" and a live CD and DVD. The NYC quartet's
    third and best full-length, <em>Capture &amp; Release</em>, generally picks up
    where others left off, but in an extended, grimier fashion,
    pairing the 18-minute ""Capture"" with the 25-minute ""Release"". It's like a
    doom-metal opera; the Melvins possessed by Die
    Kreuzen.</p><p>
<em>Capture &amp; Release</em>'s most immediate hook is Alan Dubin's bewitched
    growl. On stage, the vocalist crouches and grips his microphone like a
    weapon (arms extended), face hidden behind his long hair. On record, filtered through headphones, he
    pounces and gnarls with taunts and warnings and disses--
    ""You are blood/ Nothing more,"" etc.</p><p>
    
    Dubin's backed by the guitar of Stephen O'Malley (Sunn 0))), Lotus Eaters), the
    bass and synthesized laptop effects (wind, gurgles) of James Plotkin
    (ex-Atomsmasher), and the heavily glacial Codeine drums of Tim
    Wyskida, who whacks toms as though willing arms to unhinge. The
    conductor, Wyskida's cymbal crashes function as dissolves into Dubin's
    next monologue; on stage, all the players watch him, and when they
    land at the same time, the room literally shakes.</p><p>
    
    Because Dubin chants his libretto with vocal effects, it can be easy to
    misunderstand him. He opens ""Capture"" by shouting ""Who says I can't
    have?,"" but for a long time, I swore he was nodding to AC/DC and screaming ""Hell's Bells.""
    Which is better? Getting the lyrics right adds to the experience, but
    Dubin's scowl is so ominous you don't need to grasp each syllable to generate chills.
    The main storyline seems to be luring someone into a basement,
    strapping and tying them to something, and repeatedly letting them
    know that ""this is my house"" and they're ""one step closer to nowhere.""
    Moments where the drums pickup a bit (well, it's the speed of a
    log-jam) and the bass/guitar/vocals/and atmospheres collide in mid air
    that'll make just about anyone commence half-speed headbanging.</p><p>
    
    ""Release"" opens with three minutes of dank dungeon atmospherics
    during which Dubin whispers, ""I've got a bone to pick/ Maybe it's
    yours."" Here death is the sole escape, so when Dubin continues ""I won't
    let go"" over cymbal sheer and clean guitar strums, he's promising an eternity of torture. For the final
    movement of the album, hell breaks loose: More guitar
    distortion, incrementally faster drums, choirs of feedback, chomping
    synth noise. Live, this is when Dubin pumps his fist in the air and
    the audience pisses their pants.</p><p>
    
    A few nights ago I tried explaining Khanate to a friend, who said she
    didn't really get ""experimental metal"" or the way certain bands test their
    audience. I disagreed with the idea that Khanate (or other bands) are
    testing. Dubin and company aren't aiming for easiness, but they
    offer patient listeners the chance to burrow into a seductive cocoon,
    into a sound as chilling and ominous as a pool of black icebergs.
    After a healthy brainstorm-- the Cure and Current 93's ouevres included-- I can't think of a three-minute pop song
    offering a similiar effect.</p></div>"|4568.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4568-capture-release/|7.7|Brandon Stosuy

The band relies on samples and sound bites to push its cause, weaving them into a dense fabric of instrumental post-rock that relishes the best aspects of the genre without falling into its all-too-predictable patterns. The songs are long and winding, but it's to their advantage, as they use the space and length to shift the mood and tone, bouncing at times through robotic rhythms, catchy melodies, and thick walls of guitar and bass. Now, more than two years later, From Monument to Masses returns with <em>Schools of Thought Contend</em>, which combines 13 collaborative interpretations and two new tracks to create a compelling companion to <em>The Impossible Leap</em>.</p><p>The two new tracks continue in the style the band established and developed over the course of its first two albums. ""Deafening"" opens the disc with soothing guitar chords, bells, and violin droning over a tight high-hat and snare-rim beat. As with many of their songs, though, by the five-minute mark, the tone has changed, trading in the lush arrangement for stop-and-start rhythms and distorted guitars. ""The Noise Thereafter"", the other new track, appears toward the tail end of the disc. It's a much more upbeat affair, with math-rock-esque guitar noodling and a quick, galloping beat. It's definitely one of the more fun tracks these guys have done, and hopefully it's an indication as to where they're headed.</p><p>The remixes are the bulk of the disc, and as with most remix albums, the successful tracks are the ones that take elements of the original and breathe new life into them. ""The Quiet Before"" appeared originally as a short, dreamy, bass-driven track with as much cymbal crashing going on as an actual beat. The Thunderbirds Are Now! remix, however, transforms it into a skittering dance tune, with cut-up snares and cymbals and high-pitched computer blippery for the first half, and lullaby-style bells and keys on the backstretch. The second remix of the track, done by Subtitle, skews and detunes the guitar, pushes the bass to the front, and uses it all as the backdrop for the MC's layered rapping. A third and final version, remixed by Amundsen, closes the album. This version strips even more from the original, turning it into a somber acoustic guitar and accordion piece, with the percussion reduced to spikes of static.</p>
<p>""From the Mountains to the Prairies"" appears here in two radically different forms. The first, the Norr Liva &amp; AM remix, mutates the driving original into a haunting post-rock epic that's at times sparse and atmospheric, at times bombastic and intense. The Textual remix takes tiny bits of the original, such as single-note guitar strumming, and layers it with 808 drum machine beats and warbling bass, in essence transforming the song from rock to laptop IDM.</p>
<p>For the most part, the more bold the choice made by the artist remixing the track, the more successful the result. Automato remixes ""The Spice Must Flow"" into dance floor dub in the same zip code as ""Funkytown"". Both versions of ""To Z (Repeat)""-- one each by 65daysofstatic and Last Defender of the One True Waveform-- push the levels into the red, upping the intensity right along with the mixing-board faders. But several tracks suffer from simply not having enough going on: Jason Clark's remix of ""Sharpshooter"" is too empty at times, and too similar to the original at others. Likewise, Antimc turns ""Old Robes"" into generic drum and bass while retaining little from the original.</p>
<p>Even if it isn't enough to stand on its own, <em>Schools of Thought Contend</em> has a ton of strong, interesting, and exciting material. Its biggest drawback is the length. At 15 tracks, it's just too bloated, especially considering the source album only had seven. As a companion piece to its predecessor, <em>Schools</em> works, but without that support, it will probably find trouble standing on its own.</p></div>"|3351.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3351-schools-of-thought-contend/|6.4|Cory D.

    great one of the 21st century.  And, since hits records are, after the single, the ultimate pop form, <i>#1's</i>
    should have no difficultly proving that status.  Instead, it has the odd knock-on effect of suggesting that
    their legacy may be based on a smaller body of work than imagined.  They were smart enough not to arrange this
    compilation chronologically, but since that's still the best way to tell most bands' stories, we'll start this
    review at the beginning.</p><p>
<b><em>Destiny's Child</em><br/>
<i>#1's contains only one track from Destiny's Child's little-heard debut.  Little
    heard because it could be the work of any freshly scrubbed African-American teenagers
    from the mid-90s.  Except this was the late-90s and, you know, Timbaland and all that.
    Weirdly, it was Wyclef Jean who unleashed the beast, adding punchy drums straight off
    Boogie Down Productions' </i><i>Criminal Minded on his remix of ""No, No, No (Part 2)"".
    The group finally had a beat that properly funneled their bottomless well of scalding
    sass.</i></b></p><p>
<b><em>The Writing's on the Wall</em><br/>
    Radio r&amp;b; had already been popping for a good three years before DC took out
    a mortgage on the Billboard Top 40 in 1999, but they quickly became the
    platonic ideal, the space-age girl group of our national longings. Men are
    scrubs, cheaters, and liars, and Beyoncé, Kelly, Michelle, and the other one
    were avenging angels in pastel rooms with awesome furniture and better hair.
    Sure, it's a little redolent of that endless summer of the internet bubble
    economy at this point, but these days a little late-Clinton-era nostalgia
    hurts no one.</b></p><p>
    The beats, produced largely by Rodney Jerkins and Kevin ""She'kspere"" Briggs,
    are tsunamis of sparkling harpsichords, trilling xylophones, 8-bit rave riffs,
    lite-brite guitars, diamondique synth spritz, and sashaying hi-hats.  When
    people whine about how those similar horn o' plenty alchemists in Basement
    Jaxx stiffed in America, well, we already had Destiny's Child-- with all the
    jam-packed funny noises, an undeniable song on top, and gorgeous girls in
    astronaut fabrics in the videos.  Destiny's Child made the best pop-R&amp;B;
    of the modern era.  Period.  But of course, that's no secret: These were,
    after all, world-conquering hits.</p><p>
<b><em>Survivor</em><br/>
    So like any teen Glamazon who just shifted five million records, Beyoncé
    Knowles wanted to assert that she wasn't just two Christmas hams stuffed
    into a pair of jeans. Which isn't something to hate on, except that she
    generally made better music as a producer's puppet. Suddenly, the <i>whole
    world was full of scrubs she must excoriate in song while taking care not
    to diss them on the internet, proceeding to sell a billion more records.
    Which proves that though she's got an ego the size of the Astrodome, she's
    no fool.</i></b></p><p>
    You would think that some bright spark in the studio could have wiped
    ""Independent Women Part 1"" clean of the ""Charlie's Angels"" quotes.  Prince's
    ""Batdance"" was a hit but it's not on <i>The Hits, if you get me.  I
    guess that wouldn't do anything to make the beat less functional and more
    exciting.  ""Bootylicious"" and its disco throb are better than I remembered
    by half, and their cover of ""Emotion"" proves B's got genuine talent for
    vocal arrangements. If that sounds like damning with faint praise, it is.</i></p><p>
<b><em>Destiny's Fufilled</em><br/>
    So they broke up. Or ""went on hiatus."" Beyoncé went on to release a solo
    album with three major hits that everyone knows. Kelly went on to release a
    solo album with a few singles that no one knows. Michelle went back into
    cryogenic storage. When <i>Destiny's Fulfilled suddenly burst onto the
    charts in the fourth quarter of last year-- front-loaded with the two most
    exciting tracks, not coincidentally the first two singles-- it should have
    been a sign.</i></b></p><p>
    ""Lose My Breath"" was a Rodney Jerkins drumline symphony of stabs, stilettos,
    and that weird mink stole B sported in the video. ""Soldier"" featured Rich ""1
    Thing"" Harrison doing his best recession-era southern rap impression, with
    former Xtian good girls making double-barreled cock/firearm puns. The rest
    of the album oozed essential oils and upscale r&amp;b; respectability. ""Girl"" was
    a stroll over a 9th Wonder-produced Dramatics sample through bros-before-hoes
    territory as latte frothy as its ""Sex &amp; the City"" video. And then there
    was ""Cater 2 U"", which reneged on everything early DC stood for in a parade
    of kept-wifey pleas, lemme wipe your ass for you, cough, hack, splutter,
    barf.</p><p>
<b>New/Bonus Tracks</b></p><p>
    Opener ""Stand Up for Love"" is subtitled the ""2005 World Children's Day
    Anthem"", which should tell you all you really need to know, i.e. Diane
    Warren should be banned under the Geneva Conventions. ""Check on It"" features
    Slim Thug and a sing-songy Swiz beat and should become a minor hit when
    cross-marketing with the new ""Pink Panther"" movie begins in earnest.  Closer
    ""Feel the Same Way I Do"" sounds like an outtake from Mariah Carey's
    <i>Emancipation</i>, and ends with Beyoncé dumping her man-- kind of a
    bummer note to go out on.  Plus, Michelle now sounds like Eartha Kitt
    after a few whippets and it's really annoying.</p><p>
<b>Final Verdict<br/>
    In the MP3 age, you can take <i>#1's as pure product and not feel wrong
    for doing so.  (They're not thanking McDonald's and Pepsi in the liner notes
    out of the goodness of their hearts.)  At eight awesome, three godawful, and
    five middling songs, it's clearly not worth 20 clams.  So compile your own
    DC best-of online.  Or just go buy </i><i>The Writing's on the Wall, available
    for less than 12 bucks at any of our nation's finer discount department stores.

Then came ProTools and Ableton-enabled mixes, in which segues aren't done with vinyl in real-time, but rather Tetrised into shape in the studio. You'd think that development-- which I'm not about to denigrate, even if software mixes lose the on-the-fly urgency of a real-time session-- meant that more effort would be devoted to track selection, but oddly, exactly the opposite seems to have happened. The vast majority of house and techno mix CDs these days are club-friendly equivalents of <i>Now That's What I Call Music!, gathering the big hits of the prior 18 months. You could probably create a techno parlor game called Six Degrees of Superpitcher, judging by the number of recent mixes that prominently feature the Kompakt wunderkind's tracks.</i></p><p>
    
    In other words, judging a mix CD is harder than it seems, especially in a day when skillz are optional. Not to be too meta, but the mix CD is essentially a meta affair, a compilation that transcends the sum of its parts through some nameless other that hovers over the proceedings, call it what you like: coherence, flow, artistry.</p><p>
    
    Going by these criteria, Dominik Eulberg sets himself a few critical hurdles with his first official mix CD-- a doublepack released on his own Mischwald label. I'm guessing that <i>Kreucht &amp; Fleucht was mixed digitally, based on the precision of each seamless transition. (If it wasn't, this guy is a freaking mixing <em>machine</em>). It also leans heavily on 2005's underground-to-middleground techno hits, caned-to-death (and occasionally comped-to-death) cuts like John Tejada's ""Paranoia"", Andre Kraml's ""Safari"", and Nathan Fake's ""Dinamo"". Suffice to say that eclecticism isn't Eulberg's priority; </i><i>Kreucht &amp; Fleucht is a decidedly internal affair, a guide to the Now Sound of clattery, post-minimalist German techno.</i></p><p>
    
    Well, so be it, because the selection is impeccable. Tunes like ""Dinamo"" are ubiquitous for a reason: They fucking work on the dance floor. And Eulberg's ear-- he's also one of this scene's most in-demand remixers-- finds hidden themes that run through both discs like underground streams, weaving together atonal clanks, sawtooth leads, 8-bit stutter, and grand, epic melodies until you have no idea where one track ends and the other begins.</p><p>
<i>Kreucht, which means something like ""Creeping,"" is the darker of the two discs, given over to the psychedelic end of minimal techno. Tracks from Luciano, Ricardo Villalobos (in a 2002 appearance as Termiten, one of the album's true surprises), A. Vivanico, and Guido Schneider (remixing Dub Kult) are peppered with chirps and twitters and all kinds of bug funk. Gothic-leaning anthems-- Triola's ""Leuchtturm (Wighnomy's Polarzipper Rexmi)"", Michael Mayer's ""Lovefood (Matias Aguayo Mix)""-- crest like bobbing forest canopy above the pitter-patter below. Voices are carried aloft on winds of reverb. When not hunched over his computer, Eulberg is a naturalist, and judging by </i><i>Kreucht, his woods aren't just wild, they're haunted. </i></p><p>
    
    If you know that <i>Fleucht means ""Flying,"" you'll see where we're going on disc two. Starting with Eulberg's out-of-orbit remix of Steve Barnes' hypno-house instant classic ""Cosmic Sandwich"", and cruising through tracks like Metope's grinding, weightless ""Libertango"", James Holden's remix of ""Safari"", and Eulberg's mix of ""Dinamo"", </i><i>Fleucht is all nougat, whipped up and up. (You almost have to hand it to Eulberg for not including Closer Musik's ""1, 2, 3 No Gravity"", if only because it would have been <em>too</em> perfect a fit.) With Tonetraeger's ""Welcome Back, Kotter (Mayer-Thomas Remix)""-- another of the mix's great rediscoveries-- we come dangerously close to burning up on re-entry; those buzzing, frictive chords could strip the insulation off the sturdiest spaceship. But </i><i>Fleucht's last four tracks are pure, tranced-out bliss for people who think they hate trance, all chiming arpeggio, insistent ostinato, and hearts-beating-as-one kicks. </i></p><p>
    
    By the end, not even the most jaded listeners will care that the majority of these cuts are from 2005-- unless you're Ricardo Villalobos or Michael Mayer, you probably haven't heard them all anyway. And the <em>how</em> of the mix is a red herring, because the <em>why</em> leaps out at every pulse and stutter. An American-based friend praises it as a home-listening album, but expresses doubt as to how such a set would go over on a dance floor outside Germany. Does it even matter? Consider it a biodome, an ant farm, or a black forest of the mind; <em>Kreucht &amp; Fleucht</em> is its own microsystem, a lab slide that magnifies to lay bare the workings of the whole ecology of house and techno, if you listen right. Now that's what I call music indeed.</p></div>"|2937.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2937-kreucht-fleucht/|8.4|Philip Sherburne

    A slice of Central America's Caribbean coast smaller than Vermont, it's a
    former British colony that only gained its independence in 1981. But Belize
    has a vibrant, diverse, and well-mixed culture that whips together influences
    and people from across the Caribbean, as well as Europe and Africa. The
    traditional dish of the country is something of a metaphor for its population:
    It's called the ""boil up,"" and it essentially involves boiling whatever's on
    hand-- whole fish, plantains, pork bones, pig's tail, whatever-- together in
    one pot.</p><p>
    
    Taking things one step further, the boil up also serves nicely as a culinary
    analog to the country's musical output. Though it's a part of the mainland,
    Belize is essentially a Caribbean country, and its close ties to Jamaica and
    Trinidad &amp; Tobago are apparent on even a cursory listen to the limited recorded
    output of the local and ex-pat Belizean musical community.  And of course,
    like any Anglophone country, Belize was hit by the soul and funk sounds of
    the U.S. in the 1960s and 70s. The exuberant embrace of all of these influences
    is excellently chronicled on <em>Belize City Boil Up</em>, the latest from Numero
    Group and the inaugural release in what figures to be a series of similarly
    themed Numero compilations called <em>Cult Cargo</em>.</p><p>
    
    The bulk of the music on the disc was actually recorded outside of Belize,
    either by bands formed in the Belizean communities scattered in large
    American cities, or by Belizean groups touring abroad in Brooklyn and
    Jamaica. Compton Fairweather's CES label, originally founded as an
    electronic security system installation company, served as the official
    curator of the country's music, releasing nearly everything in the United
    States.  Unfortunately, not many people outside of Belize were listening,
    and the music has languished in obscurity.</p><p>
    
    This set of 16 scraped-together tracks has an aura of the impossible
    about it. How could this music possibly have existed for so long without
    being heard by anyone other than a handful of absurdly dedicated
    crate-diggers? Lord Rhaburn's ""Disco Connection"" is outlandishly danceable,
    a white dwarf of precision instrumental funk with incredibly sophisticated
    production that hints at dub, as well as some genres not yet invented at the
    time of its recording, like house.  The reverb on the saxes is majestic, and
    the bassline has an indescribable humidity to it, burning front-and-center
    in the mix. Rhaburn was a towering figure in Belizean music and one of its
    most prolific recorders. His other three songs here run the gamut from roots
    reggae to deep soul and strutting surf rock with a funky Muscle Shoals
    undercarriage.</p><p>
    
    Also clocking in with four tracks are the Professionals, led by Jesus
    Acosta, who first appear as a hardcore calypso band with a wonderful take
    on the traditional ""Guajida"" (also known as ""Guarija""), opening it with a
    bright, rugged sax melody that oozes sexuality. They flirt with psychedelia
    on ""A Part of Being With You"", morph the O'Jays' ""Backstabbers"" into
    horn-drenched reggae, and reinvent the theme from <i>The Godfather as
    a spooky breakbeat masterpiece.  The Web were actually based in Brooklyn,
    and their ""Things Are Going to Work Out Right"" is one of the most impressive
    songs in this boil up, beginning as a bluesy soul ballad slathered in
    Philly-smooth horns, only to explode midway through into a raucous funk
    workout stuffed with staccato horns, chicken-scratch guitar, and wailing
    Hammond organ.</i></p><p>
    
    The other three artists whose songs have been resurrected by this comp were
    sadly less prolific but no less remarkable in their skill. Most of these
    bands played thousands of shows and recorded only when they had the rare
    opportunity, and their discipline is readily apparently on the precious
    vinyl they did manage to produce. The Soul Creations offer a two-part funk
    instrumental called ""Funky Jive"", which is easily on par with anything the
    Propositions and other similar America funk acts of the era were turning
    out. The Harmonettes give up a smoking rocksteady take on Johnny Nash's
    ""Can't Go Halfway"", then outdo themselves by transforming Shirley &amp; Co.'s
    slick disco smash ""Shame, Shame, Shame"" into a nasty, ragged funk song. The
    set is rounded out by an oddball song from Nadia Cattouse, a Belizean living
    in London: ""Long Time Boy"" is exotica pop full of whistling flute and
    wandering guitar that feels totally out of time and place. It could have
    come from anywhere, any time, perhaps even outer space.</p><p>
<i>Boil Up is possibly the most solid release to date from Numero Group,
    which is by this point one of the best and most thoughtful reissue labels in the
    country.  If you like funk-- and especially if you feel you've already largely
    mined American r&amp;b--; there's plenty to dig into here, and hopefully more where
    that came from.</i></p></div>"|2078.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2078-cult-cargo-belize-city-boil-up/|8.8|Joe Tangari

    meeting of past, present, and future must sound like heart-choked
    whispers, stuttering electronic beats, and chopped orchestral
    do-do-dos. In other words, fifth proper full-length <em>The Past
    Presents the Future</em> is not much different from Her Space Holiday
    albums past-- and despite the promised future, the damn thing
    only plays in the present.</p><p>
    
    OK, so it's a little different. Along with his familiar first-person
    woe-is-mes, Bianchi lends his flat Oberstian vox and
    sample-stocked laptop to several third-person tales. That means ""The
    Weight of the World"" isn't about the narrator's attempted suicide, but
    that of a disillusioned religious woman (""Rip those black beads off
    your throat/ Swap 'em out for a knotted rope""). Elegantly string-encrusted ""You and Me"" casts Bianchi as a
    shoulder to cry on, wondering ""how can so much good exist in such a
    tiny heart?"" rather than starring in his own romantic tragedy. Then
    there's ""A Match Made in Texas"", about a
    gender-bending couple (""He likes wearing her clothes/ She likes
    watching him dress""). The apparent setting-- Texas, whoa!-- may help
    the song's flaccid politics, but can't save a monotonous melody.</p><p>
    
    On 2003's <em>The Young Machines</em>, stellar tracks like ""My
    Girlfriend's Boyfriend"" and ""Sleepy California"" made up for the rest.
    Here, unfortunately, the balance is reversed. Of Bianchi's missteps,
    the gravest are his efforts to harness catchy songs past for his
    present, ah, future. A bass line and ""1, 2, 3"" chorus straight from
    the Jackson 5 are boppily out of place on ""Missed Medicine"", with its
    bitter call to ""exploit our misery."" Then there's the all-time lamest Beatles reference
    in the history of lame Beatles references: ""Here comes your son/ Do,
    do, do, do/ Here comes your son/ He isn't all right,"" from ""The Great
    Parade"". And those songs are merely the obvious offenders.</p><p>
    
    Checking phone messages is a chore, but Bianchi makes us listen to his
    twice. A friend's spoken ""Marc, you're leaving"" opens the album-- and,
    duh, scares the shit out of me, 'cause I drink too many espressos. On
    ""A Small Setback to a Great Comeback"", high-pitched
    ambient drones accompany an increasingly pathetic woman's voice (""I
    wish you were here just to hold me,"" yuck, cooties!). By the
    predictable acoustic finale, Bianchi wants to hold his family, too.
    Aww. ""Regret is like a bill unpaid/ It controls your every move,"" he
    adds, but I don't know what that means. My unpaid bills just pile up,
    silently cursing their puppeteering ineptitude.</p><p>
    
    Bianchi's not much for such subtleties, emotional or rhetorical, which
    may suggest he'll have as much lovelorn electro-symphonic melodrama to
    recount on future albums as on those past and present-- unless of
    course time is just an illusion, in which case at least you haven't
    wasted any.</p></div>"|3828.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3828-the-past-presents-the-future/|4.7|Marc Hogan

What Annie's made clear with her entry into the <em>DJ-Kicks</em> series is it ain't difficult to see where <em>Anniemal</em> came from or what she's all about. The punk-funk savants ESG (""My Love For You"") anticipate the story behind ""The Greatest Hit"", Annie singing over her producer boyfriend's Madonna loop for kicks and ending up with a career in in(die)ternational pop. Adams/Carmichael disco (Bumble Bee Unlimited's ""Lady Bug"") nails her high camp chic, while the Mu inclusion (""Paris Hilton"") hints she feels more akin to mutant pop than her vocal similarities to Kylie or Rachel might suggest. And despite her barefaced pop-for-rockers plan for world domination (cf. Braxe and Falke's filter remix of the mini-metal outfit Death From Above 1979's ""Black History Month""), Annie doesn't forget she's from the small town of Bergen, Norway, and she generously reps her home on this mix too (electro-pop Toy and fey disco-pop Datarock begin and end the mix respectively). One disc, the influence game is out, so too any doubts re: Annie's big-eared, wide-eyed listening habits.</p><p>  Now granted, over the years the mirror has ruined a few. So Annie's own contributions take on increased significance, existing partly just because, partly for the posture of non-posturing, but entirely as proof that her conscious penchant for the off-kilter hasn't strangled her sound. ""Wedding"" may come off a bit high-low: Röyksopp's uncharacteristically sinister bubble plop electric production grinds harsh against a song whose chorus is ""Will you marry me?"" followed by ""I do, I do, I do."" But Annie's better than that. Her verb tense fuck-up (should be ""I will"") effectively timewarps past fiancehood and flower arrangements and all those stupid fucking pre-Cana meetings, straight to the vow-- funny, if you play along.</p><p>  Same thing with the Timo Kaukolampi-produced ""Gimme Your Money"", a Cristina-meets-Madonna needy-girl song that tellingly comes between ""Lady Bug"" (""Just let me be your lady bug"") and Bow Wow Wow's ""I Want Candy"" (""I want candy""). Annie knows where she fits into these traditions, but even more, she still finds room to install local character. Her vocal contribution to Norwegian producer Brundtland and Therson's debut ""Geared Up"" tackles that cold, lonely ""Poor Leno"" pop sound, while Kaukolampi's Motivii Tuntematon's ""1939"" plays like a Vitalic track at half speed-- perhaps the start of this country's own brand of swisha-""house"".</p><p>  Like Kompakt's Michael Mayer said about his Fabric mix, Annie clearly loves her tracks more than the art of loving her tracks. Mixing is merely functional, tracks play long. There is one blatant and unforgivable fuck-up though: Datarock's crosseyed chicken-scratch disco closer ""Fa-Fa-Fa"" is buried three minutes into the last track because of a cueing error with the Mu track before, which will disorient people not familiar with the songs.</p><p>  Regardless, the mistake feeds into the mix's biggest appeal, its amateurism. Annie's has more of a friend-to-friend feel than any other <em>Kicks</em> entry, the kind of mix with messages to be decoded, biography to be considered. Can't say the same for most DJ mixes, really, and definitely not for artist full-lengths. Whether in character or inadvertently, Annie invites weirdly personal reactions, as anyone she's pointed at in concert can tell you. <em>Anniemal</em> was the first date, and now she's making us mixes. Oh, she wants to be my lady bug-- well that's just great.</p><p> </p></div>"|457.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/457-dj-kicks/|7.5|Nick Sylvester

Then a round of layoffs saved Rogue like a last-minute call from the governor and he beat a retreat to New York to see what he could accomplish on his own.  Clutching a sheaf of the delicately odd pop songs he'd written but had no outlet for in Desoto Reds, he holed up in the studio with his friend Bill Racine and together the two began spontaneously cranking out the tracks that would become <em>Out of the Shadow</em>, an album that would earn Rogue Wave a Sub Pop deal-- and an endless parade of Shins comparisons.  The spirit of adventure and freedom that accompanied Rogue's life-change was apparent in the record, which featured wispy, spectral tunes, somewhere between Simon &amp; Garfunkel and Yo La Tengo, embroidered with intricate details.</p><p>
    
    Rogue assembled a band to take the songs on the road, and this quartet-- which includes Gram LeBron, Pat Spurgeon, and Evan Farrell-- is collectively responsible for Rogue Wave's sophomore outing, <em>Descended Like Vultures</em>. As such, it's reasonable to expect a record very different from the debut, which was penned entirely by Rogue. The first single from the new album, ""10:1"", confirms a sea change: Where the atmospheric debut laced cloudy melodies with quiet traces of heat lightning, ""10:1"" is a crashing thunderbolt. The thin, melodic contour lines that primarily structured <em>Out of the Shadow</em> become barely discernible underpinnings on this track, subsumed in raucously cartwheeling synths and returning producer Bill Racine's bracing guitar manipulation. The only vestige of the old Rogue Wave is Rogue's voice.</p><p>
    
    Has the band that relied on off-kilter charm forsaken their chilly moderation for heat-seeking rock?  You know, sort-of-ish: ""10:1"" is a bit of a red herring. The main difference between the two albums has more to do with volume than style. The production now has more depth, and you're more likely to hear subtle (or not-so-subtle, in the case of ""10:1"") filters on the vocals. <em>Out of the Shadow</em> seemed to emanate from very far away, but <em>Descended Like Vultures</em> is more visceral and immediate, although the loud tracks are largely tempered and controlled. Once the disappointment that it's not a Leonard Cohen cover fades, the album's opening track, ""Bird on a Wire"", is a charming introduction to the louder side of Rogue Wave: Crisp drum rolls and strident bleats buffet the melody toward an outsized, lighter-waving chorus. The driving mid-tempo guitars that open ""Publish My Love"" are contrasted with an acoustic arpeggio that would've been the song's stopping point on the first album. The excellent ""Love's Lost Guarantee"" profits from the same contrast, revealing a surprising but totally sensible Death Cab for Cutie affinity as it alternates darkly twinkling passages with romantically crashing choruses. </p><p>
    
    Other tracks expand upon the gauzy, pensive aura of <em>Out of the Shadow</em> instead of revising it. A lively yet gentle strum and Rogue's weightless vocal melody comprise ""California""; a low wash of strings colors the back end, and in its simple transparency it's one of the album's most memorable songs. ""Temporary"" should come included with stool and capo, with its murky chord progression and mumbled, depressive vocals. In the end, it's hard to decide if <em>Descended Like Vultures</em> is better or worse than Rogue Wave's debut. Differences that seem major turn out, upon close inspection, to be cosmetic, and if the extra padding relieves the songs of some of their signature inertia, the parts that stick in your head-- Rogue's lilting, saccharine melodies-- remain unchanged.  Rather than evolving linearly, Rogue Wave are building upwards, piling masonry onto a foundation of solid songwriting that, with any luck, will remain as perceptible and essential on Rogue Wave's 10th album as it is on their second. </p></div>"|6920.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6920-descended-like-vultures/|7.8|Brian Howe

Absent here are the sophisticated vocal harmonies of the Joggers debut, <em>Solid Guild</em>, replaced with even more copious amounts of guitar. I know-- guitars in indie rock, not really a revelation. But it's where the guitars go that matters: abrasive, thin-toned strings crawl into unexpected places, doubling and echoing each other, racing up and down unusual scales and squealing like spoiled babies. They ape Eastern tones on opener ""Ziggurat Traffic"" and fake the funk on ""Wicked Light Sleeper""; an extraneous screech becomes the foundation to the chorus of ""Since You're Already Up"", and a nervous atonal shuffle turns majestic on ""White Madam"". If there's an open chord anywhere on the album, I can't find it.</p><p>To that end, the album is similar to this year's Broken Social Scene record-- both are the works of guitar-driven pop bands that still seem embarrassed of the limelight, with BSS hiding their hooks behind inscrutable production and Joggers weaving through convoluted compositions. But where <em>Broken Social Scene</em> was messy and potentially self-sabotaging, Joggers have the instinct to know when to let go. Just behind these jittery hi-hats and spidery riffs are dizzy sing-along hooks that burst through almost too quickly, as if the band couldn't stand to hold them back any longer. ""Ziggurat Traffic"" sounds like field-recorded Eastern strings over a heartbeat rhythm before erupting into sloppy, ambitious guitar-rock-- all unexpected rhythm breaks, frenetic drum fills, and layered counter-melodies. The band routinely moves through unwieldy compositions, but there's always a payoff for the listener.</p><p>  Ben Whitesides' slurred, nonchalant vocals are part of what makes <em>Cape and a Cane</em> sound so self-conscious and occasionally generic, but the big choruses beg for drunken sing-alongs, and his delivery is perfect for the slow-tempo ""Night of the Horsepills"". ""Wicked Light Sleeper"" gives the first inclination the band can write songs and not just jams, and-- while <em>Cape and a Cane</em> is consistent from top to bottom-- it opens the record's best moments: ""Era Prison"", with tension-building sing-spoken verses and an endearingly sloppy chorus, and the frantic rhythms and breathless chorus of ""Since You're Already Up"".</p><p> Consistency is one of the band's biggest virtues here, but it's their grip on resistance and release that anchors the album, with hints of ambition poking out from beneath its slacker skin. From the Eastern tones on the opening and closing tracks to the dance influences on ""Era Prison"" and ""White Madam"", the Joggers fix their eyes on somewhere farther than your local dive venue without sacrificing their own unkempt charm. If there's a complaint, it's that they ditched one unique sound (the group harmonies of <em>Solid Guild</em>) and only met new ones halfway. But give the Joggers time to hone things further-- <em>With a Cape and a Cane</em> will still be a dense, satisfying listen after they take their next big step.</p></div>"|8979.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8979-with-a-cape-and-a-cane/|8.3|Jason Crock

Pop artist Ed Ruscha painted the monochromatic portrait on the cover, and Rob Bowman contributes monographic liner notes, heavily excerpting his contributions from the 2000 reissues. As for the title, what other kind of history could there be? <em>A Musical History</em> proves much more definitive than any previous compilations, which typically start with the Band's first album; however, it's not the length of its tracklist, but the range, that counts. <em>A Musical History</em> begins with a one-disc prologue with tracks from The Band's previous incarnations-- Ronnie Hawkins and the Hawks, Levon and the Hawks, Bob Dylan's backing band, and Crackers.</p><p>
    
    The band that eventually became the Band paid their dues the old-fashioned way: they apprenticed themselves. It was Ronnie Hawkins who really taught them to ""play fuckin' loud,"" a tactic that honed their killer chops and barnstorming showmanship. Under Dylan's tutelage during his first electric tour they learned that their songs were not restricted by any particular structure, running time, or tradition and so could be whatever The Band wanted them to be. So listening to this first disc is like reading an accomplished writer's very first short stories: These songs reveal a hesitant, undeveloped voice that's not quite certain yet what's possible or permissible, but the music is cast in sharp relief by our knowledge of future accomplishments. Despite the inclusion of unreleased tracks uncovered in DJ/producer Duff Roman's basement (like the instrumental ""Bacon Fat"" and the caustic ""Leave Me Alone""), this is a slow, albeit valuable, chapter in the Band's history, peppered with some admittedly fiery numbers. ""Who Do You Love"" sounds like Hawkins is stirring up a riot and his band is trying to muffle it. And the live cuts of Dylan's ""Tell Me, Momma"" and ""Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues"" have a rough, obstinate grandeur that deflected all the boos the folk-purist audiences hurled at them.</p><p>
    
    Both Hawkins and Dylan were outsized personas who dominated the stage and often obscured the five musicians behind them. When they finally formed the Band, Danko, Helm, Hudson, Manuel, and Robertson opted for something a little more democratic (or like communism, as Helm remarks in his autobiography). The key to the Band was that no voice or instrument dominated, but still, everyone was doing something very interesting all the time. There are three distinct vocalists on <em>Music From Big Pink</em> and <em>The Band</em>, and everyone except Robertson trades out instruments. The result is a pair of albums that still sound simultaneously experimental and traditional, irreverent and respectful. <em>Music From Big Pink</em> is included on <em>A Musical History</em> in its entirety-- anything less would be a travesty-- but with the previously unavailable full-length version of ""To Kingdom Come"" (which leaves Hudson's organ solo intact) and an alternate take of ""Lonesome Suzie"". <i>The Band is represented by about two-thirds of its tracks, with live or alternate versions of the remaining third. </i></p><p>
    
    It's no stretch to say this pair of albums marks the Band's peak-- blues, folk, jazz, rock, funk, soul, r&amp;b;, and country and western all synthesized into twin monuments to the American music they'd been playing for nearly a decade in clubs, roadhouses, and honkytonks with Hawkins and in stadiums and basements with Dylan. Their early apprenticeships had given them everything they needed to make these albums, but failed to teach them how to deal with the ensuing money and success. It's all pretty much downhill from the final chords of ""King Harvest (Has Surely Come)"": The Band suffered in the limelight, which shifted their communal work ethic from collaboration to isolation. Drugs, poor reviews, and intra-Band ego clashes ravaged the group, making <em>The Last Waltz</em> seem like a logical, if somewhat preemptive conclusion.</p><p>
    
    Still, despite some dips here and there (especially Robertson's awkward storytelling on ""The Moon Struck One""), the final two disks prove the quintet remained a powerful unit, able to sculpt intricate songs that rambled and grooved. Allen Toussaint's mind-boggling horn arrangements on <i>Cahoots and <em>Rock of Ages</em>-- the bulk of the fourth disc-- give songs like ""Life Is a Carnival"" and ""Don't Do It"" a hit of energy that enlivens the arrangements considerably. The <em>Moondog Matinee</em> covers are adventurous and irreverent: it takes temerity to add new verses to Little Junior Parker's Blue Flames' ""Mystery Train"", but the Band makes the new material sound like it actually belongs there. And Helm's enthusiastic vocals on Clarence ""Frogman"" Henry's ""Ain't Got No Home"" reveal a good humor and spiritedness that contrasts nicely with soberer songs like ""It Makes No Difference"".</i></p><p>
    
    The fifth disc includes ""Forever Young"", the only excerptable song from <em>Planet Waves</em>, along with two tracks from the Band's 1974 tour with Dylan: ""Rainy Day Women #12 &amp; 35"" is noteworthy for its goofy ad libs, while ""Highway 61 Revisited"" barrels along with righteous hot-rod abandon. After tracks from the underrated <em>Northern Lights--Southern Cross</em> and the odds-and-ends <em>Islands</em>, as well as a few outtakes and rarities (like Rick Danko's exquisitely homesick ""Home Cookin'""), the set closes with three tracks from <em>The Last Waltz</em>: ""Evangeline"" with Emmylou Harris, a majestic version of ""The Night They Drove Ol' Dixie Down"", and ""The Weight"" performed with the Staple Singers.</p><p>
    
    And that's where <em>A Musical History</em> concludes, venturing no further than 1978, despite the fact that four of the five members continued touring as the Band during the 1980s. There are no tracks from those lonely tours nor from any of the members' various solo projects. Furthermore, Bowman's notes end well before they can consider the three decades between <em>The Last Waltz</em> and <em>A Musical History</em>-- the deaths of Manuel and Danko, the Band's diminishing legacy, or even the long-awaited official release of Dylan's show at the Royal Albert Hall. So this set doesn't provide a complete history, but its abrupt cut-off point seems unavoidable, perhaps even natural: The Band was no more or less than those five men, who were united in their mission to make music not as pop culture, but as American culture.</p></div>"|1178.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1178-a-musical-history/|8.7|Stephen M.

Like his sometime collaborator Jamie Lidell (with whom he performs as Super_Collider), Vogel occupies a thoroughly modern field of expression, one that I'd have a hard time denying on artistic grounds even as it seems a world away from what usually passes for ""hip"". Even worse, unlike Lidell, he doesn't trespass into hip-hop or blue-eyed soul, so there's little chance you're going to hear him without seeking out his recordings. He can usually be found near the epicenter of wherever the most forward-looking techno is happening (Spain, at the moment), though that doesn't necessarily mean you'll hear his stuff in a lot of clubs. The guy taught modern classical music at the university level for crying out loud.</p><p>
    
    Fittingly, Vogel's music is individualist to a fault. Like spiritual kin Cluster, Mouse on Mars, Asmus Tietchens, or even fellow electro-provocateur Fennesz, he revels in moods that disturb, illuminating his ideas with the darkest shades possible, and yet is ultimately inclusive and alluring. His latest record, <em>Station 55</em>, features collaborations with several vocalists (including an ultra-cool Kevin Blechdom harmony arrangement on the album's single ""1968, Holes""), but sounds to me like a single-minded soundtrack of near-future Europe. Where previous albums like 1996's <em>Specific Momentific</em> or 1999's <em>Busca Invisibles were bizarre, techno-centric takes on experimental music, </em><em>Station 55</em> is less bump, more eerie propulsion. Much of the fat has been trimmed, in line with the same wave of minimalism that's fueled techno since its Detroit inception-- but especially recently via labels like Kompakt, Poker Flat, and Bpitch Control-- so rather than fill floors, I'd expect this stuff to spark conversation, introspection.</p><p>
    
    The lead track, ""Typewriter of the Dead"", makes no bones about its own lethargy, lurching out of the gate with murky organ and a slow, digital blues shuffle (in fact, when Jim Jarmusch does his sci-fi flick, he should run this over the opening credits). And then the fun starts: ""The Time Lock"", ""1968, Holes"", and ""On the Line"" comprise a no-frills suite of goth-cool good enough for the downest hipsters and smartest DJs alike. And of course, the funky digi-bass of ""The Time Lock"" or military precision rhythm track on ""1968, Holes"" do wonders for me when 
    I'm driving or reading or thinking about how much I'd like to jet off to 
    Barcelona tonight. All three tunes brim with forward momentum, so it's not 
    like you couldn't dance to them, and in fact they'd thrill the sweaty, 
    dancing masses plopped in the middle of a set of minimal house where anything on either side of them would seem like either a warm-up or a comedown. Blechdom's vocals are like daggers though, so use them carefully.</p><p>
    
    ""Neon Underground"" samples a jazz trap-set playing contorted samba, and Vogel uses a synth chord progression reminiscent of Boards of Canada or Aphex Twin in ambient mode. Unlike BoC's latest stuff, he forgoes easy-on-the-ears resolution in favor of the kind of terminally unraveling, vague tension that got a lot of people interested in IDM in the first place. Likewise, ""Arctic Wolfman"" and ""Turn On, Tune In, Drown Out"" seem calm on the surface, but threaten to implode due to the weight of their own dissonances. It's not that they're ""difficult"" listening per se, rather, their bleak textures juxtaposed with airtight beats (half-time micro-hip-hop and robot house bump, respectively) turn restraint and understatement against themselves. Vogel may hide his musical payoffs beneath a mask of steely experimentation, but rest assured, the emotional tension below the surface is a constant, explosive threat.</p></div>"|8483.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8483-station-55/|8.3|Dominique Leone

The guitar and violin that echo Robert Fripp and David Cross sparring in mid-'70s King Crimson also sounds like you're fending off 10 pirates at a crowded bar and slicing out their tongues without knocking over a single beer. The hollow rattle of percussion stands for chains rattling hopelessly at the bottom of a prison-- and the arbitrarily long drones sound like making an escape out a 10th-story window and praying for an awning below.</p><p>
     
    Or maybe that's all wrong. For their debut LP, Make a Rising, a cult fave around Philadelphia that deserve wider attention, may not have planned out a narrative so much as a series of incidents and accidents. The arrangements and production hew close to '70s art rock and Henry Cow, but the transitions are all post-Zorn-- and the listeners who are used to translating musical cues and moods into a cogent whole will find themselves ready to deal with this kind of music after, say, Cerberus Shoal's last few records, or even Fiery Furnaces' <em>Blueberry Boat</em>. We're trained to go with the flow-- wherever it leads.</p><p>
     
    Make a Rising recorded it at their work space, giving it a strange but old atmosphere like a decommissioned black box theater: The upright piano sounds dusty, and the musicians rattle around in the wings and jump in whenever it's their turn. The first eight cuts run together in what may or may not be a suite, which is largely instrumental, outside of the male and female vocals that whiz in and out like tissue-paper ghosts on a string. Those songs are followed by the ""Expired Planet"", a far more conventional and summery pop song (aside from the male singer, who sounds like he's trying to stand up in a canoe), and the album wraps up with the surprisingly sweet ukulele and accordion of ""Partial Thoughts"".</p><p> 
     
    Without sounding sloppy, the performance is ramshackle, with plenty of room sound to fade into and acoustic blind spots to jump out of, making your first listen unpredictable: breaks and free passages run longer than you expect, and the melodic, driving sections that follow leave you wary of what's coming next. Needless to say, that's what makes it so engaging. Some modern ears may be spoiled by bands like-- to take yet another not-really-similar example-- Animal Collective, who always wind up safely back at the campfire: <em>Rip Through the Hawk Black Night</em> ends sweetly but it doesn't clear things up. But that has its own rewards.</p></div>"|5666.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5666-rip-through-the-hawk-black-night/|7.9|Chris Dahlen

Over the course of 14 tracks, <em>Wohaw finds group members Tom Hohmann and Colin Langevin using their combustible noise-rock to address the plight and lost histories of various oppressed peoples, particularly Native Americans. Needless to say, this is an ambitious undertaking, one made more so by the inherent rigors of the duo's music. Combining the hyperspeed prog-metal riffing of compatriots Lightning Bolt, the ethno-pummel of Sun City Girls' </em><em>Torch of the Mystics</em>, and a surprising abundance of campfire-baked folk, the album gallops recklessly from one destination to the next as though determined to throw even the hardiest cavalry off their trail.</p><p>
    
    As you might suspect from their cumbersome band name or song titles like ""All the Worlds Leaders Must Die"", USAISAMONSTER don't necessarily put much stock in subtlety. Granted, this does little to hinder tracks like opener ""Clay People"", which boasts the thunder of a stampeding herd of bison, or the self-explanatory ""Riff Scientist"" which matches high-pitched squalls with hairpin chords and vocals that recall the stoner karaoke stylings of early Meat Puppets. Throughout these heavier tracks, Hohmann and Langevin display an almost preternatural degree of cohesion, as they corner every spastic, complex rhythm as though they're on rails.</p><p>
    
    Midway through the album, the twosome make their most unlikely U-turn yet, as the tranquil ""Waterfall"" initiates a five-track sequence of unadulterated acoustic folk. Accompanied only by acoustic guitars, on ""George Catlin and the Mandan Chief"" Langevin negotiates some extremely unwieldy lyrics (""A likeness of the Mandan's Chief/ Was recognized with disbelief/ Excited curiosity of the entire village at once"") to create a bittersweet vision of the American artist Catlin as he captures portraits of cultures bound for extinction. Stranger still is ""Alligator Allegory"", a wandering narrative sung with an otherworldly, almost Skip Spence-like eccentric flourish.</p><p>
    
    As engaging as this brief acoustic interlude is, the twosome do little in attempt to unite the album's distinct sonic poles. Following <em>Wohaw's acoustic lull, the passionate Leonard Peltier saga ""God Is Red"" opens with an intro of exotic reeds and tribal drumming, but soon lumbers back into the band's familiar mathematical pounding, all traces of folk dissipated into thin air. And though this abrupt about-face might earn USAISAMONSTER some bones for versatility, it also makes an already thorny album sound that much more disjointed, causing some listeners to long for the day when the duo can figure out a way to bring their various surging streams into better confluence.</em></p></div>"|8379.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8379-wohaw/|7.1|Matthew Murphy

There,
    it's finished. Did you miss it? It's very short. Less than 30 minutes.
    Ten tracks. Only two songs exceed three minutes. In almost any other case this would be an enormous advantage. For Rev Run,
    scourge of Old School haters, it's a non-factor. Writing about rap a lot, I
    tend to get stuck listening to overlong tropes. See, the streets need their
    money's worth-- <em>Illmatic? No use for that kind of strategic
    brevity. ""Fill it up with those Jazze Pha beats!"" mysterious label executive
    says. ""They'll eat up that squirting pop-up. Bring in the next kid we're
    going to screw over with advance money."" Run, apparently, was having none of
    that.</em></p><p>
    
    Run needs no introduction-- he's got his own TV show, is Russell Simmons'
    brother, hosts award ceremonies and is generally considered the most vital
    member of the group that took hip-hop to the rockstar level. He's a
    shouter and a high-energy performer. Even in middle age, on his first solo
    album, <em>Distortion</em>, he does lots of shouting. We hear you. You're Run! He's
    also clearly still a massive rock 'n' roll fan. Traditional rock 'n' roll.
    None of that Coldplay shit. He samples Joan Jett's ""I Love Rock and Roll""
    and Kiss and Blondie. He's not kidding. Where Run got the money to clear a
    rather large, cloying sample of ""Sweet Home Alabama"" for ""Home Sweet Home""
    is unknown. I'd guess his brother, but who's to say? What Hollis, Queens and
    Alabama have to do with each other also is unclear.</p><p>
    
    This album is almost a non-entity. Throw it on on the train, it's over after
    four stops. The big crashing snares and remarkably self-referential songs,
    (""I Used to Think I Was Run"", ""Boom Ditty"") are by no means annoying. Some
    songs are sort of hilarious, like ""High and Mighty Joe"", a song impossibly
    written after 1988. <em>Distortion</em> may make you think you're Marty McFly,
    briefly. Then you'll feel like Christopher Lloyd. A person named Whiteboy
    produced the bulk of the album and he has a deft hand. All of the samples
    are cut and looped properly, the tambourines shake in the right places, the
    drums are blandly and precisely delivered. Run's strangled screech is
    dominant, if curiously angry for a man of God. His cadence is brisk,
    punching each line out like it were his last. What a tease Run is.</p><p>
    
    The single, which you may have heard repeatedly on your local television
    station, but not on radios, is ""Mind on the Road"", the record that samples
    Joan Jett. It's about doing shows and traveling, and possibly a metaphor
    about the journey that is life. That much is unclear, too. I'd like to say
    this sort of ""Return of a Legend"" album is a waste of time. But really, what
    are you going to do with that 26:46? </p></div>"|6950.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6950-distortion/|5.4|Sean Fennessey

The sibling duo launched in 2003 with an addictively quirky debut (<em>Gallowsbird's Bark</em>), promptly rolled out an elaborate follow-up (2004's epic <em>Blueberry Boat</em>), released a collection of UK singles and B-sides (the full-length <em>EP</em>), and are now about to dump their grandest opus to date on poised-and-perplexed ears: <em>Rehearsing My Choir</em> is a sprawling piano opera starring Matthew and Eleanor Friedberger's grandmother, Olga Sarantos, and it's every bit as terrible and fantastic as it sounds.</p><p>
    If you can swallow <em>Rehearsing My Choir</em> as oral history, in the vein of NPR's National Story Project or Tom Russell's Kerouac-slurping poetry, the album offers an extraordinarily detailed portrait of mid-century Chicago, all rickety old Fords, crinkling photographs of Robert Mitchum, excessive drinking, gabbing about the war, working on the railroad.  The sequencing isn't chronological-- if you trace the map Matthew includes in the record's press kit, the album moves from the present to the 40s, 20s, 30s, 50s, back to the 40s, into the 60s, and then the 90s-- though it doesn't much matter, as the narrative instead follows the kind of internal timeline that makes sense only to its tellers.  Ultimately, it's the story of Sarantos' love of her late husband, the heft of her grief, and all the stuff that happened between first kiss and funeral march-- from the condolence cards of opener ""The Garfield El"" to the graveyard of closer ""Does It Remind You of When?"", <em>Rehearsing My Choir</em> is a weird testament to the inevitable passage of time, and the casualties of inertia.</p><p>
    As a think piece, <em>Rehearsing My Choir</em> is enormously engaging, but as a pop record, it's exhausting and fruitless.  Narrative supersedes melody time after time; there are no real songs, just cacophonous noodling and stacks and stacks of polysyllabic words. The majority of the record plays like amateur musical theater, steeped in prog-rock dementia and in love with the sound of its own voice. Unsurprisingly, the chief exception is the predominantly grandma-free (and essentially irrelevant, at least story-wise) ""The Wayward Granddaughter"": The song features drum machine boinks and zip-zapping synths and Matthew's disco whirls bouncing off Eleanor's (comparatively) silky pipes, as she embodies ""Connie,"" a popular, Greek-American teenager who bites it (metaphorically, and possibly literally) at the hands of one of two boyfriends named Kevin.  When Sarantos eventually does appear, it's as Connie's grandmother-- and delivers some of the record's most telling couplets, lamenting the capriciousness of age (""Her gorgeous red-brown hair black/ When she turned 15 behind my back"") and, to an extent, explaining the impetus behind the entire enterprise (""Well, we could talk about it, Connie/ But often, memories are better off sung/ Remember when I was young?"").
    </p><p>
    Sarantos' voice is weird and spectacular, dripping with dramatic flair, richer than Eleanor's determinably flat intones, and more obviously enthralled with the material. Deep and vaguely creaky, with just enough quake to emphasize the gravity of her story, Sarantos' pipes are thick and androgynous, heavy with the weight of hindsight-- appropriately, they age as the record plods onward, and by the closing track, Sarantos sounds exhausted and beaten.  Eleanor's role, vocally, is less clear: For the most part, she embodies her grandmother's younger self-- the self-ascribed voice-of-the-moment-- but she does so without immediacy or aplomb, leaving the two vocal lines too distinct to convincingly articulate the same story.
    </p>
<p>
    Meanwhile, the band does its best to incorporate Matthew's instrumental diddles, with varying success.  ""We Wrote Letters Everyday"" uses upright piano to recreate long-lost love letters; it's a coy, earnest device, protecting the sanctity of the form. ""Who knows what we wrote/ And what they said/ But this is probably how they read,"" Sarantos muses, followed by alternating bits of dark, longing piano and sprightly keyboards. Later, breaking down the voices of the priests at her wedding (""They all had fine voices/ But, and I mean this respectfully, they didn't match pitch,"" Eleanor clucks), Sarantos commands, ""Listen!""-- and we're rewarded with an off-key, disharmonious keyboard mess that's perfectly logical in the context of the story, but, taken independently, makes for supremely crappy listening.  So goes the whole of the record-- the music is sharp and grating, too reliant on narrative nuance, and unsure of its own role.
    </p>
<p>
    Thus, the central problem of <em>Rehearsing My Choir</em>: It's a spectacular experiment, groundbreaking and perverse, bloated with possibilities and prime for parsing. But its practical function is unclear. No matter how open your mind, how welcome to art-without-directions you may be, it's difficult to consume <em>Rehearsing My Choir</em> without taking some kind of quasi-academic, cultural studies stance, reachable only after hours of careful, dedicated, uninterrupted listening: The emotional components are in place, but willfully (and successfully) obscured behind obtuse instrumentation and overdone wordplay. You can pick it apart, but can you dance to it, roll around on the floor with it, weep to it under your favorite blanket? This is not to say that art should be easy or instant or utilitarian-- but it should be penetrable, purposeful.  And somewhere along the way, the Friedbergers got all chewed up and swallowed by their own experiment.

    Emmanuel Jal and Abdel Gadir Salim have spent most of their lives less than 
    a thousand miles from each other, but they may as well have been on 
    different planets, as they fell on different sides of the front line in 
    Sudan's long and brutal north-south civil war (a separate conflict from the 
    current troubles in Darfur). The war pitted the Muslim, Arab, and 
    comparatively wealthy north against the south, where most are 
    adherents of indigenous faiths, along with a sizable Christian minority. 
    Salim is an elder statesman of northern Sudanese music and a master oud 
    player, while Jal was forced into duty with John Garang's rebel SPLA (Sudan 
    People's Liberation Army) group before he turned eight, training in 
    Ethiopian camps and fighting skirmish actions before he learned to read.</p><p>
    
    After years of fighting and a defection to a rival rebel group, Jal was 
    ultimately helped out of the country by Emma McCune, a British aid worker with 
    Street Kids International, but was left as one of thousands of so-called 
    Lost Boys of Sudan after her death. Schooled in Kenya and London 
    with help from McCune's friends and family, Jal turned to music after 
    converting to Christianity. And it seems fitting that his odder-than-fiction 
    path into the world of hip-hop should find him entering the international 
    stage (he's already released an album of gospel hip-hop in Kenya) on an 
    album he shares with a musician from the north of Sudan, in an unprecedented pairing. 
    Jal and Salim do not mix their music thoroughly on most of <em>Ceasefire</em>, 
    instead allowing Salim's elegant desert blues-- played on oud, accordion, 
    saxophone, wooden drums, and bass-- to rub up against the sequenced beats and 
    funky flow of Jal, who raps in Nuer, Arabic, English, Dinka, and Kiswahili-- sometimes bouncing between four different languages in the space of one 
    verse.</p><p>
    
    It works surprisingly well, and not just because the two musicians appear on 
    some of each other's tracks. What really is striking about it is how effortlessly 
    Salim's organic, traditional percussion and Egyptian-influenced singing 
    style fits alongside Jal's more 21st century sound. Unsurprisingly, the 
    lyrics of both men reflect on the hope for lasting peace in their country (a peace 
    already encroached upon by the Darfur violence). Jal opens ""Aiwa"" (Arabic 
    for ""yes"") with a verse in Nuer that translates to ""I would love to sing in 
    all the people's languages/ With this chance that I have I want to express/ 
    The whole of my heart to the whole of the world."" The chorus trades Nuer 
    lines with Arabic affirmations, something that would have been next to 
    impossible only a year ago.</p><p>
    
    The vast majority of the album is not sung or rapped in a language I can 
    speak, but I've always enjoyed listening to lyrics I can't 
    understand. I think it removes an extra layer of baggage (Jal's evangelism 
    can be heavy-handed in translations) and allows me to just concentrate on 
    the pure sound of the voices, which in this case is hugely rewarding. Salim's 
    singing has a clipped dryness to it as he plays his vocals against his 
    wriggling oud lines and accordion merges with sax on pentatonic scales. 
    Salim's contributions are tonally similar to each other, and breaking them 
    up in order to place them throughout the album brings out the details in 
    each of them. It likely also makes for a more interesting listen for Western 
    ears used to modulations and non-diatonic chords.</p><p>
    
    As for Jal's songs, ""Elengwen"", ""Gua"", and ""Baai"" make a monster trio of hip 
    hop tracks. The first begins with a bouncing beat and a guitar/flute duel 
    before Jal offers some of his most interesting verses, from a flow 
    perspective. Large, mostly female backing choruses offer catchy 
    interjections, coming to the fore with a jerky English-language plea for 
    peace on ""Baai"". Live guitar and sax spice up the arrangements, and Salim's 
    oud shows up on ""Baai"", floating through the strutting beat like a linen 
    caught in a sharp wind. The song may be about the end of an appalling war, 
    but it has unbelievable floor potential.</p><p>
    
    Music obviously cannot put a wrecked nation back together, but it can be one 
    of the first steps toward reconciliation, and <em>Ceasefire</em> succeeds beautifully 
    as both that and an interesting album with potential to appeal in just about 
    any corner of the world's geography. Perhaps the most impressive thing about 
    it is that the music isn't overwhelmed by the history of its players and 
    their country. <em>Ceasefire</em> is a celebration of peace that looks forward to 
    better days, and that's something I think we can feel in any language.</p></div>"|4364.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4364-ceasefire/|8.2|Joe Tangari

On one hand, the guy can make twitchy European electro-tech with the best of them-- whether it's the buzzy malfunctioning-synth tics we usually get from Bpitch Control records, the detailed pulse we usually get from Kompakt records, or just dubbing out into grainy space. On the other hand, his T.Raumschmiere project has a shtick of its own: ultra-heavy monster-truck bangers, cartoon heavy metal, trucker-hatted skull logos, and live sets that make you hope he's not going to try and smash his laptop at the end. And as of his last full-length, these two things co-existed beautifully; as of his last few clenched-teeth tweaker-techno singles, they were positively losing their seams.</p><p>
    
    But Haas has a problem: Let that cartoon tech-metal ramp up (or camp up) just a step too far, and it turns into something kind of, well, uncool-- crossing the line from lovably brutal Germanic electronics into something sub-Rammstein, a kind of mallrat military-industrial metal that doesn't really square with the guy's skill set. And worse: Once you've let that particular monster come rumbling out of the bag, aren't your subtly crafted electro-grinds going to seem a little pale in comparison-- a little, say, not the main event?</p><p>
<i>Blitzkrieg Pop</i>, sadly enough, is all about that problem, and it does you the favor of laying out the stakes from the get-go: ""Sick Like Me"", the first proper song, takes us further than we've previously gone into the world of Raumschmiere-as-rocker. Now there are guitars. Now Haas sounds like he's from Cleveland, and raised on a steady diet of Nine Inch Nails' ""Wish"". Now Haas imagines calling people ""schmucks"" is a real tough-guy put-down (on two different tracks!). There certainly isn't much ""tech"" left in it. And as far as fake-metal goes, it's alright-- dorkily, adorably amped-up, like a wannabe-grim Andrew WK, and certainly better than the title track, which competes with, and mostly loses to, any number of one-hit nu-metal chancers from three-year-old episodes of ""Headbanger's Ball"".</p><p>
    
    Yes, those are the rockers that bookend this album-- leaving the remaining half-hour open for Haas to worry his way around That Problem. In spots, it's the old Raumschmiere-as-usual: Grim schaffel throb on ""All Systems Go"", or Ellen Allien guest-vamping on ""Diving in Whiskey"", which feels like a flatter-- more earthbound take on her own last album. But hard-man habits are hard to break, and Haas can't resist going out on a limb with a little ""now is the time on Sprockets where we RAWK""-- easy-to-resist fake-punk on ""A Mess"" leading straight into some over-the-top hair-metal vocals from Judith Juillerat on ""A Very Loud Lullaby"". Leading straight into some wonderfully creepy insectoid crawl on ""Der Grottenholm"", but let's face it: Once you've tried your shouts on, your nice subtle crawls tend to get overshadowed.</p><p>
    
    Which leaves basically one keeper: ""An Army of Watt"", a track that bothers doing the one thing that makes the Raumschmiere shtick work-- revving functional, fist-in-the-air <i>dance</i> music into a clenched-teeth old-school brutalism. And I guess now we just go on hoping Haas knows the sound of his floor bangers is his bread and butter-- and that fake-metal techno doesn't actually need to push the envelope into just plain fake metal, no matter how fun or logical it seems.</p></div>"|6696.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6696-blitzkrieg-pop/|6.4|Nitsuh Abebe

I don't throw this eye-catcher out as mere inflammatory
    rabble-rousing-- I'm not so perverse as that.  But if you take a deep breath and really listen to the album, its brilliance is not
    so automatic, despite its importance to that transitional mid-60s pop period so many critics get heart flutters over.  A few perfect
    gems are present, of course, but you also get trite hippie crap like ""The Word"", and a whole lot of little-boy-scorned misogyny,
    from blueballs-inspired arson to murder threats over suspected infidelity.</i></p><p>
    
    The artists of <em>This Bird Has Flown</em> may have found this out the hard way, giddily agreeing to take part in a Beatles cover
    project and then finding themselves trying to do something interesting with ""Think for Yourself"".  Focusing on a single album, as
    this compilation does, might be a good way to get some of the Beatles' less-appreciated deep cuts renewed attention, but it also
    forces the exhumation of tracks that would be better left uncelebrated.</p><p>
    
    Fortunately, some of the participants answer this challenge by refusing to be pious or reverent with the material.  Handed Ringo's
    abysmal country tune ""What Goes On"", Sufjan Stevens scraps everything but the lyrics, instead opting to record a really good Sufjan
    Stevens song, arranged for the full Illinoisemaker band with choral interludes, diving strings, and a surprisingly gritty jam. ""I'm
    Looking Through You"" didn't need any work, but Ted Leo gives it a cosmetic kick anyhow, leaning hard on his beloved analog delay
    pedal until it almost becomes dub.  And if you persist, you might even get me to admit that Ben Harper's reggaefied rendition of
    ""Michelle""... isn't... terrible.</p><p>
    
    Most of the other versions are strictly fundamentalist, with the artists backing off any significant changes to the original
    recording.  For all I can hear, the Donnas didn't even re-record the instruments on ""Drive My Car"", settling for a straight
    karaoke reading.  Dar Williams and Yonder Mountain String Band do little but add superfluous instrumentation and twang to ""You
    Won't See Me"" and ""Think for Yourself"", respectively.  Subtraction doesn't work much better, as Ben Lee cruelly strips ""In My
    Life"" of its harmonies, while Low leaves nothing <i>but</i> the harmonies intact on ""Nowhere Man"".</p><p>
    
    Of course, changing things around doesn't guarantee success, as the Fiery Furnaces' muddy, mistaken, Dylan-joke take on ""Norwegian
    Wood"" proves.  A Nellie McKay restyling of ""If I Needed Someone"" as lounge-jazz isn't awful, but the same treatment has been applied
    to Beatles tunes countless times, and probably shouldn't be tackled again post-Shatner.  Most disappointing of all is the Cowboy
    Junkies gender-switching reclamation of ""Run for Your Life""-- as in ""catch you with another <em>wo</em>man, that's the end... little
    <em>boy</em>.""  Dear Bands: Do. Not. Ever. Do. This.</p><p>
    
    So if <em>This Bird Has Flown</em> gets anything right about the original <em>Rubber Soul</em>, it's in the sense of perfectly replicating
    the progenitor's unevenness.  There are four or five songs worth keeping from this compilation, eight you'll never want to hear more
    than once, and a couple that will potentially ruin the original versions for you for a while.  Whether a better choice of source
    material (I know, 40th anniversary, but what is that, the cobalt anniversary?) or a better choice of interpreters would have changed
    this distribution is anyone's guess, but with both elements less than optimal, this bird's wings were clipped from the start.</p></div>"|1095.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1095-this-bird-has-flown-a-tribute-to-the-beatles-rubber-soul/|5.5|Rob Mitchum

It makes everything the band has done since look like scar tissue.</p><p>
    
    Nowadays no one accuses the Texas post-rockers of vulnerability; the quartet keeps it serious as a heart attack, showing one of the best poker faces in rock. Even 2003's <em>The Earth Is Not a Cold Dead Place-- a putatively </em><em>optimistic</em> response to the dour minor-key mega-wattage of its predecessor, <i>Those Who Tell the Truth Shall Die-- was a strikingly humorless affair.  Music this grave and resolute risks becoming a parody of itself, but the band have stood ground as if steeled for the Blitz, delivering cavernous, sure-footed instrumentals without a crumb of irony. So if you've come to depend on Royal Guard stoicism from these guys, brace yourself: </i><i>How Strange, Innocence is an emotionally effluent record, all knit brows and crestfallen countenances.</i></p><p>
<i>Earth</i> was white to <em>Truth</em>'s foreboding gray, the records' moods distinct like vinegar in oil. <i>How Strange, Innocence is a more personal affair, deep cogitative blues mingling with the bleaker registers. Thank the production: Dry and brittle, the sound betrays all EITS indicators, from the wontedly windy titles (""Remember Me as a Time of Day"", ""Glittering Blackness"") to the diarrhetic runtimes. Less reverb, you'd think, less color. But Explosions' last two albums have been so bloated that the relative thinness here actually bursts open the spectrum, finding intimacy.</i></p><p>
<em>How Strange</em> mostly does without excessive distortion and dynamic see-sawing-- no explosions, only minor flares. But even working within a compressed range, the band conjures up some lightning. ""Magic Hours"" is eight-plus minutes for a reason: The sluggish opening section needs time to unravel if the steam-building turnabout is to have any clout.  And however predictable the song's binary, quiet-crazy structure, Explosions handles both poles beautifully, moving from papery strumming and cool bass dewdrops to rushing, squall-slathered confusion.  ""Snow and Lights"" cuts to the chase quicker but belabors. Starting at a climax and retreating from there, a logy middle section evaporates into a yawning abyss exactly five minutes wide. The composition's fine, all the component parts pulling weight, and the relative lack of 'verb is a good move-- any inflation would muzzle the bite.</p><p>
    
    Even lacking the heavy artillery, these are no cupcakes. ""Glittering Blackness"" dirges with the best of <i>Truth</i>, kicking quarter notes so thick, who needs syncopation?  ""Remember Me as a Time of Day"" is very proud of its acoustic guitars, whose cascading lulls presage the band's droopy meditations on the <i>Friday Night Lights soundtrack. But whereas that foray into film scoring (the band's most recent release) moved beyond dispassionate destruction into lame docility, <em>How Strange, Innocence</em></i> does gentle from a whole different bent-- one that doesn't back down from frailty and uncertainty, and spins something way more vibrant as a result.</p></div>"|2881.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2881-how-strange-innocence/|7.9|Sam Ubl

Better yet, how would Muhammad Ali feel if his commemoration meant having to get in the ring with Lennox Lewis? The <em>Dimension Mix</em> obviously intends no such harm to Bruce Haack or anyone else (in fact, proceeds from the record go to Cure Autism Now), but there's an element of ironic tragedy in hearing artists, all of whom in some way owe their success to Haack, covering the same songs that could never bring him the deserved recognition.</p><p>
    
    Haack and his musical partner Esther Nelson pioneered electronic music by making vibrant, expressive children's songs during the 1960s and 70s on Haack's Dimension 5 label, and anyone from Beck to Mouse on Mars will acknowledge their indebtedness to those works. Problem is, rock history balks at lionizing children's music, if not electronic music. So if we remember Haack at all, it's most likely for showing Mister Rogers how a synthesizer works. Then again, Haack wrote some far-out shit, and expecting today's hipsters to embrace instructional songs about spiders or medieval dancing is a tad unfair. Fortunately, we have a chic laundry list of indie artists willing to upgrade some of Haack's catalog for the 21st century, acknowledging their own indebtedness to his work in the process.</p><p>
    
    Beck kicks off the album with a downright incriminating rendition of ""Funky Lil' Song"", revealing his springboard for the slacker-folk dabbling of <i>Mutations</i> and <i>Sea Change</i>. Likewise, ""Liza Jane"" sheds further light on Apples in Stereo's psychedelic inspirations, proving they can cop non-Beatles artists, too. Eels offer up a surprisingly spirited cover of the Arabian-tinged ""Jelly Dancing"", even if frontman E's lecherous slow-fuzz-grind corrupts Nelson's all-too-innocent lyrics: ""Now wiggle everything you wish and shake like jelly in a dish."" But Gen X disillusionment aside, the degree of separation between Haack's crude pop songs and modern-day psych-rock is so nuanced, one listen to Oranger's take on ""Catfish"" stales many of today's purportedly ""far-out"" bands.</p><p>
    
    Then there are those artists who engulf Haack's songs with their high-tech studio wizardry, creating entirely new monsters. Stereolab's ""Mudra"" mutation, which we recently frothed over in Tracks, bypasses Haack and Nelson's didacticism (""People of India often tell stories by dancing, and such a dance is called a Mudra""), instead catapulting the original's coarse electro-raga into the 28th century. DJ Me DJ You parlay similar transcendentalism, launching the already trippy ""Soul Transportation"" to the <i>Dark Side of the Moon and back with Haack and Nelson's vocals intact for spiritual guidance. With their claustrophobic beats and turn-on-a-dime mash-ups, Fantastic Plastic Machine probably go overboard on the Dimension 5 megamix ""I'm Bruce"", but such hamming occurs regularly throughout the album. In fact, <em>Dimension Mix</em>'s overarching sense of eagerness only testifies to Haack's expressiveness, whether in Money Mark's meticulous instrumentation to the quirky biology lecture ""Spiders"" or Danielson Famile lamenting having ""Nothing to Do"". The Beatles? Heh, they never reduced this many self-conscious artists to a second-grade reading level.</i></p></div>"|3698.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3698-dimension-mix-a-tribute-to-bruce-haack/|7.9|Adam Moerder

Magruder has wended an interesting path through the blurred post-rock undergrowth. Dividing his time between NYC and Austin, Magruder has played with such acts as Bowery Electric, Main, and Windsor for the Derby, and since 1997 has been drummer/programmer for the shape-shifting indie combo Calla. Throughout these projects, Magruder has cut something of an elusive figure, with his textured contributions often hidden anonymously in the brush. And though <em>Night of the Hunter</em> is ostensibly Wayne B's first full-fledged solo album, even here he seems reluctant to escape his natural tendency to recede off into the music's shadows.</p><p>
    
    Constructed of gauzy samples, processed lo-fi percussion, and acoustic guitar, <em>Night of the Hunter</em> builds a solid case in favor of organic, Four Tet-like nuance, and grainy sub-bass atmospheres. Most of the tracks here feature the cool, virtually interchangeable vocals of Jana Plewa or Daphne Gannon, and on casual listen one might easily mistake either singer to be the album's true headliner. This is due largely to the low-key, nonchalant ease with which Wayne B completes his numerous activities, as he seamlessly incorporates unfussy strands of campfire guitar or cryptic found sounds into his serene patterns without stirring a ripple.</p><p>
    
    Given Magruder's background as a percussionist, it comes as a mild disappointment to hear the stiff, inconsequential beats that anchor tracks like the opening ""Souvenir"" or ""Oak (In the Small Hours)"", although both are somewhat salvaged by a surging lo-fi wash reminiscent of the lush space-rock of groups like Auburn Lull. More intriguing is ""Dogville"", whose central rhythm is also accompanied by stray percussive clatter that sounds as though it might've bled through the walls from a nearby carpenter's workshop.</p><p>
    
    Midway through, the album takes a decided upward turn with the supple, dub-like pulse of ""Ten to One"", on which Magruder at last begins to assert himself with some propulsive invention. This momentum carries on through the swinging door creak of ""Garden of the Weaver"", the dusty cinema of ""Langor Train"" and the slow-motion, bottom-heavy throb of ""See Through"". During this multi-hued sequence of tracks, Magruder wisely forsakes his earlier static electronic rhythms, allowing live drums, bass, and an ever-shifting montage of veiled sound sources to produce an entrancing dry heat shimmer, like waves of sunlight reflecting off baked highway pavement. He continues on this thread for <em>Night of the Hunter</em>'s closer, ""Back Porch Apology"", a lengthy instrumental piece that combines the album's most prominent acoustic guitar work with a suitably murky rhythmic stroke. Appropriately, this last evocative track provides the type of mesmeric, but ultimately ephemeral soundtrack that one might expect at movie's end, when the hero rides away before the audience ever gets a chance to truly know him. </p></div>"|8806.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8806-night-of-the-hunter/|6.9|Matthew Murphy

Capping a hill north of Paris in the 18th arrondissement, the windmill-pocked neighborhood is modernly synonymous with a spirit of free-wheeling debauchery and artistic synergy. In infamous cabarets like Lapin Agile, Le Chat Noir, and Moulin Rouge, bohemian artists and bourgeois Parisians rubbed elbows with pimps and whores amid the bawdy entertainments of Jane Avril and Aristide Bruant. No artist is more emblematic of the period than the painter and lithographer Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec.</p><p>
    David Berman invokes Toulouse-Lautrec's name in ""Punks in the Beerlight""-- ""Punks in the beerlight/ Two burnouts in love/ Punks in the beerlight/ Toulouse-Lautrec!""-- the first song on <em>Tanglewood Numbers</em>. With this invocation, Berman announces the aura of <em>Tanglewood Numbers</em>. Inextricably linked to time and place? Check. Berman's ear is still turned toward the hard-bitten rhythms and brassy twang of the American South, and his narratives still unfold in real towns and avenues.</p><p>
    Seamy glamour? Check. Where 2001's <em>Bright Flight</em> leaned into full-bore country, emphasizing Berman's voice and lyrical content, <em>Tanglewood Numbers</em> is a band-oriented rock record-- crashing, amped-up, aggressively ramshackle. Berman's wife Cassie, with whom he seems to be developing a Waits/Brennan (or possibly Johnny/June) relationship, reprises her vocal and inspirational role (she penned the noodly dirge ""The Poor, the Fair and the Good""); Stephen Malkmus contributes some raucous, cutting guitars; drummer Brian Kotzur and keyboardist Tony Crow supply a yawing foundation; Paz Lenchantin flecks the songs with banjo and violin. These diverse players lurch into a shit-faced stumble to forge a remarkably drunken-sounding record in the angry crucible of sobriety, a rock'n'roll hayride kicking up feathers and peanut shells.
    </p><p>
    The most interesting parallel between Toulouse-Lautrec's art and <em>Tanglewood Numbers</em> is the signature blend of jubilance and sorrow. Montmartre wasn't all fun and games by a long shot-- what was a thrilling diversion for wealthy Parisians was a harsh reality for its insolvent denizens, and in Toulouse-Lautrec's work, a sense of alienation and hopelessness undercuts the vibrant subject matter. His dingy washes of grey and green allude to the cheap, soul-hollowing aspects of taking pleasure from class division, and no two gazes or trajectories intersect, subtly isolating each of his subjects in their own existential void. Again, the parallel is striking: While <em>Tanglewood Numbers</em> is probably Silver Jews' most <em>fun</em> album to date, with its riotous guitars and rambling sing-along hooks, it's also their saddest, an outsized hangover that makes everything into sharp edges and toe-stubbing impediments, with a patina of dizzy anxiety on every blaring chord. 
    </p>
<p>
    Berman rarely gives interviews or performs, but after a recent spate of press, we all know the story-- the long party turned sinister; the rehabilitation and relapses; the eventual resurfacing into the hard, clear light of day. We see this arc play out over the course of <em>Tanglewood Numbers</em>, as Berman moves between sick inebriation, pissy withdrawal, grudging temperance, and a tentative state of acceptance. The first three songs are pure desperation. Over the nervously coasting guitars of ""Punks in the Beerlight"", Berman searches for the paper bag that holds the liquor in case he needs to puke. When his wife ventures some hope with the promise ""If it ever gets really really bad,"" Berman interrupts her with the addict's grim realism: ""Let's not kid ourselves, it gets really really bad."" The rollicking ""Sometimes a Pony Gets Depressed"" uses hokey barnyard imagery to veil a deeper personal point about Berman's desire for sanctuary, posing questions like, ""Where does an animal sleep when the ground is wet?"" Let's not kid ourselves; it's pretty clear who the animal in question is. And the woozily bending ""K-Hole"" finds Berman utterly succumbing to selfishness and self-destruction: ""I've been living in a k-hole ever since you went away/ I'd rather live in a trash can than see you happy with another man.""
    </p>
<p>
    But it's around this time that a softening occurs. On the countrified duet ""Animal Shapes"", Berman's attention shifts from himself to the world around him, as he watches snow fall and muses about God carving the clouds into animal shapes. The revelatory line is ""The last dream left worth believing starts with animal shapes,"" as the addict returns to the objective world beyond his own physical sensations and the spiritual dimensions of that world. ""I'm Getting Back Into Getting Back Into You"" displays the same startled attention to a life that almost passed by unnoticed. But healing doesn't happen that quickly or cleanly, and through the unfettered elation of ""How Can I Love You if You Won't Lie Down"", and the romantic devotion of ""The Poor, the Fair and the Good"" and ""Sleeping Is the Only Love"", the album stumbles toward a complex suspension of grace and regret.
    </p>
<p>
    Suffice it to say about ""The Farmer's Hotel"" that when Berman finally finds the shelter he's been longing for, it's not all it's cracked up to be: ""There's no natural law that can explain what I saw/ Spread out on that straw-covered floor."" The album's final song, then, is also its centerpiece, summarizing its narrative and musical arcs in one bravura performance. ""There Is a Place"" moves between placid pastoralia and stark, incantatory rock, and finds Berman in aphoristic poet-sage mode: ""There is a place past the blues I never want to see again"" and ""I saw God's shadow on this world""-- the sort of talk associated with prophets, mystics and madmen, recipients of divine visitation, apocalyptics, and near-death survivors. Peeking over the rim of oblivion and returning to tell the tale isn't a novel concept, but it's one of lasting interest, because we all want to know what's over there without having to find out firsthand. And so Berman returns, shaken but intact and leavened with hard-earned wisdom, to give us a glimpse that's so unglamorous it makes us grateful for the banal luxury we take for granted-- some good music, friends to share it with, and a warm, dry place to hear a story.

The 
    choppy, soul-sampling production is there. RZA and GZA are there. So it's a 
    Wu-Tang Clan record, right? Well, sorta. On <em>Think Differently</em>, 
    longtime Wu affiliate Dreddy Krueger has taken a concept chock with novelty 
    appeal-- your favorite indie rappers over Wu beats!-- and stretched it into 
    a nearly hour-long exercise in necrophilia. If the formerly ubiquitous Clan 
    aren't yet a hip-hop casualty, they're on life support. It's been four years since <em>Iron Flag</em> and four years more since one of their albums made a cultural impact. Ghostface is arguably the only one of the collective who is still turning out essential albums. But Wu-Tang has an everlasting allure. Krueger only managed to wrangle the services of three official Wu members here, one of whom is U-God, the only one I wouldn't want to meet on wax. Would it really have been so difficult to get 16 bars from, say, Masta Killa? Gripes and misleading circumstances aside, <em>Wu-Tang Meets the Indie Culture</em> is surprisingly coherent and faithful to RZA's model, and it features a few unexpectedly gleaming examples of Wu-aping.</p><p>
    
    Backed by nostalgic production from Mathematics, designer of the famed W logo,
    and Wu tenderfoot Bronze Nazareth, each song has a stretched-out leftover 
    appeal. Which makes sense because that's exactly what Krueger did-- he 
    pilfered the unused Wu archives for hidden gems. The whole practice is 
    hit-and-spliff. The tracks you think will quake, like RZA and MF Doom 
    teaming up on ""Biochemical Equation"", or GZA and Ras Kass squaring off on the thrilling ""Lyrical Swords"" (Ras easily dominates the suddenly old Genius), are gold. Cannibal Ox's Vast Aire also makes a strong showing over the churning, sweaty harmonica boogie of ""Slow Blues"". ""I'm like Ali, better yet Joe Louis/ I'll put my hands through you/ I don't need bullets,"" he sneers. Less appealing ventures-- J-Live meets R.A. the Rugged Man, anyone?-- either feel forced or ill-conceived. ""Aesop Rock is weird and so is Del tha Funky Homosapien. Get 'em in the booth!""</p><p>
    
    This only raises an important question: What exactly constitutes ""indie"" in 
    hip-hop right now? In indie-hop's salad days, when El-P swung a 
    mighty sword and the word ""Rawkus"" didn't make you groan, this sort of project might have meant something. Now we're subjected to the likes of Scaramanga Shallah. These miscellaneous MCs are only indie because they can't get on commercially, not because they embody some sort of concrete ethos. This makes the whole venture bunk, though not a complete waste of time. Two interludes from Jim Jarmusch, reportedly a friend of Krueger's and the reason RZA steals <em>Coffee and Cigarettes</em> from Bill Murray, are 
    bizarrely pretentious (""Harmony composes compatibility among the incongruous..."") and reason alone to give this a listen.</p><p>
    
    While only a curio in the Wu archive, our friend Dreddy appears to have good intentions. It wouldn't have been a bad thing to hear some more accomplished MCs give these beats a shot; most recall a gloriously synth-less world of East Coast hip-hop production. Of course, that would have spared us the chance to hear Littles, La the Darkman &amp; Byata give their Wu dream whip a spin.</p></div>"|8748.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8748-dreddy-krueger-presentsthink-differently-music-wu-tang-meets-the-indie-culture/|6.9|Sean Fennessey

So you can be forgiven for thinking Calla's fourth effort, <em>Collisions</em>, feels like a contrite set of Cliffs Notes on the drowsier end of today's indie rock. In some moments, the dense, layered guitars and crystalline bass tones gesture toward the soundscapades of Texans Lift to Experience and Explosions in the Sky and the New York-Boston cabal of groups like Codeine and Longwave. At other points, however-- such as rich but austere opener ""It Dawned On Me""-- there are hints of the more acerbic songcraft of the Wrens or earlier Death Cab.</p><p>
    
    In its best moments, <em>Collisions</em> has an edge that's grittier and more
    emphatic than its predecessor. While Calla fans won't be caught
    off guard by the changes, the tempos are faster, the swells are louder, and
    generally there's a little more meat on the bone. <em>Collisions</em> sounds like a
    record born of a few studio punch-ups, with a through-the-teeth delivery and
    a pervading tension. This muted anger adds a welcome sonic energy-- particularly when the atmospherics seem a bit borrowed.</p><p>
    
    With the exception of the occasional muted growl, Calla singer Aurelio Valle's reverb-drenched lower-register vocals smack a bit of Conor Oberst, Joe Pernice, or Elliott Smith, particularly juxtaposed against the Luna guitars of songs like ""Initiate"" or the pseudo-neo-psychedelia of ""Stumble"" and ""Swagger"".</p><p>
    
    Despite the sheer familiarity of it all, <em>Collisions</em> is a good album. The guitar drones could be a little more bowel-shaking, some EBow could be higher in the mix, the vocals could be a bit more dry, and the lyrics could worm their way into your gut a little more ineffably, but there are some inspired sonic touches-- listen closely for well-camouflaged tambourine, organ, and harmonica popping up across the musical backdrops. The sounds are lush and beautiful-- even if they're difficult to filter down to an emotional core. It's not that Calla are particular coy or even too arch, it's just that it doesn't breathe and sweat and ache like an album that you're meant to go really gaga over. It's elegant in its perhaps unwitting syncretism but it's not something that can truly hurt you, which, when you really do scale back to <em>Loveless</em> or the other gilded Rosetta stones, seems to be a big part of the point: A <em>Collisions</em> without casualties is just a pretty collage.</p></div>"|1253.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1253-collisions/|6.8|Jeff Leven

Unlike heady post-punk incarnates' expansive template, nu arena rockers cull their sound from an assortment of 70s singles rather than bands per se. We can compare Diamond Nights to Thin Lizzy, but in actuality, we're really just referencing ""The Boys Are Back in Town"" since the song practically encapsulates Lizzy's prolific yet standardized canon. Such emphasis on the feel-good anthemic hit can breed either disappointment or a monlithic sound over the course of an album, and likewise <em>Popsicle</em> tragically toils and troubles through almost 40 minutes of lusterless AOR for one ""hit,"" ""Destination Diamonds"", already exhausted on an earlier EP.</p><p>
    
    I say tragic because Diamond Nights aren't the enemy here. Unlike Louis XIV, there's no dicks-out chauvinism. <em>Popsicle</em> rarely even strives for anthem status, instead cruising on mid-tempo, digestible riffs and nicotine-flavored vocals. However, Diamond Nights too often splurge on guitar shop showmanship, displacing hooks and originality with intrusive, unappealing features like finger-tapped solos and Mixolydian modes. ""City of Love"" and ""Needle in the Rice"" sound like warm-up exercises, tumultuously soaring through scales and vocal modulations with little onus on structure.</p><p>
    
    The other half of <em>Popsicle</em>'s tracks float in leather-studded, ultra-cool pool hall exhaust. At best, the band drops the cock rock to dabble in more liminal genres, like on the skittish ""Drip Drip"". An almost Gang of Four-style staccato riff pecks through Morgan Phalen's volpine verses while Tim Traynor s-s-s-sputters on the skins, building to a pompous chorus ""ready for love."" Once again, ""Destination Diamonds"", from the <em>Once We Were Diamonds</em> EP, makes a case for these guys as Cheap Trick torch-bearers, but nothing else on the album makes good on the track's bashfully falsetto chorus hook ""Baby, do you like to mess around?""</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, the more fetid leftovers from Diamond Nights's EP reek enough to overpower the newcomers. Amidst the rock numbskullery, acoustic numbers ""Ordinary Life"" and ""Snakey Ruth"" jumpstart Phalen's melodic side, though they're too little too late. Maybe I'm giving these guys too much credit, but baby-Sabbath throwaways like ""It's a Shokka"" and ""City of Love"" dog what otherwise seems an intelligent (they use words like ""modicum"" for chrissakes!) although misguided group. Hopefully they'll soon realize most bands conjure up only one ""The Boys Are Back in Town"" a lifetime, and rather than waiting for that generation-uniting, feel-good rocker, they'd best bend the arena rock aesthetic to its outer limits-- the band's real stomping ground.</p></div>"|2618.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2618-popsicle/|5.4|Adam Moerder

After first seeking out the band thanks to singer Emily Haines' beatific, pitch-palsied performance on Broken Social Scene's immaculate ""Anthems for a Seventeen Year-Old Girl"", my hopes were unrealistically high. I was inevitably disappointed with their full-length debut, <em>Old World Underground, Where Are You Now?</em>: Its new wave spunk and blunt cynicism hardly an apt musical foundation for Haines, who I prematurely pegged as a quaint little-girl-lost indie savant. Still, the album had its moments, particularly when the singer's aching vocals and bubbly synths were brought to the fore as on the haunting ""Calculation Theme"". Clearly, this was Haines' show, and I hoped future releases would embrace that oh-so-blatant fact. Too bad then, that this sub par follow-up, with its dated post-grunge and neu-disco harangues, doesn't even measure up to <em>Underground</em>.</p><p>
    
    Produced by guitarist Jimmy Shaw, <em>Live It Out</em> annoyingly revels
    in its rote, echo-laden aural milieu, while putting Shaw's unremarkable
    six-string scrapes in high relief. The press release suggests Sonic
    Youth's <em>Goo</em> as an touchstone but, directly opposed
    to that shifty-guitar-driven work, <em>Live It Out</em> is mired in a
    past-ripe '90s Pro Tools precision that edges dangerously close to
    Modern Rock tastelessness.</p><p>
    
    The band's blunt liberal leanings are still the main lyrical catalyst, but rather than skewering the Orwellian state of
    North America with its sarcasm and biting barbs, Metric often come off as
    didactic and smug. ""Buy this car to drive to work/ Drive to work to
    pay for this car,"" goes the overly obvious and simplistic cyclical refrain to ""Handshakes"". When given the opportunity to move her band's lyrics into more winking
    territory live, Haines is able to deflate such over earnest musings
    with a cartoony thumbs-up; without that necessary context, such
    sentiments often miss their mark.</p><p>
    
    The quartet work best when they sidestep loud guitars and lyrics for
    softer, more refined styles. Once again, the album's best song, ""The
    Police and the Private"" is a mainly Haines affair, her roundabout
    keyboard working in lush lockstep with her plaintive vocal melody.
    Mysteriously dystopic, Haines coos about a near future in which people
    are ""felt up and fingerprinted waiting for the train."" Tapping into
    modern day fears and the forever-blurred line between commerce and
    state, the song eschews snide snarls for a purposeful paranoia--and is
    all the better for it. Alas, it dodges greatness by tacking on a
    wholly unnecessary minute-long instrumental outro that markedly
    lessens its overall impact.</p><p>
    
    With its silly experimental excesses (the hushed, groove disarming
    French whisper on ""Poster of a Girl"", nearly all of the six-minute ""Empty"") <em>Live It Out</em> is stymied by lame riffing and unqualified wonkage. In light of
    yet another brilliant collaboration with Broken Social Scene (the
    ineffably sweet ""Swimmers"") and the flashes of brilliance she has
    shown in her own band, I still think Haines has the potential to release an unapologetic indie-rock treasure. But, as this misguided
    disc bores out, she'll probably have to strike out on her own to do so.</p></div>"|5548.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5548-live-it-out/|4.2|Ryan Dombal

I don't imagine this is all that unusual. Sure, the music they've released seems fine enough. But laying claim to our brainspace takes more than that, and each album these guys produced seemed to be slotting them further and further into that place where groups just naturally wind up after a couple decades as a going concern-- the band version of adulthood. Band adulthood is where you've settled into enough of a groove that your core fans know who they are, and everyone else happily ignores your continued existence. Band adulthood is where you make perfectly fine and increasingly subtle and sophisticated new albums, and your members embark on highly touted Significant Solo Projects-- neither of which anyone can really work up any enthusiasm about.</p><p>
    
    Band adulthood means reviews that are a big swirl of stock phrases like ""return to form"" and ""just may be their best since [insert classic here]""; it's a world of die-hard fans politely trying to convince everyone that actually, this new album, it's interesting, you should give it a listen. Band adulthood is a city where R.E.M. and Elvis Costello have offices downtown, and the Cure and New Order keep stopping by open houses in the suburbs. No mistake: people of all sorts still love their Depeche Mode; last year I even got to watch a 19-year-old metalhead dig back and convert. But people want their prime-era DM, not a paler adulthood. Even the titles of the band's last couple releases seemed to know it: after <i>Ultra</i> (!) and <i>Exciter</i> (!), I'm half-surprised they didn't manage to call one <i>No Really, We're Still Worth It</i>.</p><p>
    
    If you've caught any advance word on <i>Playing the Angel</i>, you'll probably have heard the same rumors that swirl around all band-adulthood records: That this is the one, the  ""return to form."" That this isn't just the ""best since <i>Violator</i>,"" but maybe even <i>just as good</i>. That they're about to pull off the same trick Morrissey did-- following the same path as always, and yet somehow getting everyone to sit up again and take notice. (Publicists help.) And while I wish I could take some bold, controversial true/false stance on that one, this album just won't let me. If you really are the sort of person who's been waiting with bated breath for a new Depeche Mode release, then don't worry: You'll love this. Dear everyone else: It's pretty okay.</p><p>
    
    It certainly <i>sounds</i> as good as anything they've done in a while-- and isn't that always the key with these things? Band-adulthood records leave everyone in fear of limp retreads, embarrassingly bombastic attempts to capturing former glory, ill-advised experiments, laughable bandwagon-jumping, or that ultimate horror of classic acts trying to ape the bands they're meant to have influenced. Depeche Mode have long managed to avoid those traps (say, ""showing Linkin Park how it's <i>really</i> done""), and on this record they've done even better, hitting on something that feels solid and relevant and natural: a dense, buzzy web of sound that folds in the old arena anthems, the camp noir-gospel of the early 90s, and the polished micro-production of <i>Exciter</i>.</p><p>
    
     The whole problem of the ""new"" DM has always been the gap between the clean-lined synth clang of their prime era and the lush, fussy computer-assisted electronics of today; the most surprising tracks here shoot past that issue entirely. ""Precious"", the first single, works some slow-rolling ""Enjoy the Silence"" beauty-- but the whole thing's riding on burbling acid-synth lines, retro-classic and up-to-the-minute at the same time. ""John the Revelator"" does up-tempo ""Master and Servant"" pulse and ""Condemnation"" choir calls over ultra-modern bleep and click, ""A Pain That I'm Used To"" does slow industrialist grind, and some other tracks pull off something like Depeche Mode torch songs. Yes, they've got their style working, their production mostly down, and Dave Gahan's singing gets richer and better with each passing record.</p><p>
    
    Only here's the thing: Surely a pop album lives or dies by its songs. And while the sounds here, apart from some sterile ""modern"" clicks and flourishes, climb their way past the pitfalls of the 25-year-old band, the songs here can't. Give any songwriter a couple decades, and the same things will happen-- the writing gets progressively more subtle, more sophisticated, until eventually it's curiously free of spark, always skirting the obvious old hooks in favor of something too professional to even notice. It's all here: the arch, wandering melodies; the methodically constructed key changes; the weirdly formless slow-and-quiet epics; the standard lyrical stew of religion and lust and fragile, innocent, faithful things in a dark, dark world. Yes, this group has spent the past 15 years trading in mood and atmosphere-- much more so than the relentlessly tight pop of their 1980s arena days. Yes, given enough time, they'll gather up into something passably engaging. No, no one's asking for karaoke classics. But none of the moods and atmospheres and slow-growers here stand much of a chance of reaching out and drawing you in-- or of making a believer out of anyone who didn't believe already.</p><p>
    
    The end product, then, is one of those signature artifacts of the Adult Band: an album we hardly even need to review. Depeche Mode's core fans will flip for it; it's the best thing they've released in a long while. Everyone else? It's pretty okay. And these days, over a decade since <i>Songs of Faith and Devotion</i>, well, you already know which of those two camps you fall into.</p></div>"|2285.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2285-playing-the-angel/|7.0|Nitsuh Abebe

    has become traditional for studios to wheel out indie
    coming-of-age films. Since we've been around this
    block before, we know to expect
    certain things from the soundtracks of these films, be
    they focused on teenage crisis, quarter-life crisis,
    mid-life crisis, or some combination of these infinite
    crises. Any compiler knows that a delicate mix of
    childlike whimsy and bittersweet melancholy is a must,

    more than up to the challenge of filling out the OST. He started by courting Elliott Smith, who was originally pegged to provide all of the film's music. Smith's erratic work rate delayed the proceedings, and his death halted them, forcing Mills to draft in the Polyphonic Spree, perhaps
    thinking he could at least save the money it would've
    cost to hire an orchestra.</em></p><p>
    
    To their credit, Tim DeLaughter's robed crew are adept
    at the whimsy part of the recipe stated above, as
    anyone who's heard their relentlessly optimistic brand
    of sun-cult music can attest. Though the format
    doesn't allow the Spree to indulge their usual
    slow-build dynamics, the band nevertheless finds the
    space to use all of their many parts, handing most of
    the vocals to their choir and letting the strings,
    horns, etc. flit around the borders. But with rarely
    more than a minute or so to unfurl, the songs lack
    heft, sounding a little like jingles for
    correspondence art schools and new-age massage
    centers.</p><p>
    
    However, as far as the Spree doing the
    melancholy part: Eh, not so much. Attempts at
    gravitas sound overly forced and unnatural for the
    band, with DeLaughter putting on his best Ben Gibbard
    impression for ""Sourness Makes It Right"" and the
    choral smiles being poorly hidden on ""Wait and See"". 
    Fortunately, Mills was able to salvage three demo-ish
    songs done by Smith, tremulous takes on Big Star's ""Thirteen"", Cat
    Stevens' ""Trouble"", and his own ""Let's Get Lost"".
    
    ""Thirteen"" is clearly the best of these, reverently
    remade as it is, Smith adding another sedimental layer
    of sadness to undercut Alex Chilton's already-longing
    adolescent reminiscences. But as accompaniment to a
    movie about a troubled teenager and his relationships,
    it's not the most subtle of soundtracking gestures. 
    Lack of subtlety is something that plagues
    the entire score, not surprising given the rainbow
    sledgehammer tactics of the Polyphonic Spree.</p><p> 
    
    In the end, this lack of grace is what keeps
    <em>Thumbsucker's OST from joining the ranks of excellent
    indie soundtracks alongside <i>The Virgin Suicides</i></em>, <em>Eternal
    Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, and anything Mark
    Mothersbaugh has done for Wes Anderson. The
    Polyphonic Spree, despite attempts to pare down their
    sound and numbers when appropriate, can't help but be
    too intrusive for cinematic usage, inserting
    themselves into scenes like that episode from ""Scrubs"",
    rather than providing constructive background color. </em></p></div>"|7897.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7897-thumbsucker-ost/|5.2|Rob Mitchum

Five years later, not much has changed. For more than a decade, the Memphis collective has been perfecting an impossibly thick and dark form of Southern rap. Nearly every track consists of the same ingredients: ghostly, glistening horror-movie synths, churning orchestral strings, enormously deep drum sounds, fuck-you-up gang chants, and violent knucklehead lyrics delivered in thick, wet, swollen Southern accents. If that sounds tedious, then that's sort of the point; Three 6 Mafia are an immersion thing. Like Lungfish or the Boredoms, Three 6 Mafia producers DJ Paul and Juicy J understand the psychedelic properties of repetition. Over the course of an album, these tracks pile up on top of each other and become a kind of narcotic haze, a blissfully paranoid house of mirrors, a world unto themselves.</p><p>
    By the time of 2003's stunning <em>Da Unbreakables</em>, the group had its approach down to a science. Everything on that album was so slow and hard and ominous that it practically bent the air. The group had winnowed its once-huge lineup down to four, and everything that they did sounded practiced and weathered and calculated, like they'd spent years figuring out exactly how to raise heart-rates and explode trunks. Something else happened in 2003, though: crunk blew up. The slower, darker end of the stuff that made its way to the radio (Lil Scrappy's ""No Problem"", Crime Mob's ""Knuck If You Buck"") was heavily and obviously indebted to the Three 6, but the group remained a regional empire, huge stars in Memphis and little-known outside the South. Promising Three 6 protgs like Lil Wyte and Frayser Boy made great records, but you weren't about to see them on MTV.</p><p>
    On the spoken introduction to <em>Most Known Unknown</em>, DJ Paul explains the title: ""Three 6 Mafia is known, but at the same time, they unknown. We got a lot to do with what's going on in hip-hop today, but niggas don't realize it."" But the album's opening song and first single, ""Stay Fly"", is a curious departure. The song finds the group's members rapping in double-time instead of their usual slow, slurry cadences, collaborating with fellow Tennessee rappers Eightball, MJG, and Young Buck instead of their own circle of friends, and, most shockingly, using the skittering percussion and tear-stained strings of dusty soul rather than the minor-key John Carpenter pianos they've been leaning on for years. It's a strong single, but it was also an unsettling sign that Paul and Juicy might be trying to become Kanye West. </p><p>
    But despite a new fondness for dusty r&amp;b; samples, Paul and Juicy have kept the black-hole stomp that has always made them great. <em>Most Known Unknown</em> is the group's most melodic album, but these lighter touches perfectly compliment the old eeriness. On ""Swervin'"" a gorgeous harp line floats above a storm of low, distorted bass, while the light, sprightly violins of ""Side 2 Side"" rub up against the stomp-stomp-clap drums perfectly. And ""Poppin' My Collar"" is just a beautiful song, its soaring strings and choral vocals offset just right by a slow, hard beat. <em>Most Known Unknown</em> doesn't carry the punch of <em>Da Unbreakables</em> (it's hard to top a posse cut built on a ""Carmina Burana"" sample), but Paul and Juicy's lighter touch makes for a few unexpectedly moving moments.</p><p>
    The group is now down to a trio, but those three guys have great voices: DJ Paul's weathered bark, Juicy J's wet, percussive under-the-beat slur, Crunchy Black's nasal, singsong rasp. The lyrics remain in full dumbshit slap-you-up mode; my favorite line is DJ Paul's ""Haters shaking like booties in the strip club/ I'll cut ya head off like Al-Qaeda in this bitch, what!"" This can occasionally veer into truly sickening eruptions of misogyny; the rape narrative that Paul throws on ""Let's Plan a Robbery"", especially, is unforgivable. But as a purely aesthetic experience, <em>Most Known Unknown</em> is like a summer thunderstorm-- gorgeous and humid and dangerous.</p></div>"|8303.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8303-most-known-unknown/|8.1|Tom Breihan

First, it's a catchall descriptor for fans of creaky old r&amp;b; and soul singles. For them, Cobras albums are crackling pieces of heaven, combining all the music's sex and danger with the detail of an archivist. Plus, buying stuff like <em>Baby or their memorable 1998 debut </em><em>Mink Rat or Rabbit saves hours wasted trolling mildew-y record shops and the back alleys of eBay. But ""Shangri-La"" also references the Cobras' connection to Memphis and Stax/Volt, Cooper-Young cool. They're conduits for the city's soul history, but they also have a contemporary link in Greg Cartwright: </em><em>Baby's co-producer and lately a fulltime Cobra, Cartwright was a member of Memphis garage rock instituions the Reigning Sound, the Oblivians, and Compulsive Gamblers, the last two of which recorded for...Shangri-La Records. That the Cobras' bash-and-slink versions of those old songs paint them as both interpreters and garage rock revivalists only completes the Shangri-la daisy chain.</em></p><p>
<em>Baby</em> was released on Rough Trade in the UK and Europe earlier this year, but in America it's the band's Bloodshot debut. They've picked out 12 more r&amp;b; obscurities, but also thrown in an original, the shamelessly salacious ""Hot Dog (Watch Me Eat)"" (""You bring the drinks, and I got the buns...""). Covering old cuts of r&amp;b; and soul as they do, you might expect Cobras vocalist Rachel Nagy to try on her damndest Carla Thomas or Aretha Franklin, or at least sing with cockeyed arm on hip. But instead Nagy sings with a cocky, slow-burn confidence that's throaty enough to handle the material but is all kinds of unique, too. Her voice places the Cobras on the cusp between purism and reinterpretation. Plus, if you want to push the intro bit even further, on ""It's Raining"" and ""Real Thing"" she suggests the dusky girl group growl of the Shangri-Las.</p><p>
    
    While Nagy's delivery is the Cobras' centerpiece, much of their famously kinetic groove comes from guitars that wrangle all trebly over drumming that's heavy on cymbals and wet snare. ""Cha Cha Twist"" is part fire, part whisper, and wants to turn your living room into a clothing-optional dance party, while Bobby Womack's ""Baby Help Me"" alternates its pleading verses with big trashy chords in the chorus and still finds time to reference the Percy Sledge version with a silky bass line.</p><p>
    
    The Cobras can crank out shimmy-ready numbers like ""Cha Cha"", ""Everybody's Going Wild"", and opener ""Slippin' Around"" (""We're making love 15 miles from town!"") in their sleep. But because things come easy for them, the Cobras might be tempted to coast a little-- and that's a factor on <em>Baby</em>. They're always raucous-- and Nagy is always on-- but the album can also leave you wondering, ""What if the Detroit Cobras covered this one or that one, or the deeper-in-the-stacks one?"" Luckily, they'll never run out of material for the very same reason. And when Nagy and the band really hit it, as on <em>Baby</em>'s ""Weak Spot"", ""Raining"", and ""Just Can't Please You"", you're too busy reveling in a band on top of their game to wonder what they could've been doing instead. </p></div>"|2298.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2298-baby/|7.5|Johnny Loftus

    Kinsella(s) and his rotating cast of enablers. It's <em>Presents
    Guitar Duets</em>, in which 10 once/current Joan of Arc members draw
    names out of a trucker hat to noodle us some, hey, guitar duets. The
    project would seem stinky-ripe for a haha 'fork-tongued concept review
    -- quick, get me the top 10 PFM crits ever to give it to Kinsella with
    a sandpaper Durex--  but seriously, why do we hate this guy again?
    More to the point: Why does anyone even care?</p><p>
    The venerable Brent D. was asked a similar question not a fortnight
    ago by his hunchbacked Hungarian masseuse, Ivanka. She confessed a
    lingering enjoyment of the first Cap'n Jazz record, the one you
    couldn't even get until it was reissued. She intently rubbed Brent's
    thigh. The new disc, she said, just seemed so relentlessly
    inessential-- 10 percussion-less, mathy, Brown Line-paced
    instrumental tendrils meandering about more like exercises than
    performances.</p><p>
    Sure, Ivanka swayed slightly to the first two tracks-- the ones
    redolent with the autumn-rain acoustic guitar of Record Label
    bankroller Bobby Burg, the guy behind overlooked naïve-pop vehicle the
    Love of Everything. But her work suffered over the next two
    duets, she gave her clients spasms during the swordfishtromboner
    cling-clang of track 5 (""Nate Kinsella/Ben Vida"") and set her Tazo-swigging
    receptionist napping by the beeping climax of track 8 (""Todd
    Mattei/Tim Kinsella"").</p><p>
    Recently laid off from a local unicorn abortion clinic, William Bowers' new
    personal trainer, DuKowski, had other ideas. Turns out things could
    be, have been, much, much worse. For instance: Instrumentals mean never
    having to hear Kinsella whine. And using the guitarists' names in song titles at least spares
    us Kinsella's usual flailing intellectualisms. DuKowski asked Bowers
    if he could feel the burn. No, but he could feel a blister, and with
    that turned up the volume on <em>Chase the Devil: Religious Music of
    the Appalachians</em>. Kinsella, ca. 2001: ""Why can't we stop all this
    blowjobishness?""</p><p>
    What else: A general post-post-rock malaise hangs over the whole
    affair, punchable as the Album Leaf, interspersed with academic John
    Faheyisms, clipped Michael Hedges and creaking, repetitive
    self-indulgence that can be heard all the way in Currituck County,
    Brooklyn. Almost dig the detuned finale, though. Pfork's Spencer Owen
    wept, Nick Mirov went on to review the Goo Goo Dolls, and one time I
    was in the same café as Julianne Shepherd. Anyway, who was Camilo
    Arturo Leslie? Brian Howe plays well with others and could probably
    'splain you my quote-unquote concept: <em>Presents: Guitar Duets</em> is
    exactly this insular, somnolent and unnecessary. As for David Moore,
    he moved overseas and was never heard from after rhapsodizing about the (Joan
    of) Arcade Fire.</p></div>"|4272.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4272-presents-guitar-duets/|3.5|Marc Hogan

    improvisational acumen have rendered them the toast of the current
    noise-rock crop-- all the while they've continued to tweak their post-hardcore/Harry Pussy formula.</p><p>
<em>Hypermagic Mountain</em> is Lightning Bolt's fourth, most well-oiled album: song-by-song
    it chugs into rockier Van Halen, Fucking Champs, or Orthrelm territory. Somewhere in
    the middle a lack of variety creates a dull patch, but even the more homogenized tracks slip
    by on the upped energy as well as subtle, virtuostic additions to the violence. The set was again captured by
    ex-Small Factory jangle-popper Dave Auchenbach, who mostly harnesses
    the band live to two-track (with some live mixing) and DAT. Because of the approach, <em>Hypermagic Mountain</em> breathes like a battering ram: The drums are gargantuan and, conversely,
    the vocals fold nicely into the buzz.</p><p>
    
    The sound's crowded-- the Boschian cover art is a solid
    visual analogue-- but Lightning Bolt make
    room for all their key ingredients: brief space excursions, lessons in
    dynamics, monster riffs, semi-humorous politicos, sugar-dosed energy.
    Everything you'd expect to find is here and in amped form-- festering bass
    (with that slippery balloon sound) and machete-slinging, crazy-climber
    drums. The components
    establish LB as more rock, less noise-- though they've always treaded closer to that realm than to Merzbow or Whitehouse.</p><p>
    
    The Brians' break the gate with ""2 Morro Morro Land"", upchucking a
    noodle before opting for the overdrive of a jaunty lick.
    The heavier, somehow portentous ""Captain Caveman"" connects for a second punch with
    Chippendale shouting somewhere in the midst of the commotion that ""this is the anthem."" Well,
    actually, it's one of many.</p><p>
    
    The next movement's spacier, focusing on ghosts: ""Riffwraiths"" and ""Mega Ghost"" include more entropic loops and echoed vocals-- especially on ""Mega"", which begins ambiently with dead-soul vocal echo. Fittingly, the first few minutes of zoomed drums and bass on ""Magic
    Mountain"" sound like an uphill climb. Like the best of immediate-minded
    rockers, LB kindly deliver. So no, none of that avant-noise
    tease: Despite still working on the outer edge of rock dynamics,
    when LB build to something, you can be assured it'll explode.</p><p>
    
    Elsewhere, there are anti-Bush theme papers (""Dead Cowboy"") and sludgy bass over cryogenic drums
    and brackish vocals (""Mohawk Windmill""). Continuing in the vein of lovely
    slower pieces-- i.e. <em>Wonderful Rainbow</em>'s ""Hello Morning"" or the title
    track; <em>Ride the Skies</em>' ""The Faire Folk""-- ""Infinity Farm"" is pitched
    pulsation and rattle with mellow baby squawk vocals. Think Black Dice
    and a little coterie of puppies.</p><p>
    
    As I just confirmed by peeking out my Brooklyn window, heavy metal's enjoying
    hipster popularity; it's entirely imaginable Lightning Bolt could
    impress fans of that middle world with this rock-oriented sound.
    But even with added hooks and sharper flavors, LB's previous release, <em>Wonderful Rainbow</em>, still possesses more variety and a certain je ne sais squall. So where does <em>Hypermagic Mountain</em> rest in the canon? Like the opening
    train ride of Thomas Mann's novel <i>Magic Mountain, it finds the band
    climbing toward some unknown peak, and while it attains
    great heights, there's also a now-again sound of wheels spinning, and every reason to believe LB still haven't reached their ultimate destination.</i></p></div>"|4788.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4788-hypermagic-mountain/|7.3|Brandon Stosuy

Over the course of their discography, Aidan Moffat and Malcolm Middleton have explored romance as an abstract notion constructed of the sordid lies people tell in order to pair off and-- as Aidan put it in one variation-- ""go home and make a mess."" On <em>The Last Romance</em>, their sixth proper studio album, Arab Strap present another song cycle detailing the craggy terrain that separates gloriously tawdry, dead-end sex from more lasting, mature (i.e. boring) relationships. But this time something wholly unexpected occurs, as the duo's notorious self-deprecating gloom here begins to lift, allowing the briefest rays of romantic comfort and satisfaction to flicker in the distance.</p><p>
    
    Throughout <em>The Last Romance</em>, Arab Strap's more familiar lyrical themes are thankfully bolstered by their boldest and most assured music to date, as they build confidently on the advances made on 2003's <em>Monday at the Hug &amp; Pint</em>. Gone entirely are their once-frequent plunky drum machines, replaced by a skillfully balanced array of piano, strings, and horns. And though as a vocalist Moffat remains his curmudgeonly limited self, never before have his vocals been so thoughtfully integrated into Middleton's arrangements-- check the way his croon expertly mirrors the cello on ""Confessions of a Big Brother""-- giving these performances an effortless, dyed-in-wool cohesion that their earlier pint-fuelled narratives sometimes lacked.</p><p>
    
    Over the years, Arab Strap have recorded an astonishing number of songs set in beds with dirty sheets, so the sleazy jolt of ""Stink"" opens <em>The Last Romance</em> in well-established territory, and with Moffat's customary disinterest in foreplay. ""Strangers waking up in the Monday morning stink/ Of course I feel sick, but it's not why you think,"" he sings over formidably roiling guitars, postponing for a moment the album's newfound streak of tenderness. Equally uneasy are tracks like the propulsive ""(If There's) No Hope For Us"" and ""Chat in Amsterdam, Winter 2003"", a heartsick, drumless mutter which eventually opens out into impressively dissonant smears of guitar while Moffat glumly intones, ""If we're having so much fun than how come I'm crying every Monday?/ Is it just to cancel out the laughter from Thursday 'til Sunday?""</p><p>
    
    It's on the aforementioned ""Confessions of a Big Brother"" that <em>The Last Romance</em> takes a deliberate turn, as Moffat begins to dole out the do-as-I-say-not-as-I've-done advice like a pub-bound St. Augustine: ""Try and be a gentleman, always tell the truth/ I'm not just a hypocrite, I'm jealous of your youth."" Evidently taking this solemn, introspective counsel to heart, the duo move promptly through some of the most warm-hearted material in their history, starting with the affectionate pillow talk of ""Come Round and Love Me"" (""It's on the tips of our tongues, but who'll be the first one to say it?"") and the wry, pro-monogamy pummel of ""Speed Date"".</p><p>
    
    On the piano-driven ""Dream Sequence"", the album's lead single, Arab Strap-- to their everlasting chagrin, no doubt-- even approach something of Coldplay's atmospheric sweep, although Chris Martin has certainly never demonstrated Aidan's overall ability to use the word ""fuck"" with such invention. Later, as the raucous, album-closing ""There Is No Ending"", achieves a brassy, Pogues-like swell, Moffat comes to identify romance as a curious, but welcome form of surrender: ""If you can love my growing gut, my rotten teeth and graying hair/ Then I can guarantee I'll do the same as long as you can bear."" And though such optimistic sentiments might initially sound jarring to those familiar with Moffat's cultivated persona as the surly bard of hungover, carnal ennui, <em>The Last Romance</em> should stand as proof that a little sunlight might just do Arab Strap some good.</p></div>"|275.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/275-the-last-romance/|8.0|Matthew Murphy

But Janes' So Cal roots thankfully don't dig too deep, and her influences fan out further. She cites Casey Kasem's Top 40 as influential, and names ties to the suburbs of D.C., jazz clubs of Philadelphia, and punk of Olympia, Wash.-- all forces that habitually manifest themselves in previous efforts, <em>Done Gone Fire and </em><em>Poison and Snakes</em>. Released on Sufjan Stevens' Asthmatic Kitty label (the former was produced by Stevens), both of her previous albums at once court and thwart expectations of Ms. Wanderlust and Mr. America's collaboration-- and both are so sprawling that they're frequently frustrating. Though the issue at hand is too many cooks, it isn't Stevens' doing on <em>Done Gone Fire</em>, or Rafter Roberts' on <em>Poison &amp; Snakes</em>. It's the schizo-stuff Janes throws in, intentionally or otherwise, that emerges seductively bluesy Jesus-lovin' indie pop, largely unremarkable and unfocused, and warbly to a fault.</p><p>
    
    Janes' purposeful strangeness might be beautiful-- her stabs at tradition, valuable-- if done right. On her latest album, Janes is joined by Los Angeles-based free jazz collective Create(!) with whom she eschews soulful pseudo-folk cuteness and reinterpret six spirituals and folk standards to door slams and trash can lid noises. Sufjan takes a leave of absence, and so does his aforementioned bells and whistles; produced and recorded by Chris Schlarb of Create(!) in a one-room shack, <em>Liz Janes &amp; Create(!)</em> banishes use of electric-instruments and remedies Janes' most irksome faults. Here Janes drops the affected Baez-warble, and Create(!) provide the strangeness she sometimes slaves too hard to arrive at; together, they revamp tradition to construct something strangely new, and surprisingly personal.</p><p>
    
    For better or for worse, this album creates the impression of spanning for ages in its under-half-an-hour run. There's little room to err, but they still manage: ""Lonesome Valley"", ""Be My Husband"", and ""All the Pretty Horses"" would lull tiny hippie babies to sleep in two minutes, tops. Janes sings ""Go to sleep, little baby,"" and problematically, it works too well. By the time ""Jesus Is a Dying Bed-Maker"" ups the pace, the attention-deficient will have fled before hearing Janes' sweetly admonishing ""well, well, well""; too bad, because it's here that Janes draws closest to stunning.</p></div>"|4349.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4349-liz-janes-create/|7.2|Rachel Khong

Stealing the party vibe from Golden Age hip-hop and the bratty arrogance of church-basement hardcore, Ninja High School leave the weight behind and make an album with a sharp ear and a positive, inclusive atmosphere.</p><p>
    
    From the first track of <em>Young Adults Against Suicide</em>, atonal mechanized bleeps bump uglies with funk basslines, and hip-hop beats meet with hardcore shouts-- all behind a barrel of quirky vocal samples. ""Jam Band Death Cult"" is a smooth, crafty pastiche of laid-back horns, gentle piano, and foot-tapping beats. There are barbershop quartet harmonies on a chorus about people wasting the band's time, while the group shouts, ""Shut the fuck up/ This is what's up"" through distorted mics with as much arrogance as exuberance.</p><p>
    
    The music is strangely buried in the mix, covered in a nostalgic haze, so it's the tag-team rapping and shouting that makes or breaks the record. To that end, the group displays more competence than personality. What are they shouting about? Not much. Jabber about who's the best band in the land, who's going home in ambulance, where the fucking party is at, and so on. They get close to a manifesto on ""Feverish Dream"" (opening with a line about crucifying Ian Mackaye and burying the Velvet Underground once and for all), but politics are not the band's strong suit. The glitch-addled tribute to Harry Belafonte on ""Nap"" is probably more sincere. <em>Young Adults Against Suicide</em> doesn't say ""Let's tear walls and preconceptions down,"" it says ""Party all right good times let's go fuck yeah."" (Just look at it as an acronym-- ""YAAS!"") It's the irreverent spirit that translates more than the content, and it works when the end result a party record, no less and no more. </p><p>
    
    The first few tracks establish the modus operandi, and the band becomes progressively more daring toward the record's center. After the aforementioned ""Nap"", ""Shake it Off"" merges the bassline from Talking Heads' ""Naive Melody (This Must Be the Place)"" with a ridiculously long ad-libbed scream, while asking the crowd to ""let the fucking sunshine in"" and then, of course, to shake-shake-shake-shake-shake-shake it off. With a little more emphasis on finding great beats instead of being the number one party-starters, the record could have avoided petering out in the final third. Not that there's any horrific missteps, or even a change in approach; It's just that the sugar rush has dissipated before the 12th track comes around.</p></div>"|5922.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5922-young-adults-against-suicide/|7.0|Jason Crock

Xiu Xiu and Larsen, each aware and vaguely admiring of the other, meet at a Jarboe show, exchange records, vow to stay in touch, and become so mutually enthralled that they actually follow through and record an album together. They meet up in Torino without much of a plan and immerse themselves in the studio with trad rock instruments plus a bunch of theremins and glockenspiels. They jam intensely around sketched-out song structures and sequence the most realized bits as an album, an ephemeral and fractured thing that mirrors its mode of creation.</p><p> 
    
    As listeners, we're rightfully wary of such one-off collaborations-- they often produce thrilling results in rap, where oversized personalities slam into one another explosively, but in indie rock, they can lead to a sort of hazy obscurantism as each musician tiptoes around the other's style. The results are often more <em>interesting</em> than realized, the sort of exploratory blurs that the <em>In the Fishtank</em> series often produces, which are easy to praise and then quickly forget about. And XXL may well wind up as such an artifact, prized by collectors but inessential for the causal fan. Nevertheless, it's surprisingly cohesive and focused for such a spontaneous production, largely because each band tempers the other's excesses. Xiu Xiu's confessional overstatement is as distinctly American as Larsen's cerebral reserve is European, and on <em>Ciautistico!</em>, they meet in the middle to create a music that scans as either a more rational Xiu Xiu, as on the structurally balanced instrumental tracks uninterrupted by dramatic shards of dissonance, or more emotional Larsen, as on the tracks where Stewart's aching vocals imbue the silvery drones with a messy human presence.</p><p> 
    
    As if striving to embody the impulses of both bands, <em>Ciautistico!</em> is both corporeal and weightless-- you feel the bodily plunk of each intoned string and chime, and the shimmering confusion of the resultant sound waves decaying and diffusing into one another. The tone is icy yet resonant, drops of water falling into a deep well. ""Paw Paw Paw Paw Paw Paw"" opens with a low three-note bass drone and watery synth washes, but instead of continuing down the path of abstraction, Larsen's insanely tight drummer and Stewart's timorous vocals bundle up the atmosphere into a gloomy pop song. This is immediately offset by the album's most daunting song, ""Minnie Mouseistic"", which plays like the sound effects for a radio drama-- discordant tones, gentle concussions, creaks and ratchets bloom in isolation on a field of silence. Certain moments are pure Xiu Xiu, like the svelte electro-throb of ""Ciao Ciautistico"" and the sparkling fountain of synths that closes ""Birthday Song"", but for the most part, Xiu Xiu and Larsen slip into a methodical mind-meld, shuffling melodies and countermelodies toward their logical conclusions. </p></div>"|8828.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8828-ciautistico/|7.0|Brian Howe

You can see them on tour and get a preview of the album to come in their live show, but aside from that, it's difficult to tell which direction their music will go next. If you'd heard <em>Spirit They're Gone</em> or <em>Danse Manatee</em> you could possibly have predicted the more difficult and abstract direction of <em>Here Comes the Indian</em> but you wouldn't have guessed they'd make something like <em>Campfire Songs</em> around the same time; if you'd heard the latter you'd might hazard a guess about <em>Sung Tongs</em> but <em>Feels</em> wouldn't necessarily strike you as the work of the same band.</p><p>  That said, the newly released <em>Feels</em> is not a total departure from <em>Sung Tongs</em>, and it actually tracks it quite closely in terms of the album's structure. It's apparent from the first few bars of ""Did You See the Words"" that A.C. begins in ""song"" mode, setting aside for the moment the soundscaping that defined the earlier records. The first spin is a tad disconcerting because, with its electric guitar and more trad band set-up, Animal Collective sound for the first time like what they've always been to detractors with more outré tastes: an indie rock band. The songs proceed with a logic that has more to do with the early experiments of Mercury Rev than say, Sebadoh, but where Animal Collective previously sounded as if they were working according to an unusual set of rules, the first half of <em>Feels</em> exists in relationship to music history, and not just any music history, but rock.</p><p>  I hear the ghosts of 1950s artists like Buddy Holly inside more straightforward pop songs ""Grass"" and ""The Purple Bottle"". On ""Grass"", the reverb on Avey Tare's voice adds a hiccup to every syllable and the guitar is processed to sound at times like the rollicking boogie-woogie piano rhythm. Of course, 50 years ago no one would have made a chorus out of loud, clipped screams synchronized to bashed drums (well, maybe Jerry Lee Lewis), and the conversational vocal harmony breakdown of ""The Purple Bottle"" jumps ahead a decade to a highly psychedelicized Beach Boys. Such moments are why the adolescent unpredictability of Animal Collective is such an asset-- they're able to tap into the narrative of Western pop while making it their own.</p><p>  Like Animal Collective's previous full length, <em>Feels</em> is sequenced carefully, with jauntier, tuneful numbers leading to an amorphous back half. The two transitional songs in the record's middle, ""Bees"" and ""Banshee Beat"", are among the best things Animal Collective has done. ""Bees"" imagines how a drifting pop song might sound inside the sonic universe of an Alice Coltrane album, with a trebly autoharp that is all strings and no body and sustained clusters of piano that bring to mind an ascension through clouds. ""Banshee Beat"" is even better. Animal Collective's signature approach to composition-- in which open chords are strummed repeatedly for longer than seems necessary to create a unique sense of tension relieved only by vocal chants and howls-- finds its apotheosis over these eight minutes. ""Daffy Duck"" is a further exploration of the ideas presented on ""Bees"", and ""Loch Raven"" is an uncharacteristically tender electro-acoustic lullaby, vaguely Aphexian in the way it mixes sine wave drones with a simple piano line and a cluster of wordless voices.</p><p>  The upbeat ""Turn Into Something"" brings the album back to where it started. <em>Feels</em> is an excellent record, one that, despite a more conventional approach, happens to get better over time. But it's also interesting to contemplate as a chapter in the Animal Collective story. If the childhood pals can stay friends and continue to inspire each other we may have some more great records down the road. At the moment they seem on a pretty heady plateau, but you don't get the idea listening to <em>Feels</em> that they've said nearly all they have to say.</p><p> </p></div>"|193.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/193-feels/|9.0|Mark Richardson

In some other universe (which they are doubtlessly exploring in between building analog synthesizers and soundtracking video art), they are superstars, riding the wave of meta-consciousness, outlining patterns that only make sense when you look at them a millions miles away. The dancers in this universe don't need hooks, because hooks only interrupt the flow. But what do Gonzalez and Russom sound like here and now? Is it enough to re-master forms mastered thirty years ago by people with a lot fewer expectations for sounding cool? And is post-modernism here to eat us all and throw away the bones?</p><p>
    The short truth is ""no, with a but"": If you're looking for flawlessly crafted minimalism, no less spacey than any of the duo's professed influences (throw in New Age pioneer Vangelis for good measure), <em>The Days of Mars</em> delivers. In fact, in terms of the genre, its four expansive pieces should be held as models of textbook precision. However, I can't shake the feeling that there's something missing. Though not a note is wasted, or drone abused, there's opacity to the music that ultimately leads me feeling a little malnourished. Of course, I also can't shake the feeling that I've heard this before, but that's not the root of why it doesn't stick: Maybe Gonzalez and Russom are craftspeople in a pool of artists. Or, maybe there really is only so much that can be wrung from a single chord progression-- but no, that's actually one of their strengths, treading the milky regions of The Singularity, perfectly at home with both advanced technology and the primordial One. No, I think the main problem with the album is that unless I make a conscious (or chemically enhanced) decision to invest myself in it, it seems just pleasant and as ephemeral as dark matter.</p><p>
    That said, I can't fault it on purely musical grounds. The late 2003 single ""Rise"" vibrates like a strobe light, with synthesized open fifths and the distant ring of overtones created by the natural resonance of layers upon layers of electronic tones. The minor-key (or more accurately, ""mode""-- this kind of harmony both predates and usurps traditional keys) figures operate in almost complete symbiosis, each connected to the last; should one fall apart, the whole piece changes color. Of course, willing participants will find it abundantly hypnotic, but even if you want to use ""Rise"" as background music, an orchestra of sine waves has a tendency to work wonders on the mind. Likewise, ""13 Moons"", though less propulsive than ""Rise"", seems at once distantly cosmic and conventionally pretty. Gonzalez and Russom are hardly inaccessible artists.</p><p>
    ""Black Spring"" is probably the most familiar sounding track on the album for me, especially after years of hearing film scores rip off Oldfield's ""Tubular Bells"". The flip side is that it's also very easy to recommend spacey newcomers dive into its near-13 minute sonic arc. <em>The Days of Mars</em> is in fact a great introduction to ""space music"" in general-- just don't blame me if I return for repeat plays less often than for, say, TD's <em>Phaedra</em> or Riley's <em>Persian Surgery Dervishes</em>. Still, in a landscape full of seen and unseen phenomena, where the unknown seems almost passé, Gonzalez and Russom make music for taking things in stride. By turns bleak and beautiful, this is music for a new, but vaguely familiar world.</p></div>"|2628.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2628-the-days-of-mars/|7.6|Dominique Leone

I don't know, I didn't read it. But combining the material of both Buckleys for a tribute record-- not to mention casting the net beyond folk or rock-- inevitably makes for a mixed bag.</i></p><p>
    
    The faithful: Most of the Tim Buckley covers strive in different ways to compensate for his distinctive, nimble voice. Magic Numbers imitate his swaying stop-start pace through ""Sing a Song For You"", imbued with their trademark sibling harmonies. They leave it with their personal stamp, but what was once so impeccably graceful is now a bit too precious with those breathy higher harmonies. Elsewhere, the Earlies' ""I Must Have Been Blind"" lays it on thick with a wall of vocal harmonies and wide-armed slow claps to reach the heights of Tim's original vocal. Sufjan Stevens takes on ""She Is"", and wisely moves the spotlight away from his limited voice and onto the arrangement, where he excels. The usual banjo and sparkling clean electric guitar are there, lifted by layers of airy woodwinds that hit untapped potential in the original. On the younger Buckley's side, Adem takes a brave one-man acoustic attempt at ""Mojo Pin"", keeping every note the same, and his able voice is the closest match to either Buckley (and sounds almost like father covering son). Stephen Fretwell's ""Morning Theft"" is a bit too faithful, dragged down in gushy sentimentalism, and points out the door Jeff left open for one too many amateur romantics.</p><p>
    
    The departures: Micah P. Hinson's confidently sung yet peculiar take through Jeff's ""Yard of Blonde Girls"", adding layers and building in volume as if it were one of his private demos, a perky back-porch pluck with no reverence to Jeff's grinding glam-happy original. King Creosote's ""Grace"" limits itself to accordion and simple acoustic strumming, yet nails the existential woe of the original without the vocal histrionics.</p><p>
    
    The not-so-departurous departures: The Engineers' ""Song to the Siren"" sounds a whole lot like the Engineers.</p><p>
    
    The mixed bag: The inclusion of artists like Matthew Herbert and Bitmap might make the disc more diverse, but it dissolves the focus. I'd have liked to hear a record of new sensitive folkies who feel the influence of Tim and admiration for Jeff. Bitmap's ""Dream Brother"" adds a thin coat of robot funk while leaving the structure unscratched. The new ""Everybody Here Wants You"" wipes the slate clean, and while the cooing vocals of Dani Siciliano and the slinking beat are a nice counterpoint to the original's exaggerated sensuality, the result is cold and aimless. </p><p>
    
    The surprises: Tunng deconstruct ""No Man Can Find the War"" to stunning effect, leaving fleet fingerpicking and low harmonies over subtle electronic percussion, with a casual delivery that makes the grim imagery of the lyrics even darker. Kathyrn Williams turns her scratchy limited range to an advantage, and her minimal, sunny take on ""Buzzin' Fly"" is easily most charming track. Maybe I'm wrong on the modern folk angle; the best tracks on <i>Dream Brother</i> are from artists who ignored expectations and dared to be themselves-- flaws and all. </p></div>"|996.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/996-dream-brother-the-songs-of-tim-and-jeff-buckley/|7.0|Jason Crock

Back in 2002, you had a blast either shellacking or safeguarding the San Fran trio's fidgety post-punk debut <i>Life, respectively aligning with the Ott or Bowers camps. Question is: How did Numbers ever cause such ballyhoo? Perhaps with the upsurge of ""The ____s"" bands, indie gatekeepers felt obligated to strike preemptively. Whether that meant sabotaging any possible cash-in with retro-crazed MTV2 and </i><i>NME or being the first to herald tomorrow's potential ""it"" band, Numbers dubiously pitted brother against brother in a war way bigger than its cause. So that's the history; here's the neatly packaged blurb: Numbers gleefully rehash excitable late 70s bands like Devo and XTC, their buoyancy unfazed by the unoriginal, derivative material.</i></p><p>
    
    Considering Numbers' lack of divulged material (their first two true LP's combine for less than 45 minutes), <em>We're Animals</em> feels like the long-awaited main event after two sneak previews, and the payoff is-- power-pop, sort of. It's like suddenly these guys believe they're the New Pornographers. <em>We're Animals</em> comes chock full of bubblegum hooks, vocal harmonies, and tripartite rock song structures (Gasp...bridges!). Unfortunately, Numbers' newfound Ritalin-treated sound doesn't mean more ideas, just longer ones, and the result is about as fun as an overstretched Slinky.</p><p>
    
    Topographically, the album resembles a grim cardiogram printout-- generally flat with a few spiked moments of nervy chaos. Opener ""Beast Life"" jerks you from point A to B, though the actual sections they divide play it safe technically. Lead singer Indra Dunis's incoherent squalls are also scrapped, supplanted by droning nursery rhyme cadences similar to Deerhoof's Satomi. ""Funny But Sad"" goes sing-song, Kim Deal-style, recalling the airy, simple verses of ""I Bleed"" and ""Invisible Man"". Despite a helter-skelter breakdown, the track ends with a campy call-and-answer titular chorus complemented by intermittent shouts of ""I laughed!/ I cried!"" </p><p>
    
    The emphasis to melody on <em>We're Animals</em> is reminiscent of off-kilter mutant disco hits such as ""I Know What Boys Like"". On ""The Fuck You Garage"", Dunis stoically half-sings, half-chants ""I know it well/ It looks like hell"" over a clumsy moog riff, eventually crash landing the song headfirst into a catatonic anti-chorus.  Here, the struggle between saccharine pop, deceptively saccharine pop and classic bloody nose punk becomes most apparent. <em>We're Animals</em> still has haywire guitars, bushwhacking rhythms, and those homemade synthesizers we're always hearing about, but the real story is the band's conflicted strategy for melody. Sadly, Numbers too often chicken-hearts, stifling catchiness immediately after having blunted a song's jittery fun beyond repair.</p></div>"|5867.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5867-were-animals/|6.0|Adam Moerder

The band has studiously stuck by the same sound for so many years that we already know how it's going to play before we even hear it. We know it's going to have that familiar honkytonk gravitas and hymnlike pacing, the same clever wordplay and powerful harmonies. These ingredients produced a classic of alt-country, 1995's <i>Old Paint, which intensifies the here-we-go-again vibe that shadows their subsequent releases: showcasing Janet Beveridge Bean and Catherine Irwin's vocal chops, that album was so good it pickpocketed all their tricks and left them no way to surprise us.</i></p><p>
    
    So <em>Thinking of You</em>, Freakwater's seventh album, would seem to throw a slight curveball: It features members of Califone as Irwin and Bean's backing band, along with stalwart bass player Dave Gay. But this album isn't the departure that collaboration might suggest; instead of taking them in noisier, experimental, or more modern directions-- toward, say, Bean's former band, Eleventh Day Dream-- Califone only helps Freakwater sound even more like themselves. Multi-instrumentalist Tim Rutili uses guitar, organ, and ukulele to add texture songs like ""Cricket Versus Ant"" and ""Jewel"", and Evelyn Weston's bowed saw adds a little mystery to ""Jack the Knife"", but the most prominent instrument remains pedal steel-- here courtesy of Jon Spiegel-- which accentuates the country melancholia on almost every song.</p><p>
    
    For Freakwater, the accompaniment is and always has been secondary; this is primarily a vocal-oriented band, and Bean and Irwin do the high-lonesome-in-a-crowded-bar sound better than just about anyone around. The opener, ""Right Brothers"", resounds like a torch song sung by arsonists, igniting a simmering verse into a fiery and forceful chorus. ""Loserville"" is so gorgeously bitter that it's difficult to decide if it's an anthem or a lament, and ""Upside Down"" is a perspective-twisting stomp that settles somewhere between defiant and self-deprecating. ""Sap"" is all wordplay about being lost for words: ""I fell like a thing that falls,"" Irwin sings. ""And I crashed like a thing that crashes,"" Bean responds. Before the song ends, they turn these tongue-tied similes in on themselves: ""I broke like the kind of thing that just can't bend,"" they sing in unison, ""and it went on and on and on like a thing that just won't end.""</p><p>
    
    Bean and Irwin favor an unhurried tempo that allows their voices to crescendo gradually and dramatically. This reliance slows some songs, stalls others. Califone enables them to quicken that pace, but not to move with any more agility, so the album's reach occasionally goes beyond the range of their harmonies. They inject some 60s spunk into ""So Strange"", but the song feels a little leaden despite its go-for-broke breakdown, and the closer ""Hi Ho Silver"" never quite reaches the heights it aims for. But the band's longevity is the result of perseverance and personality rather than innovation. Which is fine: theirs is a tradition-bound music, and <em>Thinking of You</em> just makes it sound like their tradition is no longer comprised of the typical prerock sources, but of every previous Freakwater album.</p></div>"|3185.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3185-thinking-of-you/|7.2|Stephen M.

    reason.  More than some sort of ill-defined genius or brilliance, what made this band so special is that they captured their era
    without sounding consigned to it.  Listening to ""Once in a Lifetime"" roughly 25 years after it was laid to tape-- and countless
    other tracks on this all-inclusive eight-disc box set-- their music is perhaps more relevant now than ever.</p><p>
    ""And you may ask yourself, 'How did I get here'?"" is a sort of omni-biographical prediction for every individual caught up in the
    information age.  It considers our lives as consumers-- lives spent consuming information, commercial goods, and trivialities-- and
    holds a magnifying glass to the moments when you look around at all you've collected and wonder what for.  Talking Heads had an
    uncanny ability to tie connecting threads between seemingly disjointed elements, both musically and lyrically, and what may come
    across in David Byrne's lyrics as simple quirkiness or detachment more often seems like an open-minded willingness to give voice
    to the ridiculous things that lie in the subconscious.</p><p>
    Talking Heads' roots extended to college at the Rhode Island School of Design, but they were truly forged in the crucible of New
    York City's burgeoning punk scene.  In a sense they were the polar opposite of the band they often opened for at CBGB, the Ramones.
    But, unapologetically egg-headed and eclectic, even funky, Talking Heads were more pop-art than punk, filling their music with
    head-spinning tempo changes, freaked-out vocals, and a healthy propensity for experimentation.  To say they were unique is like
    saying Thomas Jefferson was pretty smart-- even bands that have since tried to sound like them can't.</p><p>
    The band's importance is acknowledged basically everywhere-- they're even in the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame now-- so it's puzzling
    that it's taken their discography so long to receive the lavish treatment it deserves, something made even somewhat ironic by the
    band's early embrace of technology.  In fact, the CDs have always sounded vastly inferior to the original vinyl releases.  Enter
    the reissue gurus at Rhino, who've painstakingly assembled the definitive collection of the entire Talking Heads studio output.
    The <em>Brick</em> is an elegant presentation of all eight studio albums together in an austere white box embossed with the titles
    of the songs it contains. Each album is presented in DualDisc format, with the record and bonus tracks on the CD side, and a 5.1
    surround mix and video extras on the DVD side.</p><p>
    In addition to live footage, the set also calls attention to the band's early mastery of the video format.  Each of their music
    videos are included with their respective LPs, and each is in an artistic (if not technical) league that only a small fraction of
    videos produced during MTV's first decade achieved.  The fact that they're enjoyable on a level beyond nostalgia is impressive
    enough, but ""Love for Sale"" in particular, while hardly counting among the band's best songs, must rank among the best videos I've
    ever seen.  Making wickedly insightful and intuitive use of footage from commercials and consumer logos, the short culminates in
    the iconic transformation of the band into chocolate figurines.</p><p>
    As for the albums themselves, the clean remastering has made a spectacular difference in sound quality, boosting the levels and
    fleshing out the depth and dynamic range of the recordings.  The earliest albums benefit most-- <em>77</em> and <em>More Songs About
    Buildings and Food</em> sound better than ever, as punchy and nervy as the music they contain.  Those two albums effectively mark
    the band's first phase, with Chris Frantz and Tina Weymouth laying down thick, r&amp;b-influenced; grooves while Jerry Harrison and David
    Byrne, always an under-rated guitarist, offered up tricky interplay and dense texture.</p><p>
    Byrne was a riveting frontman from the start, and he gets away with vocal tics and singing way outside of his range here in a way
    few other performers have.  His eccentricity is the focal point of the classic ""Psycho Killer"", but it's songs like ""Uh Oh, Love
    Comes to Town"", ""Thank You for Sending Me an Angel"", and the cover of Al Green's ""Take Me to the River"" that emphasize how much
    each member brought to the table individually.  As an ensemble, they were beyond tight, and their ability to lock into a tense
    groove led them to transition away from the concise, bouncy weirdness of their first two records into darker and more abstract
    territory.</p><p>
    They began the transformation on 1979's <em>Fear of Music</em>, a willfully difficult, paranoid album that moves Byrne's anxieties
    to center stage.  Opener ""I Zimbra"" is something of a fake-out, hinting at the group's future experimentation with African
    polyrhythms and heavy groove, but its gibberish chant is actually fairly indicative of what follows.  On ""Mind"", Byrne's voice
    blurs with bizarre trickling synth and fractured bass; ""Paper"" and ""Air"" express uncertainty about our corporeal existence; Byrne
    smears irony over the record's most danceable rhythm track, ""Life During Wartime""; and ""Heaven"" paints the afterlife as a place
    of mind-numbing repetition: ""When this kiss is over it will start again/ It will not be any different/ It will be exactly the same,""
    he sings, sounding sober, almost resigned.  The album closes with a nightmare twosome in ""Electric Guitar"" and ""Drugs"", lysergic
    new wave tunes that collapse under their own oppressive weight.</p><p>
    The bleak intensity of <em>Fear of Music</em> crystallized on <em>Remain in Light</em>, the band's masterpiece.  Brian Eno had produced
    the band since <em>More Songs</em>, but here, he pushed them to stretch out and let their songs breathe as much as possible.  The lack
    of ego on the album is striking.  The band members switch instruments and share the spotlight with backup musicians-- Frantz is
    augmented by all manner of hand percussion, while Byrne gets plenty of help on the mic from huge choruses, often playing
    call-and-response.  The grooves of ""Cross-Eyed and Painless"" and ""The Great Curve"" are unstoppable, while opener ""The Heat Goes
    On (Born Under Punches)"" feels like a constant, burning descent into a cauldron of polyrhythms.  ""All I want is to breathe,"" sings
    Byrne in multi-tracked harmony, but the song is claustrophobic and constricted, refusing to allow his escape. ""The Overload"" is
    almost too dark, completely blotting out whatever small trace of sunlight might occasionally poke through earlier in the record.
    The album is a triumph, but it was understandably draining: Their follow-up took three years to complete.</p><p>
<em>Speaking in Tongues</em> was worth the wait.  Movement is in its fiber, but it's the details of the arrangements-- the buzzy synths
    that answer Byrne in the chorus of ""Making Flippy Floppy"", the clicking handclaps of ""Slippery People""-- that make the album's funk
    so deeply satisfying.  The mood is noticeably lighter as the band deftly extricate themselves from the seriousness of their two
    previous albums.  Where Byrne sounded trapped in a fragile body on <em>Fear of Music</em>, here he muses that ""We've got great big
    bodies/ We've got great big heads.""  ""Burning Down the House"" sets howling keys against mechanically fingered guitarwork and
    massive percussion, while ""This Must Be the Place (Naive Melody)"" wrenches human sadness from its synthesizer melody.  Elsewhere,
    ""Pull Up the Roots"" and ""Girlfriend Is Better"" find the band at their loosest.  Unfortunately, <em>Speaking in Tongues</em> was the
    last Talking Heads album that felt completely natural.</p><p>
    The band's final three albums are rarely discussed relative to what came before; they're not nearly as rewarding.  <em>Little
    Creatures</em> sported the outstanding single ""And She Was"", but is otherwise a staid, composed effort.  Where once there were
    once loose grooves, there was now noticeable stiffness, and the music feels beholden to pre-established concepts rather than
    allowed to form through free-associative interplay.  The follow-up, <em>True Stories</em>, was mostly filler packed in around the
    crunchy synth-rock of ""Love for Sale"" and ""Wild Wild Life"".  As an album, it has its moments (and yes, Radiohead took their name
    from one of its songs), but it largely fails, too tightly intertwined with the narrative of its cinematic counterpart.</p><p>
    The band's final album, 1988's <i>Naked, is a strange beast, essentially two completely different sets of songs playing against
    each other on the album's two halves.  The band began the recording process by assembling a series of grooves in New York, then
    traveled to Paris for overdub sessions, bringing in local African musicians (and Johnny Marr) in a slight return to the technique
    that made </i><i>Remain in Light so great.  It works on ""Blind"", a song beholden almost completely to its bubbling groove and sharp
    horn arrangement as Byrne sings in an unusual rasp.  ""(Nothing but) Flowers"" is ebullient highlife funk, essentially a wistful
    celebration of the end of civilization as Byrne offers lyrics like, ""This was a Pizza Hut/ Now it's all covered with daisies,"" over
    chattering guitars and ultra-fluid rhythms.  The record's flip, however, is much darker, almost completely divorced from what
    precedes it-- ""The Facts of Life"" is especially cold, with a mechanical synth and lyrics like, ""We are programmed happy little
    children.""</i></p><p>
    Still, <em>Naked</em> is, for me, the best and most interesting of the band's closing trio of albums, and if nothing else, it shows
    them attempting a fresher approach.  The quartet wouldn't officially announce their break-up until 1991, but they went out on a
    higher note than they're often given credit for.  The reissue appends the interesting soundtrack song ""Sax &amp; Violins"", which actually
    works as a strong closer for the album.  Generally speaking, though, the outtakes and leftovers from the band's earliest sessions
    are the best Rhino offers on these discs.  <em>77</em> especially is augmented by a wealth of rare tracks. ""Sugar on My Tongue""
    deserved to make the original tracklist, if not in this particular recorded form, and Arthur Russell shows up sawing up his cello
    on the interesting ""acoustic"" version of ""Psycho Killer"" (a number of electric instruments are present).</p><p>
    Beyond the quality of the actual music, Rhino has done a superb job of getting the sound of these albums to where it should have
    been long ago, and the bonus material is well-chosen and enlightening, if not essential listening.  Including the band's videos
    and live footage from the years before they made videos was a great idea, and despite its high price tag and some strange packaging
    decisions (the jewel cases have no printing on the spines, and the back covers are solid white, which means you have to remove the
    liner notes to find the tracklists), the box is worth it for anyone who wants everything in one place.  But of course, what ultimately
    matters most is the music, and listening to each of these records delivers something the elaborate artwork and fetishist packaging
    can't: proof this band deserves every kind word ever said about it.</p></div>"|8267.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8267-talking-heads-brick/|9.1|Joe Tangari

Expertly fusing classic rock, soul, blues, lo-fi, and punk into one throbbing machine, the Snakes mish-mash aesthetic inadvertently landed them in garage rock bins across the globe, rubbing stickers with the Hives and the Dirtbombs, shaking off the Standells and the <em>Nuggets</em> box, trying their best to reinvent the scrap-heap in a post-Beck universe.</p><p>
<em>Porcella</em>, the band's fourth full-length since their Toronto inception nearly a decade ago, is a funhouse, all warped mirrors and sliding floors, mellotron gurgles and trumpet hoots, too sinister to giggle away, too compelling to ignore. Much has already been made of the Deadly Snakes' self-proclaimed departure from their garage-rock roots-- but it turns out contemporary genre distinctions are actually just slippery (or meaningless) enough that the labels the Snakes are now so desperate to eschew (unlike the majority of garage revivalists, the Deadly Snakes are sophisticated songwriters and astute players) never really applied to them anyway. Consequently, <em>Porcella</em> is the next logical step in the Snakes' careful evolution-- dark, slinking, and packed with revelations.</p><p>
<em>Porcella</em> jerks from country-blues throwdowns with ""Jeeee-sus loves me!"" lyrics and typewriter drums (the semi-ridiculous ""Let It All Go"") to classic Snakes soul-tomfoolery (the freewheeling, honk-heavy ""Sissy Blues""), but never pauses for reflection or righteousness. <em>Porcella</em> may not be as explicitly ""garage"" as the band's previous records, but it still delivers the same beautiful, scrappy mess. Produced by vocalist/multi-instrumentalist Age of Danger (aka Max McCabe), <em>Porcella</em> sees Danger and Andre Ethier trading microphone duties, which provides interesting texture-- even if Ethier is the more interesting of the two.</p><p>
    
    Mostly, <em>Porcella</em> is at its best when it's at its creepiest: ""High Prices Going Down"" opens with clanking metal (think chain gangs) and a loping bassline, before Ethier starts to wail: ""I read the news and I heard it said/ There's 200 already dead/ High prices going down/ And the king gave up his crown/ High prices are going down/ My mind was abuzz like a swarm of bees/ And I did just as I pleased."" Ethier's throaty, desperate howls bounce off smarmy mellotron, while the grim details of his looting grow more and more topical. ""High Prices"" is followed by single ""Gore Veil"", a wisp of a song that delivers despite itself, all goofy ba-da-ba-bas and trumpet exaltations. It's a strange juxtaposition, but that's what <em>Porcella</em> is all about: laying the laughable alongside the profound. The Deadly Snakes may be incessantly compared to the Kingsmen and the Kinks, but <em>Porcella</em>, like all of their records, packs a healthy dose of Dylan, too-- particularly the band's penchant for dark, awkward poetry and seizure-inducing blowouts, often showcased in the very same song. </p></div>"|2520.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2520-porcella/|8.1|Amanda Petrusich

The Dead Science is one such band, and if it's going too far to speculate that they're emulating Xiu Xiu, it's still useful to outline those familiar strokes, lay them over the Dead Science's ornate contours, and note where they diverge. The affinity's not imagined; Jamie Stewart declared the Dead Science's Sam Mickens one of his favorite guitarists on this very site, calling his playing ""both cool and violent."" It's an apt description of Mickens's atmospheric and elegantly discordant style, but it also fits Stewart's own. Their milieus are so closely aligned, it's safe to venture that if you're in the nay-saying camp vis-à-vis Xiu Xiu, you can stop reading this review right now: There's nothing for you here.</p><p>
    The immediately striking resemblance is between Stewart's and Mickens's vocals. You wouldn't necessarily mistake one for the other; Stewart's voice is throatier and more delicate where Mickens' is thinner, with an almost flinty edge. But these are relatively minute distinctions; to the casual listener, the two will scan as analogous because of their highly affected, relentlessly melodramatic, and falsetto-heavy mien. More precisely, Mickens inhabits about half of Stewart's vocal range: Eschewing the harsh dynamic shifts that instantly catapult Stewart from a reedy mewl to a hoarse shout, Mickens hunkers down in his breathy falsetto, occasionally recalling Shudder to Think's Craig Wedren when he lets it drop into a sweetly menacing purr. This consistency paints the album monochromatically, but achieves powerful effects on the more ephemeral songs. On ""Sam Mickens' Dream"", he sings, ""I went to sleep/ Perchance to dream,"" his voice bending and quivering in a manner well-suited to the watery guitar strum that inches the song along. And on ""The Future, Forever (Until You Die)"", it seeps around the splintering chords and free-form percussion like tendrils of fog.</p><p>
    The Dead-Science-as-half-of-Xiu-Xiu tack is easy to continue from the vocals to the music-- were you to strip the bombastic synth workouts from Xiu Xiu's records, the brittle and burnished guitars that remained would be of a piece with the ones on <em>Frost Giant</em>, here augmented by Jherek Bischoff's upright bass and Nick Tamburro's restrained percussion. On a record full of diverging paths, the most memorable moments occur when all three surge as one: On ""Drrrty Magneto"", Mickens's guitar lilts through an ominous two-chord figure, then cascading drum rolls and a climbing bass line propel the song toward a shivering pulse. To portray the Dead Science as half of Xiu Xiu doesn't imply that they're only half as good; it simply means they've limited their palette, by choice or by necessity, to a less diverse assortment of hues. Whether this is negative or positive depends on how (and if) you like your nauseous grandeur-- crashing emphatically over your head, or insinuating sneakily under your skin. </p></div>"|2625.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2625-frost-giant/|7.4|Brian Howe

When music possesses such an uncomplicated immediacy, the story of how it was made and by whom is less crucial. The macro of Boards of Canada's music is so well ordered, so complete, that the stories of the constituent parts are incidental. I never much cared for Easter eggs anyway; with art like this I prefer to let my subconscious do the work of sorting things out. So I find this band's records easy to take at face value.</p>
<p><i> Geogaddi</i> was three years ago, and since that time Boards re-issued <i>Music Has the Right to Children</i> as well as early records like <i>Twosim. </i>With that small flood of material on the market at the same time we were able to digest Boards' career output as a whole and it became clear how deeply committed they are to a core sound that was quite well formed from the get-go. As long as Mike Sandison and Marcus Eoin are making music together they will always sound like Boards of Canada.</p>
<p><i> Geogaddi</i> was a few shades darker than what came before, but the grim hints of violence that record suggested are nowhere to be found on <i>The Campfire Headphase</i>. Instead, the latest record offers perhaps the dreamiest vision of the band yet. The first time through <i>Campfire</i>, I found myself wondering whether Stephen Wilkinson of Bibio had been offered a guest spot. Bibio got a small blip of buzz last year for <i>Fi</i>, his beguiling album of queasy four-track experiments with processed guitar. On the record he was promoted as a ""discovery"" of Boards, and, after listening to <i>The Campfire Headphase</i>, it's clear why they were so taken with his sound. Boards use of guitar on tracks like ""Chromakey Dreamcoat"" and ""Hey Saturday Sun"" makes explicit something about the band's sound that was always just beneath the surface: the connection of the music to the pastoral tradition of British folk. That feeling of nature's green as gold, the stream of sunlight through fluttering leaves, the communion with the environment that always involves a confrontation with death. There's a reason people bring weed with them on camping trips.</p>
<p>Of course, this being Boards of Canada, the guitar is first a sound tool, the familiar timbre of which is loaded down with the weight of emotional memory. So it's bent, stretched, spun in with the thick swirl of sound (<i>The Campfire Headphase </i>is a anything but minimalist) to become another ingredient in the record's stew. It bugs me that most of the songs here with guitar use one very simple picked chord and basically bring the loop in and out in predictable fashion. Perhaps because of the instrument's familiarity it naturally draws attention to itself, and there's no getting around that there's not very much happening with the guitar on most of the tracks where it appears. It adds nice twist, sure, but nothing more.</p>
<p>In terms of mood, <i>Campfire</i> is a sluggish record, weary, pointed edges dulled as if by the march of time. Boards could previously be counted on to offer a display of crisp, forceful drum programming to jar you out of your narcotic haze (""Telephasic Workshop"" and ""Gyroscope""). <i>The Campfire Headphase</i> is all midrange, the mid-tempo shuffles putting the mind-boggling array of instrumental processing front and center. In the sound generation department, at least, they're still hitting. The best thing Campfire Headphase has going is its unnamable synthesizer sounds. As copied as their aesthetic has been, it's amazing that after all this time they're still flat-out better at coming up with cool noises than just about everybody. The pure exercises in texture, like the minute-long between-track interludes like ""Ataronchronon"" and ""Constants Are Changing"" are among the record's high points.</p>
<p>These blissed-out narcotic interludes don't come quite often enough, though, and in fact this feels like a step down from the last two albums. It would be very hard <i>not</i> to step down from the heights scaled by those records, but by subtly altering their approach and adding bits of guitar <i>The Campfire Headphase</i> never really seems to give it a go. <i>The Campfire Headphase</i> is a good album and it's almost, but not quite, a good Boards of Canada album.</p></div>"|839.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/839-the-campfire-headphase/|7.6|Mark Richardson

    music critic, and renowned Friend of Thurston) isn't above
    street-teaming when the occasion calls for it. That there's also a
    brief essay/anecdote by Sonic Youth's A&amp;R; guy inside this Deluxe
    Edition package of <i>Goo doesn't keep Coley from doing his civic duty, heaping
    praise upon this album's shoulders via wonky descriptors like
    ""Mountain-on-Ketamine"" or ""a puzzle ballad about the road to oblivion."" However,
    amidst all the polysyllabic polish, Coley offers a bit of truth: ""[S]ome long-time fans were
    already croaking that the band was moving in a rockist direction,
    leaving behind the avant-noise roots that had marked their early
    history. Of course this was a load of happy horseshit. Sonic Youth had
    been rocking the fuck out from the git-go; they were just doing it in a
    language that most people didn't understand.""</i></p><p>
    
    Indeed, if 1991 was the year punk broke, then 1990-- the year Sonic
    Youth supposedly bit the wax tadpole-- was when punk decided to step off
    the ledge. No doubt there were folks at the base of the wall, trying to
    cushion the impact. And, of course, they all ended up with egg on their
    face, and <em>Goo in their lap. Fifteen years later, things have and haven't changed -- hair bands abound, but instead of Aquanet and spandex, they accessorize with chain
    wallets and MySpace accounts. And while Sonic Youth will never be ready
    for their close-up, there's stuff getting play on the radio stations
    that doesn't sound all too different from the more accessible moments
    offered on this here album.
    An album which, of course, doesn't sound all too different from the
    stuff SY was offering the kids prior to cashing Geffen checks, aside
    from those oh-so-important production values. Byron says howdy.</em></p><p>
    
    Thanks to the wonders of remastering, the gaudy glory of <em>Goo</em> is
    brought to the forefront. Thurston and Lee making like Lou and Sterling
    on ""Tunic"", the seven-second radio-dial montage leading into ""Mote"", the
    bombastic hissyfit at the end of ""Mildred Pierce""-- all new-to-you,
    brought to you now in hi-def quadrophonic Technicolor! And thanks to
    this being the Deluxe Edition, you can compare and contrast the bright
    and shiny <em>Goo against the storied and mythic </em><em>Goo</em> demos, which sound
    like, um, demos. You might prefer the ramshackle charm of ""Animals""
    over the hit-it-and-quit-it tightness of the finished product
    (""Mary-Christ""), but you have both here, so there's no need to really
    choose. My ears prefer the Hollywood 70mm treatment over the handheld
    shaky cam cuts, but there's something to be said for the three-minute
    fuck-you danging at the end of ""Blowjob"" (aka ""Mildred Pierce""). Also, the instrumental version of non-album cut ""Lee #2""-- a gentler,
    twangier Sonic Youth-- has it all over the previously unreleased version
    that makes the mistake of adding words.</p><p>
    
    As for the non-demo bonuses, they're there. The kick to be had
    listening to Thurston and Kim talk beat over snippets of <i>Goo</i> (as part
    of some flexidisc promo)-- woot to the Watt shoutout, T-- but
    there's a good reason it's at the end of the second disc. Elsewhere,
    the Youth cause a ruckus, cover the Boys Beach and Neon (with Lee, of
    course, playing the part of Brian Wilson in the former), and there's a
    bit of that catchy rockist stuff that some of the fans probably still
    can't stand. ""Can Song"" is three minutes of dirty booting that's hard
    to resist. That Thurston felt the need to preface the track-- now
    called ""The Bedroom"", previously released as a concert-recorded B-side--
    with a question about your mom being a skinhead is something best left
    between him and his therapist. Old transgressive habits die hard, I
    guess, just like punk supposedly did, way back when Sonic Youth deigned
    to pitch and shift their rock and roll to a decidedly bigger demographic
    and fuck it up for everyone. And fuck it up they did, thank God.</p></div>"|7349.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7349-goo-deluxe-edition/|8.5|David Raposa

The radio was AM-only, and as luck would have it, reception was poor and the only station it could pull was Lansing, Mich.'s version of the ""Golden Oldies"" format. Oldies, yes, these were the songs to hear in this car. Tooling through the streets while listening to pop singles from the late 1950s and early '60s through that factory-original system, the production of the era made perfect sense. Songs like the Flamingos' ""I Only Have Eyes for You"" or the Association's ""The Time it Is Today"", with all their lush reverb, opened up the single in-dash speaker and kept us in the middle of the music as if it was Dolby 5.1. Those producers knew exactly what they were doing.</p><p>  Reverb gives the illusion of immersion, and immersion is what the Clientele is all about. Singer and guitarist Alasdair Maclean writes songs that work like songs are supposed to, but I've no desire to hear them covered by another artist. Clientele songs are bound tightly to the performance and production; to separate them would destroy the effect. Still, the band's signature sonic trick-- laying a thick coating of reverb Maclean's voice in tribute to the AM radio production of the '60s-- has in a sense been isolating; such a relentless stylization is bound to turn away some people.</p><p>  There's a subtle shift in that regard here on <em>Strange Geometry</em>, the Clientele's second full-length. The reverb is toned down considerably, strings have been added (courtesy of Louis Philippe), and the album as a whole is more direct and focused. This clarity foregrounds Maclean's songwriting talent, a poetic ear tuned into a more surreal world, with darker images bumping against the bucolic scenes of records past. The music retains its easy tunefulness, but inside many of the songs lurks a desperation that seems new to the Clientele world. ""Crowds pulled you away, through the ribbons and the rain, and the ivy coiled around my hands"" in ""(I Can't Seem To) Make You Mine"". And then on the catchy mid-tempo ""E.M.P.T.Y."", Maclean sings, ""Driving west, now half past five/ My skin is cut, my hands are knives.""</p><p>  On previous Clientele records loneliness and romantic longing led to a hyper-aware state of quiet contemplation; here there's a vague suggestion of underlying violence. ""The crowd"" is mentioned throughout <em>Strange Geometry</em> but the narrator never seems part of it. Instead he wanders the streets seeing things--lifeless bodies in doorways, his own face inside trees-- that may or may not be there. Passages of blissed-out musical haiku like <em>Suburban Light</em>'s ""6 am Morningside"" or <em>The Violet Hour</em>'s ""Haunted Melody"" are nowhere to be found.</p><p>  It's not right to play up the differences too much, though; this is in most respects a classically ""Clientele"" record. The primary differences can be found by comparing the version of ""Impossible"" from last year's <em>Ariadne</em> EP with the one released here. On the former, Maclean's voice sounds like it's been bounced off the ionosphere an ocean away, and the band's instruments sound pinched and aged. The <em>Strange Geometry</em> version begins with a stately string arrangement as a lead-in to a much meatier sound, while sticking with the same basic arrangement. The slight nods to accessibility and the decreased stylization might disappoint some of the faithful at first, but <em>Strange Geometry</em> grows more appealing with repeated listening. On the whole, <em>Strange Geometry</em> does a better job than <em>The Violet Hour</em> translating the Clientele's aesthetic, which lends itself easily to the single or EP, to the demands of a full-length record. One of today's most consistently wonderful bands has kept up its long winning streak.</p><p> </p></div>"|1507.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1507-strange-geometry/|8.6|Mark Richardson

For those familiar with <em>The Captain Is Dead, Let the Drum Corps Dance!</em>, that album's ""You Were on My Side"" is a good reference point for the sound of their new album <em>No Rest For Ghosts</em>.</p><p>
    
    From the morose, existential lyrics to the goth cartoons in the liner notes and cross-stitched pink skull on the cover, <em>No Rest for Ghosts</em> aims for the cute side of the macabre. ""Little Wet Head"" describes being swallowed and regurgitated by an infant in disturbing detail (""You crawled, then you walked... you grew so huge that you blocked out the sun/ Then you go and you plant my head in your jaws""). That and ""Waking Up"" pick up the tempo at the center of the record, but love and loss loom heavy over the majority of the songs, particularly the slower tracks.</p><p>
    
    The mood may be monochromatic, but the band is never short on ideas. Percussion is inventive and clear as a bell, such as the thundering electric drums of ""I Was Hit"" or woodblocks that trip over themselves and fall into a bed of handclaps on ""Knocking on Your Head."" At other times, the sound seems cluttered, like when the piano and higher guitar notes bleed together on ""Ringing in the Dark"". Moreover, the percussion of ""Knocking on Your Head"" is more memorable than the melody, as are the backing vocals on the ponderously sad ""Hold On"". The touches in instrumentation make this an interesting listen with, like a walk on a rainy afternoon with a head full of stimulants, every detail flowering and compounding each other. But for better or for worse, the more the band holds back, the more the songs on <em>No Rest for Ghosts</em> rely on the featherweight vocals of frontman Jordan Geiger.</p><p>
    
    The spartan production is nothing new for the band, but the tamer they are, the more the lo-fi approach holds them back. Put the Minus Story in a room with Jon Brion or Dave Fridmann, they might come out with a masterpiece. For now, it sounds like someone let drama students loose in the band room.</p></div>"|5588.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5588-no-rest-for-ghosts/|7.3|Jason Crock

Normally, the GFM evangelist peacocks around fanning his feathers in either defense or exhibition, associating dissent with ignorance. His sermon is ""the essence, the movement.""  Hip-hop is <em>Hip-Hop</em>. Deviation is desertion, or worse, collusion. The Fifth Column of the Four Elements. Calm yourself, padre. Like every other genre, hip-hop inevitably striated with age; its own Paul McCartneys, Luther Vandrosses, and John Teshes emerged. No, Will Smith is not the answer. There are many answers. Snoop is pioneering Gangstadult. The Roots are morphing into rap's U2, producing reliable, if not necessarily revolutionary, album after album (?uestlove being the charismatic spokesperson for the group and the cause). Kanye may become the Phil Spector of all this with this on- and off-record antics. LL is LL. And fine, Will Smith is John Tesh. A whole cadre of underground artists, who were born too late, caters to this audience, creating a hip-hop analogy to the 1990s teenage Deadheads. J-Live is part of and apart from the adult-contempo scene, employing its smoothed-out boom-bap and socially conscious themes, but replacing its vexing nostalgia with ornery gravitas.</p><p>
    
    The weary, and thankfully non-preachy, tone of <em>The Hear After</em> probably has to do with J-Live's history. His legendary struggle to release his debut, <i>The Best Part, made him a grizzled vet before most had even heard his record in full. Written and recorded during the height of the underground revolt against gunclapper rappers in the mid- to late-90s, by the time it was properly released in 2001, <em>The Best Part</em></i> was a memento, a token of lost opportunity. In the interim, J-Live worked as public school teacher in Brooklyn, and his rhymes reflect the patient yet vigilant attitude of every good instructor. He doesn't need to get worked up; just keep plugging away in the hopes that your message will reach <em>just one child. Probably the album's best track, ""Brooklyn Public, Pt 1"" revisits the frustration of his teaching experience, but it also reflects the underground's increasingly futile efforts to convert the masses. Over a school-recital piano line, J-Live laments, ""Some of them really care about what's being learned and taught/ They fought through it when they got stuck/ Some are there until the bell rings/ Run through the day without thinking 'cause they really don't give a fuck."" It has become the teachers' code: save the ones you can, hope the other ones don't kill you. </em></p><p>
    
    While <em>The Hear After</em> probably won't appeal to the Bapesta Massive, it doesn't really try to either. The pared-down Roots-y production and edutainment factor might appeal more to their parents. ""Listening"" is a business-trip phone conversation between J-Live and his wife, Kola Rock, set to a whirling bass that evokes the comfort of a long engagement. ""Whoever"" is a night out at the neighborhood salsa club with J-Live calling out the punks that are not listening. It's also one of the several tracks J-Live produced himself, as per usual. What lesson did he learn from his early travails? Use samples owned by your parent label, Ryko, in this case.  </p><p>
    
    There really is no tragedy in J-Live's story, though. He was never set to break the mainstream. He's a sidewalk professor, the music more a conveyor of his lessons than an attempt at street anthems. He executes his tutorials with confident aplomb, never currying favor with a demographic that won't look him in his damn eye. It may not sound particularly vigorous or relevant, but neither is your dad. You should call him. Or just keep acting out.</p></div>"|4181.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4181-the-hear-after/|6.5|Peter Macia

Even marked down to $2.99, these albums will likely never sell, destined to haunt the cut-out bins and sale racks for eternity. Tim Fite's second full-length album and his major-label debut, <em>Gone Ain't Gone</em>, liberally samples some of these dusty artifacts into his songs and sonic collages, making them virtually indistinguishable from the live instruments. Whether he is rescuing or exploiting these works is debatable, but building off this type of pop culture effluvia is an intriguing, if not especially innovative, idea, especially considering how mp3s may make even used-CD stores obsolete. Fite's a collagist like the Avalanches and the Go! Team, for whom samples are their primary instruments, but like Beck, he's anchored to American music traditions like blues, folk, country, punk, and hip-hop.</p><p>
    
    ""I Hope Yer There"" kicks off <em>Gone Ain't Gone</em> with dark, trilling guitars that sound like dread-filled alarms, but Fite ruins the effect with his gummy down-home drawl and preacherly shout-outs, which add only bluster to his blues. He sounds like an avant-garde G. Love-- and going avant-garde is the only way G. Love could be worse. The remainder of <em>Gone Ain't Gone</em>, however, shows Fite to be a musical shapeshifter with an ambitiously broad repertoire of styles and sounds. He's at his best when he sticks to rock sources: ""No Good Here"" is jangly pop interrupted by blasts of loud guitar courtesy of some band called the Seymores, and ""A Little Bit"" bounces along on what sounds like a backmasked high-hat and waspbuzz guitar.</p><p>
    
    Throughout the album, though, Fite mixes his collage pop with false-sounding country hickisms and low-rent hip-hop exercises, which try to make a virtue out of their amateurishness. The territory between these two seemingly disparate genres has been well traveled by many artists (like Kid Rock, Bubba Sparxx, and, more recently, Cowboy Troy), and Fite doesn't have a whole lot to add except his foundational approach to sampling. That technique creates some interesting juxtapositions, such as the horn outro that caps the C&amp;W; class lament of ""Away from the Snakes"", but more often, it feeds a persona that seems disingenuous and grating, especially on the stuttering raps that derail ""I Hope Yer There"" and ""Forty-Five Remedies"". </p><p>
    
    The pointless jokiness of ""Cop Show"" reveals Fite to be something of an ironist (apparently confirmed by his press photo, which looks like a bug-eyed portrait from a circa-1962 college yearbook), while the sound bites on ""Toasted Rye"" (unattributed) and ""I've Kept Singing"" (from Paul Robeson) suggest a) That the album's theme is race and music, and b) That Fite is out of his depth. The distance between him and his music-- a distance filled mostly with others' music-- opens up the possibility for malignant caricature, as if the hip-hop elements are often just one step away from blackface. It's probably unintentional-- despite its ramshackle aesthetic, the album has the worked-over precision of a true labor of love-- but that doesn't really diminish its ugly potential. In the end, maybe all of these musical elements were simply never meant to be squashed together on the same album with Fite's overplayed persona, which will likely doom <em>Gone Ain't Gone</em> to suffer the same obscurity as its inspirations. That's no great tragedy. </p></div>"|3350.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3350-gone-aint-gone/|3.6|Stephen M. Deusner

He was abused by his dishonorably-discharged junky father and his stepfather, kicked out of high school, overmedicated in a mental hospital, became a white-rap wunderkind in the early 90s, almost put out an album on Columbia, kicked around the major label system, got hooked on drugs, had a kid, got dissed on the first Eminem album, and found himself a home in underground rap.  It's much more interesting than the stab stab stab, kill kill kill, drugs drugs drugs shit he's been rapping about for years.  <em>Hell's Winter</em>, then, is both a revelation and a forehead-slappingly obvious artistic move: The dude finally started drawing on his own experiences.</p><p>
<em>Hell's Winter</em> is a harrowing ride on which Cage describes his childhood in fractured blips of vivid images instead of broad, sweeping statements. On ""Too Heavy for Cherubs"", he matter-of-factly, almost gleefully, describes being forced to help his father shoot up: ""Erratic then gone, I went from manic to calm/ Watching the yellow liquid drip back out of his arm.""  On ""Peeranoia"", he recalls his own drug addiction with a boastful, entertained lightness: ""Didn't quit PCP, it quit me/ Reality rolled me up, took two puffs, then clipped me.""  But the album's mission comes into sharpest focus on ""Stripes"", where Cage's anger toward his father comes through without sarcasm or emotional distance.  Elsewhere, Cage applies this bleak disgust to subjects outside his past; ""Grand Ol' Party Crash"" has an obnoxiously bananas George W. Bush impression by Jello Biafra, but Cage also describes a soldier dying in the hospital: ""He gets word that his unit didn't make it/ Got a free ticket home, but flatlined before he got to take it.""</p><p>
    Of course, Cage also remains a demonic shock-rapper, and that side of him is fully on display here. He still bashes his old label boss, still fantasizes about murderous rampages, and unfortunately still says stuff like, ""There's a thin line between love and a fuck/ And how drunk she gotta be to put it in her butt."" But part of what makes <em>Hell's Winter</em> work is that Cage still sounds hungry and savage and wild-eyed; it wouldn't be anywhere near as charged or scalding if he'd turned into Atmosphere overnight.
    </p><p>
    Even without the lyrics, <em>Hell's Winter</em> is the fullest realization of the Def Jux aesthetic since Mr. Lif's <em>I Phantom</em>. Much of the production comes from El-P, Central Services, and Blockhead, and all three rub heavy falling-down-stairs drums and glitchworks against gorgeously spacey blankets of synth. DJ Shadow's track for ""Grand Ol' Party Crash"" is an amelodic fuzzed-out stomper, while Camu gives the fiery posse cut ""Left It to Us"" a metal-fried guitar lope. Best of all, Rjd2's track for ""Shoot Frank"" is a tragically beautiful showstopper: dying house pianos over moaning female vocals and rolling martial drums, with a stunningly sad and resigned hook crooned by (of all people) Glassjaw's Darryl Palumbo.  Like the rest of <em>Hell's Winter</em>, it shows what happens when the smartest people in indie rap decide to stop farting around and make something that resonates.

As our introduction to Dungen, <em>Ta Det Lugnt was like dessert before the appetizer-- it felt like cheating. Its retrofit so accurate and uncontrived, its swagger so fully detailed, the album came almost too effortlessly. Where was the artistic struggle? Who was this bodacious stoner with amazing hair, dusting off instant classics over </em><em>husmanskost</em>?</p><p> 
    
    There was backstory alright-- one needed only decipher Swedish to begin to look for it. But even a cursory familiarity with <em>Dungen</em>, the ungainly psilocybic debut, and the recently reissued <em>Stadsvandringar</em>, the more composed sophomore effort, reveals an unexpected twist: cheese is where wonder boy's heart really lies.</p><p>
    
    If <em>Ta Det Lugnt</em> emerged untainted from a 30-plus-year cryogenic sleep, <em>Stadsvandringar</em> is the schizophrenic nightmare. Beatles and Tulls live a diatonic turn apart, crossbreeding most openly on ""Solen Stiger Upp"", whose prominent flutes disorient by dint of overhybridization, unsure whether to trill or thrill. ""Fest"" further sows confusion, tiptoeing a creaky ""Blackbird"" back porch before blowing the shit asunder. The faux-heavy outro loses a photo-finish to ""Sol &amp; Regn"", which harmonizes woodsy fiddle and sunburnt guitar, in the race to sully Gustav Ejstes' integrity.</p><p>
    
    So timeless psych-rock opus wasn't always the M.O.-- fear not, Scandinavians aren't born with Creation's catalog grafted to memory. Before realizing <em>TDL</em>, Ejstes made some hardcore realizations: ""I questioned everything about music,"" he told Pitchfork's Brandon Stosuy. ""What's music? What's the meaning of it? I play G Minor and it's 'yeah yeah, I love you.' I was sick of it.""</p><p>
    
    Oh, duh, intense self-reflection-- <em>that's</em> how you make compelling art. While <em>Stadsvandringar</em> marks a quantum leap forward from the noodly debut, the album pulls up at that gaping, pre-revelation void. Nothing on the disc touches <em>TDL</em>'s bittersweet brilliance; riff-to-riff combat is a laugher. Where the latter mussed its pulchritude with conflict and cynicism, these diaper dandies are pleasure without the price. ""Stockholm"" is typical DOON-yun molasses sway, all top-heavy acoustic strum and underlying synth peals, but damned be that textbook half-cadence resolution. Spare us the theory lesson, tack.</p><p>
    
    Non-speakers are at a disadvantage here: Without lyrics, we're ill-equipped to give <em>Stadsvandringar</em>-- or any of Ejstes' output-- a full rendering. In lieu of this important knowledge, then, join me in a listener participation exercise: Imagine Ejstes spitting your soupiest live journal stanza over ""Natten Blir Dag""'s vanilla verses. Now over ""Festival"". On which do the vox put their best sore thumb foreward? And on which do you not give a flying fuck what's being said?</p><p>
    
    All this isn't to say <em>Stadsvandringar</em> is a poorly made album; in fact, by 2001 Ejstes had helmed a lot of the techniques-- frenetic jazz-rock drumming, fluid electro-acoustic interplay, whooshing abysses of reverb-- key to <i>TDL</i>'s sound. But one can see how it could've made a man ill, making such sap as ""Natten Blir Dag"" when there's clearly the desire to branch out. Dungen made sense-- what tyro doesn't want to write 18-minute epics? But the shaky transition to pop form is fascinating because it renders <em>Ta Det Lugnt</em> even more improbable-- it was a breakthrough of heroic proportions, the stuff <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0268978/?fr=c2l0ZT1kZnx0dD0xfGZiPXV8cG49MHxrdz0xfHE9YSBiZWF1dGlmdWwgbWluZHxmdD0xfG14PTIwfGxtPTUwMHxjbz0xfGh0bWw9MXxubT0x;fc=1;ft=21;fm=1"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><http:> &gt;weepy biopics</http:></a> are made of.</p></div>"|2576.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2576-stadsvandringar/|6.3|Sam Ubl

You're just suddenly in it, like a silver pinball shot into the screwy Op art lock groove of its cover. The prickly microhouse rhythms he brought to 2003's <em>Leave Luck to Heaven</em> are still present, but as Audion Matthew Dear tops those stipples with synthesizers that growl and an attitude that says, ""Come on."" With this record, the only thing you're supposed to do is get off. Oscillating tones pierce the beat repeatedly on opener ""Vegetables"", and pretty soon there are manipulated voices in there too, mumbling alone in your mind. But that's just a preamble to the <em>Suckfish</em> thump of ""Your Place or Mine"" and ""Titty Fuck"". There are elements of empty space in the former-- Dear snips off the bass except for right over the drum so the synths are like pointy elbows jutting into the open space on a dancefloor, and the effect is chilly. But if their titles didn't give it away these songs are pretty randy, too-- <em>Suckfish</em> is techno that tumbles towards ecstasy in 4/4 time.</p><p>
    
    ""Your Place or Mine"" is cool, but it's ""Titty Fuck"" that's the real base desire provider, its slinky 22nd century disco beat flirting with a five-note melodic tickler until the whole thing swells to a hissing, gritty finale that's just unclean. Back alley sex = bad idea. But that's the feel Dear is going for with Audion, however detached and dirty it is. He wants you to envision having relations among machines, or maybe machines having relations; either way, he provides tracks like ""Kisses"" and ""The Pong"" to do it to. ""Pong""'s primary tone thrusts and eases back, the inevitable give and take of a frantically dancing crowd in a dark basement room, and a howling bass line alternates with blasts of clattering rhythm and quieter moments that sound like pinging sonar.</p><p>
    
    The calculated quality of <em>Suckfish</em> is part of its allure. Unlike Nympho, Armand Van Helden's recent foray into sexified disco-punk obviousness, Dear has specifically categorized ""Titty Fuck,"" the fluid, tense ""Uvular"", and the rest as being separate from himself. (You won't see something like the blatant ""Just Fucking"" on <em>Leave Luck to Heaven</em>'s follow-up.) Releasing them under an alias allows Dear to position this material as a separate project, a grand design to get you laid. And the designer? Audion, which doesn't sound the least bit human and instead suggests a faceless superintelligent robot or hard plastic nub that will exude soothing ""penetration sounds"" in some Huxley sex parlor of the future. This is opposite to Van Helden's all too manmade and selfish approach, like bad cologne and worse drugs versus the sleek lines of <em>Suckfish</em>, the sex toy prototype.</p></div>"|488.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/488-suckfish/|8.0|Johnny Loftus

Without much fanfare, the Portland, Maine-based group has constructed a broad and unwieldy discography that is resistant to blanket judgements. But for their 11th release, the avant-garde troupe have issued what is surely their most topical, lyrically-focused collection, and the <em>The Land We All Believe In</em> emerges as a magnanimous, comic investigation into realities both political and otherwise. Along the route Cerberus Shoal maintain their catholic approach to instrumentation and deformed pop structures, resulting in their loopiest piece of sonic theater to date.</p><p>
    
    Over the course of their now decade-plus career, Cerberus Shoal's sound has undergone a higher-than-average number of directional shifts, due primarily to their ever-revolving membership. Since 2003's <i>Chaiming the Knoblessone, however, the roster has relatively stabilized into a regular septet that now also includes percussionist Tim Morin. Produced by Scott Colburn, longtime cohort of the Sun City Girls and John Fahey's Revenent label, the music on <em>The Land We All Believe In</em> continues to function without an absolute center. In true ensemble form everyone takes turns sharing vocal duties and assuming the spotlight, and never before has the group sounded further afield from their indie-punk origins. Here in fact there are long stretches where they instead explore various pre-rock forms, roaming freely through gnarled ethnic folk, woozy sea chanteys, and trilling showtunes in a manner reminiscent of a looser, more rustic Thinking Fellers Union Local #282.</i></p><p>
    
    ""Reality, you are not quite what you used to be,"" sing Colleen Kinsella and Erin Davidson over banjo and clattering percussion on the elegiac opening title track, a sentiment that the group then proceed to repeatedly confirm over the course of the next hour. Founding member Chriss Sutherland pilots the manic ""Wyrm"" over choppy waters, vocalizing in his own distinct, impenetrable dialect; while ""Pie for the President"" prescribes a unique form of activism (""Bring a pie to ze president/ I want to feed him big sausages"") and ""Junior"" perhaps takes further oblique swipes at our Commander in Chief, ""Junior, I've got something to tell you/ All that you fear is shit.""</p><p>
    
    Things come increasingly unhinged on the epic-length ""The Ghosts Are Greedy"", which contains an extended mid-song spoken word segment railing against the government, media coverage, and the mysterious ""Dr. Draino"". Eventually this track opens into a reassuring coda that optimistically proclaims, ""There is no conflict...We belong united,"" noble sentiments that would likely be more persuasive were the group's vocals not so progressively melodramatic and Muppet-like. And as the album closes with the jazzily skewed ""Taking Out the Enemy"", one is left with the impression that perhaps Cerberus Shoal make their best arguments in favor of a tolerant, egoless unity at those times when they all keep their mouths shut and let their playfully audacious music do their talking.</p></div>"|1387.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1387-the-land-we-all-believe-in/|7.3|Matthew Murphy

    Singer Keith Murray is the ringer of this scrappy crew. His calm, romantic delivery takes these constantly shifting tracks, with guitars filling every corner of the compositions, and makes them a little more palatable. For a band that's going to incur some Hot Hot Heat references for their spastic but accessible take on indie rock, his professional croon is a pleasant counterpoint to Steve Bays' yelp.</p><p>
    
    The band attempts to deliver a perfect single on every track, and expectedly, only a few deliver that rush. While ""Nobody Move, Nobody Get Hurt"" comes on a little too strong, the following ""This Scene Is Dead"" and ""Inaction"" quickly find their groove. ""This Scene Is Dead"" plays like a cuddlier version of Les Savy Fav's ""The Sweat Descends"", a few notes of guitar reverberating over the verses before a churning chorus, and ""Inaction"" loses no momentum through its rhythmic twists and turns.</p><p>
    
    The band does their best to change the beat and keep it fresh between the three of them (bass, guitar, and drums) while straddling the line between indie and pop-punk. But somewhere around ""Cash Cow"", a pattern starts to emerge: a herky-jerk indie-safe verse meets with soaring stretched vowels and downstrokes on the chorus. It's an effective formula, provided it isn't used on 12 consecutive tracks.</p><p>
    
    There are a few songs that transcend the cut-and-paste approach, like the punk-inflected ""Callbacks"", Murray's Devo-like inflection on the giddy repetition of ""The Great Escape"", and the slower ""Can't Lose"". On ""Can't Lose"", the rhythm section stutters like an engine with one piston, and while the chorus pulls the same trick as all the others, the band comes up with a brief bridge that's so unassuming and tender it contrasts with the entire album. Most of these tracks have hooks aimed straight for your jugular, but ""Can't Lose"" shows the band could go even farther with a little restraint.</p></div>"|8805.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8805-with-love-and-squalor/|6.7|Jason Crock

    were important. I was in high school, and I plucked <em>Mall</em> from a 99-cent bin because it was cheap and I wanted to hear something new. That's 
    right, <i>Mall</i>. It was the worst possible intro to the band, the 
    still-born result of Andy Gill and Jon King's first reunion under the name. 
    I slogged through ""Cadillac"" and ""F.M.U.S.A."" a few times, shelved it, and 
    forgot about the Gang of Four until I began to hear rumblings about their 
    brilliance a couple of years later.</p><p>
    
    Since <em>Mall</em> belly-flopped into the cut-out racks in 1991 there have been two 
    more revivals of the Gang of Four name. The first brought Gill &amp; King 
    together in 1995 for the passable <em>Shrinkwrapped</em> album; the most 
    recent (and ongoing) reunion brought back the much-vaunted 
    original lineup in full. Hugo Burnham and Dave Allen get less credit, but they were 
    every bit as important to the band's airtight, brittle funk-punk as their 
    mates, and having them back has turned the reunited band into a genuine 
    powerhouse. Of course, it helps to have some good songs to play, and it's an 
    understatement to say that the tracks from <em>Entertainment! and </em><em>Solid Gold have held up damn well over the decades. The rest of their catalog, recorded  with varying line-ups, hasn't been so lucky, but they wisely steer clear of most of it in the set-lists of their marathon tours.</em></p><p>
    
    These reunion things can be dodgy propositions, but Gang of Four's live 
    attack is as savage as ever, even without new songs to change things up. New 
    songs from old acts tend to disappointing anyway-- just look at ""Bam Thwok"" or, more to the point, anything Gill and King did in the absence of 
    Burnham and Allen. So the show is great, a slightly ironic nostalgia trip 
    down Agit-pop Memory Lane and a chance for the original item to show all the 
    worshipful kiddies who've taken their sound and run off with it how it's 
    really done.</p><p>
    
    So the next logical step following the accolades is to release a live album 
    documenting every ass-kicking highlight of the show, right? Well, not 
    exactly. Gang of Four have instead hit the studio to capture the spirit of 
    their live show, in the way they feel the old albums never did. It's the 
    band's right to feel they're upgrading their old work to some standard they 
    think it fell short of (Burnham apparently hated the drum sound on the 
    original records), but last I checked, almost no one else was talking about 
    room for improvement where ""To Hell With Poverty"" and ""Damaged Goods"" were 
    concerned.</p><p>
    
    And as far as the material from the records made with the original line-up 
    goes, there is no improvement. It sounds good, of course, simultaneously 
    heavier and less abrasive than the old tracks, and certainly not worse, but 
    it does feel a little pointless to take in these new studio versions when 
    I've got the old ones sitting right there on a shelf. They 
    revive two songs from their third album <em>Songs of the Free</em>, made after 
    baked-goods mogul Sara Lee took over from Allen on the bass, and have vastly improved both of them. ""I Love a Man in 
    Uniform"" and ""We Live As We Dream, Alone,"" were both fantastic songs trapped 
    in lead-assed funk bodies and hideous over-production; here they strip away the hired backing vocalists, kick up 
    the tempos, and attack the songs with the righteous fury they deserve.</p><p>
    
    And speaking of righteous fury, it's time to hit that touchy 
    Marxism/Capitalism subject, because there are reasons beyond the drum sound 
    that the band chose to make this record. If you're among the naive and 
    idealistic crowd who believe Gang of Four to be unassailable ideologues, 
    champions of the proles, guys who'd never in a million years do anything 
    just to make a buck, feel free to put your fingers in your ears and yell ""la 
    la la"" for the rest of the paragraph. It began back in 1979, when the band 
    signed a poor contract with EMI (a move that earned them the rather 
    self-important scorn of erstwhile kindred spirits like Crass and the Ex). To 
    date, Gang of Four still have unrecouped advances on their EMI catalog and 
    have never seen a dime of royalty cash from sales. So in order to pre-empt 
    an attempt by their old label to cash in on the reunion with a best-of 
    compilation they'd see no money from, they made their own best-of album, 
    recording new masters that they'll be able to earn royalties from. It's good 
    business.</p><p>
    
    There's also a ""bonus"" 
    disc of remixes that in all honesty ought to have been limited to an edition 
    of zero. It's not all a horror show-- Ladytron and the Rakes both do nifty things with ""Natural's Not in it"" (the source tapes are the new recordings) and Karen O gets to live the dream on the Yeah Yeah Yeahs remix of ""I Love a Man in Uniform"", taking the chorus herself while her bandmates recontextualize the song's beat as straight disco. The rest? Let's just say that Hot Hot Heat's remix of ""Damaged Goods"" is the worst track I've heard all 
    year, clipping the vocals and placing them awkwardly around a criminally 
    naff beat. King's chopped voice sounds like it's begging for release from 
    the fifth level of Hell. At least Go Home Productions had the good sense to 
    realize that there's no way to improve on the bass and drum groove of ""To 
    Hell With Poverty"" and just got rid of it entirely instead of trying to 
    tweak it.</p><p>
    
    Amusement Parks on Fire come close to making a decent dubside for ""Why 
    Theory?"" but ruin it with laser noises and gratuitous programming that feels 
    placed in out of an obligation to fill sonic space. And that's ultimately 
    what the whole release winds up doing, filling space. Whether or not Gang of 
    Four write any new songs during this latest stint together is moot-- their 
    legacy is already sealed. The old songs still sound great, while the new 
    drum sound and wetter, louder production just sound modern; in an odd way 
    it's already more dated than the sound of the original albums. Bottom line 
    is that if you've got the old albums and you want to experience Gang of 
    Four again, better to shell out for the actual show than for the disc that 
    approximates it. Good on the band for getting in touch with their inner 
    capitalists, but <em>Return the Gift</em> is ultimately superfluous.</p></div>"|3390.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3390-return-the-gift/|6.0|Joe Tangari

His vocals are flamboyant, manic, and completely over-the-top on <em>Chandeliers in the Savannah</em>, Neon Blonde's first full length. The main difference between Blood Brothers and Neon Blonde, however, is that instead of the searing, angst-fueled punk rock, this disc hands over track after track of eclectic electro-trash and danceable noise rock.</p><p>
    
    The band excels at combining stripped-down electric beats and synths with more organic elements, such as piano, acoustic guitar, and saxophone. Many of the album's stronger tracks feature the piano as the prominent instrument, including ""Chandeliers and Vines"", an almost tender ballad if not for the 20-second wall-of-noise freak-out in the middle. On the other hand, jagged guitar lines and simple programmed beats assault the listener elsewhere on the disc, with Whitney channeling Brainiac's Timmy Taylor in full-on spazzcore mode. It's that sort of track-to-track variety that keeps <em>Chandeliers in the Savannah</em> interesting.</p><p>
    
    While ""Black Cactus Killers"", ""Princess Skullface Sings"", and ""Dead Mellotron"" rattle with heart attack inducing rock, ""Crystal Beaches Never Turned Me On"" and ""The Future Is a Mesh Stallion"" are as dance as they are punk. The band touches on a bit of everything, from glam to post-punk to lounge, and slams it all together like they're using some sort warped Cronenberg creation made from the spare parts of old Casio keyboards. <em>Chandeliers in the Savannah</em> is dark, mysterious, and challenging, but ultimately rewarding. It never feels contrived, never odd for the sake of being odd. And although there's definitely a sense of improvisation and freewheeling here, the band is precise, tight when it's necessary, and never excessively sloppy. </p><p>
    
    Whitney's voice fits perfectly with this style. Whereas in his primetime gig, his voice is jarring, at times almost gimmicky, here it's just one more layer in an already flavor-rich pie. On ""Headlines"", released as a single earlier this year, he goes from high-pitched trilling to scratchy and strained with ease, all while the repetitive drum beat and driving piano drone on behind him. ""Love Hounds"" features rapid-fire, almost spoken verses over guitar caterwauling, and then slides into the disc's catchiest chorus. Actually, that's another thing working in Neon Blonde's favor; they're hardly afraid of a good hook. Chaos and melody tango throughout the disc, dipping and spinning, and never leading the other where you'd expect. </p></div>"|5921.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5921-chandeliers-in-the-savannah/|7.7|Cory D.

Take the disc out of its tray (if you're still into the whole physical copy thing), for instance, and the first thing <em>Front Parlour Ballads</em> treats you to is a coy riff on that <i>Garden State scene juxtaposing a wallpaper-pattern-shirt against wallpaper-pattern-wallpaper. The only sign of restraint is that Thompson still insists on wearing that same old black beret, which, in and of itself, one suspects, is a back-handed piss-take good for a self-satisfied smirk when the bloody interviewer comes calling. </i></p><p>
    
    Throughout Thompson's storied career, his rich, deep heavily-accented voice and reverence for the deepest corners of Anglo-Celtic acoustic tradition haven't always been inviting to casual rockers, even if more mainstream acts like Dire Straits all but owe their existence to his subtle guitar stabs and lacey arpeggios. But a close listen to his songs tends to reveal a punk personality treacherously lurking amidst the baroque sea balladry and wispy references to the lull of the Thames.</p><p>
<em>Front Parlour Ballads</em> offers the traditional Thompson mix of lush folk beauty and cruel knife-twisting lyrics. The album is largely acoustic, saving its electricity for rousing effect on songs like opener ""Let It Blow"", in which a honeymooning cad baldly tells his bride ""as she lay on the sand he said, isn't it grand? I bring all my wives to this spot."" While tempered by pained romantic moments like those found in ""Cressida"" and ""For Whose Sake"", Thompson is often apt to vent caustic middle-aged spleen on a world of sodden domestic mouth-breathers, relegating them to the dustbin of the heart with observations like ""perhaps she doesn't want to see the heel that you've turned out to be, that's why she'll take a gin or three to drive doubts from her head."" Meanwhile, ""When We Were Boys at School"" is an Old World literati equivalent of Pearl Jam's ""Jeremy"", although rather than biting the recess lady's breast Thompson's bullied lad ends up running some form of a military empire-- the one vague if abstract political gesture on an otherwise personal album.</p><p>
    
    At times Thompson overreaches or comes across as heavy-handed-- albums that namecheck Nietzsche, Rawicz, and Hannibal tend to do that. Indeed, if someone tells you <em>Front Parlour Ballads</em> is a party album, that person is probably an Oxbridge medievalist on an absinthe bender. But for us less tweedy Yanks, there is still much to love amidst Thompson's proverbial light and shade, gorgeous guitar work and gallows humo(u)r.</p></div>"|8027.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8027-front-parlour-ballads/|7.7|Jeff Leven

As singer and bassist for 90 Day Men, and as new member of TV on the Radio, Lowe has been involved in his share of nervy, tough-to-pigeonhole art-rock. On <em>The Psychic Nature of Being</em>, however, he leaves behind all graspable traces of rock, opting instead to detail a deeply contemplative sequence of fingerpicked guitars and enigmatic veiled drones. And though this ambient, experimental approach has long been heavily trafficked-- particularly by those on the Kranky roster-- Lowe's understated playing and deceptive melodic skills enable him to here succeed in claiming a relatively untouched acre.</p><p> 
    
    The three lengthy pieces on <em>The Psychic Nature of Being</em> were recorded as real-time compositions without overdubs or edits. This curious, needlessly constrictive recording technique does make the album's deliberate, measured structure more impressive though not necessarily more entertaining. Throughout these tracks, Lowe uses wordless vocal loops as a mesmeric foundation over which he positions his tasteful acoustic fingerpicking and assorted effects, in a manner rather reminiscent of latter-period John Fahey albums like the Jim O'Rourke-produced Womblife. But Lowe's playing here is not as resolutely blues-based as Fahey's, and his meditative compositions ultimately dock somewhere between Six Organs of Admittance's most diffuse works and the slowed-gravity drones of Kranky labelmates like Stars of the Lid.</p><p>
    
    Both of the album's first two tracks open with long unaccompanied stretches of Lichens' unique vocal effects, whose hushed, recurrent loops can sound almost medieval in their outspread minimalism. On ""Kirlian Auras"" these time-stretched drones prove so captivating that it comes as something of a jolt when the guitar finally enters a few minutes into the piece. As a guitarist, Lowe plays with a graceful melodic economy, allowing his instrument to effortlessly join into the ongoing ambient currents without overwhelming them. In fact, his playing seems so patient and considered that you're unlikely to even detect the album's improvised origins. </p><p>
<em>The Psychic Nature of Being</em> closes with it's longest piece, the 20-minute ""You Are Excrement, You Can Turn Yourself Into Gold"". Not coincidentally, it's this track that could have benefited most from some judicious editing. Building gradually from tiny, bell-like tones, the track eventually takes on a more electric hue as Lowe's flickering guitar accumulates layers of delay and refined distortion. Unfortunately the track's subtle momentum isn't always enough to keep the music from occasionally spilling off into quiet, dormant eddies. And it's during these brief, inactive lapses that the listener may find cause to hope that on the next Lichens release, Lowe will permit himself the luxury of a genuine revision or two.</p></div>"|4991.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4991-the-psychic-nature-of-being/|7.2|Matthew Murphy

Cartoon themes were a given-- maybe even too obvious-- but no one thought MF and DM would bring in Meatwad, the mucus-throated glob of raw beef who spits more heat than a thousand Biggie Smallses. If you think I'm describing a fat rapper and not an actual wad of meat, I feel for you, but don't leave yet. If you listen to Doom, you expect the ludicrous, and <em>The Mouse and the Mask</em> is his most ludicrous to date. Possibly in reaction to the rampant comedy skits on rap records in the last decade, Doom and Danger go all out, calling in the Aqua Teen Hunger Force to help craft the best funhouse hip-hop since <em>De La Soul Is Dead. It may not move the critical masses like </em><em>Madvillainy, but if nothing else, Danger Doom will get Comic-Con going nuts.</em></p><p>
    
    By now, most fans know what to expect from the parties involved. MF Doom still wears his villainous mask and rhymes stuff with ""goonie-goo-goo"" and ""poop,"" along with brilliantly enigmatic self-deprecations and disses so cryptic their targets are oblivious. Danger Mouse, as he's done with cartoon hooligans and mashing up G.O.A.T.s, displays a deft hand on the sequencer and a taste for whimsical soundtrack samples. Here he takes that penchant and amplifies it, conducting neck-snapping scores for long-lost Looney Tunes. And then there's Adult Swim, the four-hour block of absurdimation aired late-nightly on the Cartoon Network, which slants toward bizarro and has a tendency for extreme sarcasm. Forcing all this farce onto one record could be disastrous, but instead it comes off like one big calamitous Saturday-morning public access show.</p><p>
    
    Doom loves themes, as he's shown on <em>Mmm... Food and his King Geedorah project, but never has the concept of an album had him sounding quite this chipper. The Adult Swim crew controls the vibe with ridiculous interludes (most notably, Master Shake contributes a series of escalatingly angry phone messages), but also inspires Doom to avoid the dourness that shades most of his other records. The labyrinthine self-analyses of </em><em>Madvillainy</em> are mostly absent, but Doom remains sharp, focused on slaying a cavalcade of smartass cartoons. Elsewhere, Cee-Lo stops by to croon over the fuzz and slap of ""Bizzy Box""; Talib Kweli lightens up and raps simply about breakfast cereal; and Ghostface recollects his own days behind the disguise on ""The Mask"", which certainly builds anticipation for a rumored GhostDoom project.</p><p>
    
    Danger Doom won't change your life. It's not as revealing as Doom's other work, and Danger Mouse's big, Technicolor productions here are a little too trivial to be immortal. But for what it attempts-- which is basically a comedy record with no-joke skills-- it exceeds expectations. The intelligence of everyone involved keeps it from being Jeff Foxworthy-worthy, with the interludes and adlibs as rewindable as Doom's lyrics. Yes, I've heard Three 6 Mafia and Young Jeezy and Lil' Wayne, and the underground is keeping it so real. But on Saturday morning, when temples throb and lungs wheeze, I'm trying to sprinkle sugar on my corn flakes-- not cocaine.</p></div>"|2624.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2624-the-mouse-and-the-mask/|7.8|Peter Macia

It was like listening to the kids outside your window who are locked into their own in-jokes and use their own slang for sex acts: I just figured, you either get it or you're out. Somehow, his farther-out colleague and cLOUDDEAD partner Doseone was easier to follow, maybe because his jester act steers you more directly to his heart.</p><p>
    
    Dose has said about Why?, ""I met him at 18 and he was 40."" And you get that vibe from Why?, aka Yoni Wolf, more on every album. On <em>Elephant Eyelash</em>, Why? has moved even closer to using
    plain old song forms and he formed a live band to play them that includes Wolf's brother Josiah on drums, guitarist Matt Meldon, and Doug McDiarmid on anything else. Recorded in DIY lo-fi, they have better chemisty than when they debuted on the <em>Sanddollars</em> EP earlier this year. In fact, Wolf shrugged off his Why? alias and turned it into the name of his band-- which may violate the Hip-Hop Local 712 union regulations, but what the hey, they're underground.</p><p>
    
    In fact, forget about whether Wolf's career belongs in hip-hop or indie rock or jangle-psych or whatever: By now his music has oozed so far away from a clear-cut genre that the whoom-pa beats he's sometimes fond of could have been inspired by polka. The same goes for his fully-developed, fully-original vocals. His speak-singing lays packages of words one after another with attention to every syllable, dropping them in sequence like he's laying a stone path. But his pop songs showcase his singing, which starts off like he's reading his journal to a bored girlfriend, then takes flight in an impassioned croon.</p><p>
<em>Elephant Eyelash</em> sounds less crisp and less striking than the folk-plus-beats arrangements of 2003's Oaklandazurasylum, but it brings more heart; where that earlier album's lyrics crackled with the anxiety of beating yourself up after a bad day at school, <em>Elephant Eyelash</em> soars like the last songs on prom night.You'll still puzzle over the lyrics-- Wolf says he's writing about a
    break-up, though don't let that limit your imagination-- but the emotional intent is blindingly clear. The music pours and soars over the splintered images, like on 'Sanddollars, which uses a triumphantly conventional pop anthem to make its chorus sound like a mountaintop declaration: ""These are selfish times/I've got shellfish dimes/ And sanddollars."" Yet he tops that with the huge, heart-pounding piano chords on ""Rubber Traits"", which propel him as he belts: ""Unfold an origami death mask/ And cut my DNA with rubber traits/ Pull apart the double helix like a wishbone/ Always be working on a suicide note."" And I finally understand how he feels.</p></div>"|8672.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8672-elephant-eyelash/|7.8|Chris Dahlen

    of chutzpah. It also sets the bar kind of high. I imagine that if God made 
    music it'd be pretty special, maybe the kind of thing that would physically 
    blow your mind out your ear or herald the Earth's final destruction. Think 
    about how disappointing it would be if God was on the bill and you got a 
    milquetoast singer-songwriter or boring lap-pop.</p><p>
    
    dEUS' music isn't godly, but in the second 
    half of the 90s they released three very good albums that weren't easily pigeonholed. The first two in particular hop from 
    genre to genre, while 1999's <i>The Ideal Crash took all their manic 
    eccentricity and channeled it into a slightly more accessible package. Six 
    years later, <em>Pocket Revolution</em> continues that evolution with a sharp, direct 
    attack that undoubtedly has more commercial potential than anything they've 
    released before. This comes at the expense of the messy charm that made 
    their early music so enjoyably chaotic, but anyone who originally liked them 
    for the Frank Zappa, Charles Mingus, Don Cherry, and Captain Beefheart affinities they once 
    flew like a flag won't be totally disappointed, as their music still has 
    those elements. They're just packaged more subtly.</i></p><p>
    
    Case in point is ""Cold Sun of Circumstance"", a wildly rhythmic song stuffed 
    with faux blues riffage and frenetic vocals. The main thing separating it 
    from the craziness of <em>In a Bar, Under the Sea</em> is the band's restrained 
    production, which has a smoothing effect on all of the material. The 
    proggier songs are held back a bit by the approach-- ""What We Talk 
    About (When We Talk About Love)"" in particular features a monster rhythm 
    track topped with Beefheartian interjections and could have had the same 
    explosive quality of ""Fell Off the Floor, Man"" with looser engineering-- but 
    the band's pop side is finally given full flower, so it's a trade-off.</p><p>
    
    In the past, songs like ""Little Arithmetics"" were almost token bones thrown 
    to the European singles charts, but ""7 Days, 7 Weeks"" is the closest thing to a sure 
    hit they've written. Tom Barman's double-tracked vocals throw off the song's 
    cloak of heavy ambient keyboard, the mellow verses abetted by e-bowed guitar 
    and mellotron. It's catchy in the same way R.E.M. once were-- not in your face 
    with its hooks, just very precise about how they're placed. The band also 
    embraces vocal harmonies whole hog on <em>Pocket Revolution, a step that hugely 
    enriches songs like ""Include Me Out"", which comes across as sort of a 
    half-way point between Pink Floyd and late-60s folk-pop. And then there's 
    closer ""Nothing Really Ends"", a which borders on lounge (in a good way) with 
    its cocktail drums, vibes and sturdy, crooner-worthy melody.</em></p><p>
    
    So dEUS have settled down with age and returned from their hiatus as a more 
    craft-conscious, restrained rock band. I'd be lying if I said I liked them 
    more this way than I did for <em>In a Bar..., but as transitions go, they've 
    made the leap to greater maturity with a lot of grace. </em><em>Pocket Revolution is 
    an accomplished re-introduction to one of Belgium's greatest exports.</em></p></div>"|2300.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2300-pocket-revolution/|7.8|Joe Tangari

The music violinist Warren Ellis, guitarist Mick Turner, and drummer Jim White make together is not only immediately recognizable as a sound, it's also a persistent exploration of very specific emotional terrain. So while ""Dirty Three"" is clear shorthand for tightly circumscribed set of musical values, the members' other projects retain a certain flexibility.</p><p>
     
    Turner and White periodically work together as Tren Brothers, with Turner adding flourishes of melodica to fill in chords while his guitar lines meander. That last word is important. Tren Brother pieces, though airy and spacious and generally short, are not economical. The spark driving this music is intuition and process is paramount. Mick Turner, like a bat searching for food by sending out a variably pitched scale ultrasonic tones, gradually teases out melody by unwinding jittery arpeggios to see which ones stick. White is his ultimate foil, with his astonishingly free and original approach to drums wherein actual timekeeping is far down the list of priorities.</p><p>
     
    This concise record was released as part of Western Vinyl's Portrait Series. Each of its four tracks is accompanied on CD by a video, all of which consist of time-lapse shots of Mick Turner creating a painting (including the sleeve art). Turner and White as ever seem inspired by restrictions, reaching their greatest heights on the repetitive vamps of the title track and ""Crow #3"". On the former White flails away, trying like hell to bash his way out of the song's structure, while Turner lewdly fondles his instrument and keeps the strings ringing. ""Crow #3"" inches along to that off-kilter lurch these guys made famous, the ultimate soundtrack to a blind-drunk walk home alone beneath a star-lit sky. Welcome swells of melodica add that extra pinch of yearning.</p><p>
<em>The Swimmer</em> is good stuff all around, but there's something missing. Secretly Canadian released a Tren Brothers 7-inch in 1998 that happens to contain my bar-none favorite slice of D-3-related music on the B-side, the endlessly climbing two-chord epic ""Kit's Choice"". At such a moment the searching quality in their approach leads to a moment of real ecstasy. <em>The Swimmer</em> never quite gets to that sublime place these guys sometime stumble upon.</p></div>"|8302.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8302-the-swimmer-ep/|6.6|Mark Richardson

    competition, there are no full-time pro-curlers. Ontario's Constantines, too, counterbalance their work-- their allusiveness
    and unblunted riffs-- with a rough-hewn populism. Their songs might conjure the ghosts of Italian futurists, obscure 50s
    casualties, or Rod Stewart, but they ultimately bleed with love, rock 'n' roll, and the booze-stained nights that follow workaday
    days. The band's self-titled debut clamored for the death of rock music, while 2003's equally impressive <em>Shine a Light</em>
    saw a great band building its dank, proletarian vision, dancing through alleyways, too drunk to steer or to stop.</p><p>
    
    Third album <em>Tournament of Hearts</em> stumbles to its factory job the next morning, shakes out the cobwebs, and turns the radio
    dial to classic rock. It's gentler than its predecessors, relying on sweat and unresolved tension rather than a glorious gutter-poet
    deluge, though the change is more of subtleties than of substance. Here, the band consecrates not the grand passions of <em>Shine a
    Light</em> but the everyday labors of nurses, phone operators, and working stiffs ""from Herald Square to the heavens, earth, and
    sea.""</p><p>
    
    In depicting ordinary people, the Constantines unabashedly evoke bands that ordinary people might like. ""Working Fulltime"",
    inspired by the work of 93-year-old Chicago journalist and oral historian Studs Terkel, nods toward Bachman-Turner Overdrive in
    its title and simple, power-chord refrain, then dives into a G'n'R twin-guitar breakdown. ""We will not be undersold,"" singer/guitarists
    Bry Webb and Steve Lambke grimly chant, after insisting, ""We wake up every morning full of wonder."" The album's most immediate
    track, ""Soon Enough"", is nearly as direct and overpowering as <em>Shine a Light</em>'s immortal ""On to You"", but with a soft,
    countrified strum rather than its predecessor's punk-derived tumult. ""Work and love will make a man out of you,"" Webb repeats,
    his still-throaty vocals sounding as subdued as the arrangement.</p><p>
    
    It's not that <i>Tournament of Hearts</i> doesn't rock, but it's more constrained, finding power in withheld but ever-imminent
    explosions. Opener ""Draw Us Lines"" drones over a single guitar chord, name-dropping San Francisco eco-witch Starhawk over pounding
    drums out of a pagan ritual. ""Hotline Operator""-- not to be confused with the <em>Nighttime/Anytime</em> EP's same-named instrumental--
    builds pressure with whispery choruses before a final, all-too-brief double-time coda and anguished wail. A few of the tracks draw
    on the sludge-rock side of former tourmates Oneida, such as the greasy guitar of ""Lizaveta"", which also revisits ""Insectivora"" horns.
    Elsewhere, the looser ""Good Nurse"" puts the band's recent stint as Neil Young cover band Horsey Craze to good use. But the most
    unrestrained track is standout ""Love in Fear"", with its elliptical bass and guitars whining like sirens, as Webb implores, ""Just
    kiss me on a rooftop.../ Under helicopters of desire.""</p><p>
    
    Lambke, who provided lead vocals on <em>Shine a Light</em>'s jagged ""Scoundrel Babes"", takes the forefront twice on <i>Tournament</i>.
    His thin, unprojected voice is in stark contrast with Webb's Greg Dulli-like gruffness, though the lyrics about abattoirs and life
    in the city on the cool, horn-laden ""Thieves"" could just as easily come out of Webb's mouth. Acoustic closer ""Windy Road"" is a
    brave misstep, shooting for Iron &amp; Wine but ending up someplace whinier, despite the Constantines' usual lyrical prowess: ""Best get
    new dreams/ These old dreams won't last,"" Lambke murmurs.</p><p>
    
    The metaphorical battle-of-sexes resonance of <em>Tournament of Hearts</em> is obvious, but curling is also a deeply Canadian sport. Webb sings of ""pissing rain"" and ""the weird winds of Ontario"" as his songs detail Canadian blue-collar paycheck-to-paycheck. Amid
    the glacial guitar strums and funereal percussion of ""You Are a Conductor"", the penultimate track, he bestows upon his subjects
    what working life sometimes takes away: control, or, more specifically, the ability to direct one's own path, like a curler's broom
    hurrying hard to make way for the rock (the rock!). ""Shamble on,"" Webb moans, more softly than ever.</p></div>"|1591.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1591-tournament-of-hearts/|7.6|Marc Hogan
