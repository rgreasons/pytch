Musicians, however, are generally not as productive as they once were. When R.E.M. were burning through a non-stop cycle of writing, recording, and touring in the 1980s, it was the industry norm. By 1985, the group was midway through the most productive period of its career, and had already released two instant classic albums within the span of 24 months for IRS Records. R.E.M. thrived on this pressure, and critical success seemed only to embolden them, resulting in a series of distinct, increasingly ambitious records that nudged them ever closer to the mainstream without sacrificing their character.</p>
<p><i>Fables of the Reconstruction</i>, the third release in this astonishing reissue blitz, is the first to show any sign of strain from the band's relentless schedule. It's a great and inspired album, but not quite as consistent as <i>Murmur</i> or <i>Reckoning</i>, or other R.E.M. works to come down the line. Aside from the oddball lead single ""Can't Get There From Here"", which approximated southern funk via Peter Buck's chiming Rickenbacker chords, <i>Fables</i> is a dark and murky set with a textural palette close to the muted earth tones of its packaging. As the title suggests, it is their most ""Southern"" album, with a sound that evokes images of railroads, small towns, eccentric locals, oppressive humidity, and a vague sense of time slowing to a crawl. For a bunch of guys who were still new to life on the road, the specificity of setting makes a lot of sense-- it's the homesick pride of people suddenly removed from their usual context.</p>
<p>Michael Stipe's lyrics, at this point just beginning to gel into deliberate themes after a few years of intuitive mumbling, are mainly concerned with imagining the inner lives of outsiders and recluses; men who have traded companionship for a life on their own terms. This fascination can tip into sentimentality-- ""Wendell Gee"" may be the most syrupy R.E.M. tune-- but the best of these songs bypass mawkishness and stress Stipe's identification with his subjects. ""Life and How to Live It"", an ecstatic rave-up based upon the life of a schizophrenic man who alternated his time between two sides of his house, showcases Stipe at his most spirited and unhinged.</p>
<p>Musically, <i>Fables</i> is a transitional work. Buck was still working within his jangle-pop style-- ""Driver 8"" is basically the ultimate archetype of this aesthetic-- but they'd begun to toy around with grander ambitions. ""Feeling Gravity's Pull"", the album's ominous opener, contrasts a grim, trebly lead guitar part reminiscent of Tom Verlaine with stately, cinematic strings and vivid lyrics detailing Stipe's dreamscape. ""Can't Get There From Here"" successfully integrates horns and funk grooves, and along with ""Maps and Legends"" further develops Mike Mills as a foil to Stipe on harmony vocals. Less ambitious cuts like ""Green Grow the Rushes"" and ""Good Advices"" are charming in their own right, straightforward in their simple, unfussy beauty. <i>Fables</i> is the end of the line for that particular strain of R.E.M. song-- within a year, these guys would move on to making their own brand of arena rock on <i>Lifes Rich Pageant</i>, never to return to more intimate affairs.</p>
<p>This reissue includes a bonus disc of demos recorded in Athens before heading to London to track the songs with producer Joe Boyd. At this stage in the process, the songs were written but not entirely fleshed out. Though it is nice to hear songs such as ""Driver 8"" and ""Auctioneer (Another Engine)"" in a raw state, these demos are mainly a curiosity for hardcore fans. That said, comparing and contrasting the demos with the finished recordings makes an excellent case for Boyd as a producer. Since the band has mentioned in past interviews that the <i>Fables</i> sessions were stressful and difficult, Boyd has received a fair amount of negative criticism for his work on the album. This is unwarranted. The band have worked with better and more simpatico producers in their time, but Boyd did a fine job of finessing and polishing these tunes without getting in the way of the album's peculiar earthy vibe. ""Can't Get There From Here"" is the most dramatic example of Boyd's positive influence. The demo sounds awkward and confused as Stipe and Mills stumble over one another in the chorus, whereas the finished version runs smoothly, carried along by Buck's exceptionally crisp chords.</p>
<p>In the context of R.E.M.'s career, it's hard not to damn <i>Fables of the Reconstruction</i> with faint praise. It's not an obvious classic, but it certainly doesn't fall into the category of ""lesser works."" <i>Fables</i> is a fine album that has aged very well, and the simple fact that it is not on par with its two predecessors or further landmark records like <i>Document</i> and <i>Automatic for the People</i> is not a comment on its quality on its own. Ultimately, <i>Fables</i> is best enjoyed as something slightly off the beaten path, with a proudly eccentric style befitting its offbeat subjects.</p></div>"|14446.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14446-fables-of-the-reconstruction-deluxe-edition/|8.5|Matthew Perpetua

<p class=""MsoNormal""><span>My Bloody Valentine</span><span> </span><span>perfected the beautiful bludgeon on their 1991 masterpiece, <i>Loveless</i>, then, on that album's graceful final track, ""Soon"", pointed in a totally new direction. As universally revered as ""Soon"" has become, most shoegaze aficionados chose to ignore its suggestion that they go out and do their own thing. Sure, some good music has resulted from <i>Loveless</i>' legacy-- and younger generations’ fascination with 4AD's lush back catalogue. But more often than not, the faithful stuff sounds stubbornly nostalgic, even hopelessly dated. Dense melodic noise dominated School of Seven Bells' debut LP, <i>Alpinisms</i>. But the album also toyed with world music rhythms and Eastern mysticism that, if nothing else, stamped it as a member of Brooklyn's Class of 2008. It's a good record, but <i>Alpinisms</i> can sound stylistically tentative and the musical partnership of twin sisters Claudia and Alejandra Deheza and Benjamin Curtis originally smacked of a one-off.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span>SVIIB have since toured extensively, and their road-tripping appears to have made them more focused songwriters and performers. In the last two years they've not only coalesced into a band, but a band with a distinctive signature. That the flirtatious earworm ""Bye Bye Bye"" on new album, <i>Disconnect from Desire</i>, near-quotes ""Soon""'s hiccupping breakbeat seems appropriate somehow. SVIIB still work with a handful of shoegaze motifs, which they now use to highlight certain emotional states (typically turmoil and ambivalence). But it's the band's assertive pop melodies that prevail on their sophomore album.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><i><span>Desi</span></i><i><span>re</span></i><span>'s lead track and first single ""Windstorm"" signals the transition as its instrumental drone slides into the Dehezas’ crystalline vocals. Far from fuzzy and undefined, the song draws clean, three and a half minute pop parameters. ""Joviann"" and ""Babelonia"" achieve similar results with intros, outros, and choruses drenched in atmospheric distortion that dissipates to reveal melodic throughways. ""Heart Is Strange"", a marvelous club banger with the zeal and vivacity of <span> </span>Ladytron's ""Destroy Everything You Touch"", marks yet another shift in aesthetic priorities. While the album's drums are primarily machine-programmed, they sound massive-- particularly on ""Strange"" and its neighbor ""Dust Devil"". Evidence of Curtis’ tenure with the rhythm-obsessed Secret Machines wasn’t always easy to spot on <i>Alpinisms</i>, but <span> </span>it’s everywhere on <i>Desire</i>, which Curtis also produced.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span>Still, some people will probably call<i> </i><span>the record</span> detached, and one of its most curious (but frankly awesome) analogues is Madonna's chilly electropop album <i>Ray of Light</i>. I don't want to force the comparison, but like Madonna, SVIIB assimilate niche, underground sounds and set them in a broader pop context. And the two albums' sequencing, arrangements, and mystic preoccupations (that's a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigil_%28magic%29"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>sigil</span></a> on <i>Desire</i>'s cover; the title's a Brian Enoism) all make a compelling case for kinship. Also, it's fair to say that SVIIB are rocking a slicker, more commercial sound these days-- at least in the studio. (The band still whips up a maelstrom on stage.) In a summer where chillwave sounds are omnipresent, <i>Desire </i>is<i> </i>an unexpected, but welcome, counterpoint. Where those newcomers privilege the nostalgic, indefinite, and noncommittal, the vets in SVIIB make a confident gesture towards the future.</span></p></div>"|14453.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14453-disconnect-from-desire/|8.0|Amy Granzin

After all, Sub Pop has released records by three bands that grew out of it: Sera Cahoone, Grand Archives, and Band of Horses. Like Lifter Puller (the pre-Hold Steady band of Craig Finn and Co., which recently re-released its back catalog), Carissa's Wierd was a mostly local cult phenomenon in Seattle until two of its former members, Ben Bridwell and Mat Brooke, formed Band of Horses and released <i>Everything All the Time</i>. Every time Band of Horses was initially discussed, Carissa's Wierd's name appeared as well. Repeat something enough and it starts to resonate, and so casual fans of Band of Horses (and eventually Grand Archives, the band Brooke left BOH to start) started to hear about this defunct band, their final legendary show at Seattle's Crocodile, and that it was hard to get your hands on their three studio albums.</p>
<p>Now that their hushed songs are gathered together for the first time, beware of listening to <i>They'll Only Miss You When You Leave</i>-- a title that proves that CW has a sense of humor about its place in indie rock history-- as a Band of Horses history lesson. First of all, BOH is Ben Bridwell's creation. He is that band's mastermind. But he is a relative footnote in Carissa's Weird, which was initially founded by a teenaged Mat Brooke and Jenn Ghetto in Tucson. It was only after the duo relocated to Seattle that they recruited subsequent members Bridwell and Cahoone (both of whom, at different points, played drums). And secondly, Band of Horses were never this off the beaten path-- Carissa's Wierd is so much stranger than any of the bands that have sprung from its ashes.</p>
<p>The 16 tracks on this comp are culled from 1999's <i>Ugly But Honest</i>, 2001's <i>You Should Be at Home Here</i>, 2002's <i>Songs About Leaving</i> (which was produced by Death Cab for Cutie's Chris Walla), and the compilations <i>I Before E</i> and <i>Scrap Book</i>. Though a chronological track listing would have been preferable, this collection of Morrissey-ian titled songs (""All Apologies and Smiles, Yours Truely, Ugly Valentine"", ""Blessed Arms That Hold You Tight, Freezing Cold and Alone"") proves that you don't need to play loud or fast to be powerful and affecting. These songs are marked by darkly colored violins, lo-fi production that elevates every guitar string squeak to an integral part of a song's arrangement, and the delicate, tender interplay between Brooke and Ghetto's voices. (The tracks that he sings without her just aren't as emotionally satisfying.) But unlike many of the chamber pop bands that have emerged in their wake, Carissa's Wierd aren't mannered or precious. They are delightfully messy.</p>
<p>Some of the band's aesthetic choices sound, admittedly, a little dated-- Brooke's vocals, for example, can teeter on choked teenage-Conor-Oberst territory at times. But rarely have bands this hushed and narcotized been able to express negative emotions beyond sadness or self-loathing. Carissa's Wierd also manage to do anger. Curious Band of Horses fans should be curious to hear where Bridwell learned the power of the ballad, but they may also be put off by the low-lit, Low-like tones of this collection. But those that have been bored by BOH's recent output (or even those who ignored it altogether) can rest assured that Carissa's Wierd are more than just the sum of its parts.</p></div>"|14422.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14422-theyll-only-miss-you-when-you-leave-songs-1996-2003/|7.4|Rebecca Raber

From his booming 808 kick drums to his viscous midrange, his music is a visceral presence, one that at times seems to be rumbling deep inside you. But that physicality doesn't negate its decidedly ethereal side. Tin Man's is also head music, from its psychoacoustic timbres to muttered vocals that play out like a stoned interior monologue.</p>
<p>This is the seventh record from Tin Man, aka Johannes Auvinen, a Californian musician of Finnish descent who keeps quarters in Vienna. Beginning in 2004, he has released records on Sähko's Keys of Life sub-label, Patrick Pulsinger's Cheap, and his own Global A imprint; <i>Scared</i> turns up on White Denim, a Pennsylvania label that's home to an eclectic set of acts like Nice Nice, Mi Ami, and Eddy Current Suppression Ring.</p>
<p>It might seem like an odd fit for an artist whose core aesthetic principles stem mostly from Chicago house and Hamburg's ambient house, but then, Tin Man has never really made ""straight"" dance music. He frequently dials his 808 back to a slow-motion crawl, and he suffuses most of his songs with a vocal delivery that sounds like Leonard Cohen on codeine. Unlike herky-jerky ""mnml"" house, this is truly minimalist stuff, content to leave the rhythmic grid riddled with empty space.</p>
<p>True to its title, <i>Scared</i> is also plenty spooky, although, like most gothic music, it doesn't mind straddling camp. Some of his lyrics-- ""The whole world is just dragging me down/ Destroying me/ 'Til there's just a bad feeling left""-- might be mistaken for the writing of Swans' M. Gira, sung in an intonation that borders on the morose. But it's hard not to hear a glimmer of good humor behind even his bleakest lines, as if this were a kind of parody of numbness, a deadpan autism.</p>
<p>Mastered by Dubplates &amp; Mastering's Rashad Becker, <i>Scared</i> luxuriates in sound at its most liquid: Rarely do you hear bass frequencies vibrate the way they do in the title track's opening passage, striking up a seasick harmony against muted electronic tones. Vocoder effects, paired with blurred, swirling synthesizers, similarly evoke underwater sensations, an almost amniotic sense of suspended animation.</p>
<p>It's not hard to spot the influences informing <i>Scared</i>. The reductionist house productions bear comparison to Dial Records' Pantha du Prince and Lawrence; the vocoders immediately recall Ricardo Villalobos' ""Easy Lee"", while the nimble 808 programming is similar to that of Non Standard Institute's Tobias Freund. But Tin Man doesn't only pull from dance music. His ruminative mood and gravelly Sprechstimme are both anticipated by the Australian band Flash &amp; the Pan's 1978 recording of ""Walking in the Rain"". I wouldn't be surprised if Auvinen himself didn't know that; it's not a terribly common recording. But the more distant reference points reinforce the sense that Tin Man's talent, beyond songwriting and sonics, has a lot to do with the way he filters far-flung ideas into a unique, unexpected, and almost claustrophobically personal sound.</p>
<p>For all its idiosyncrasies, <i>Scared</i> also feels uncannily current, playing with the same kinds of overcast moods and broken-down tempos, the same K-hole stasis and feel-good bum-out, that you might find running through the music of the xx, Fever Ray, witch house, or Sunn 0))). But Tin Man is also very much different, and seven records later, he sounds more and more like no one except himself. An album perfectly suited to a crash-and-burn era, <i>Scared</i> is an ode to depleted serotonin whose very ambiguity makes it all the more addictive.</p></div>"|14447.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14447-scared/|7.7|Philip Sherburne

Locating a unique moniker that evokes your sound or tells a prospective listener something about you is even harder, but by that standard, Chatham County Line chose wisely. Chatham County, North Carolina (there's one in Georgia, too), is located pretty much right in the middle of the state, south of Durham and Chapel Hill and directly West of Wake County, which has its seat in Raleigh, the state capital and the town in which the band formed. Wake County is one of the fastest growing counties in the United States, to the point where Raleigh is no longer paired with Durham in U.S. metropolitan statistics-- it's paired with Cary, one of its exploding suburbs. A little to the left on the map, Chatham County is still comparatively rural; until the 1940s, it was a major coal mining center. The image the band's name conjures fits its mostly acoustic bluegrass sound perfectly, straddling the urban-rural divide, pointing toward something more pastoral that is nonetheless changing-- those Raleigh and Durham suburbs are poking their way into Chatham County.</p>
<p>It's something Dave Wilson has addressed in his songwriting from time to time, as he did on the title track of <i>Route 23</i>, the band's second album. He seems a little less concerned about it on the songs he wrote for <i>Wildwood</i>, the band's fifth album, but the band itself has changed a little. They've had pedal steel and overdubs on their albums for a while now, but the drumming on several of these songs, provided by guest musician Zeke Hutchins, is a new look, and the band's organic, open bluegrass collides more than ever with other strains of country music. This lends the album an overall more ""modern"" feel than most of their past work, though I'd say the newly apparent country influences aren't so much Nashville as Texas and California. Album closer ""End of the Line"" in particular has a casual charm that oddly reminds me of the Sir Douglas Quintet's ""Mendocino"".</p>
<p>The band's close harmonies, sometimes featuring all four members, are prominent and continue to be one of its best assets. A high tenor doubling Wilson's lead vocal on the slow, dreamy ""Porcelain Doll"" adds just the right amount of ache, while the big harmonies of ""Crop Comes In"" lend it something of a West Coast feel, and the drums and pedal steel combine with that to make it a singular song in the band's repertoire. The bluesy tint of ""Ringing in My Ears"" is also new for the band, and the song's lyrical conceit of building verses out of pilfered lines from Paul Simon, George Jones, Smokey Robinson, George Harrison, Willie Nelson, and others is a clever way of paying a little tribute without trying to get so eclectic musically that the album loses coherence.</p>
<p>Aside from all that, though, there's still plenty of the roiling banjo, fiddle, and mandolin the band built itself on. They just seem to be branching out a bit and trying to give themselves new avenues to explore. As such, it's perhaps a little less satisfying and immediate than <i>IV</i>, which is still the band's finest album, but it seems to set them up to do anything they want on their next record. And it's also likely to help build their audience outward a bit-- it's not hard to imagine someone who's never much bothered with bluegrass but loves Fleet Foxes finding a lot to love here. In fact, the name has probably never been more appropriate.</p></div>"|14437.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14437-wildwood/|7.2|Joe Tangari

His solo debut, 2007's <i>Love/Hate</i>, broke through with minor hits ""Shawty Is Da Shit"" and ""Falsetto"", whose wildly addictive hooks papered over his slight persona. The rest of that record created a constellation of characteristics that laid out his aesthetic-- the lush production courtesy of beatmakers L.O.S. and Tricky Stewart, songs that wash into each other in the mode of a DJ mix to create a miniature suite with precision sequencing.</p>
<p>On <i>Love vs. Money</i>, The-Dream's second LP, he tried to replicate this effect. Although the epic sweep of the second album's final third was The-Dream at a songwriting peak, the front-loaded pop songs-- particularly ""Walking on the Moon""'s thin attempt at literal transcendence-- felt like shadows of past achievements. Even so, it was another vital chapter in an unusual career, as The-Dream has balanced the mercenary hit-making obsessions of his peers with the  tender loving care of an auteur working out a unified statement.</p>
<p><i>Love King</i>, the alleged final chapter in his Love Trilogy, is the thrilling conclusion to his three-album arc. If you've been charmed by The-Dream's strengths-- Tin Pan Alley song concepts and an unceasing sense of musical craft-- then you'll be immensely satisfied with the music here. The record argues for The-Dream's identity as an album artist whose tics and stylistic effects have created a self-sustaining world of distinctive R&amp;B, and in a style that proudly wears its influences on its sleeve.</p>
<p>As a debut single, ""Love King"" felt like a cobbled-together collection of these attributes: the expected ""radio killa"" ad-libs, self-mythologizing, and hooks with familiar insistence. But it turned out to be a pump fake, because here it makes for a great table-setting opener. <i>Love King</i> builds on <i>Love/Hate</i> and <i>Love vs. Money</i> by indulging in emotional and melodic excess. The-Dream knows where to find the sweet spot, and he has an uncanny knack for how pieces of music fit together. When a song would be best served by space, he gives it plenty. Every piano chord and finger snap and bass hit is in its right place. He sweats every detail but never loses sight of how the album works as a whole.</p>
<p>""Yamaha"", the most immediately powerful track on the record, is one example of what he does so well. It pushes The-Dream's earlier Prince nod ""Fast Car"" even further in the direction of outright imitation, with searing hooks, nakedly lustful appeals, and an arrangement and instrumentation that pay homage to the R&amp;B of the early 1980s. As the song unwinds, you feel like you're sharing the songwriter's love of this music, and marveling at the way that he absorbs it into his own aesthetic. The following ""Nikki Part 2"", emerging from the twinkling synths of ""Yamaha"", keeps the run going, the melancholy of the verses ultimately finding transcendent emotional recognition when the song opens on the chorus. And then the urgent drama of ""Abyss"", a perfect title for a song that feels like an emotional freefall, completes the mid-album triptych, its epic chorus evoking a cold-water plunge of claustrophobic betrayal. These highly charged moments are balanced by more understated tracks. ""Turnt Out"" is The-Dream at his easiest and most likable, and it's one of the album's few moments of restraint. Meanwhile, ""February Love"" turns <i>Love vs. Money</i> fan favorite ""Fancy"" from a grandiose statement to a more intimate memory.</p>
<p>The-Dream's debut had the advantage of appearing in a vacuum, enabling him to balance his traditional songwriting impulses with a unique creative approach. Once it became apparent that the latter direction had garnered him a loyal following, the pressure to give more generously to that audience led to an imbalance on <i>Love vs. Money</i>. With <i>Love King</i>, it no longer feels as if he's splitting the difference between his pop star ambition and a large cult of admirers. By breaking down the detachment that made him such a popular songwriter to follow his personal musical vision, and it's taken him to a place only he could find.</p></div>"|14449.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14449-love-king/|8.6|David Drake

For most of the 2000s, the distinction was more than just words on a jewel-case spine, as he debuted new material under the Sun Kil Moon banner and then reinterpreted it in live or demo settings as a solo artist. Musically, it always sounded like a matter of electric versus acoustic, full-band versus solo guitar, jammy versus intimate. It's the two sides of a man who has turned himself into a cottage industry through his Caldo Verde label, releasing scores of companion EPs and limited-edition live LPs that keep his old songs alive. But the split between Sun Kil Moon and Kozelek has never come across as merely a sales gimmick. Instead, it's a way to document the complex lives of his songs, which are never quite finished but always hold the potential for rebirth and transformation.</p>
<p>With <i>Admiral Fell Promises</i>, his fourth LP as Sun Kil Moon, Kozelek has flipped the script. Instead of downcast Crazy Horse epics like <i>Ghosts of the Great Highway</i> and <i>April</i>-- albums rich with electric tones, roomy arrangements, and landscape-painting lyrics-- this is literally a solo record: just Kozelek alone with a nylon-string guitar. Furthermore, the title track dates all the way back to 2001's <i>White Christmas Live</i>, released under his own name. So this stands as an anomaly within his catalog, not only for its artist credit but also for its music, which finds him wandering into new territory and entertaining new ideas.</p>
<p>On this site last May, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/guest-lists/7659-mark-kozelek/"" target=""_blank"">Kozelek said</a> he'd been listening to a lot of classical guitar music, specifically name-checking Kaki King and Croatian musician Ana Vidovic. They seem to be the primary inspiration for <i>Admiral Fell Promises</i>, which showcases a classical picking style rather than his usual strumming. Kozelek's playing is supple and nuanced, swift in its fingerings and hypnotic in its repetitions of riffs and phrases. Despite the Nordic muse of the title, opener ""Ålesund"" possesses a flamenco intensity, as Kozelek adds fluttering fills to the main themes, and on ""Australian Winter"", he creates an ominous repeating rhythm that plays up the restless tension of the lyrics. If the instrumental codas that cap almost every song become a bit predictable, this style fits his songwriting well, allowing him to punctuate the short verses of ""Half Moon Bay"" with sympathetic filigrees of sound and to create hidden coves on closer ""Bay of Skulls"".</p>
<p>As usual, Kozelek's songs are inspired as much by places as by people-- or, perhaps, by places that let him contemplate the people who are no longer around. Mostly those places are in or near San Francisco: Half Moon Bay down the coast, Sam Wong Hotel in Chinatown, the intersection of Third and Seneca. Whether he's watching the city from his window or taking a long, lonely walk along the beach, he sketches out his surroundings in fleeting details, noting the reassuring presence of boats in the bay or gulls overhead before retreating deep into his own memory. ""Oh, Catherine drifts again into my mind,"" he sings on ""Sam Wong Hotel"". ""Freezing the tide, she visits me still."" Despite some lyrical clichés and careless redundancies (""Come out from the burning flame"" being the most glaring example), Kozelek's songs change mood fluidly, and the contrast between the serene settings and his own tumultuous thoughts raises even the most languid instrumental passages above mere aural wallpaper, lending it the gravity of his best work while giving it a character all its own.</p>
<p>Regardless of how it's credited, <i>Admiral Fell Promises </i>treats music as a retreat, allowing Kozelek to stand apart form the world and nurse his own disappointments. That safe haven, even more than his descriptive songwriting or eloquently downcast vocals, is crucial to his appeal, allowing the listener to slip into his perspectives, to see these vistas through his eyes, and to feel the ache of his regrets. For an artist who's notoriously difficult to pin down, that sense of refuge is remarkable, as is the fact that two decades into his career, Kozelek is still finding new inspirations.</p></div>"|14430.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14430-admiral-fell-promises/|7.0|Stephen M.

The masked, anonymous California six-piece recently spent some time on the road supporting Liars, even going so far as to help fortify that outfit during their manic set. And any crew that has the freak-out chops to roll with those dudes must have some bizarro tricks of their own. But even if Fol Chen subscribe to a quirkier, more restrained brand of weird than their collaborative pals, it's this kindred aesthetic that helps them stand out and occasionally impress, as a good portion of their sophomore effort <i>Part II: The New December</i> is able to do with a series of rhythmically obtuse tracks that uncover patches of contorted funk and whimsical pop.</p>
<p>The opening one-two punch of ""The Holograms"" and single ""In Ruins"" is a great attention grabber, homing in on the more subdued elements that presided over their debut <i>Part I: John Shade, Your Fortune's Made</i> and giving them a hooky overhaul. You get a sense that Fol Chen have a weakness for harboring clutter, but they do so in a way that clearly demonstrates some kind of control, as samples and right-brained instrumentation fit almost robotically into specific places. This approach is also likely responsible for the out-and-out pop looks a lot of <i>The New December</i> digs into. Like outcasted members of Prince's Revolution, ""In Ruins"" spins and thumps deliriously in ways that wouldn't feel out of step with either a really leftfield Christina Aguilera single or a clattering Deerhoof tune.</p>
<p>But <i>The New December</i>'s weakness is being unable to relocate the momentum of its opening songs. Subsequent tracks like the sparse, vaguely loungey ""Your Curtain Call"" and the sinister ""This Is Where the Road Belongs"" have intriguing details but ultimately end up just kind of wandering all over the place. And most of the hushed, ethereal tracks are too committed to understatement, they simply often drag.</p>
<p>Save for goofed-out R&amp;B jam ""C/U"", most of the material feels a little flat without the movement of the standout moments or the exotic vibes that the slighter, meandering pieces contain. Had Fol Chen made good on those early impulses to really boost <i>The New December</i>'s kinky eccentricities, it wouldn't have been much of a surprise to find it making serious inroads with new listeners. Though it ultimately only warrants selective revisiting, it certainly doesn't mean we aren't curious to see how <i>Part III</i> might work out.</p></div>"|14426.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14426-part-ii-the-new-december/|6.7|Zach Kelly

Which, inevitably, someone at <a href=""http://discouragerecords.com/label.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Discourage Records</a> belatedly did, discovering in the process that Desper is alive and relatively well at age 60, and that this modest forgotten record floats from the past to the present with an undeniable insistence, pulling attention to itself until you can't pay attention to anything else.</p>
<p>Indeed, <i>New Sounds</i> is a classic lost record, though whether it counts as a lost classic is pretty relative, considering that even folk heavy hitters Nick Drake or Bert Jansch were once tagged as totally obscure by all but the most ardent followers of the form. <i>New Sounds</i> isn't the sort of record that would appeal to casual toe-dippers, anyway. Rather, it's the kind of recording, like Gary Higgins' similarly recently unearthed <i>Red Hash</i>, pretty much designed to be lost and rediscovered decades later. It benefits from the mystery, and even if Desper himself (sadly no longer able to play guitar, thanks to a recent injury) has been found, it's almost better to listen to the record imagining Desper was lost as well.</p>
<p>It's not that much of a stretch, as Desper already sounds pretty lost circa-1974 singing songs such as ""Lonely Man"", ""Liberty"", ""Don't You Cry for Me"", and ""Time Is Almost Over"". With their quiet mix of strumming and finger picking paired with mournful, reverb-laden vocals, tracks such as these are private and personal, as if Desper recorded them addressing his reflection in a mirror he could no longer see.<span> </span>They're certainly a far cry from the lusher ""Dry Up Those Tears"" and ""The World Is Crying Out for Love"", Desper's formative recordings, originally released as a 7"" and included as bonus tracks to this reissue.</p>
<p>It's on those two early songs that we can hear the link not just to other forgotten folkies but to such haunted troubadours as Big Star's Chris Bell, similarly ambitious writers who in the end may as well have been recording songs strictly for themselves. That Desper, too, has finally found his way out from the dustbin will impact the world only a bit more than <i>New Sounds</i> did 36 years ago, but on any given night when you may feel just a bit like Desper did the day this album was recorded (reportedly in just a single take), it's the kind of record that can pull you out of your mood by drawing you wholly into his.</p></div>"|14440.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14440-new-sounds/|7.8|Joshua Klein

Now that listeners are used to shuffling randomly between hundreds of gigabytes' worth of downloaded audio files, the tape format offers a cohesive, analog listening experience, without the ability to skip around even the way a vinyl record allows. This summer a few of the more interesting, up-and-coming cassette-oriented labels-- Scotch Tapes, Moon Glyph, and Patient Sounds-- are making the search for quality music from the tape world a little easier by releasing compilations. Like Italian Beach Babes/Paradise Vendors label comp <i>PVI006/IBB004</i> earlier this year, their efforts recall indie comps of decades past, curating a varied and occasionally inspired assortment of ramshackle artists based on a shared camaraderie that runs deeper than superficial styles.</p>
<p><i>Fuck Winter: A Scotch Summer Mixtape</i>, the first-ever Scotch Tapes comp, is the only one of these three releases available exclusively on cassette. Fittingly, then, it's also the most in tune with the experimental and noise inclinations that kept the format alive in the underground prior to its recent mini-resurgence. Run by Al Bjornaa out of Batchawana Bay, Ontario, Scotch Tapes has put out a tape by Oneida and a 7"" by Mike Watt project Al Qaeda, among other releases. Limited to 250 copies, <i>Fuck Winter</i> covers a lot of range in 23 tracks, each so short that if the industrial pummel of Endometrium Cuntplow or vuvuzela-esque James Chance freakouts of Tayside Mental Health aren't for you, just wait for the next track (there's no skipping, remember?). Iowa City-based Wet Hair, whose Shawn Reed runs highly regarded tape-focused label Night People, shimmer through wordlessly hooky highlight ""Untitled"", which sounds like a half-remembered anthem from a climactic moment in a 1990s slacker movie, while Halifax-based Fuck Montreal come across like a fascinatingly gothy lo-fi girl group on the perversely catchy ""Knife Fuck"". Different listeners will find different favorites amid the generally fuzzy, scrappy proceedings-- whether the English art-punk of Fever Fever, the Brooklyn post-punk of Talk Normal, or the sludgy riffage of Vancouver-based cassette regulars Shearing Pinx. As Glasgow's Divorce, not to be confused with Seattle's the Divorce, shout: ""You can have it all!""</p>
<p>Moon Glyph's <i>Regolith Vol. 1</i> marks the Minneapolis label's first vinyl record, pressed in a 500-LP edition. Accordingly, the psych-heavy, 10-track comp enjoys slightly higher fidelity, meaning slightly less homespun charm but a more headphone-friendly listening experience, emphasizing bands from the imprint's hometown. Many will want to seek this out, digitally if not on vinyl, for ""Surfer Girl"", a reverb-kissed, disarmingly melodic jangle-pop love song by Minneapolis sextet Velvet Davenport, featuring chillwave-circle mainstays Ariel Pink and Gary War. Still, there are just as many rewards to be found in the oscillating, bass-heavy ambience of Camden (a side project of Cole Weiland, from Minneapolis band Daughters of the Sun, also on this comp-- not the pre-Decibully emo group), the sunny power-pop guitar licks of fellow Mpls.ers Vampire Hands, or the tribal noise-disco of another area band, Skoal Kodiak. The release starts with Leisure Birds' sun-baked, organ-backed whoa-oh-ohing, and ends with the alternating Southern-rock guitar heroics and surreal sermonizing of Moonstone. ""This is something you could believe in, if you believed in things,"" sing Magic Castles. The psych-rock underground in the Twin Cities, it appears, is alive and well.</p>
<p>Patient Sounds, the label run by Matthew Sage of Fort Collins, Colo., psych-rockers M. Pyres, has also issued its first comp, <i>Patient Sounds Sampler V. 1</i>, downloadable free from the label's blog or available for purchase on the band's tour. The release again confirms the wealth of talent making warm, gooey psych just below the average indie listener's radar. A new track from M. Pyres, ""Miles &amp; Days Ahead"", is a sprawling instrumental, with crystalline guitar figures built for Built to Spill, and a bass line constantly burbling toward a release that never comes. Minneapolis-based Littoral Drift put earthy folk amid outer-space echo, recalling the acoustic work of Kurt Vile, while Greeley, Colo.-based Ambassador Engine stick to wonderfully wobbly underwater séances. Bingo Pajamas, aka Brooklyn-based Niki Smith, has arguably the comp's breakout moment, setting her murmured harmonies over an arrangement equal parts tUnE-yArDs eccentric and Ciara sensual. While the Moon Glyph and Patient Sounds comps veer more toward chillwave than the Scotch Tapes tape, all reflect the unassuming variety of slightly warped sounds currently making their way onto cassette. Most importantly, all transcend the format altogether, even when, as with <i>Fuck Winter</i>, they benefit from its old-fashioned quirks.

You can say, do, or get accused of horrible things, but most of time, if you're delivering the goods, the public will remain on your side. This is why R. Kelly is like Teflon, and why outrage regarding Michael Jackson's scandals and peculiarities only truly hobbled him when the quality of his music began to slide in the early 1990s. Madonna, too, has proven herself capable of multiple comebacks following creative missteps and P.R. disasters. Right or wrong, the social contract is simple: If you bring the hits, we'll put up with your shit.</p>
<p>With <i>/\/\/\Y/\</i>, M.I.A. has broken that contract. And she could not have chosen a worse time to do it. The album comes not long after a <i>New York Times Magazine</i> cover story that portrayed her as a pretentious, truffle fries-eating phony spouting radical politics at odds with her extremely comfortable lifestyle. The piece was devastating to her credibility, and her childish response-- putting the author's cell number on Twitter-- only made matters worse. It seems likely that <i>/\/\/\Y/\</i> will only accelerate this M.I.A. backlash. The record is a shambling mess, devoid of the bangers that characterized <i>Arular</i> and <i>Kala</i>, two of the stronger pop albums of the past decade. It aims to capture a technological and cultural zeitgeist in its over-stimulated, digitally degraded sound, but the songs are too flimsy to carry her bold conceit. Without compelling tunes, the obnoxious public antics, dubious political messages, and thin voice that had grated on her naysayers have become impossible for even dedicated fans to ignore. It's as if everything that was great about M.I.A. has been stripped from this music, leaving behind only the most alienating aspects of her art and public persona.</p>
<p>It's hard to tell whether <i>/\/\/\Y/\</i> is half-assed or half-baked. There are certainly a number of good ideas in the mix here, but the execution is lacking. Tracks like ""Story to Be Told"", ""Lovealot"", and ""Teqkilla"" come across like mildly promising demos ready to be edited into sleeker, stronger compositions. Lead single ""XXXO"" sounds unfinished, as if everyone involved figured they may as well wait around for someone else to make a better remix. Most of the songs are built out of digital clangs and electronic noise, but unlike <i>Kala</i>'s ""Bird Flu"", in which chaotic clatter was the basis for a brilliant track evoking panic and confusion, this cacophony doesn't signify much of anything, aside from perhaps a desire to seem confrontational and daring. There are moments of interesting noise, but in the absence of appealing grooves or memorable hooks, it barely matters.</p>
<p>The production credits on <i>/\/\/\Y/\</i> aren't too different from <i>Kala</i> or <i>Arular</i>. Regular collaborators Switch and Diplo are back, but their contributions are disappointing despite their previous chemistry with M.I.A. ""Tell Me Why"", one of two songs with Diplo, aims in the general direction of the pop crossover success of ""Paper Planes"", but the beat is limp, and the song is marred by a poor, heavily Auto-Tuned vocal performance. ""Born Free"", produced by M.I.A. with Switch, is appealingly aggressive and punky, but the intentionally amateurish sound diminishes rather than accentuates its visceral impact. ""Steppin' Up"", a Switch collaboration with Rusko, is the album's most successful attempt at grafting her jarring new aesthetic to a traditional M.I.A. rhyme, but it's still a far cry from, say, ""Bamboo Banga"" or ""Pull Up the People"". Both producers get lost in this deliberate clutter.</p>
<p>M.I.A.'s new collaborators don't fare any better. Dubstep producer Rusko seems to be the most dialed-in to her current muse, but his tracks are better at evoking vague menace than provoking physical movement. Sleigh Bells' Derek E. Miller, author of some of 2010's most inspired and aggressive bangers, is wasted here. Rather than providing a track as enormous as ""Kids"" or ""Crown on the Ground"", his riff from the Sleigh Bells tune ""Treats"" is mutated into the haphazard ""Meds and Feds"". That song is not a total disaster, but it's certainly a missed opportunity and a poor application of a strong guitar riff. Sugu's intro track ""The Message"" is the worst thing on an album of failed experiments-- a bad demo with a simplistic, paranoid rap that's as rhetorically effective as someone in a dorm room ranting about the C.I.A. inventing A.I.D.S. It's not the best idea to kick off your politically charged album with a song that demolishes the possibility of addressing a serious issue about privacy with any degree of depth or nuance.</p>
<p>It's not exactly a surprise that M.I.A. would opt to create such an off-putting and anti-pop album at this point in her career. She may be reaching for an interesting and provocative style, but her motives seem defensive in nature-- reasserting her artsy, agit-prop cred not long after breaking through to the mainstream and becoming engaged to the heir of the Bronfman liquor fortune. On a superficial level,  <i>/\/\/\Y/\</i> is a challenge, but it's really more of a retreat.

Working as How to Dress Well, he's able to synthesize an unusual combination of influences to make striking music that can alternately frighten and comfort. Over the last year, Krell uploaded a number of short EPs to his blog and gave them away for free. <i>Can't See My Own Face - The Eternal Love 2</i> is Krell's most cohesive moment as How to Dress Well yet, a five-track release that deconstructs R&amp;B motifs and marries them with a corroded home-recorded aesthetic. From the xx to pop-contortionists like James Blake, there seems to be a new appreciation of pre-millennial, silk-spun R&amp;B in the air among indie types, to the point where earnestly name-dropping Keith Sweat, as Krell did in an interview with Pitchfork, seems like a plausible and sincere gesture. This shift is a little less surprising considering that the artists in question are now in their early to mid-twenties. They grew up with this music, and now they're trying to do something new with it.</p>
<p>For his part, Krell takes a more experimental approach, making a lot of the material on <i>Can't See My Own Face</i> difficult to access on a first encounter. By replacing some of R&amp;B's lust with solitary longing, he creates a space that's hard to pin down. There's a certain amount of sensuality when he coos, ""I will always love you, baby,"" but the songs seem to come from somewhere distant. Though he makes these songs sound personal and inwardly directed (as he does on the lush, haunting opener ""Suicide Dream 2""), Krell is also able to tap into the smooth surface structure of the music he's reconfiguring. The results can be pleasurable and relatable and also alienated and creepy.</p>
<p>Part of the reason Krell is able to pull off this strange hybrid is his great ear for melody (especially when paired with percussive elements, like on the peculiarly catchy ""Mr. By &amp; By"" here). But the melodies are frequently obscured by the damaged production. At points, when his piercing wail shoots into the red and things begin to distort quickly and sharply, it can be difficult to resist the instinctual urge to slip your headphones off. But according to Krell, the rougher portions of the recordings are deliberate. And because there's no obvious need for Krell's haunting delivery to be obstructed-- he really does have a wonderful voice-- for some listeners, the application of this much distortion might feel like an arty nuisance.</p>
<p>But the more you listen, that tension is part of what makes the music special. Listening through the noise for the joyous, romantic moments makes <i>Can't See My Own Face</i> that much more intimate. Krell's voice alone confronts the harsher textures in a strangely victorious kind of way. And the more you find yourself anticipating something gorgeous just below the surface or just around the bend, the more you start to hear.</p></div>"|14414.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14414-cant-see-my-own-face-the-eternal-love-2/|8.0|Zach Kelly

You can imagine these guys know a thing or two about being in the backcountry. Despite their reliance on electronic elements and looping devices, their sound is naturalistic and reminiscent of some of the more outré acts from the late, great Jewelled Antler Collective, who would sometimes rely only on field recordings and scraped-pinecone sounds to evoke nature's aura. Woodsman's sound is a little more straightforwardly accessible than that, but they're still a group that concerns itself with capturing a ""mood"" above all else. Their latest release, the <i>Mystery Tape</i> EP, is drenched in the kind of sleepless, nocturnal dread you might feel while lost in the forest. Melodic figures repeat like mantras, while wisps of voices float in and out of these five tracks, left to dangle and remain unfinished.</p>
<p>But while there is an incantatory, shaman-like quality to Woodsman's sound, on the <i>Mystery Tape</i> EP the group exerts a type of restraint that was lacking in their previous full-length, <i>Collages</i>. Other like-minded acts might take this heady sound and jam its mechanisms with vocal whoops and ""tribal"" drums, but Woodsman possess a deep focus, keeping most of the pieces on this release under five minutes. These guys may jam in their spare time, but they're not making us listen to it. Instead, they create tightly-wound songs where everything evolves organically and unfolds on its own time.</p>
<p>Regardless of clarity, a dense, smoky fog hangs throughout the EP, and Woodsman do get a little lost during the 14-minute album closer, ""Smells Like Purple"". With that one exception, the band's sound cuts through the haze, generally refusing to slip into the background. The fact that they have two drummers, Eston Lathrop and Dylan Shumaker, helps. The grooves they lay into lock together like unevenly laid bricks, keeping time within each other's drum fills while adding a few rhythmic tics. At times, another guitar line is added to the mix, turning the dripping atmosphere of ""Hocus Pocus"" into something more immediate and lending an almost-beachy vibe to ""Balance"".</p>
<p>EP highlight ""When the Morning Comes"" finds Woodsman at their most transcendent. Wordless vocals stretch across a skipping drumbeat, while electronic sounds lay low in the background. Then, dense ambience rolls in, the beat drops out, and those patiently waiting electronic blips and bleeps erupt, spiraling upwards. If Woodsman keep on this path, perhaps they're headed that way as well.</p></div>"|14408.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14408-mystery-tape-ep/|7.7|Larry Fitzmaurice

While he lives in San Francisco, his music's earthy tunefulness and gospel influences honor the rural South of his birth. But straight folk has an unvarnished spontaneity that Daniels permits only intermittently. While his core tunes are perfect for strumming on the porch, he dresses them up in arrangements and orchestration from jazz and classical music. His FatCat debut, <i>Sharp Teeth</i>, earned wide praise and equally wide comparisons to Will Oldham, mainly because of Daniels' voice. In practice, he's more like Sam Amidon-- placing at least as much emphasis on the setting as the song-- with a hint of the outsized sincerity of Saddle Creek-style emo-folk.</p>
<p>Daniels next album, <i>Fear of Flying</i>, squandered his gifts for arrangement on undercooked and punitively somber songs. The grimness was understandable, as the record was about his grandparents' physical decline. But his third major release, <i>I Mean to Live Here Still</i>, proves that he can address mortality without the doldrums. With new collaborators, robust hooks, and an energetic take on Daniels' signature sound, it's his best record yet.</p>
<p><i>I Mean to Live Here Still</i> is a collaboration with the Virginia-based, nine-piece jazz ensemble Fight the Big Bull. The songs, with lyrics adapted from Henry David Thoreau, were worked out via mail, and then recorded all together in Virginia. As a result, they feel painstakingly assembled but not sterile-- in fact, they flirt with controlled chaos. Horns are a huge presence and span the tonal range from free-jazz splatter to Dixieland gaiety. The album's spirit of joyous lamentation often calls to mind New Orleans funeral marches, especially on the chipper ""The Funeral Bell"". But you're just as likely to hear cerebral percussion breakdowns and pattern weaves.</p>
<p>The drawback is that the songs occasionally get lost in the arrangements. The long, squalling breakdown of ""Die and Be Buried"" sets up an awesome drop, as does the sharking bass and percussion workout in the middle of ""On Fields"". But Daniels' voice is so crucial to his music's personality. It's supple and comfortable even at the limits of its range, where it tends to linger. When his voice disappears for long stretches, the album can slip out of focus. It creates the odd impression that the nine-piece band has muscled him out of the room.</p>
<p>But Daniels' ambition pays off when the band is more fully integrated. ""All Things Are Current Found"" is one of those big syrupy numbers he does so well, where layers of voices and instrumentation pile up sweetly, but with hints of impassioned sourness. The horn player on ""Through All the Fates"" earns an MVP award for his highly musical but comical turn: At one point he makes the horn ""sing"" the la la la's from the vocal melody; a good-natured razz. And this jazz unit is also able to handle more formal ideas, like the carefully stacked intervals of the slow-dawning ""Each Summer Sound"". Daniels is still working his way through some equivocation between art music and folk music, but this is the closest he's come yet to sealing the seams.</p></div>"|14441.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14441-i-mean-to-live-here-still/|7.5|Brian Howe

A songwriter, producer, and electronically adventurous guitarist in the Robert Fripp school, Dunn co-founded pioneering Atlanta band the Fans, whose music R.E.M.'s Peter Buck later tried to release, without success. Dunn also co-produced two seminal Georgia singles, the B-52's' ""Rock Lobster"" and Pylon's ""Cool""/""Dub"", along with the latter's debut album, <i>Gyrate</i>. His solo work, however, has been out of print for more than 20 years.<br/> <br/> Watertown, Mass.-based Casa Nueva Industries sets that right with <i>No Great Lost: Songs, 1979-1985</i>. Coming after last year's DFA release of Pylon's <i>Chomp More</i> and the recent Acute reissue by fellow Athens, Ga., band the Method Actors, this anthology shows Dunn made some strikingly contemporary-sounding records in his own right. Bridging effete 1970s UK art-rock and the jagged, jerky American new wave he'd helped shepherd, with clever deconstructions of rock'n'roll classics for good measure, Dunn would fit right in with the more recent Atlanta scene of brainy, bratty bands like Deerhunter, the Coathangers, and Black Lips.</p>
<p>In a recent interview with Atlanta's <i>Creative Loafing</i>, Dunn recalls making ""Star Trek"" jokes while a student at Cal Arts during the early 1970s, and indeed there's an endearing nerdiness throughout <i>No Great Lost</i>. On 1981 solo debut <i>The Judgement of Paris</i>, presented here in its entirety, Dunn applies his autodidactism to oblique hooks, analog synths, drum machine beats, and inventive guitar freakouts; he can sneer, ""Mommy, I don't wanna be a fascist,"" mock a ""prolix prole,"" and warn of ""rising vampires and falling empires,"" right before offering a resplendently textured ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" instrumental. For all Dunn's intellect, though, he also shows balls. Surfy opener ""911"" doesn't get much less incendiary once you remember he's hiccuping ""nine-eleven"" about not the World Trade Center attack, but the Jonestown mass suicide (bands: cover this). Nearly as impressive as the music is the album's remixing by engineer Pete Weiss, who tried to recreate the sound of the vinyl from the master tapes following the destruction of Bruce Baxter's original mixes in an apartment fire-- ""Bother,"" Dunn dryly notes in his hyper-intelligent accompanying essay.</p>
<p><i>No Great Lost</i> can be a lot to take in one sitting, but it's worth setting aside some time as well for its inclusions from Dunn's 1984 <i>C'est toujours la même guitare</i> EP, 1985 sophomore LP <i>Tanzfeld</i>, and 1979 single ""Nadine"" (featuring synth by the Brains' Tom Gray-- hey, when is somebody going to reissue the band that gave Cyndi Lauper ""Money Changes Everything""?). There's even one Fans song, the aptly titled ""Cars and Explosions"". Arriving with testimonials from Apples in Stereo's Robert Schneider and the late critic Robert Palmer, this release is a singularly warped artifact from a post-punk intellectual off in his own world. It's a world not so different from the one many bands inhabit today, and it has its own strange rewards.</p></div>"|14277.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14277-no-great-lost-songs-1979-1985/|7.5|Marc Hogan

Considering how instrumental Flying Lotus has been in building a scene of likeminded beatmakers, it was a bit jarring when he admitted to Pitchfork that ""a lot of halfway kids, come out here, kids who started making beats six months ago, thinking they can get on stage because their drums are off."" It's possible that sort of people he might be talking about would share a similar profile to Will Wiesenfeld: 21 years old, hailing from a sleepy, suburban outpost like Chatsworth, and employing non-quantized drumbeats to... gah, make love songs. But Wiesenfeld's C.V. checks out: despite his age, he's a veteran, previously working in the classically-informed but unclassifiable [Post-Foetus] before being invited by Daedalus to open for a Destroy L.A. show featuring FlyLo and Nosaj Thing. It was there that Baths was born, and with <i>Cerulean</i>, he places himself as something of the pop voice that the L.A. beathead scene never realized it needed.</p>
<p>Wiesenfeld reacted negatively on his MySpace at this site's use of the word ""blunted"" to describe ""Maximalist"", and I can understand where he's coming from. After all, his live videos on Yours Truly prove that this is music that's physically demanding to compose and perform, requiring deep concentration and focus.  It's not a stretch to liken Baths to any number of beat-minded chillwavers, but the crucial difference is that where Toro Y Moi or Washed Out might let their sampled textures go slack to create a beanbag-ready laidback vibe, Baths' debut, <i>Cerulean</i>, is more suited to the weight bench. These beats have muscle. ""Maximalist"", for example, hits hard, but its force is drawn from sheer density. The track begins as a woozy wave before a low tide ushers in a Books-like sample stating, ""It takes a lot of courage to go out there and radiate your essence."" These are big feelings Wiesenfeld is trying to capture.</p>
<p><i>Cerulean</i> has clear influences, but it also has its own point of view. It would probably be overload if the lyrics matched the density of the music, but the themes in <i>Cerulean</i> are pretty simple-- the desire for human connection and occasionally (""Indoorsy"") a retreat from it. Wiesenfeld is the kind of artist who would write a Latin-tinged song about forbidden love that would show up on your iPod as ""♥"". And as much as the front-and-center emotionalism on the album threatens to collapse, the record comes unhinged only once, on ""You're My Excuse to Travel"", when matter-of-fact lyrics (""I love you enough to drive like an hour from wherever I am to be with you"") filtered through a fork-in-socket vocal performance that recalls an electrified Passion Pit.</p>
<p>The sturdiest melody belongs to ""Plea"", and while the plea itself is a basic desire-- ""Please tell me you need me""-- there's something deeper going on. It's addressed to a male figure, and Wiesenfeld lives in the battleground of Proposition 8, so the line, ""We're still not valid,"" lends a crushing blow and possibly gives a new layer of meaning to ""♥"", where the lovers are on the lam because what they're doing is ""wrong."" But as with Franz Ferdinand's ""Michael"" or Bloc Party's ""I Still Remember"", it shouldn't be applauded simply because it's addressing the difficulty of gay relationships in what's otherwise a sexually blank scene. It should be applauded because it's a fantastic song.</p>
<p>When talking to Pitchfork earlier this year, Wiesenfeld was sheepish about the genesis of his stage name-- he just likes baths. But it's a thread that runs throughout <i>Cerulean</i>, trying to find an escape while remaining down to earth, searching for something magical in our day-to-day lives. Some find it in a drink; some find it in nature. Others will find it in <i>Cerulean</i>.</p></div>"|14433.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14433-cerulean/|8.2|Ian Cohen

<p class=""MsoNormal"">There's one version of the narrative behind these recordings that's romantic but also basically true: that they represent an incredible victory of the artist's spirit. Daniel Johnston was a young man in West Virginia-- 19-22 years old in this period, 1980-83-- with no audience, no particular support from his family, no musical community to speak of, no recording equipment but a cheap boombox, a voice like roofing nails on glass, an out-of-tune piano, and chronic, debilitating mental illness. He also had an unstoppable drive to redeem the materials of his life as art, and as ungainly and twisted as his songs were, they had aspects of shocking beauty and freshness. So the songs poured out-- hundreds of them, on a series of cheap cassettes that he gave to anybody who might possibly care, until people did. (In other words, there is no valid excuse for not making your art in a world where Daniel Johnston managed to do what he did.)</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Another version, which is also basically true, is that this outpouring of songs was thoughtful, focused labor by an artist who was happy to give himself over to the <i>idea</i><span> of obsession and awkward personal revelation. A lot of Johnston's signature sound-- crappy home recordings on bottom-of-the-line cassettes, naked instrumental fumbling-- was more or less forced on him by his circumstances. But it was also a deliberate, fully realized aesthetic-- those between-song audio-verité sound collages didn't get there by accident. To think that Johnston didn't know exactly what he was doing is to not listen to the work itself.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Granted, it's pretty hard to listen to some of this particular work: six discs' worth of early Johnston's misery, tape grind, piano-banging, and yelping is about eight times the recommended weekly maximum dose. Another problem with the myth of Johnston as ""naïve"" is the suggestion that his work is all of a piece, which it isn't by a long shot; some of these tapes are way better than others. <i>Songs of Pain</i><span>, a compilation of Johnston's best (and most archly moralistic) early material that he put together for Kathy McCarty, includes a handful of extraordinary songs-- ""Grievances"" is a statement of purpose for the rest of his career, ""Never Relaxed"" might be the funniest thing he's ever recorded, and ""Living Life"" is a bloodied but unbowed power-pop tune. </span><i>More Songs of Pain</i><span>-- reissued as a twofer with </span><i>Songs of Pain</i><span> a few years ago-- is a more accomplished if less bracing take on a lot of the same themes.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">On the other hand, <i>Don't Be Scared</i><span> and </span><i>The What of Whom</i><span>, respectively recorded in July and August of 1982, are lacking in quality control-- the mock-""disco medley"" of ""Stars on Parade"" is plain awful-- and get rather samey (apart from the terrific, self-romanticizing number that gives this box its title). And most of the songs on the two volumes of </span><i>The Lost Recordings</i><span>, reproduced from circa-1983 tapes Johnston literally found under his bed seven years later, sound like unfinished sketches and half-hearted demos. It doesn't help that </span><i>The Story of an Artist</i><span>'s booklet, which includes artwork by Johnston, interviews with people close to him, and notes by Everett True, contradicts itself about some of this material. Did Johnston give Jeff Tartakov the master copy of </span><i>Don't Be Scared</i><span> before he threw most of his belongings into a dumpster, as Tartakov writes in his introduction? Or did Tartakov rescue it from the dumpster, per an editorial note in an interview with McCarty?</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Later in 1983, Johnston moved to Texas, and recorded his best cassettes, including <i>Yip/Jump Music</i><span> and the harrowing ""unfinished album"" </span><i>Hi, How Are You</i><span>. He didn't really begin to find an audience until a bit later; Tartakov began duplicating and distributing these early tapes in 1987, after Johnston was already something of a cult item. It's not quite fair to dismiss any set that includes the </span><i>Songs of Pain</i><span> as juvenilia, but this box is less the story of this particular artist than a portrait of a difficult artist as a difficult young man.<br/></span></p>

If you're imagining an unholy matrimony of Autechre and Albert Ayler, slow your roll. Tadlock's synthesized soundscapes are busy but well behaved, full of precisely whirring, subtly interlocking little pieces. By the same token, his jazz accoutrements are applied openly but not overbearingly. Thin saxophone bleats float through the mix, while clattery percussion stumbles around but does its best not to knock over the furniture.</p>
<p>What makes Spirituals work is the same age-old thing that helps make the Books or Four Tet work, namely the tension between efficient technology and messy humanity. ""City With Soul"" is a great example, as Tadlock blends an insistently mechanistic chopped-up synth with swirly blobs of psychedelic keys, sax blurts, and gibbering voices. Ditto ""Pilsner"", which callously drops Shadow-esque drumbeats and squawking sax all over an industrious little factory of maniacally repetitive pulses and tones (as you've perhaps surmised, saxophone is frequently the attention-grabber here, much as it is in free jazz; Tadlock may dole it out judiciously, but it truly is the ghost in the machine).</p>
<p>The more you listen to <i>Spirituals</i>, the greater sense you get of Tadlock as being the kind of guy who would spend hours setting up dominoes just for the thrill of toppling them. Like how ""Manzanita"" spends three and a half minutes following a lovingly intricate series of miniature electronic loops only to have a monkey wrench of jazz junk tossed into its gears. Or how the momentum of the opening ""Wanderings"", with its Morricone whistles and ""Baba O'Riley"" keys, keeps getting subtly undermined by arrogantly laggard drumbeats. As the album progresses, Tadlock's designs do begin to feel a little formulaic, and certainly he's working toward something that guys like Kieran Hebden and Dan Snaith have done better. Still, Tadlock is an engaging electronic craftsman, and the interjection of instrumental cacophony into his pieces is done consistently enough and well enough to grant the jazz club-trawling Oregonian his own distinctive artistic voice.</p></div>"|14443.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14443-spirituals/|7.6|Joshua Love

The title of Casiokids' recent <i>Topp</i> <i>Stemning På Lokal Bar</i> loosely translated to ""great vibe at a local bar,"" and now diskJokke offers <i>En Fin Tid</i>, or ""a happy time."" That's a modest and direct summary of the experience the Oslo-based producer christened Joachim Dyrdahl creates on his second LP, following his strong 2007 debut, <i>Staying In</i>. At this rate, Todd Terje will be probably drop an album called <i>Funky Cowbell Italo Edits</i> any day now.</p>
<p>Dyrdahl has his own special place in the Norwegian prog-disco pantheon: Prins Thomas is the earthiest, Lindstrøm is the most spacey, and diskJokke, the breeziest. His tracks twinkle with colorful hand percussion and wind-chime synths, and the buoyant, effortless feel is achieved with arithmetical precision. Grounding the dawn-breaking aesthetics of Brian Eno and Tangerine Dream in sturdy dance and tropical styles, <i>En Fin Tid</i> is full of mini-odysseys through the realms of happy and happier.</p>
<p>What amounts to a fun summer record for us is more personal for Dyrdahl: It's about becoming a father and a full-time musician after abandoning a career in mathematics. Whatever the inspiration, this record demonstrates Dyrdahl's ear for builds, as he seamlessly integrates sound layers and big, batted-around themes. The best tracks emphasize these skills. But while diskJokke's strongest suit is the liquid-neon bubble bath, he can do some cool stuff in a more aggressive vein too. Upwelling tropical suds offset the steely pulses of the title track, which pushes it over the line between gear workout and imaginative composition.</p>
<p>The straight-cut cadences Dyrdahl favors are perfect contrasts for the loopy twists and Theremin-squeals of his characteristic melodies, but they're less satisfying when left to fend for themselves. The more linear tracks here pale in comparison to the baroque fantasies. Appropriately for a record about fresh starts, it is sometimes better at cranking up than following through. Epic closer ""Nattestid"" reprises the Reichian piano patterns of <i>Staying In</i> standout ""Folk I Farta"", but its endless microhouse permutations and drain-swirling synths feel like they're in search of a big drop that never arrives. It's a sweet track that could have been a real heater. Still, these few tepid patches are far from deal-breakers. While <i>En Fin Tid</i> might squander a few opportunities, it's never anything less than pleasurable, smart, and highly evocative of diskJokke's unique, rose-tinted perspective.</p></div>"|14405.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14405-en-fin-tid/|7.2|Brian Howe

Broadly, in Spanish-speaking Latin America, the term is used to refer to a city or village founded by people of African descent (sometimes joined by Native Americans), usually escaped slaves. In Colombia specifically, the town of San Basilio de Palenque is one of the last places where a Spanish-Bantu creole language called Palenquero is still commonly spoken. It's a unique and endangered language that most Spanish speakers can't understand, and it's one of the starkest reminders of Colombia's centuries-old cultural link to Africa via slavery-- around 20% of Colombia's population has African ancestry.</p>
<p>African currents run through much of the popular music of Latin America, but in 1970s Colombia an interesting thing happened: The then-current popular musics of Colombia and West Africa merged to create an updated Afro-Latin sound that ultimately evolved into champeta in the 1980s. This unique, omnivorous genre of Colombian music eventually broke out of its regional base around Cartagena and San Basilio to become a part of Colombian culture at large, much the same way that jazz spilled out of New Orleans and into the fabric of American culture. This compilation from Britain's Soundway records, co-compiled by label founder Miles Cleret and Colombia native (and owner of Palenque Records) Lucas Silva, offers a time-lapse of the evolution of this intercontinental fusion.</p>
<p>Much as the soundsystem gave birth to ska and ultimately reggae in Jamaica, the roots of this music can be found in the picos, the local term for the Cartagena and Barranquilla soundsystems. The DJs that spun records for the picos were a resourceful bunch-- they played their share of local cumbias and other Colombian music, but they cut it with Caribbean music and hard-to-procure records from Africa, whipping up a gumbo of cumbia, compas, highlife, rumba, salsa, soukous, and funk that influenced what the musicians coming up listening to all of this would play on their own records. ""Burumburumbum"", by Casimbas Negras is practically geography-neutral. It has guitars that sound like they came off a record from Ghana, a snaking sax line that could have been recorded in Martinique, chanted vocals, and a jumpy rhythm that's part cumbia, part Afrobeat lockgroove.</p>
<p>All up and down this set, the guitar playing is a joy-- a clear tone on the electric guitar was the preferred sound, and these guys aren't doing a lot of strumming or chicken-scratching. The lines they play are fluid and melodic, dueting or sometimes dueling with the singers, settling into sunny highlife patterns or cutting loose with an oddly psychedelic flourish. That's the other thing that's in no short supply here: experimentation. The vocal formula for this music was fairly consistent, with a lead engaging in a spirited dialogue with a chanting, repetitive chorus. But these bands and solo artists find so many combinations of rhythms and arrangements to wrap around that basic formula that it doesn't feel repetitive over the course of the full 21 tracks (23 on the 3xLP version).</p>
<p>The experimentation is more overt on some tracks, with echo effects and odd guitar noises spicing up the hand percussion. Wganda Kenya has three songs here, and his have a strange flavor. ""El Lobo"" features rattles and buzzing synthesizer in its portentous intro, but it's actually not quite as strange as ""Pim Pom"", which is all voice and percussion until a wild electric organ part comes in, essentially soloing under the vocals. The organ sounds suspended in the middle of the mix, mingling neither with the percussion nor the vocals but effective all the same. His final track, ""Yoro"", is a slow, pretty highlife. It's one of a few downtempo tracks that balance the running order, offsetting frantic songs such as Abelardo Carbonó y su Conjunto's frantic ""Quiero a Mi Gente"", which sounds like hyper-speed Peruvian chicha music.</p>
<p>At this point, it's almost unremarkable when another long-lost scene from some far-away corner of the world is unearthed and presented to the West in an easily digestible, well-produced compilation. If you're a global vintage pop junkie, it's become a matter of, ""Oh, of course tons of amazing music was made in this place at that time, and here it is, thanks to someone else's hard work and passion."" It almost feels like I should be bored or fatigued by it. But you know what? I'm not, and I think there's a stupidly simple reason for that: it's great music, and it fills a space, stylistically and sonically, that was previously empty.</p></div>"|14423.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14423-palenque-palenque-champeta-criolla-afro-roots-in-colombia-1975-91/|8.2|Joe Tangari

She's enjoyed big hits that have crossed over from urban radio to the novelty-hungry pop audience. The problem is just that, though: Songs like ""Milkshake"" and ""Caught Out There"" were taken as novelty songs in the U.S. With Kelis classed as a weirdo outsider-- or worse, nothing more than a mouthpiece for the Neptunes-- both 1999's <i>Kaleidoscope</i> and 2003's <i>Tasty</i> sank from memory once America had squeezed her striking singles dry. Kelis hit the scene in that brief window opened by Missy Elliot, when it looked like R&amp;B radio might have room for more than one oddball with an experimentalist's bent. Despite the fact that her producer pals had the zeitgeist in a stranglehold for a few years, this proved not to be case, to say the least.</p>
<p>And so: the nine-track <i>Flesh Tone</i>. A decade ago, this album would have been career suicide. Now, it sounds so of-the-moment, a full-length exploration of the house music influence that's been all over the radio over the last few years, that it's easy to hear it as a pre-planned attempt at nine hits in a row.</p>
<p>If so, she's miscalculated a bit. This isn't one of will.i.am's stadium-storming pop-dance hybrids, despite the fact that the BEP scourge is now one of Kelis' benefactors. Nor is it one of the over-sugared confections Benny Blanco has spun for Britney or Ke$ha (where sugary becomes barf-worthy). No, this is unadulterated house music, of the sort that's gripped continental European hedonists for almost 20 years. Fans of Kelis-as-leftfield-R&amp;B-singer should consider themselves warned.</p>
<p><i>Flesh Tone</i> can be as harsh as anything the more brutalist French producers turned out last decade and as melodic as last season's Ibiza smashes. It's structured to flow as smoothly as a pop DJ mix, complete with shape-shifting instrumental segues between tunes. Kelis' producers, including such hipster-unfriendly names as David Guetta and Benny Benasi, have fashioned a catalog of super-club staple sounds. (Naysayers might call them clichés, with the obligatory upturned nose.)</p>
<p>Naturally everything gets sweetened a bit, given that Kelis is still working with the radio (rather than the dancefloor) in mind. The electro riff on ""Acapella"" lurks in the background, under Kelis' low-key ecstasy and Guetta's melodic bells-and-whistles. And ""Scream"" shifts from beachside house piano to Kelis imitating a haughty electroclash ingenue. All of this subgenre synthesizing is a bit shameless. It's also frequently great, at least if you're already enamored with big, bright, synthetic dance music.</p>
<p>Now you can't entirely chalk up Kelis' career foibles to a mercurial marketplace, or an unadventurous public, or label mismanagement. Sure, she lacks the show-stopping pipes of a Beyoncé. Most R&amp;B singers do. But there's also something oddly mannered and/or affectless about many of her performances, which you can easily see alienating fans of a genre built on emoting. But here she's clearly working in the tradition of the archly mechanical disco diva, where little eruptions of passion color a delivery as metronomic as the beats. Whereas once her voice got lost between the Neptunes massive beats, on <i>Flesh Tone</i> Kelis blends with the rhythm for the first time.</p>
<p>And yet, despite Britney revitalizing her career with an even more robotic sound, despite the fact that you can turn on the TV and see the (even more) affectless La Roux strutting her chilly stuff, ""Acapella"" bounced right off the U.S. pop charts, which bodes ill for <i>Flesh Tone</i>. Maybe Kelis just can't catch a break. Or maybe Americans still want pop-dance that's more pop than dance. Whatever her bad luck might be down to, Kelis can take some small comfort in having made her best album since <i>Kaleidoscope</i>. Hopefully the full-scale disco makeover won't scare off the future-funk fans who've sustained her career thus far.</p></div>"|14439.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14439-flesh-tone/|7.2|Jess Harvell

The track streaming at her site, ""Bollywood"", is bhangra-rap about how she ended up doing TV scores out of broke desperation, featuring a bunch of ""funny"" pitch-altered voices imitating music-biz gladhanders ripping her off. It's one of <i>Funstyle</i>'s four key tracks, all in a similar prefab-beats-and-wacky-voices vein; another is ""U Hate It"", a patchwork thing (with fake Prince harmonies) about how much everybody's going to think her record sucks, unless it's a hit, in which case they'll pretend they all loved her in the first place and her success was their doing. Its refrain goes, ""I think I'm a genius/ You're being a peni-us... colada, that is.""</p>
<p>Two things are immediately evident about those four songs. One is that they're horrible on just about every conceivable level, and there's no way Phair can't know it (psst: ""U Hate It""!). The other is that they are not the particular flavors of horrible anybody would ever have guessed Phair would perpetrate. The sub-Jewel alt-country move? Sure. The pro forma kid-music album? It's plausible. Suppressing her unique songwriting gifts to sound like a lesser Sheryl Crow clone? She's kind of done that already. But this? This is Phair <i>razing her image to the ground</i>: spitting at anyone who thinks they know who ""Liz Phair"" is, or expects her to make <i>Guyville VI: The Return of the Exile</i>. The only comparable album that comes to mind is Bob Dylan's 1970 double-middle-finger double-LP <i>Self Portrait</i>, on which he successfully alienated the audience that had been paying too much attention to him.</p>
<p>Naturally, the immediate reaction to <i>Funstyle</i> was ""What is this shit?"" That was, of course, followed by a wave of contrarianism: admirers of Phair's early records arguing that actually it's pretty okay, that it's raw and eccentric and personal in a way her albums haven't been since the 1990s, that there are some decent songs on it. And it's true--what <i>Funstyle</i> lacks in fuck-all-y'all formal purity it possesses in the flickers of songcraft she can't shake. It's hard to avoid scavenging it for salvageable bits. ""You Should Know Me"" is badly arranged, but it's the kind of uncertain, circling, not-quite-foursquare picking at an emotional scab she's always specialized in; ""Oh, Bangladesh"" never justifies its lyrical conceit or lax, doodly lead guitar, but it flatters her voice's odd contours. ""And He Slayed Her"" has one terrific, furious line (""I mean, what kind of kid were you when you were a kid?/ What kind of man would do what you did?""--it's the conversational sputter of ""I mean"" that makes it), marooned in a lyric that rhymes ""crooked soul"" with, all together now, ""rock'n'roll.""</p>
<p>Even beyond the ghastly FruityLoops-and-varispeed numbers, though, there are some more conventionally cruddy songs here, like ""Satisfied"", a Bryan Adams-level string of clichés: ""I came, I saw, I kicked its ass/ I walked away and I never looked back/ I remember you when you held my hair/ As I puked, oh, everywhere"". Is that Liz Phair doing a power ballad, or Liz Phair parodying power ballads? It's impossible to tell at this point. Maybe <i>Funstyle</i> will be liberating for her; maybe, as with <i>Self Portrait</i>, her deck-clearing exercise will let her shake off aspects of the way she's understood that she finds burdensome. At the very least, it's a shrewd way to lower expectations. After this, whatever she does next can only be a pleasant surprise.</p></div>"|14444.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14444-funstyle/|2.6|Douglas Wolk

So Percussion are devoted to contemporary classical music written for percussion, a slender, under-explored niche that they have proven to contain revelations. Matmos, the partnership of Martin Schmidt and former Pitchfork contributor Drew Daniel, have always heard symphonies in life's smallest details, sampling things like thawing streams and liposuction vacuums and building busy pop tapestries out of them. Together, they have performed off and on for a number of years, and it's easy to see, when they are together onstage, what these two curious, highly specialized sensibilities found attractive in each other. <i>Treasure State</i> is the group's first collaboration on record, and the good news is that they have achieved a sort of mind meld between their two approaches.</p>
<p>Matmos' albums typically come with some conceptual bent; 2001's <i>A Chance to Cut Is a Chance to Cure</i> sampled the sounds of an operating room, while 2006's <i>The Rose Has Teeth in the Mouth of the Beast</i> consisted of 10 sonic portraits of unconventional gay icons. <i>Treasure State</i> is a bit more straightforward. Billed as a ""representation of an American landscape""-- Montana, in this case, where the album was recorded, and whose official nickname gives the album its title-- <i>Treasure State</i> consists of eight tactile miniatures exploring the timbre of a series of materials. There seems to be no higher agenda at work than to discover how different objects sound when they are clonked with mallets or scratched or rubbed together, and this makes for an absorbing and refreshingly visceral listening experience.</p>
<p>Both Matmos and So Percussion share an uncanny ear for textures, and on <i>Treasure State</i>, it is nearly impossible to separate out where one group's contributions begin and the other's end-- it all coalesces into an engaging swirl of pinprick detail. ""Treasure"", the opening track, begins with some clear, ringing chimes, reminiscent of the gamelan music of composer Lou Harrison, before a wave of rustling noises slowly overtakes it. Trying to identify all those noises, or figure out whence they came, would be like trying to catalogue the species of insects in a rainforest with your eyes closed. The music works best when you just let the confounding clatter just wash over you.</p>
<p>Some of the pieces on the album bear a title suggestive of the materials used to perform it: ""Aluminum"", ""Needles"", ""Water"". The last is particularly evocative of its source, almost to the point of discomfort. As water is sloshed vividly around your headphone-space, dumped loudly into pails, and drizzled in thin streams near your eardrums, you may find yourself with an overpowering urge to hit pause and visit the bathroom. Matmos have always had a slightly morbid interest in the private sounds our bodies make, the kind most of us wouldn't relish amplifying, and there is a scattering of those here: humid squelches, smacking lips, salival pops.</p>
<p>For the most part, though, Matmos have toned down their more outré side for this project. There are no samples of, say, amplified crayfish nerve tissue or latex fetish wear. Their fascinations here are more practical and everyday. Like ""Shard"", which makes enticing and crunchy musique concrète out of broken pieces of pottery and the grinding of dinner plates. This is undoubtedly headphones music; trying to play this in the background would do a disservice to the very notion behind the project, which seems to beg for an undivided focus on that which we normally take for granted. This has always been Matmos' mission, and they have found marvelous partners in So Percussion, who add unprecedented levels of warmth and dimension to Matmos' busily crawling textures. Together, they make music of such heightened awareness to detail that it makes you almost hear your own pulse.</p></div>"|14429.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14429-treasure-state/|7.6|Jayson Greene

That wasn't always the case. During his tenure in the Appalachian-drone outfit Pelt during the early 1990s, Rose-- who passed away late last year-- made occasional, and often unorthodox, use of electric guitar. But during the last decade he devoted himself to acoustic instruments-- writing deeply meditative finger-style ragas in the spirit of neo-primitive pickers like John Fahey and Peter Walker. <i>Ragged and Right</i>, among Rose's final unreleased studio recordings, finds the guitarist plugging back in.</p>
<p>During a 2008 tour of the Midwest with D. Charles Speer and the Helix, Rose became smitten with Link Wray's <i>Mordicai Jones</i> album and <i>Three Track Shack</i> sessions, which were getting heavy rotation on the drives between gigs. To commemorate the trip, Rose recruited his tour mates for a session at Black Dirt Studio where they knocked off a few whiskey-soaked Wray covers, a Merle Haggard tune, and an original with Rose performing on lap steel and electric guitar.</p>
<p>The ringing and ominous drones he produced in Pelt are nowhere to be found here, though. Rather, Rose plays the traditional sideman-- dropping slick leads and solos into faithfully arranged country and western material. He had the licks to pull it off, too. His lap-steel work on the group's cover of Merle Haggard's ""The Longer You Wait"" is a reminder that Rose was a man of diverse chops-- a guy whose honky-tonk riffs were as inspired as his third-eye-popping ragas.</p>
<p>It's still weird, though. In his post-Pelt work, Rose seemed fascinated with the strangeness of pre-WWII blues and ragtime recordings-- their wobbling rhythms and foreign-sounding sense of melody. The group's Wray-inspired arrangement of ""In the Pines"", with its ""papa-ooh-mow-mow"" intro and unhinged vocals, stays true to that spirit. As a solo artist Rose never did much rock'n'roll-- not even on the EP <i>I Do Play Rock and Roll</i>-- but Wray's brand of weirdness might have made a good jumping-off point for him.</p>
<p>Not that the other guys are invisible. D. Charles Speer and the Helix fill out the session with drums and piano, and the group's leader, No-Neck Blues Band's Dave Shuford, provides lead vocals on three tracks. It's a group effort, for sure, and like Rose's upbeat <i>Dr. Ragtime and His Pals</i> LP, <i>Ragged</i> draws energy from the freewheeling collaborative spirit. Rose was a serious musician, but he had a lighter side, too. His sprawling ragas and solo compositions were frequently transcendent. On <i>Ragged and Right</i>, so is his bar-rock.</p></div>"|14421.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14421-ragged-and-right/|7.2|Aaron Leitko

His second album, <i>Privilege</i>, is a double LP with 20 tracks that mostly hover in the six- to eight-minute range. That's well over two hours of enigmatic techno to digest, and it can't even be called diverse, at least on the surface. Glitterbug's unwavering commitment to icy pulses, tidy minimal beats, and unfiltered repetitions makes the songs flow by without much fanfare. Dynamic shifts are used sparingly, and handled with precision. Despite all the steely synth arpeggios and clockwork drums, <i>Privilege</i> often feels more like ambient music than techno, settling comfortably between foreground and background, scratching the same itch as Gas and the Sight Below.</p>
<p>Brock Van Wey's <i>White</i> <i>Clouds Drift On and On</i> is a great example of a record that was both monolithic and advantageously overstuffed, pushing through some tedium in order to weave you fully into its unique world. Glitterbug's clipped palpitations wear thin more quickly, but his extended durations do wind up cultivating deep immersion. More editing here might have done more harm than good. It's not like there are a few heaters hidden in a bunch of filler, although the tracks with naturalistic pianos (""So Could We"", ""Lionheart"", ""Transitions"") are especially wonderful, and I wish there were more of them. Even though some tracks, taken individually, just go on for too long, together they accumulate an oceanic breadth and depth that makes <i>Privilege</i> as a whole feel more substantial than its parts.</p>
<p>Glitterbug's tracks are least interesting when they're most purely techno, although he has a strong handle on fundamentals. ""Cornered"", for example, ratchets up from arpeggio to house bass to snares to chimes, all neat as a pin, and represents the album at its most functional and sterile. The music gets more interesting as it mingles with carefully captured organic sounds and with other genres, like IDM, dub, modern classical and concrete music. Usually, a hint of mystery is all it takes: ""Blast"" would be feel pretty flat if not for the bit of resonance fluttering anxiously in the background.</p>
<p>Glitterbug recorded parts of this album on a global tour that encompassed the Arctic Circle and China, and a map of the journey is hidden in the album by way of field recordings, from the extremely wet-sounding water on ""Wide &amp; Near"" to the mind-gnawing whispers on ""Slurred Thinking"". You get a sense of all kinds of secret codes working beneath the hood, and these moments of near-intelligibility ease us through the long haul. We need such things to hold onto amid these almost featureless waves. Why bother with fills and rolls when one kick and one snare will get the point across? Glitterbug seems to wonder. This essentialist mindset reins everything into an ongoing pulse with no margin for error: It can be hypnotic or monotonous, but nowhere in between.</p></div>"|14416.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14416-privilege/|6.7|Brian Howe

They move freely, but within obsessively constructed worlds. They make the questionable choices lesser artists would be afraid to, and they do it on their own clock. But their reputation for being anal-retentive and self-contained is one of the reasons <i><a href=""http://www.mountwittenbergorca.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mount Wittenberg Orca</a></i>-- a recording of a song cycle performed last May for Housing Works, a charity and chain of upmarket thrift stores in New York-- is so refreshing. Dave Longstreth, the brain and foreman of Dirty Projectors, wrote the songs in less than a month, and the group rehearsed together for only a week. At a listening party the band held for the EP in late June, he explained that the songs were mostly recorded live and in the same room. The result is 20 minutes of music that sounds more dressed-down than anything Björk or Dirty Projectors have put out before. And while it's hard to imagine them working this stuff out while intermittently horsing around in the backyard, the performances here are casual, at least by their standards. The occasional blemishes aren't chinks in the armor, they're fortifying-- they're evidence of the group spirit at work.</p>
<p>The songs here are shorter, less cluttered, and just generally easier to listen to than <i>Bitte Orca</i>, which will disappoint you only if you love Dirty Projectors because of their relentless complexity. Some of this is a matter of instrumentation: Despite the spirit link that Longstreth, Amber Coffman, and Angel Deradoorian have formed over their guitar and bass playing, there's very little guitar in these songs, and the bass plays a comparatively conservative, anchoring role. The songs here focus on the singers. The DP women-- whose voices have a lemony, shrill quality-- continue their routine as android reconstructions of pre-rock backup singers; Björk still sounds like it has only been 10 minutes since she first crawled out from under a rock; and the blend works precisely because they don't try too hard to blend.</p>
<p>The songs, I'm told, are about whales-- or, more specifically, about a hike that Coffman took on Mount Wittenberg in Northern California. (All the proceeds from the record go to a National Geographic Society charity dedicated to the preservation of marine space.) One of the things I find interesting about Longstreth as an artist is how much he seems to need an external concept to be confessional, like covering Black Flag's <i>Damaged</i> as a way of revisiting teenage memories on 2007's <i>Rise Above</i>. Though a lot of the lyrics here are playful and relatively straightforward (""Beautiful mother up ahead of us, can you see us play inside the waves?""), there are a handful of moments where the lyrics transcend the concept. Björk, in a line that continuously shocks me out of the pretense that she's supposed to be a whale, sings ""Come into my home/ Murder my family."" By singing from the perspective of Coffman-- human alone in nature-- Longstreth is able to indulge in idealism that I suspect he believes in, but wouldn't feel comfortable owning up to in the dear-diary sense: ""I am free/ I am not bound to the difference between the real and the real to me.""</p>
<p>The EP is a small statement from artists who are accustomed to making big ones-- this isn't <i>Volta</i> or <i>Bitte Orca</i>. At this point, Dirty Projectors are on their way to becoming part of the New York elite, having also collaborated with the Roots and David Byrne in the past year and a half. Given that Björk probably isn't someone used to taking orders, her participation is a huge compliment to Dirty Projectors as a band and Longstreth as a writer. It's also evidence that Dirty Projectors still sound great without the endless overdubs and revisions-- evidence that whatever they could put together in a few weeks is still a lot more than what a mediocre band could put together in a career.</p></div>"|14436.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14436-mount-wittenberg-orca/|7.7|Mike Powell

Many of these acts start with pop structure and add beats and electronic arrangements borrowed from dance music. The best of these, like Delorean and ceo, combine elements in a way that appears seamless. But Blondes, who are friends Zach Steinman and Sam Haar, are more rooted in dance music proper. Rather than mixing styles, they build organic club music from the ground up using humble analog instruments. The result is kind of a bedroom take on Lindstrøm space-disco-- ultimately better suited for headphones than the dancefloor.</p>
<p>Blondes' debut single from last year, ""Spanish Fly"", was a fine encapsulation of their style. Introducing its sounds one at a time, the song has this great build-and-release where the payoff comes late, but the lead-up to it is just as fun. <i>Touched</i> is their first non-single release, and it stretches this approach out to five tracks. ""Spanish Fly"" is included, and there's another song I'll get to later that's as good, but a couple of others leave a bit to be desired. Blondes' tracks are very much about a slow unfurling of instruments-- there's a lot of restraint and craft that goes into them-- but they're linear in shape and tend to move in only one direction. For instance, opener ""You Mean So Much to Me"" has a lot of cool elements-- sparkling synths and depth-charge bass-- but a predictable composition: It builds, reaches a climax, then dials back down.</p>
<p>With a song like that, you can't help but wish there was some more movement to it (the final track, ""Virgin Pacific"", is similarly static), but Blondes show more dynamism on the EP's two remaining tracks. The 11-minute epic ""Moondance"" is the real winner here. There's an insistent piano and heavy bass holding it together, but the synths swoosh back and forth unpredictably, bouncing off one another in a way that makes it feel kind of bubbly and unstable. ""Paradise City"" takes the same approach and strikes a nice balance between Blondes' proggier, space-disco tendencies and a peaceful, ambient vibe. That feeling exists through most of the EP, and on the whole it shows promise. It'll be interesting to see how Blondes do when they stretch out to full-album length-- the extra space might let them go even deeper.</p></div>"|14432.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14432-touched-ep/|7.2|Joe Colly

The song, one half of this two track split 10"", is a bit of a disappointment. That could be simply the result of lofty expectations-- absence makes the heart grow fonder to a point, but answering the silence with something as pro-forma Torche-like as ""King Beef"" isn't going to satisfy anyone. The one wrinkle this tune offers is in its percussion, which comes with a slightly more industrial-sounding bent this time around. Otherwise, ""King Beef"" sounds like the sort of enjoyable yet undistinguished palette cleanser the group would add to an album between the real heavy cuts.</p>
<p>Aaron Turner art fans notwithstanding, if there's a reason to spend money (or bandwidth) on this release, it's for Boris' off-kilter contribution. Working harder than ever to escape pigeonholing (as admirers of their wide-ranging <i>Japanese Heavy Rock Hits</i> singles from last year can attest to), ""Luna"" finds the heavy psych stoner what-have-you group moving between black metal (specifically of the Burzum/Xasthur persuasion) and shoegaze. The song's tinny hardcore-speed drumming takes its cues from the former, while Takeshi's keening vocals sound like the result of his singing along to the new Serena-Maneesh album. Meanwhile, the guitars play both sides against each other, frantically keeping pace with the drummer in one moment, then switching gears to offer spacious ping-ponging two-note patterns while chords arc across the firmament.</p>
<p>This back-and-forth goes on for most of the track's 12-minute length, giving both the frenetic and fantastical elements of the song room to breathe, and turning what seems like a conceptual misstep into something much more respectable. There's even a sly nod to their release-mates in the track's coda, a minute-long snippet of sludge that, while not nearly as massive as the sort of tectonic rumble Torche can summon from the depths, does their metal compatriots proud.</p></div>"|14438.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14438-chapter-ahead-being-fake-ep/|6.0|David Raposa

He'd get a beat from Led Zeppelin or Kraftwerk going, then mash it up with Oum Kalthoum or a recording by some other Arabic or North African performer. And he was doing this in the 1970s, at a time when the mash-up was a distant-future pop cultural phenomenon and Grandmaster Flash was only beginning to map out his adventures on the wheels of steel. In a sense, Taha has never stopped making those mash-ups in a career that now spans almost 20 studio albums between Carte de Séjour and his solo career. He's got rock, reggae, techno, raï, and Arab pop wrapped so tightly together on his records that they're nearly inseparable. All the mixing makes sense, given his background as an Algerian by birth who has lived in France since the age of 10.</p>
<p>If there's one thing all his music has in common, it's that it moves, whether the beat is pushed along by North African percussion, a drum machine, a drum kit, or some combination of the three. The material on <i>Bonjour</i> is still kinetic, but the grooves are different, more locked in, and persistently downtempo. That might partly be a side effect of Taha's break with longtime producer Steve Hillage in favor of Gaëtan Roussel, the leader of popular French folk-rock band Louise Attaque, with additional production from Mark Plati. The bounce that Hillage gave Taha's albums has been replaced by tense, tightly coiled beats, and the various styles that Taha draws upon to inform his own are even more thoroughly smeared together. ""Mokhtar"" is basically synth pop with Taha singing in Arabic over the top as little Berber flourishes and swathes of distorted guitar gnaw at the edges. ""Sélu"" is the biggest exception to the generally slower tempos, but it sticks with the album's overall technique of building off of hypnotic, repetitive rhythms. ""Ha Baby"" has a fluid rhythmic underpinning, but it's more traditionally Arabic, the beat covered with flecks of oud and mandolute.</p>
<p>It's not quite Led Zeppelin backing Oum Kalthoum-- Taha has arrived at something much more subtle and, ultimately, meaningful. He can duet with Roussel, and the mix of his gruff, staccato way of speaking French with Roussel's soft, fluid singing isn't jarring. It just sounds like a cosmopolitan conversation. I've wondered a bit why a guy so far into his career would name his album ""hello."" In the absence of an explanation, I've come to think that it's not meant as an introductory hello so much as a greeting to old friends whom Taha is seeing for the first time after making some changes in his life. And while <i>Bonjour</i> isn't as immediately infectious as many of Taha's albums, it's still filled with memorable fusions and subtle details.</p></div>"|14400.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14400-bonjour/|7.5|Joe Tangari

""Well, hell, World War II gave us the ball point pen,"" says the actor Charles Tyner in a monologue excerpted from his hilarious role as the militant Uncle Victor in the 1971 film <i>Harold and Maude</i>. With tales of war and murder, and his well-decorated uniform, he brings the lugubrious teen Harold to some uncomfortable intersection of euphoria and orgasm. ""I say get the krauts on the other side of the fence where they belong. Let's get back to the kind of enemy worth killing.""</p>
<p>Black Tusk eventually interrupt Tyner's talk, massive drums and turbid guitar slashing through the script like lightning bolts. But the passage is significant as a thematic statement and-- by then, 34 minutes into these 37-- a reminder of just how relentless and economical <i>Taste the Sin</i> has been. Jonathan Athon's swollen bass tone and the band's tendency to put it in the middle suggest fellow Southern metallurgists Weedeater, while the serrated vocals and mid-tempo dominance recall fellow Savannah lords Baroness. But Black Tusk's particular alchemy of metal and hardcore elides the fancy tangents of both bands, swapping Baroness' acoustic and hyper-technical alleyways and Weedeater's smoked-skull drones for a deliberate, methodical mix of marches and sprints. Churning like hardcore and viscous like stoner metal, <i>Taste the Sin</i> is the rare crossover record that works to capitalize on the immediacy of its chosen genres and not to bend them into obscurity. It's a power play.</p>
<p>The <i>Harold and Maude</i> sample provides a fitting cap for the album's near-maniacal aggression, too. Pardon the binary, but this is primo dude metal-- high on might, speed, and aggression, rather low on finesse or grace. The cover by Baroness' John Baizley depicts a bare-breasted woman who wields snakes as weapons and flowers as amulets. Inside, the grizzly trio peers from behind another nude warrior, this time with battle wounds on her face and black tusks extending rather crudely from her jaw. Oh, and the album is entirely about fighting wars and killing enemies, driving cars and crashing them.</p>
<p>Presented as a conjoined pair of EPs, <i>Taste the Sin</i> comprises two distinct but unequivocally androgenic parts. The first six tracks praise guts and glory, each member passing around tales of epic conquests and last stands. ""Way of Horse and Bow"", for instance, opens with a shriek of ""Attack!"" over drums, guitar and bass that bludgeon a simple rhythm and riff. ""Hear my call/ Raise your swords/ Mount your steed/ Lord of lords,"" goes the first verse. The back half, a four-track suite called ""Double Clutchin'"", opens with a strong-as-steel instrumental, guitars lifting above the dense rhythm section like the hood ornament on a vintage sports car. It ends, of course, with a crash. ""Fuck you! This is my final farewell,"" goes one perfectly obstinate bit just before the accident. The intervening minutes are worth the disaster: Barreling ahead, pausing only long enough to lean into the curves, Black Tusk don't reinvent the wheel, nor do they try. They just go hard, fast, and long enough until, at the end of ""The Crash"", the wheel explodes. Black Tusk are left with nothing but their own defiance: ""Ain't goin' slow!"" they shout again and again. They're not lying, either.</p></div>"|14435.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14435-taste-the-sin/|7.6|Grayson Currin

DMC. Parrish Smith. Malice. Pimp C, at least up until he died. Big Boi's been on that list ever since André Benjamin started rocking pith helmets and neckerchiefs. Big Boi's not underrated, exactly; everyone who knows rap knows he's a great rapper. It's more that he's taken for granted. Virtually every OutKast review of the past decade and a half has posited Big Boi as the earthy, street-level anchor to André's spaced-out visionary, the guy responsible for securing the group's cred when André was trying to invent new colors. Expect <i>Sir Lucious Left Foot</i> to change those conversations. We haven't heard a major-label rap album this inventive, bizarre, joyous, and masterful in a long time, and it's almost impossible to imagine André putting out a solo album this strong anytime soon.</p>
<p>At this point, Big Boi has every right to indulge in the bitter-old-man invective that's tempted so many other rappers of his generation. Even though he's half of one of the most successful groups ever, Big Boi has had to go through years of release-date delays and label drama (some of the topical lyrics here sound like they were written years ago), until he finally left longtime home Jive just so he could release a damn solo album already. Label machinations kept André's voice from even appearing on <i>Sir Lucious Left Foot</i>-- heartbreaking when you think about André's jaw-dropping display on the early advance single ""Royal Flush"". But instead of letting these setbacks infect his music, Big Boi's made an album that explodes with ideas at every turn, that glides and twitches and mutates with delirious urgency.</p>
<p>Musically, the album drips with 1980s synth-funk signifiers. The keyboards glimmer as they roam, and talkboxes mutter and blurt. But these tracks aren't the stoned miasmas that someone like Dâm-Funk cranks out. Instead, they're itchy and fleet-footed. New melodic elements flit in and out of tracks just as you start to notice them, and there's a lot going on at any given moment. Consider, for example, album closer ""Back Up Plan"". The track, from old comrades Organized Noize, finds room for cheerleader chants, disembodied grunts, a weird little synth whistle, processed funk guitar, orchestra hits, frantic scratching, a lowdown wobbling bassline, and probably some other stuff that I'm missing-- and this is one of the most laid-back songs on the entire album.</p>
<p>Every once in a while, we'll get a nod toward some current trend, but these aren't market capitulations; they're more opportunities to play with what the kids are doing now. ""Follow Us"", for example, has a generic rock-dude chorus from Vonnegutt, and virtually any other rapper would've built a hackneyed half-rock song out of a chorus like that, but producer Salaam Remi instead piles bubbly synthetic melodies all over each other. And the robo-voices on ""Shutterbugg"" aren't airy Auto-Tune; they're more of a deep rumble that you can feel in your gut. ""Tangerine"" somehow simultaneously sounds like strip-club ass-shake material and Funkadelic covering Morricone. Looking at the production credits, it's surprising to see names like Scott Storch and Lil Jon-- hitmakers who don't really make hits anymore, and who haven't been all that interesting in a while. So Big Boi, then, is someone who encourages his collaborators' furthest-out ideas, and who knows what to do with those ideas when he gets them.</p>
<p>As a rapper, Big Boi is something else. He just does so many things with his voice and cadence, letting his words fall over the snares one moment and fighting upstream against the beat the next. He never falls into any particular pattern of delivery, instead using his flow to knock beats back and forth with relish. Sixteen years after the first OutKast album, he's still coming up with dizzy combinations of words: ""My recitals are vital and maybe needed for survival,"" ""The slickness that get your chick hit quick,"" ""Stay sharp as broken glass, get busted on a smash/ When your ass cross paths with this half of the 'Kast."" Even if he were saying nothing, the tumble of his words is a thing to behold.</p>
<p>But then, he's never saying nothing. <i>Sir Lucious Left Foot</i> is an album blissfully free of both old-man hectoring and drug-rap nihilism. A few times Big Boi brings up the idea that it's really not too smart to rap about selling crack all the time, but he doesn't dwell on it, and he confines most of his skepticism to awesomely worded asides (""Snow? That's for toboggans."") He's hard enough to tell you to get the South's dick up out your motherfucking mouth and draw blood with the command, but he's also clever enough to slide away from threats just as quickly. He spends a large chunk of the album talking about sex, sounding like a fired-up 11-year-old goofing off in the back of some sort of prodigy-level English class.</p>
<p>There's a lot more to like about <i>Sir Lucious Left Foot</i>. Some of the skits are actually pretty funny. The guests-- who range from masterful fast-rap newcomer Yelawolf to a stirringly gritty Jamie Foxx-- all turn in top-shelf performances. Old Dungeon Family associates Big Rube and Khujo Goodie make feel-good cameos that actually contribute to their songs. But the real story is the rap veteran who's done everything he could possibly do in the genre but who still finds new ways to have fun with it. Last year's best rap album came from Raekwon, another wily old vet who hit a serious late-career stride. But Raekwon did it by inhabiting his older styles, making a record that could've conceivably come out in 1996. On <i>Sir Lucious Left Foot</i>, Big Boi does something even more difficult: He gives us a great album that sounds nothing like any of the great albums he's already given us. From where I'm sitting, that's an even greater achievement.</p></div>"|14424.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14424-sir-lucious-left-foot-the-son-of-chico-dusty/|9.2|Tom Breihan

Part of that is just simple math. Unless you count the minute shifts in Kompakt's aesthetic over the years as part of Mayer's creative legacy, the rangy German hasn't exactly been prolific. Sure, there was that memorable Fabric mix, the <i>Speicher</i> series of full-lengths and 12""s, the retrospectively unremarkable solo album <i>Touch</i>, the immediately underwhelming Superpitcher collab Supermayer, and other one-offs and quick-draws. But spread over 12 years, and for a guy who is still routinely held up as a genre figurehead, that's actually not so much.</p>
<p>Better to point to the more intangible things that Mayer developed and honed during that period: his taste, his tempo, his belief in techno as a more fluid, utilitarian, and lovelorn instrument. It's this underlying aesthetic that's informed his best work, his most inspired live sets, his most fruitful signings-- basically the dude's entire legacy-- and nowhere has that been more directly vocalized than in these mixes. They might not happen any more regularly than the World Cup, but it's hard not to feel like the <i>Immer</i>s are Mayer's most personal works, the best distillates of everything he loves most.</p>
<p>So it's reassuring to know that <i>Immer 3</i>, still dutifully, almost stubbornly, works within the same parameters as its predecessors.  Comprising an Ewan Pearson refit of Cortney Tidwell's possibly overplayed-by-now ""Don't Let Stars Keep Us Tangled Up"", Closer Musik's twerky ""Departures"", and the DJ Koze remix of Ben Watt's ""Guinea Pig (Vocal Variation with Julia Biel)"", <i>Immer 3</i>'s opening trio is predictably slow to get off the ground. It isn't until the grinding chords and everything-but-the-kitchen-sink electro house of Tim Paris' wonderful ""Edges of Corrosion"" that the tempo moves into aerobic territory. Mayer standbys Smith N Hack and Poker Flat alum Raudive provide a stretch of lonely electro leading into the record's highlight: a Gui Boratto remix of Massive Attack's ""Paradise Circus"".  Boasting Hope Sandoval on vocals, a sequence of perfectly interlocked rhythms and melodies, and some of the most desolate piano chords this side of Max Richter, ""Paradise Circus"" is basically Mayer catnip. It'd be beautiful anywhere, but in these surroundings, it feels especially potent.</p>
<p>Things get a bit lighter after that; Popnoname's ""Hello Gorgeous"" trades in early-80s synth-led quirk while Superpitcher's exclusive Charlotte Gainsbourg remix (""The Operation"") marries her cold, Gallic pop sensibilities with his full-bodied production ethic to striking effect. The mix's other standout moment comes with Culoe de Song's ""The Bright Forest"", a lush bit of almost-downtempo that ratchets up the drama with syrupy strings and a meandering piano lead. Since the only signature piece missing by this point is some suspiciously earnest Europop, enter Kinky Justice's ""New Day"" to close things out.</p>
<p>There's an abundance of rhythmic texture and eddying female vocals and broody strings and disco accents, all of it wrapped up in a familiarly understated presentation that prizes atmosphere and accent above force and momentum. It's heady and subtle and stylish and worryingly comforting in that it doesn't sound massively different from anything Mayer was doing in 2002. In fact, by the brute force of his own persistence, he's managed to give this sound the sort of longevity-- and by extension validity-- that a lot of early-Kompakt skeptics never thought it would enjoy. Maybe it even explains the title: Immer means ""always.""</p></div>"|14425.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14425-immer-3/|7.8|Mark Pytlik

Bachmann was never on a major label-- Archers of Loaf released their records on Alias Records, and Crooked Fingers have split time between Warm, Merge, and self-releasing music-- but he still seems to have recognized that musicians need to be looking for alternative sources of funding for their projects. To pay for the recording and release of this EP, his second short collection of covers, Bachmann turned to Kickstarter.com, a site that lets artists, charities, community groups, inventors, and all manner of other people solicit donations for their projects. A donation gets you something in return, in this case anything from a high-quality download at the $6 level to a performance by the band in your living room for $2,500. (NB: Pitchfork publisher Chris Kaskie is an investor in Kickstarter.)</p>
<p>Bachmann and his Crooked Fingers cohorts clearly made it well beyond their funding goal, enabling them to do a digital/vinyl release; this is the second covers EP the band has released, and for its modest ambitions, it delivers a lot. The focus is a bit different this time. Where last time, he included a huge hit (Queen and David Bowie's ""Under Pressure"") and got a little outside the Crooked Fingers comfort zone by taking on Prince as well, on <i>Vol. II </i>Bachmann turns his sights on songs a little more naturally in his wheelhouse. Merle Haggard, Moby Grape, John Hartford (via Glen Campbell), Thin Lizzy, Billy Joe Shaver (via Waylon Jennings), and the Kinks all get the modern Americana treatment, and it more or less all works. It's also interesting to hear the band return to such a subdued approach after cramming <i>Forfeit/Fortune</i> with horns and European folk sounds.</p>
<p>The golden-era country covers, Haggard's ""Shelly's Winter Love"" and Shaver's ""Black Rose"", are two of the most notable re-interpretations. Bachmann strips both of the the
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
sonic signifiers of country music, leaving out the steel guitars and twang in favor of warm textures. ""Shelly's Winter Love"" goes from pretty Bakersfield ballad to a shimmering, even haunting, atmospheric love song, and it's a great, unexpected choice for a cover. Bachmann's rough-hewn voice does well to the 1970 Dave Davies-penned Kinks song ""Strangers"", even though some subtle bleepy synthesizer is the only major change to the song. The EP sags in the middle a bit-- Hartford's ""Gentle on My Mind"" is too understated, while they manage to suck almost all the energy out of Thin Lizzy's ""Wild One"". I'll take the original's harmonized lead guitar any day.</p>
<p>So it's not perfect by any means, but it's a lovely extra for fans of the band, and the extra money it raised will go toward the band's next LP, possibly used to hire a few extra bouzouki players and gypsy brass bands (I hope). As much as I kid, though, I am curious whether this heralds a retreat from the fuller sound the band has pursued lately or simply a low-key diversion. It's not quite the essential piece of the discography that the first <i>Reservoir Songs</i> EP was, but it does enough to personalize the source material that it's worth listening to on its own merits.</p></div>"|14378.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14378-reservoir-songs-ii-ep/|6.8|Joe Tangari

About a decade into his recording career, he remains as prolific as ever. He released four discs in April alone, and recently compiled an mp3 DVD of the 48 albums he's made so far. Still, all of his music that I've heard has a distinct sense of patience. He may not take much time between releases, but it sounds like he rarely rushes through any individual recording.</p>
<p>Thoughtful calm is the focus of <i>Fantision</i>, Felipe's latest album for Schematic, the Miami label that's supported much of his work since releasing his 2002 debut. Mixing prickly digital noise with acoustic guitar, soft percussion, and some sneaky vocals, Felipe constructs his pieces like jigsaw puzzles, avoiding set patterns and predictable shapes. Yet the sounds he shoots around the stereo space are mostly tempered and restrained, bearing an internal logic that strips them of novelty or shock value. This results in tracks that feel like songs despite rarely behaving that way.</p>
<p>The melodic aspects morph continually, with hints of structure emerging and retreating in gradual cycles. On <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l3P3kXvmWM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""o8""</a>, languid strumming akin to <i>Sung Tongs</i>-era Animal Collective melts into gurgling electronics, while ""o3"" slices wafts of drone into shadowy rhythms before melting back down into sonic lava. Throughout, Felipe's bag of tricks never empties. While his sonic palette is pretty basic, his moves from one hue to the other are always inventive and carefully chosen. Such motion stands out on <i>Fantision</i>'s best track, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-nlf4fTCeA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""o13""</a>, which is also its most song-like. Here, halting guitar and eerie vocals transform a slow waltz into a freak-show nursery rhyme. Much of the album is similarly creepy, but even the oddest sounds mesmerize, much the way that weird events in dreams make sense to the passive dreamer. In other words, the chills Felipe gives you are more likely to soothe than disorient.</p>
<p>Felipe has always been a bit of a musical chameleon, jumping between different styles and hitting lots of reference points along the way. You'll likely recognize a few of those here-- I heard echoes of the Residents, the Books, Ben Frost, and Tyondai Braxton. But what impresses most is how <i>Fantision</i> sounds primarily like itself. The first few seconds immediately establish a tone and a mood that remain solid to the end. This creates an authoritative feel similar to how the best film directors leave traces of their aesthetic in every cut, pan, and fade to black. Dino Felipe is that kind of auteur, and <i>Fantision</i> looks and sounds like his best sonic movie so far.</p></div>"|14417.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14417-fantision/|7.9|Marc Masters

Bay area rapper Roach Gigz is clearly influenced-- as he'll admit-- by both artists, as well as by his spiritual inspiration, Mac Dre. But unlike so many rappers whose influences become oppressively imitative, Roach Gigz effectively captures the masters' irreverent best by simply being himself. His new mixtape, <i>Roachy Balboa</i>, is one of the most energetically fun rap records released this year.</p>
<p>His rapping has a muscular dexterity that sounds instinctively balanced between acrobatic rap style-- this is unquestionably a rap fan's rap record-- and keeping things interesting. Every track seems to follow this labyrinthine ADD logic, sinewy flow interlocking off-the-cuff thoughts with irreverent joie de vivre. His grimy humor helps to ground the uncapped mania of spirit.  The beats largely reflect this feel, madcap rapidfire high-pitched vocal samples over unhinged and busy treble-friendly production. The tracks that stand out the most work against the grain; ""Goomba Pimpin"", for example, relies on slow, low-slung warped-bass sonics. It also kicks off with a hint at the creativity behind the writing process. Beginning with a classic writer's block story track conceit (""So I was pickin' the vegetables out my cup of noodles""), the first verse travels a meandering path before resolving itself in an unrelated direction: ""Took a piss on the block/ Now I got a court date, man I hate the cops/ True story.""</p>
<p>Ultimately what makes this record so good, though, is that Roach Gigz is simply a charismatic, likable guy, and that this personality really comes through in his music. He hints at some raw currents of paranoia and griminess, some nihilistic humor, the kind of thing that used to catch rappers headlines, but the rapper's emphasis on realism means this hip-hop shock-humor is relegated to a single color in his overall approach. He also drops too many lines that belie some sense of morality, that make it clear he's got a purpose and a story to tell, to be too much of a hip-hop loose cannon. Not to undersell Roach Gigz' crazy-living bona fides; the guy is only 22, and this record sounds like it, the echoes of teenage delinquency still rattling around in his brain.</p>
<p>It's a record that knows what it's like to be a rough-and-tumble 22, from anti-neediness anthems like ""Let Me Breathe"" and the flirtatiously lustful ""Gold"". Gigz first record,<i> Buckets and Booty Calls</i>, was a mixed bag, occasionally showing flashes of inspiration and raw skill but feeling largely listless, imbalanced. And this is why Roach Gigz' personality is so engaging on <i>Roachy Balboa</i>; there's the youthful realization of possibility, a recognition of creative electricity sparked when a kid discovers his creative outlet, the potential of his own talents.</p></div>"|14419.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14419-roachy-balboa/|7.7|David Drake

True, the Scottish DJ duo's long-running Glasgow club night of the same name was put on ice this past April, but Optimo-the-partnership soldiers on into the second decade of the 21st-century with remixes, a label, and yes, new mix CDs. So don't go into <i>Fabric 52</i> thinking it's some kind of valedictory, or a summing up of Optimo's decade-plus journey across club culture's fringe. Instead, in keeping with the restlessness that continues to define their career, it's another sideways leap away from their previous mixes.</p>
<p><i>Fabric 52</i>'s perhaps the most techno-centric mix of Optimo's career. On the other hand, it's probably the only techno mix of the year whose Discogs.com entry features a prominent credit for a Chapman stick player. The wild in-track edits and multiple song mash-ups seem to be a thing of the past, but Optimo still range widely across the history of synthetic club music. <i>Fabric 52</i> moves from the warped proto-techno ""pop"" perversions of Fad Gadget to some bracingly crude early acid house, from the 1990s days of German high minimalism to a smidge of 21st-century UK funky.</p>
<p>And as always, Optimo slip and slide between subgenres and decades with a startling ease. Some of that's down to the track selection. Much of the first half of <i>Fabric 52</i> sounds straight from the days of acid wash and polka dots and smiley faces. Without researching the tracklist, it's tough to tell the difference between true old-school acid house and modern producers trying to ape the limited technology of the mid-80s. And when a mix features a 21st-century act called the Tyrell Corporation, which takes its name from Blade Runner and sounds like a revved-up (and shameless) homage to classic New Order, you know to expect a certain amount of synth-centric classicism.</p>
<p>But classicist as they might get, Optimo never go for the easy transition, and they also refuse to sacrifice momentum in order to show off their skill. That's why <i>Fabric 52</i> gets much more interesting in its second half, when the duo finally shakes free of the safe pulse of sequenced rhythm for something a little more varied. It's easy enough to blend new-school synth-pop with old-school synth-pop. But somehow Optimo make that Tyrell Corporation track sound natural as it emerges from a Latin-tinged broken beat cover of a Fela Kuti tune.</p>
<p>Now, the staggered rhythm of broken beat doesn't mix easily with anything, even other broken beat tunes, but especially anything 4/4. I'm sure there's a technical explanation for how Optimo pulled it off, maybe even a simple one. All I know is that as you're listening it's unexpected and thrilling and full of weirdly euphoric energy for such a moody mix-- basically all the things you expect at this point from an Optimo CD. I have to admit I was a little worried about <i>Fabric 52</i> in the beginning. The first 35 minutes or so seemed to be a little too eager to pay simple homage to the enduring power of techno's pulse. But it turned out that it's one of the few recent mixes that needs its 72-minute running time to reach its payoff. The wilder and woollier second half of <i>Fabric 52</i> proves Optimo knew what they were doing as always. I don't know how I could have doubted them.</p></div>"|14411.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14411-fabric-52/|7.5|Jess Harvell

It's what he does. About a month and a half ago, Gucci was released from prison after serving a six-month parole-violation sentence. But it's no shock to see him coming out with an hour of new songs so soon after his release. After all, one of the best Gucci songs from last year was ""First Day Out"", which he supposedly recorded on, literally, his first day of freedom after he served his <i>last</i> six-month parole-violation sentence. Going to prison for parole violation, see, is the other thing Gucci does. Or, as the man himself puts it on ""Georgia's Most Wanted"", ""I spend my winter in the jail, so I'm balling all summer/ Bad bitches on my tail hunt me like a bounty hunter."" So if he goes back to the big house before 2010 ends, we can't say he didn't warn us.</p>
<p>Even with that prison sentence, <i>Mr. Zone 6</i> isn't Gucci's first mixtape of the year. Back in spring, we got <i>The Burrrprint (2) HD</i>, which had some music that Gucci recorded over the phone from prison but more that was left over from earlier sessions. It's amazing he even had anything left; Gucci released <i>six mixtapes</i> and one official album last year. And even though he's just absurdly prolific, all of those releases made for a strong end-to-end listen. <i>The Burrrprint (2)</i>, meanwhile, was just OK, which can only mean one thing: Despite the insane amount of music he puts out, Gucci cares about quality control. With <i>The Burrrprint (2)</i>, we learned what happens when Gucci's reduced to releasing leftovers. And with <i>Mr. Zone 6</i>, we're reminded what happens when he has time to put together a serious album-length piece of work. The difference is revelatory.</p>
<p>If you're a Gucci neophyte looking for a way in, <i>Mr. Zone 6</i> is every bit as strong a starting point as last year's best Gucci tape, <i>The Burrprint: The Movie 3-D</i>. It's got all the hallmarks we've come to expect from a Gucci tape: cheaply catchy twinkling-synth beats, intricately goofy wordplay, singsong choruses that get stuck in your head so hard they start to drive you nuts. If Gucci's most recent prison sentence has made him at all reflective, we don't hear it here. Instead, he stays firmly in his wheelhouse throughout. But there is a slight adjustment in approach here: Gucci seems to realize that he's a divisive figure, that plenty of rap fans still think he's a flamboyant buffoon who can't rap.</p>
<p>For those listeners, Gucci puts on something of a rapping clinic: switching up his flow every few bars, jamming as many syllables as possible into quick-rewind clumps. Only a few guest-rappers appear on <i>Mr. Zone 6</i>, and the guys invited are straight-ahead hardhead types like Waka Flocka Flame and Yo Gotti. Compared to them, perfectly effective in their quick appearances, Gucci seems to be on another level completely-- rapping lazy figure-eights around whoever steps on a track with him. For the first time, Gucci seems to want us to <i>notice</i> that he's a great rapper.</p>
<p>But this is still a Gucci tape, so nobody should approach it expecting <i>Illmatic</i> levels of insight. Instead, we get punchlines stupid in their brilliance, or brilliant in their stupidity: ""Just like Levert, I like to flirt/ I'm not your Casanova/ I'm not Romeo/ It's Gucci, ho/ I'm tryna bend you over."" Or: ""Take a TwitPic of Gucci dick and send it as a Tweet/ Ever since she met me, say them niggas obsolete."" (Seriously, the way he pronounces the word ""Tweet"" gets me every time.) Gucci's funniest ad-lib is a barfing sound, and he uses it wherever possible. This is, uh, <i>impolite</i> music, and there's not a person alive making better impolite music than Gucci Mane. So for all the work he does maintaining a single rhyme over the course of an entire verse, or finding newer and slipperier ways of introducing a double-time flow, the moments that get stuck in your head are the simple isolated boasts: ""Guns like Super Contra,"" ""cocaine whiter than Taylor Swift,"" ""I stereotype my fuckin' self."" And yeah, there's a certain level of insight in that last phrase. But if you take it too seriously, Gucci Mane will laugh at you. He's laughing anyway.</p></div>"|14409.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14409-mr-zone-6/|8.3|Tom Breihan

Did you even think they were capable of an album at all? Maybe you expected a whole mixtape filled with bewildered yelling about name brands on some postmodern Fatboy Slim shit, or one of those hipster-rap records filled with a bunch of half-serious post-crunk/booty bass homages. But if you were a bit more curious, maybe you went to their MySpace page and heard the elaborate reference-fest ""Rainbow in the Dark"" and a deconstruction of co-opted dancehall dialect called ""Fake Patois"" and caught on to something deeper. Maybe you started wondering if they were a bit less trivial than you suspected.</p>
<p>As it turns out, ""Combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell"" has as much to do with the whole of <i>Shut Up, Dude</i> as the Beastie Boys' ""Cooky Puss"" does to the referential overload of <i>Paul's Boutique</i>. Das Racist's Brooklyn-buzz affiliations and humorous bent might mislead you into thinking it's an exercise in cheap laffs for people who don't take rap seriously, but this album feels a lot more like the irreverent hip-hop fanboy mania of <i>ego trip</i> magazine than smarmy genre tourism.</p>
<p>Himanshu Kumar Suri aka ""Heems"" and Victor Vazquez have something elaborate going on, toying with and subverting the rules of hip-hop lyricism even as they pay them respect. ""Who's That? Brooown!"" uses A Tribe Called Quest's well-worn ""Scenario"" as a reference point, but Heems mutters his callbacks to Busta Rhymes' verse in a sleepily cocky voice that sounds like the exact opposite of Busta's off-the-charts energy. The repetition and recursiveness that made ""Combination"" so polarizing crop up in odd places; one otherwise-complex line in ""Ek Shaneesh"" simply ends ""drinkin' beer, drinkin' beer/ prolly drinkin' some more beer"" before teasing an obvious Tears for Fears-referencing internal rhyme that never actually comes. Familiar hit-sourced hooks are self-sabotaged with trailed-off mumbling (the Juelz Santana-sourced, Billy Joel-jacking ""You Oughta Know""), the spiritual presence of Bob Marley is called into the not-so-lofty service of soundtracking their tribute to dollar cans of iced tea, and they actually named one of their tracks ""Deep Ass Shit (You'll Get It When You're High)"" as a rib-jabbing mission statement. (No points in guessing which prolific Oxnard-based underground producer gets his beat used for that one.)</p>
<p>If they were just fucking around, those gags would wear off and leave you with nothing but a series of smug hey-get-it? nudges. But Heems and Victor are serious enough about coming up with memorable lines that they come across like some kind of lyrical stealth operatives. The fact that they often go from water-treading repetition to intricately built phraseology mid-verse is a great riff in itself. One of the shortest and simplest lines on the album is one of the cleverest-- ""W.E.B. DuBois/ We be da boys,"" from ""Hugo Chavez""-- but there are also moments where you're left wondering how they could make so many unexpected linguistic connections look so easy. Their go-hard rampage on ""Nutmeg"" is 1990s-reared, cipher-honed style gone berserk, turning a funhouse mirror on Ghostface's finest moment of abstract pyrotechnics, as it starts with the unlikely couplet ""Queens Boulevard/ Kierkegaard"" and gets even more dizzyingly ridiculous from there.</p>
<p>Granted, there's a certain information-overload college-student bent to their humor, evident in cross-genre namedrops like ""Richard Hell Rell"" or the mentions of Tao Lin and ""and Dinesh DiSouza. But Das Racist push past mere signifying to come across as straight-up literates with a way of making cultural studies out of entertainment and vice-versa. Several lyrics take offhand references to Bollywood stars and Cuban sandwiches and extrapolate stream-of-consciousness ethnographies out of them, while ""Shorty Said (Gordon Voidwell Remix)"" draws out punchlines and commentary about identification by listing all the racially divergent celebrities that women supposedly claim Victor and Heems resemble (Egyptian Lover; Amitabh Bachchan; Slash without his hat). Das Racist approach this idea of otherness in a way that feels both playful and provocative, asserting their identities in a way that both reinforces their individuality and goofs on their stereotypes. And if it hits a certain nerve, it's probably the same one that got tweaked by the sociological b-boy stoner comedy precedent of ""Chappelle's Show"". Fast-food hipster-rap, my ass-- these dudes are the truth.</p></div>"|14376.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14376-shut-up-dude/|7.8|Nate Patrin

Britney was the obvious link bait, but as word of the collaboration spread, it created Rorschach-like responses about the producer's role-- whether he was a blatant sell-out or a genre ambassador to the masses-- and fed into anxiety/happiness over the scene's increasing popularity. The recent L.A. transplant had already remixed or produced for Kid Sister, M.I.A., and Basement Jaxx. Working with the former pop princess seemed to test his recent exhortation that dubstep is ""the punk rock of the electronic-music world."" But the spiky-haired Brit would probably be the first to say ditch pretension and politics, get hyped, and just jump in the pit and have fun.</p>
<p>From the start of <i>O.M.G.!</i>-- which opens with a celebratory ""woo!"" that punctuates redlining, wall-of-bass lead single ""Woo Boost""-- Rusko dives in headfirst, rolling forward on distended low end while occasionally stepping into new territory. He bounces between the laid-back digital dub of ""Rubadub Shakedown"" and ""District Line"", more uptempo and ravey territory on ""Kumon Kumon"", and the Gucci Mane collaboration ""Got Da Groove"", a successful fusion of strutting beats and a bulbous bass line. As for that Britney collab, he could do a lot worse than ""Hold On"", a decent though stretched-out two-step rhythm that shines light on the versatility of Dirty Projectors' Amber Coffman.</p>
<p>But over the course of the entire album, <i>O.M.G.!</i> doesn't live up to its breathless title, coming off more as a disjointed dance survey course than anything game-changing. Sheer massiveness can be visceral, and Rusko has certainly pushed that idea forward with singles like ""Cockney Thug"". But he can also slip into hyperactive and cartoonish territory (parts of ""I Love You"" sound like a very slowed-down version of the chattering aliens from ""Sesame Street""). And fusing blown-out bass lines with stock parts from other genres-- the trancey build-ups of ""You're on My Mind Baby"" and ""I Love You"" or cheesy club-lite of ""Feels So Real""-- doesn't add up to much. Rusko still puts together some moving, visceral moments, but here, they seem fleeting, good ideas in search of a vision.</p></div>"|14399.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14399-omg/|6.7|Patrick Sisson

Following the best-of, Harcourt moved to the small New York label Dovecote in 2008 to re-release 2006's <i>Beautiful Lie</i> for his U.S. audience, and now he's back with a new studio album.</p>
<p>Harcourt's best asset is his colorful voice. But his lyrics are either clichéd-- ""I'm a recipe for disaster"" or bad-poet dramatic-- ""I'm wrapped in lachrymosity"" (both from the chorus of ""Lachrymosity""). And because his voice is the centerpiece of most songs, the lyrics are always in-your-face. When it isn't a high school poetry recital, <i>Lustre</i> often feels like a disappearing act-- an attempt to put on a few musical disguises to see if anyone likes them better than the musician beneath. On ""When the Lost Don't Want to Be Found"", a slowed-down, lugubrious Tears for Fears nod with faraway, tinkling piano, Harcourt deepens his voice so much that he sounds unrecognizable and exaggerates his enunciation. This style of song may be new for Harcourt, but it comes over as little more than dull new wave. The trouble with experimenting in different genres is that it can take a lot of study and practice before you're able to say something new.</p>
<p>The stylistic choices Harcourt makes with his flexible voice-- from a feathery vibrato to a harder delivery-- can be effective at building emotion, as on ""Haywired"". But too often he lapses into tired ideas, like the backing ""sha-la-la-la""s and ""ooh-wee-ooh""s of ""A Secret Society"". That song is actually a rare instance of zest with a skipping melody that's more radio-friendly post-punk than folk, and he stays in the same vein for the cutesy ""Do As I Say Not As I Do"" and ""Church of No Religion"". But again, thin narratives drown both out, and the dingy, gray atmosphere of ""Religion"" could be early Bono without the inspiration or the Edge's guitar.</p>
<p>So who is Ed Harcourt? He's been known to brandish a lot of instruments in his live performances, but on <i>Lustre</i> he's showing off with genre, moving from the old-timey, bouncy piano numbers of his previous work to soaring new wave and peppy, guitar-driven pop. I suspect that a little more mystery-- more of the introspective, expressive songs that pepper each of his albums-- could transform his recent work from occasionally interesting to truly moving.</p></div>"|14321.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14321-lustre/|4.3|Liz Colville

It's easier than ever for kids to make professional-grade records and have them heard, but any sign of weakness-- a lackluster stage show, a questionable interview, a dud follow-up-- and listeners will let you know how duped they feel. Few people know this better than Nathan Williams, who made his buzzy second album <i>Wavvves</i> at his parents' house and spent the rest of 2009 on a badwill tour (live disaster, canceled tour, fistfight) that earned him Lohan/Hilton-levels of derision in certain circles.</p>
<p>But some stuck with him, like Best Coast best bud Bethany Cosentino, the late Jay Reatard's backing band, and esteemed producer Dennis Herring. If you include yourself in that group, new album <i>King of the Beach</i> rewards your belief. The album's title may be something of an ego-fueled joke on indie's ongoing infatuation with seaside fantasy, but Williams is still very much a part of the world he pokes fun at. Though the scorched-earth production of <i>Wavvves</i> was pretty much the opposite of chillwave, it did share themes, embracing weed, nostalgia, and both music-making and the outdoors as ideal escapes from early-20s boredom and a depressed job market.</p>
<p>In its quest for an endless summer, <i>King of the Beach</i> wears its California lineage with pride. It's major-key and resplendently colored, owing as much to Orange County skate-punk as it does to the Beach Boys. In the past, Williams' 1960s fixation mostly manifested in some falsetto Brian Wilson oohs and ahs, and that's still his go-to hook. But the references here are drawn from an exponentially wider palette: The twinkly, lovelorn ""When Will You Come"" uses the evergreen ""Be My Baby"" beat, while ""Mickey Mouse"" cops from ""Da Doo Ron Ron"" and distills <i>Person Pitch</i> to a three-minute essence. The charm is hearing Williams going directly to the sources of his inspiration, whether it's the warped synth lope of ""Baseball Cards"" or the jingle-like facility of ""Convertible Balloon"".</p>
<p>Yeah, ""variety"" and ""well-produced"" are new concepts for Wavves, but even when Williams recalls his high-voltage past, the growth in songwriting is unmistakable. Catchy as they were, the melodies of ""So Bored"" and ""No Hope Kids"" weren't hooks so much as battering rams that broke through with sheer repetition. The bright production here allows the songs to go places. The title track is built on a chassis of four-chord power-pop, but it opens up enough to be filled in with oddball percussion, whammy bar damage, and a surprising key change. Even though the double-time slamdancer ""Post Acid"" reminds me of everything that was good about Lookout! or Epitaph, Williams lets us in on his sense of a good time before an impassioned delivery of one of 2010's most anthemic choruses: ""Misery, won't you comfort me in my time of need?""</p>
<p>While <i>King of the Beach</i> manifests a quantum leap in Williams' confidence as a musician, from a lyrical standpoint, he's pretty much the same downbeat loner who made <i>Wavvves</i>. It's very much a punk record in attitude, but one that eschews its artier iterations and reps for the marginalized, snotty mid-90s heads like Green Day, MxPx, or even Blink-182, bands who were wrongly conflated with jock culture despite predominant themes of isolation, boredom, and sexual inadequacy. Though Williams never specifically addresses his real-life beefs, it's hard not to read into the self-loathing as real time commentary. His old friends hate him, girls won't listen, and he's fucked up. The mood never becomes oppressive, though. ""I'm not supposed to be a kid/ But I'm an idiot/ I'd say I'm sorry but it wouldn't mean shit,"" isn't the most artful mea culpa, but like most of <i>King of the Beach</i>, there is power in its directness.</p>
<p>Williams has boasted that he wants <i>King of the Beach</i> to be his <i>Nevermind</i>, and while I'll go out on a limb and speculate that it won't change the music industry as we know it, it serves a somewhat similar function in introducing a talent who benefits from a pop polish. More pointedly, it might be derided because it owes more to <i>Dookie</i> than <i>Doolittle</i> and many might choose this as a soundtrack to drinking beer or starting a mosh pit. Some may see <i>King of the Beach</i> as a story of redemption or even an argument that a public shaming might do good for some of these younger bands. Either way, it's' a fantastic record, and you can't say Williams didn't earn it this time.  Don't blow it, dude.</p></div>"|14415.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14415-king-of-the-beach/|8.4|Ian Cohen

Whereas the first two Scissor Sisters records found a way to translate specifically gay subject matter into big-tent camp that opened up their appeal to anyone with a taste for colorful dance music and 1970s radio pop, their third album isn't quite as inclusive. They are no less tuneful, but their aesthetic and lyrical themes are more firmly rooted in gay culture, to the point that many straight listeners may find themselves feeling like outsiders looking in. Instead of presenting a queer pop sensibility for the masses, they've gone deeper into their subcultural niche.</p>
<p>Though it starts off with a set of songs that wouldn't sound out of place on the two previous albums<i>, Night Work</i> quickly slips into hyper-sexualized gay club mode and sticks with that vibe until the end. The band's reference points have shifted, abandoning 70s pastiche in favor of calling back to the sort of deeply uncool 80s pop that was largely ignored in the past decade of Reagan-era revivalism. ""Night Work"" comes off like an arena rock version of the Pointer Sisters; ""Something Like This"" and ""Skin This Cat"" find the band diving into the deep end of sleazy, neon-hued synth pop. ""Harder You Get"" is an immensely appealing hybrid of Judas Priest leather-daddy metal and sleek Eurodisco; ""Running Out"" embraces the decadent corniness of David Bowie at his mid-80s nadir and somehow spins that sound into pure gold. Best of all, the epic ""Invisible Light"" does for gay clubs what ""Thriller"" did for horror movies, right on down to Sir Ian McKellan turning up for a Vincent Price-esque monologue like some kind of Italo-disco wizard. The album is low on potential hits but high on inspiration, with the group finding clever angles on familiar sounds rather than simply aping their favorite guilty pleasures.</p>
<p>The band's change in tone and focus is essentially a matter of shifting their emphasis from camp to overt sexuality. To be sure, there is no shortage of camp on <i>Night Work</i>, but the homoeroticism that has always been present in their music has been foregrounded, and many of the songs deal with situations specific to modern gay life. In some cases, the lyrics couldn't be more obvious, as with the blatant man-on-man S&amp;M action in ""Harder You Get"", but in others, the lyrics are subtle and coded. ""Skin Tight"" is a moving ballad dealing with condom use and intimacy; ""Sex and Violence"" explores the self-destructive impulse to indulge in anonymous, sometimes Internet-facilitated sex. Neither song is entirely obscure in its sentiment, but the ""dog whistle"" lines deepen the drama considerably. One example is when Jake Shears sings in the latter track, ""Does anybody know right now exactly where you are?""-- a reference to the commonly advocated practice of letting someone know the address of your hook-up in case you never turn up alive again.</p>
<p>The back half of <i>Night Work</i> includes some of the darkest music the Scissor Sisters have recorded. The songs are not bleak or joyless, but there's a clear thread of loneliness and desperation for human connection running through the lyrics that puts a damper on the group's usually celebratory spirit. Shears and his bandmates are wise to broaden their emotional range, and it is apparent that this work is coming from a deeply personal place. The album is basically about the need for night life as a way of finding community, identity, and escapism, and obviously we wouldn't require any of that were it not for the feelings of loneliness, confusion, and boredom that color even the perkiest songs on the record.</p>
<p>The songwriting on <i>Night Work</i> may not be as strong overall as on their debut, but they've improved greatly in terms of tonal consistency, avoiding the scattered eclecticism of their second album. Without drastically changing what they do, Shears and company have successfully pushed their style to a new extreme. This could turn out to be either a transitional work on the path to even more niche-oriented material, or an artistic tangent that the band had to get out of their system before returning to more chart-friendly music. But in any case, <i>Night Work</i> is a bold, uncompromising album that more than earns its inevitable cult adulation.</p></div>"|14404.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14404-night-work/|7.6|Matthew Perpetua

Maintaining an active Twitter feed, jumping on as many guest verses as humanly possible, and flooding the market with mixtapes is the best bet for exposure. Twenty-year-old Lil B (real name Brandon McCartney), a rapper from Berkeley, California, has taken this approach to its logical extreme. Mostly forgoing mixtapes and mp3 downloads, Lil B constantly shoots video of his tracks and freestyles, uploading them to a <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/lilbpack1#g/u"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">YouTube site</a> that, as of today, has 172 original clips to view.</p>
<p>It's an insane output, almost impossible to keep up with, and it mirrors Lil B's scattered, freewheeling lyrical style. Known previously for his work with the Berkeley party-rap crew the Pack, who scored a 2006 hit with their sneaker ode ""Vans"", Lil B's solo approach is unfiltered and introspective. He calls his raps ""based freestyles,"" slang for an improvised, stream-of-consciousness flow. ""In based freestyles, we don't think,"" he said recently in an <a href=""http://www.complex.com/blogs/2010/06/09/lil-b-talks-getting-sucker-punched-gay-rumors-drake-envy/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interview with Complex magazine</a>. ""You just let your unconscious mind speak. You let the truth speak. I'm not pre-thinking what I'm gonna speak."" So Lil B's rhymes are often sloppy and half-formed, sometimes crass and silly, and sometimes remarkably cogent. It's the kind of style that makes you wonder if he's some kind of mad genius or just completely fucking around.</p>
<p>This puts Lil B in the category of quote-unquote weird rappers-- guys like Kool Keith, Madlib, and even Lil Wayne, who often appeal to leftfield and indie listeners. But like Wayne and more recently Gucci Mane, Lil B's eccentric persona, atypical flow, and aggressive self-promotion make it possible for him to find a mainstream audience. (There's talk of an impending record deal with Soulja Boy's SODMG imprint.) As of now, though, Lil B remains a divisive and even controversial figure among rap fans. He's got a track called ""Look like Jesus"" and another called ""I'm a Fag I'm a Lesbian"" even though he's apparently not gay. He's been called ""the worst rapper alive"" and was punched by a random dude for no apparent reason in a <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpUTZRJUNSs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">prominent YouTube clip</a>.</p>
<p>But there are those who think Lil B is onto some next-level shit, and there's certainly an argument to be made there. His commitment to a kind of pure expression feels very punk in its way. It's not about skill or ability with him-- he basically ignores the established rap custom of beat riding and sometimes just talks over instrumentals-- but more about communicating whatever he feels even if it makes him look like a klutz in the process. From a listener perspective, Lil B is a fascinating mess of contradictions. He preaches positivity and oneness with the earth but has a song called ""Robber's Anthem"" and totes a pistol in the clip for ""Rich Bitch"". He can be thoughtful and sensitive one minute and then offensively misogynistic the next.</p>
<p>Because of the scattered nature of his output and dedication to the YouTube format, there isn't really one album that encapsulates all the different sides of Lil B. He put out the <i>6 Kiss</i> and <i>I'm Thraxx</i> records last year and there are several unsanctioned mixtapes floating around that compile a dozen or so tracks each. <i>Base World, Pt. 1</i> is one of these, and it does a pretty good job of showcasing his more tuneful and emotional side. Lil B often spits on ambient electro beats and has previously sampled artists like Antony and the Johnsons and Boards of Canada. The production here falls in line with that approach-- tracks usually feature a chiptune electro-pop sample and a loping, tinny drum kick. They are lo-fi but melodic, and Lil B mostly raps in semi-coherent form.</p>
<p>This tape can be treated as sort of preview to his upcoming Black Ken full-length, and it's somewhat limited in scope. <i>Base World, Pt. 1</i> showcases a variety of subject matter-- songs about girls and sex, fucked-up relationships, personal anxiety, and street life-- but leans a bit heavily on the tame side of Lil B's personality. ""B.O.R. (Birth of Rap)"" looks back at a messy adolescence and an obsession with hip-hop, ""Bonnie and Clyde"" is sort of your standard ""I need a ride or die chick"" cut, and ""I Can't Sleep"" and ""So Selfish"" deal more with self-doubt and introspection. A few more of his aggressive tracks could have been included to provide better contrast, but there's some powerful stuff here regardless.</p>
<p>""She Don't Love Me is a severe song about heartbreak that pulls no punches. ""Bust a nut in you but I want my seed to die, 'cause you not my wife, just a sweet disguise"", Lil B raps. That this and the disturbingly raunchy ""Violate the Bitch"" come from the same guy who recently put out the touching ""Real Life"" is what makes Lil B such a captivating character to follow. And it's more than just ""Did he really say that?"" moments and wondering if the guy can actually rhyme (he can). In a genre that prizes realness above just all else, Lil B has managed to stay uncommonly raw.</p></div>"|14418.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14418-base-world-pt-1/|7.0|Joe Colly

That goes a long way toward explaining an old association with a white-power record distributor that Judd, indefensibly, still refuses to disavow. But it also illustrates how far this guy has come since his frothing-demon early days. Judd did just fine for himself when he stuck with straight-up black metal; Nachtmystium's great 2006 album <i>Instinct: Decay</i> makes a hell of an argument for how far unadulterated black metal can go without really testing its genre parameters. But with 2008's <i>Assassins: Black Meddle, Part I</i>, Judd made a conscious decision to push past the scene that birthed him-- a decision he takes even further on the band's new joint.</p>
<p><i>Addicts</i>, while remaining heavy as all fuck, isn't a black metal album in any real way. Instead, it finds Nachtmystium at a place that reminds me of <i>Into the Pandemonium</i>-era Celtic Frost, or <i>Roots</i>-era Sepultura-- monstrously vicious bands that widened their scope by attempting to fuse sounds and grammars from disparate genres into their general maelstrom. And like those two bands, Nachtmystium can get messy or maybe even hokey at times, but they end up with a final product that towers above anything around it.</p>
<p>There's a nice bait-and-switch at the outset of the album. ""High on Hate"", the first proper song, starts as something recognizably black metal. There's a little more melody in the vocal than you'd hear in, say, anything in the Emperor discography, but you still get berserk double-bass and swarming-insect guitars, and it shows just how much bile Judd can display when he stays within his old comfort zone. But 2:20 in, a righteous pick slide signals a total change in tone, as a slow, deliberate, fiery stoner groove kicks in, and the song ends in a triumphant guitar solo not too far removed from, like, Slash. From there, things branch out further. Judd has referred to ""No Funeral"" as ""black metal disco,"" and while that might be overstating things a bit, the song's retro synth vwerps do exist somewhere on the Tangerine Dream/Giorgio Moroder axis. The bass-thuds and cheesed-out backing vocals on ""Nightfall"" recall Queens of the Stone Age. Closer ""Every Last Drop"" brings in vaguely Tuvan wordless moans from Yakuza's Bruce Lamont, as well as acoustic guitars, electronic pulses, and shoegaze-level guitar fuzz, then lets all those ingredients percolate for eight and a half zoned-out minutes.</p>
<p>The whole thing sounds incredible, especially compared to the band's tape-hissy older work. Sanford Parker, the best producer in metal this side of Kurt Ballou, records everything with just enough polish and just enough grime-- letting you feel every riff in your gut without cleaning the sound up so much that it squanders the music's primal mystery. At times, you can even hear fingers squeak on acoustic guitar strings. But expert production isn't always Nachtmystium's friend. Certain lyrics, for instance, become a lot sillier when you can actually make them out (""I am the wizard!/ I live in hell, you know!/ You will never see me!/ But I exist below!""). And a few of the ideas, like the almost-reggae synth sound in the background on ""The End Is Eternal"", don't really work.</p>
<p>Overall, though, <i>Addicts</i> stands as a landmark work for this band, both in its omnivorous restlessness and its crushing, monolithic heaviness. It's a deeply immersive record, one that can swallow up your whole world if you hear it on headphones in the right mood. And it becomes even more impressive when you learn that Judd wrote it as an album about overcoming struggles, rather than luxuriating and reveling in directionless hate, the way so much black metal is perfectly content to do. ""I always knew there was nothing standing in my way,"" he roars on ""Then Fires"", and he's right. The further out this guy pushes his ideas, the better his music gets-- which means <i>Addicts</i> might be Nachtmystium's best album yet.</p></div>"|14396.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14396-addicts-black-meddle-part-ii/|8.2|Tom Breihan

Aiming for the natty-suited punk of Elvis Costello circa <i>This Year's Model</i> or Spoon in their relatively florid <i>Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga</i> period, Drew Patrizi (as Trumpeter Swan) weds jagged guitars and headlong rhythms with horns, piano, and bright organ tones. The four-minute ""Loose Lips"" breezes by in what seems more like two, and does what every album opener ideally should-- leaves you wanting more. The three songs that follow oblige with hooks and energy, particularly curt, jangly ""Won't Come Back"", and ""Acolyte""-- the latter's pillowy synths, crisp beats, and arch vocals evoking the chic artifice of pretty much every British new wave single released in 1983.</p>
<p>Ultimately, though, <i>Clues</i> sets up for the letdown. The heavily front-loaded album is Patrizi's first solo outing since decamping from Austin and former gig What Made Milwaukee Famous. And while the multi-instrumentalist offers that band's fans several reasons to follow him to his new home in Brooklyn, he gives at least as many not to. Not that Patrizi strays far from the kitchen-sink, pan-pop aesthetic of WMMF or its label Barsuk's wheelhouse (including Death Cab, Mates of State, Nada Surf) of accessible indie rock. Most of <i>Clues</i> was recorded in Austin before Patrizi relocated, and among its roster of pick-up players are WMMFers Jeremy Bruch and John Houston Farmer. Don't bother looking for Brooklyn signposts.</p>
<p>Any one of the borough's music trendlets, however, beats the traffic-snarl of <i>Clues</i>' back half. Patrizi's best snake-and-ladder compositions compare favorably to the playful, sophisticated pop practices of Carl Newman. But unlike Newman, Patrizi doesn't seem to know when to lay off the fussy instrumental details, tempo changeups, and bonus refrains. ""Broke the Skin"", for example, gussies up a drab piano line in layers of keyboard noise, filtered vocals, and stray spoken-word samples, finally winging off on chopper sound effects. Some tracks are so over-egged (""Early Midlife Crisis"", ""Greenbelt""), you can practically spot bits of shell and feathers in the mix.</p>
<p>Patrizi is probably reveling in his new-found freedom as a solo artist and not in a muse-muzzling mode. Whatever the reason for Trumpeter Swan's maximalist missteps, the result's the same: What would have been a nifty four-song EP is instead a bloated long-player.</p></div>"|14395.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14395-listen-for-the-clues/|5.8|Amy Granzin

TTA don't make songs about being happy; they make songs about wanting to be happy. They're as troubled as anyone else, but in line with the effervescent nature of their music, they simply refuse to wallow in bad feelings. When on 2007's <i>A New Chance</i>, Eric Berglund pleaded, ""don't you die yet"" and pointed out that ""there's something else... something bright and pure that you've never felt before,"" it wasn't naïve positivity. This was a guy struggling with fear and depression and trying his damndest to stay hopeful.</p>
<p>When we talked to Berglund recently about his solo project ceo, it sounded like he may have found some peace. ""[I have] a profound sense of belonging that will always stay with me no matter what happens... a feeling that I only dreamt of until a while ago"", he said. So if TTA records were about holding on to hope no matter the cost, then the first ceo album, <i>White Magic</i>, is about achieving lasting contentment. Berglund says as much in the track ""Oh God Oh Dear"": ""I finally touched life and it was all so clear.""</p>
<p>That emotional clarity matches the album's sharp songcraft. As ever, Berglund's music has a remarkable sense of melody, and <i>White Magic</i> has the same tidy precision that initially set TTA apart. There's an understanding of hooks and pop structure here that almost seems only available to the Swedish. The record isn't completely made up of the pulsing electro-pop that you'd expect-- there are some lush orchestral pieces sprinkled in-- but each track is put together carefully with a keen sense of how the pieces fit together. To take one example, ""Illuminata"" is one of the more overtly danceable numbers on the record, and it's as big a pop song as anything by Phoenix, Vampire Weekend, or any other hook-friendly indie band out there.</p>
<p>Berglund also gets how melody fits into club music. Since we first came to know him and TTA, there's been a big uptick in the number of groups having a go at the sort of gentle Mediterranean disco often described as ""Balearic."" But Berglund and his Sincerely Yours crew understand this sound on another plane. Alongside friend and labelmate Kendal Johannson, who helped record the LP, he seamlessly marries the Balearic style with pop. Lead single ""Come With Me"" is a clinic on how to do this, constructing a blinding surface sheen that allows the song to function underneath. But there's also darker, less buoyant stuff here: opener ""All Around"" is loose and string-driven and the sinister title track has an almost Depeche Mode vibe.</p>
<p>The range of moods reinforces the record's overall theme-- it's mostly upbeat, but there are traces of doubt and longing that suggest Berglund has a ways to go before feeling truly at ease. It's easy to connect with the emotional side of the album since everyone can identify with wanting to be happier. But that's only half the appeal. It's also totally possible to ignore all that and just lose yourself in the effortlessness of these songs. At just eight tracks in fewer than 30 minutes, <i>White Magic</i> is tantalizingly short, and Sincerely Yours' notorious secrecy makes it hard to say if there will ever be a follow-up. One-off or not, though, it's pretty obvious that ceo is the real deal.</p></div>"|14407.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14407-white-magic/|8.5|Joe Colly

In October, Matador unveiled <i>Childish Prodigy</i>, the Philly psych-folker's first full-length for the label. It sounded like Vile had left behind bedroom music for classic rock brawn, his backing band the Violators dialed into every curvy riff and delay-clipped freakout he could muster. <i>Childish Prodigy</i> was more direct than anything he had done up until that point, but it also captured growth you could hear and offered glimpses of a songwriter with his best still in front of him. Eight months later comes the <i>Square Shells</i> EP, a release Vile and Matador are calling a ""stepping stone"" to bridge the gap between <i>Childish Prodigy</i> and the next LP. But with seven beautifully sequenced songs in 27 minutes, it's more substantial than your traditional stopgap, with more to explore.</p>
<p>Vile has a gift for finding just the right textures for his songs. At his best, every layer of sound is sumptuous in its own way. This holds true whether he's fingerpicking or just wandering around the neck of his guitar, and whether with a full band or alone with just a drum machine. At his worst, songs can get lost in too much gauze and too many effects, but Vile doesn't make that mistake this time out. On opener ""Ocean City"", his vocals are clear and his strumming is as playful as the melody is light, and the result is one of the cleanest songs he's put to tape. Elsewhere, Vile goes it alone along more familiar routes and demonstrates his way with immersive mood. ""Invisibility: Nonexistent"" is a particularly strong example, a seven-minute drone-driven piece with a repeating maze of lazy drum machine and distant guitar work.</p>
<p>That track's lonesome feeling bleeds into all of <i>Square Shells</i>, be it by way of instrumental hymns ""Losing Momentum (For Jim Jarmusch)"" and ""The Finder"", or the fingerpicked echoes of ""I Wanted Everything"". It's a satisfying EP that leaves open the question of where Vile's music might go next. Will he work more in the folk lane and away from FM radio licks? Will he go it alone or will the Violators be at his side? On ""I Know I Got Religion"", he croons over caramelized strums, ""Now I stopped using picks, nothing between me and my guitar/ Now I'm strumming away, every day/ When I feel blue, I write a strummer for you."" We'll see how this one ends.</p></div>"|14413.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14413-square-shells-ep/|7.6|David Bevan

We remember the young women featured on essential box sets like Phil Spector compilation <i>Back to Mono</i> or Rhino's more recent <i>One Kiss Can Lead to Another</i> not for their full-lengths or their larger-than-life exploits, but for their singles. In some cases, as with the Crystals, the artists you heard singing over your car's AM radio weren't even the same ones who came to town to perform.</p>
<p>Initially dreamed up as a modern girl group, the Pipettes have defied this grim logic once before. On 2006 debut <i>We Are the Pipettes</i>, the Brighton, England-based indie-poppers improbably managed a full-length's worth of cheeky, refreshingly contemporary, and wholeheartedly catchy songs to match their polka-dot dresses and choreographed moves. They were ""the prettiest girls you've ever met."" Your kisses were wasted on them. They were playful, they were divisive, but they were memorable and, to many, instantly appealing.</p>
<p>Four years later, the Pipettes are an almost entirely different group. Unfortunately, at least on <i>Earth vs. the Pipettes</i>, they're also a much, much worse one. It doesn't help that the rotating lineup of vocalists, now down to the sister act of Gwenno and Ani Saunders, trades the breezy, conversational singing style of the debut for a brassy, over-emotive approach that probably wouldn't make it far on a TV talent contest. It doesn't help, either, that what Pitchfork's Ryan Dombal called the ""DIY-Spector flourishes"" of <i>We Are the Pipettes</i> now give way to synths, disco-funk guitars, clattering bongos, and Miami Sound Machine horns, with plenty of strings and 60s sha-la-la backing vocals still there to clutter the over-crowded mix. It <i>definitely</i> doesn't help that the last few tracks tack on a vague interplanetary conceit, complete with robot vocals proving once and for all that T-Pain has a harder job than you might've thought.</p>
<p>What makes <i>Earth vs. the Pipettes</i> irredeemable, however, is an utter lack of what the Pipettes and their girl-group predecessors once understood so well: distinctive, emotionally affecting pop songs. Self-destructive crushes are nothing new to the girl-group genre, of course, and can be at least as artistically compelling as healthier romances, but tracks like the U2-echoing ""Thank You"" or redundant soft-rocker ""I Always Planned to Stay"" (""It's nothing less than what was expected"") are full of generic, boring girls pining blandly for generic, boring boys. The rhymes, melodies, and brutally obvious key changes used to stretch weak ideas to an acceptable length-- you've heard them all before. Hell, the outer-space conceit might be fitting, after all, because there's nothing like an actual human being anywhere in these songs; it seems important that the only character with a name is the eponymous officer of the T. Rex-shuffling ""Captain Rhythm"".</p>
<p>Worst of all, <i>Earth vs. the Pipettes</i> sounds like not just a different group, not just a lesser group but, in sadly off-putting ways, almost an <i>opposite</i> group. ""I don't want to hold your hand,"" sang the 2006 Pipettes, but on this album they ask us to give it to them on at least two separate songs (please ""understand""). Where ""Pull Shapes"" insisted, ""Just don't let the music stop,"" the new single begs for somebody to ""Stop the Music"". Speaking of ""Pull Shapes"", for fun slang this time we get ""I Vibe You""-- about which the less said the better.</p></div>"|14371.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14371-earth-vs-the-pipettes/|3.2|Marc Hogan

The verb felt like a mission statement for the Golden State magpies. A pan-psychedelic rock band, Sleepy Sun seemed intent on tying together the electric and acoustic ends of Led Zeppelin's discography and wrangling its favorites-- British folk, stoner metal, and classic rock among them-- together with the lasso. That inclusive approach had its consequences, though, especially with equivocation. Because Sleepy Sun fit so many elements into <i>Embrace</i>, each piece felt a bit unadventurous and overly familiar, though the album as a whole encouraged the unexpected.</p>
<p>Sleepy Sun's second LP exaggerates the problems of its predecessor by pushing nothing too far or too hard. ""Sandstorm Woman"", the 10-minute closing epic, feels like little more than the middle-aged house band at your neighborhood biker bar coming down from a set-break joint. The pensive moments come as if presaged by telegraph. The big rock outro-- all sweaty frontman glossolalia, guitar spirals, harmonica howls, and stretched drum rolls-- gradually slows its tempo and restrains its roar, resolving into a tidy, diminished coda. Unlike Earthless, Sleep, or any of the dozens of bands who have taken such moments to hell and the moon, Sleepy Sun bring it back to Earth and let it rest. It's the refusal to get too crazy, and it's boring. Many of these nine tracks suffer from the same half-there approach. The acoustic tunes stacked early do little but drift daintily. ""Open Eyes"" starts as a promising mix of clipped meters and refracted vocals. Ultimately, though, it heads for the same electric rock peaks that Black Mountain conquered on 2008's <i>In the Future</i> (see that band's ""Tyrants""). Sleepy Sun fall well short.</p>
<p>Such circumscription isn't <i>Fever</i>'s only problem, though it is the most vexing. Thing is, you've probably heard all of this before, via Zeppelin, Mountain, Sabbath, Pentangle, or any of the thousands of bands that have cited those acts as influences. Sleepy Sun's psychedelic rock is of a cut-and-paste variety, where a few decades of platitudes are snipped from their sources and simply rearranged. There's a fat-bottomed drum breakdown attached to a harmonica solo on ""Desert God"", and a fascination with stop-time and slow-burn maneuvers dominates ""Wild Machines"". ""Marina"" gets the mid-song auxiliary percussion and tribal chanting, while ""Freedom Line"" sports the meditative vocal intro. OK, dudes, we get it-- you like LPs, too.</p>
<p>All that said, <i>Fever</i> is beyond capably played and produced. Bret Constantino and Rachel Fannan offer adaptable voices, as fit for the thunder-on-the-mountain dramatics of ""Open Eyes"" as they are the across-a-bedroom intimacy of ""Ooh Boy"". Guitarists Matt Holliman and Even Reiss sound ready for most anything, too, whether it's the meticulous distortion and electric swells throughout ""Acid Love"" or the lithe, intertwining acoustic guitars during ""Rigamaroo"". The bass maw and stuttering drums of ""Freedom Line"" twist and shift, and producer Stewart affords enough sonic presence-and-pop to make it seem as though the band is practicing across the hall. And that's what makes <i>Fever</i> so frustrating. Sleepy Sun have learned the methods and studied the maps, but-- at least on record-- they've yet to take that knowledge into territory that feels new or, really, like it's their own.</p></div>"|14403.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14403-fever/|6.1|Grayson Currin

Google seems to think so: It returns some 70,000 results on the matter, including several from this very website. Certainly their lineup is stacked enough for the distinction. Between Spencer Krug, Dan Boeckner, and Dante DeCaro, I count half-a-dozen notable bands past or present, and drummer Arlen Thompson has put in work with Arcade Fire. But supergroups are rarely this prolific, nor this devoid of ego, and Wolf Parade have excelled at reconciling two increasingly distinct songwriting presences to make their music with-- rather than on top of-- each other.</p>
<p>This is especially true of <i>Expo 86</i>, the third Wolf Parade record in just under five years. Co-leaders Dan Boeckner and Spencer Krug are both coming off of arguably their most successful self-led projects yet. Last year's <i>Dragonslayer</i> served as a culmination of sorts for Krug's Sunset Rubdown, and Boeckner's Handsome Furs made a huge leap from curios to contenders on 2009's <i>Face Control</i>. Both seem to have carried the strengths of their respective sorta-side projects into the booth for <i>Expo 86</i>. While Wolf Parade's self-produced 2008 LP <i>At Mount Zoomer </i>was a notoriously laborious record to make, <i>Expo 86</i> is said to have come together quickly, with help on the boards from Howard Bilerman. Limber and focused, it sounds like a record made by a band without a bunch of other commitments, and more than the two Wolf Parade records that preceded it, like a unified statement from its two songwriters rather than a couple of strong voices working in parallel.</p>
<p>Krug takes <i>Expo</i>'s first shot with the chatty ""Cloud Shadow on the Mountain"", a jumpy, almost paranoiac ramble that that feels closest to the scattershot bluster of his work on <i>At Mount Zoomer</i>. Boeckner's ""Palm Road"" follows, a fairly standard Springsteenian rattler that gets it done but fails to ignite. Each track is distinctly the work of its author, but it's at this point that the differences between the two songwriters start to blur. ""What Did My Lover Say? (It Always Had to Go This Way)"" is Krug's, but it rides a rawboned riff that feels far more like the work of Boeckner, with Krug keeping the flights of lyrical and vocal fancy to a minimum. Here, especially in the wake of <i>Zoomer</i>, Krug's songs feel very to the point, as though he's saving the weird stuff for the Rubdown records and just wants the Wolf Parade tunes to pop. Which they do. And while I rather like Krug in the streamlined mode he's in here, one could easily argue he loses something having his edges sanded down like this.</p>
<p>While Boeckner's contributions to the Wolf Parade catalog have been by turns dizzying and drab,<i> Face Control</i> established him as a force of casual cool, and he brings that vibe to everything he touches here. Whereas Krug seemed to dominate Wolf Parade's 2005 debut, <i>Apologies to the Queen Mary</i>-- despite a strong showing from Boeckner in that record's back end-- the balance seems to have shifted some, and Boeckner's contributions here are uniformly strong. His circuitous songs are by and large more memorable than Krug's, but even at his best-- ""Little Golden Age,"" ""Yulia""-- he never quite blows it out like he did again and again on <i>Face Control</i>.</p>
<p><i>Expo 86</i>, if nothing else, feels like the realization of a Wolf Parade sound; the exquisite <i>Apologies</i> carried the long shadow of its producer Isaac Brock, and <i>Mount Zoomer</i> felt too often like two personalities careening off each other rather than finding some common ground. Solid and occasionally striking through it is, I do come away from <i>Expo 86</i> feeling a bit unsatisfied. <i>Apologies</i> was such an exhaustingly cathartic listen, <i>Mount Zoomer</i> was a puzzle you had to put together, but <i>Expo</i> just kind of lays it all out there, and the takeaway just isn't what it was for its predecessors. It's quite a feat to get these two singular songwriters, both riding waves of creativity, to cohere in this way. But after the individual successes of <i>Face Control</i> and <i>Dragonslayer</i>, <i>Expo 86</i> finds a nice comfortable spot somewhere in the middle, which feels more dependable than revelatory. Could be a little more supergroup-standard ego would do them some good.</p></div>"|14398.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14398-expo-86/|7.5|Paul Thompson

She's never limited herself to simply acoustic guitar and voice, frequently working with strings in some form on nearly all of her albums since 2004's <i>Dogs</i>. <i>Outlaster</i>, her latest record, is the first to have a full (if small) orchestra appearing on every track. It's a switch to hear her among so many collaborators when some of her best recent work-- like 2007's <i>You Follow Me</i>, a woefully overlooked and impregnable batch of songs-- was put together with just one, drummer Jim White. The interplay between them was gripping enough to make any listener forget it was the work of only two people. So why the need for so many more?</p>
<p>Though Nastasia is still at the center of these songs, <i>Outlaster</i> is the work of musicians listening closely and reacting to one another, and the spirit of collaboration is what gives these songs life. Bear in mind that Nastasia worked with both Jim White and various string players on 2006's <i>On Leaving</i>, a record with songs so spare they barely registered; the change on the following two albums is audible in more than a few ways. The strings and woodwinds on <i>Outlaster</i> are applied with the same rigor and taste that she's exhibited over her career, and they make each of these songs more vivid without turning them soggy with sentimentality. Even as they flirt with Eastern tones on ""You're a Holy Man"" or a severe Eastern-bloc tango on ""This Familiar Way"", they bring out new elements and tones in Nastasia's songs that feel like they'd been lurking underneath all along.</p>
<p>As striking as the arrangements are, there's still a place for the nuance that's typified Nastasia's work. ""You're a Holy Man"" is likely the most crowded room Nastasia's ever recorded in, with full strings, drums, and electric guitar, but all are as nimble as Nastasia herself, as they carefully accent the melodically intricate track. Likewise, a quick staccato pluck of violin strings adds palpable suspense to the opening verse of ""What's Out There"" before building to the more typically tense triplets behind Nastasia's deep wail later on. And when the orchestra holds back for the first verse of ""Wakes"", it lends all the more weight to the gorgeous moment when it comes in just before the second.</p>
<p>These collaborators seem to have spurred Nastasia to try different voices and tones: There's a newfound boldness (almost hoarseness) in her voice to compete with in ""This Familiar Way"", and a breathlessness to keep up with tracks like ""What's Out There"" and ""Wakes"" that puts a rare color in her cheeks. But some things haven't changed. Even as she tackles big topics, Nastasia still uses small, precise images to get the point across, whether it's the mention of a mask (gas mask?) in the foreboding tale of seclusion and paranoia in ""What's Out There"", the description of an old photo of a couple mooning the camera in ""Cry, Cry Baby"" that nails the length and depth of the relationship described, or the detail of someone wrapped in a sheet in the beginning of ""Wakes"", which is funereal and resigned in its lyrics but stubborn and defiant in its melody. The orchestra on <i>Outlaster</i> successfully cracks a window on Nastasia's one-woman-and-guitar setup and shines a different, striking light onto her music.</p></div>"|14393.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14393-outlaster/|8.1|Jason Crock

Up until now, there's really only been one thing uniting all of Wesley Pentz's various production credits: It's all been shit designed for dancing. (Even <i>Florida</i>, Diplo's own downtempo <i>Endtroducing</i>-esque affair, had some dancefloor push to it.) But that's not the case with the man's latest project. Math addled British hardcore kids Rolo Tomassi make a hell of a racket, but it's not the kind of racket that really encourages anyone to bust any kind of move, not even the punch-punch-spinkick variety you see at hardcore shows. (There's breakdancing in the band's ""Party Wounds"" video, but it's pretty incongruous, and I'm going to go way out on a limb and say their shows do <i>not</i> turn into Rock Steady Crew affairs.)</p>
<p>There's really nothing about <i>Cosmology</i>, the band's Diplo-produced album, that sounds like a Diplo production. Instead, it sounds like hardcore-- juddering stop-start hardcore with queasy keyboard lines and occasional pushes toward prettiness, but hardcore nonetheless. The synths don't sound like Diplo synths, and there's zero baile funk influence to be heard. Everything is well-recorded, with the vocals way up front, which is sort of a problem; music like this tends to work better when the tracks come with some mysterious murk. But I'm guessing Diplo had something to do with the way the album flows together-- no gaps between songs, everything moving together in a seamless suite. It works pretty well for this band.</p>
<p>If there's one personality that dominates the LP, though, it's not Wes Pentz. It's frontwoman Eva Spence, who's equally comfortable singing in a glassy, ethereal coo and a glasses-shattering screech. Spence's two singing styles are so different, in fact, that I just assumed she was two different people when I first heard the album, and I got annoyed that the band didn't let the girl sing more often. When she's in shriek mode, you totally can't tell that's a girl singing. There's also not much difference between that scream and every other scream from every other screamy hardcore band over the past 10 years. That scream can be an effective tool when she uses it at big moments, but when it's just that most of the time-- as it is here-- it loses impact. When she's actually <i>singing</i>, though, she doesn't sound much like anyone else.</p>
<p>Spence only uses that calm, frozen vocal style when the band stretches out and lets their tracks breathe. The first six or so tracks on the album are all clangy, off-kilter riff-tantrums, and we rarely get to hear that voice. These tracks are all mathed-out fragmentation, like the Dillinger Escape Plan or the Blood Brothers, except without the fireball urgency those bands could bring. Instead, the frantic time-sig switch-ups feel like showing off, sometimes with disconcerting levels of Zappa/Bungle-esque self-conscious weirdness.</p>
<p>It's on the back half of the album, where the band stretches out on longer songs with more ideas, that they really come to life. On these tracks, they relax their pyrotechnics enough to find some melody in their discord. The closing title track is the best song on the album by a mile. It builds from eerie, vaguely Angelo Badalamenti keyboards toward something much heavier, leaning more toward prog than hardcore for most of the track's eight minutes. This song reminds me of the better tracks on Genghis Tron's recent <i>Board Up the House</i>: A frenzied, fractal band finding its voice by zoning out. More of that, please.</p></div>"|14388.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14388-cosmology/|6.1|Tom Breihan

Same goes for albums: It's hard to be excited about the recently unearthed outtakes from a record that was pretty lousy on its own. Psychic Ills' 2009 misfire <i>Mirror Eye</i> wasn't the kind of thing most hoped for more of. The Ills' latest, <i>Catoptric</i>, is a four-song set culled from the same sessions that birthed <i>Mirror Eye</i>, originally intended for a concurrent release as a mini LP. But despite a somewhat shaky premise, <i>Catoptric</i> thankfully plays more like a separate featurette than a blooper reel.</p>
<p><i>Mirror Eye</i> was meditative, its gaze inward, lots of long, billowy, slate-grey drones moving so slowly as to seem to be crawling. It stood in sharp contrast with <i>Dins</i>, the Ills' visceral, occasionally violent 2006 debut LP. <i>Catoptric</i>, unlike either, seems to be facing upward-- it is spacey, expansive, almost devotional. Its tracks feel more purposeful, more sympathetic, more enveloping than <i>Mirror Eye</i>'s wishy-washes, and despite running about half as long as its predecessor, it seems to push further.</p>
<p>The raga-like opener ""Transmute"" swirls and chirps, its chanty vocals low in the mix, underpinned by an amniotic gurgle. It's the busiest, most live-in-a-room track here, and it manages to hold its shape through five spherical minutes. The thuddier, buzzier ""Secret Flower"" has kind of a sonar Pink Floyd vibe to it, tumbling along wobbly on a krautrock groove. It's the weakest of <i>Catoptric</i>'s four songs, falling into a lockstep that seems to hold on maybe a minute or so too long, but it's still got a sense of purpose. And then there's the smoky ""Indus Echo"", which rides a series of long, slow pulses into a telescopic tabla-bump trance. The band's Eastern influences are in full effect on the track, but here as on ""Transmute"", they wear them well.</p>
<p>But it's the outer spaceways of ""Outvocation"" that make <i>Catoptric</i> worth the trip. The slowly mutating track sounds like a slow-mo spacecraft hovering overhead, pausing to gurgle out some coded messages. It feels steely, stark, and infinite, building to a truly ominous throb toward its conclusion before pulling back as patiently as it arrived. And patience really does seem to be the difference between the <i>Catoptric</i> tracks and the lesser <i>Mirror Eye</i> material. Still, even on the most successful tracks here, Psychic Ills do seem to be stuck on the cusp of something without ever quite arriving at it. There's a kind of compositional blankness on display, a nagging feeling that what you're really hearing is long series of intros and outros rather than the songs themselves. But that suits the cutting room vibe of <i>Catoptric</i> just fine.</p></div>"|14406.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14406-catoptric/|5.8|Paul Thompson

Even so, the scope and virtuosity of his intuitive style makes him seem an especially tricky subject for a tribute album. Curated by Buck Curran of the folk duo Arborea, <i>We Are All One, in the Sun </i>does an impressive job of capturing the breadth of Basho's work, and it does so by concentrating as much on his eccentric songwriting and general beatific spirit as it does on his guitar skills.</p>
<p>In a wayward career that extended from his 1965 Takoma debut <i>The Seal of the Blue Lotus</i> to his untimely death in 1986, Robbie Basho specialized in the sort of cross-cultural stylistic leaps that are easy to take for granted in the Internet age but which must have sounded totally alien in 1965. In his playing he regularly referenced flamenco, Indian ragas, Celtic folk, and a wide variety of Asian and Native American styles with an almost invisibly deft touch. It seems appropriate, then, that for this tribute Curran has gathered musicians from around the globe, including several vocal tracks and a pair of non-guitar instrumentals that help to better illustrate the reach of Basho's influence. The pieces are a mix of direct covers of Basho originals and more impressionistic tribute songs that do their best to evoke and/or approximate Basho's enigmatic style.</p>
<p>Of course, the surest way to pay homage to a virtuoso guitarist is to enlist some virtuoso guitarists. No Basho tribute album could feel quite legit without an appearance from German guitarist Steffen Basho-Junghans, whose enthusiasm for Basho's work prompted him to add Basho to his own name as a sort of creative talisman. <i>We Are All One</i> is bookended by a pair of 12-string guitar pieces by Basho-Junghans, the first recorded in 1992 and the second in 2008. These pieces are not only fascinating re-interpretations of Basho's work but also provide a window onto the gradual progression of Junghan's own unique style. Similarly, pieces by guitarists Glenn Jones and Cian Nugent showcase artists who are not content to be mere copyists, as they instead craft new variations using Basho's wayfaring creativity as a guide.</p>
<p>Lovely though these pieces are, contributions from cellist Helena Espvall and Persian oud master Rahim Alhaj really serve to distinguish this album from any number of recent excellent acoustic guitar records. Throughout Basho's work, there seems a frequent undercurrent of loneliness or melancholy that has led many to describe his music as ""haunting"", and Espvall's lightly dissonant cello piece ""Travessa Do Cabral"" masterfully evokes this same impression. And while it is unclear whether the Iraqi-born Alhaj's piece ""Baghad Athania"" is directly inspired by Basho, it does reflect Basho's fondness for Middle Eastern forms and adds a welcome variation to the album's timbre.</p>
<p>Basho's own idiosyncratic vocals have never been universally beloved, even amongst his devoted fanbase. His voice could rise to an eerie wail that can seem remarkably startling and unearthly, especially at those points when his guitar has lulled the listener into a meditative daze. So it is probably for the best that the three vocal pieces here, all sung by female vocalists, are all performed with a notable degree of restraint, with nobody trying to duplicate Basho's style too precisely.</p>
<p>""Moving Up A'Ways"", Basho's typically eccentric variation on an old Navajo prayer, proves a perfect fit for Espers' Meg Baird, who delivers a captivating, understated performance. Buck Curran's own duo Arborea does similar good work on ""Blue Crystal Fire"", buoyed by Shanti Curran's suitably crystalline vocals, and Fern Knight make a good match for Basho's strange epic ""Song for the Queen"", providing what I believe is the album's sole electric instrumentation. Each piece on the album echoes a slightly different aspect of Basho's work, and this subtle level of variation helps make <i>We Are All One, in the Sun</i> that rare tribute album that is a solid listen from start to finish, and also serves to whet the appetite for further immersion into Robbie Basho's incredibly rich back catalog.</p></div>"|14387.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14387-we-are-all-one-in-the-sun-a-tribute-to-robbie-basho/|7.9|Matthew Murphy

The record introduced us to his folksy collage-pop aesthetic, but while often beautiful, its low fidelity often felt more like a hindrance than a benefit, and the more traditional song structures could feel slight or meandering. His newest album, <i>Mare</i>, is another story. An earthy, eclectic record that manages to be challenging, but also remarkably patient, it's the sound of the formerly Ridgewood, NJ-based songwriter quietly coming into his own.</p>
<p>Lynch once worked for Smithsonian Folkways Recordings, and now studies ethnomusicology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and you can hear those diverse influences at work on <i>Mare</i>: The music is recorded on humble equipment, is rough around the edges, and pulls liberally from lots of different genres. There are traces of drone, noise, and African percussion, for instance, alongside more traditional pop and rock elements. His instrumentation is unusual and eclectic, incorporating clarinet, watery guitar lines, shuffling maracas, and delicate drum work. But where bedroom pop tends to be somber and even unsettling at times, Lynch's music is very much at ease with itself. And it sounds very organic. Tracks are experimental in composition but ultimately echo the mood of folk or country-- music that feels like it should be played outdoors.</p>
<p>There's a kicked-back, front-porch quality to the album-- songs are sedate and unfurl slowly. Lynch sings but obscures his vocals until they act as a loose guide rather than a specifc blueprint. So <i>Mare</i> is primarily about atmosphere, and in that sense it's very much like an ambient record. And as with good ambient, it soothes without drifting off into the distance. This balance is key to the record's success, and Lynch acheives it with a smart rhythmic touch. ""Interlude"" is airy and gentle but it has propulsion and direction. Under its woozy synths and indistinct vocal coos is a funky guitar line that keeps it moving forward.</p>
<p>The album is also sneakily complex. You can just let it wash over you-- and it's good at that-- but the closer attention you pay, the more detail emerges. ""Ruth, My Sister"" is a pleasant wisp on first pass, but more spins show a dynamic arrangement that builds tension an inch at a time. And the sequencing is excellent: The record picks up steam around the seventh track, ""Ears"", which is bright and celebratory and just the right amount of spark so things don't become sleepy. Lynch is also smart to save some of his most straightforward material for the end of the record as a nice payoff. ""Travelers"" is probably the poppiest thing here-- just a simple vocal hook and melodic bassline-- but totally effective within the larger scheme.</p>
<p>One of the most likable things about <i>Mare</i> is that, for how druggy and narcotized it sounds, it doesn't comes across as sad or tuned-out. A lot of artists use these kinds of woozy textures to enhance a detached viewpoint, but ultimately this is colorful and engaged music. It's relaxed and inviting, and if the idea of summer music wasn't so generally overstated then I'd say it's also very season-appropriate. More centrally, though, it's a major creative step forward for Lynch, whose absorbing ambient pop sounds prove how refreshing this kind of subtlety can be.

For every group that managed to adapt to the Linn Drum era and score some actual hits, there were a dozen others that learned the hard way how tricky it was to maintain their funk credentials while adapting to the new sounds that the market demanded. These were the groups that stayed in their own local orbits, putting out independent and private-label releases that attempted to negotiate the disco/funk split with a foot on each dancefloor before finally clicking with the synthesized future.</p>
<p>This is the realm that Peoples Potential Unlimited operates in, and <i>Peoples Potential Family Album</i> is a fine collection of the D.C. label's most interesting rediscoveries so far. Label operator Andrew Morgan is one of those curator types who takes pains to not only license his finds but track down the originators and give them their due. And this first compilation is a labor of crate-digger love that doubles as a look into the ground-level versions of vintage 80s funk archetypes from roller-boogie to go-go, recorded with garage-band looseness and studio polish alike.</p>
<p>The first few tracks in the collection stand firmly on the side of the former. These are bands that, in an earlier era, would have fit in well with the lo-fi, J.B.'s-influenced woodshedder aspirants featured on collections of early- and mid-70s nuggets like <i>The Funky 16 Corners </i>and Jazzman's regional compilations. The gritty, disco-informed soul of tracks like Minority Band's ""Live"" and T.M.S.'s ""Get the Feelin"" are raw without being sloppy. There's actually something kind of rearview-looking about this stuff-- even through all the fat analog keyboards and Nile Rodgers-informed guitar, you can tell these bands were reaching back to the early-70s likes of B.T. Express and the Ohio Players even as they surged toward a rejuvenated new incarnation of funk.</p>
<p>Then again, there's actually a song here called ""Rejuvenate the Fonk"", by the Oklahoma group Satellite Band, and its slap bass, squiggly keyboards, and handclap-heavy backbeat could place it as this compilation's figurehead. The core of <i>Peoples Potential Family Album</i> is the gleaming, synthesized boogie that personified the times, and if it's maybe a half-step below the best moments of Rick James or the Gap Band, that still puts these discoveries in a pretty impressive class. The crisp, sophisticated bounce of Midnight Express' ""Danger Zone"", Caprice's coolly seductive ""Candy Man"" (featuring Apollonia's sister Larnette Winston on vocals), and Checker Kabb's rubbery jam ""By My Side"" could've been R&amp;B hits with a little more polish, luck, and distribution. As they turned out here, they're simply good examples of how smaller regional groups fit in to the bigger picture of an era in exciting stylistic flux.</p>
<p>Like most rare groove compilations, there are just enough examples of weird, amateurish novelty to provide a bit of off-kilter personality. NoLa group Crunch's 1982 split ""Cruise""/""Funky Beat"" and the dub of Mix-O-Rap's ""All Party People"" drizzle wandering, frequently off-beat keyboard noodling over their supple percussion, and it feels like everything starts ricocheting at odd angles after a point. Stranger still is the Ballplayers, the circa-1980 musical side project of MLB journeymen Lenny Randle and Thad Bosley, whose instrumental ""Universal Language"" is a slice of wah-wah disco-funk that falls somewhere between Denny McLain's late-60s lounge-Hammond LPs and the 1986 single ""Get Metsmerized"" on the baseball-player-as-musician quality scale. But that's just the kind of label PPU is: championing gems and oddities alike, unearthing finds that shouldn't have been buried in the first place, and elevating long-lost coulda-beens into a new generation's under-heard heritage.</p></div>"|14357.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14357-peoples-potential-family-album/|8.0|Nate Patrin

In other words, they've been around a lot longer than the better-known band with the similar name.</p>
<p><i>Dansette Dansette</i>, though, is the first album they've released since the rise of the Vivian Girls and Dum Dum Girls and Brilliant Colors and The Pains of Being Pure at Heart-- the new generation of groups that are operating more or less in the barrettes-in-the-hair mode Fletcher's various bands have been occupying for a few decades. That puts Fletcher and Pursey in the curious position of having stuck around long enough to see the revival of what they've been doing all along. (There are a couple of allusions here to the wave they came up with, too: ""Counting the Hours"" is a cousin to the Primitives' 1986 debut ""Thru the Flowers,"" and the funniest line on the album involves Fletcher enthusiastically invoking the Jesus and Mary Chain's name.)</p>
<p>The funny part is that Fletcher and Pursey were revivalists in the first place. Pursey's described Tender Trap as ""a girl group with guitars,"" and they unambiguously align themselves with the early-60s girl-group moment on a few of these songs. The title track (named after an old-fashioned portable turntable) namedrops Sandie Shaw, Lesley Gore, and the Supremes in its chorus; the ""Leader of the Pack"" beat turns up in a few guises. For that matter, the two new band members, drummer Katrina Dixon and guitarist Elizabeth Morris, finally let Fletcher be part of the three-part girly harmonies she's always alluded to. ""Do You Want a Boyfriend?"" updates the call-and-response of Betty Everett's ""The Shoop Shoop Song"": ""Does he have to please you?/ Psychologically!/ Does he have to tease you?/ Gynecologically!""</p>
<p>It's exactly the sort of record they've been making all along, in other words: tuneful, a little bit silly, aware of gender politics. There's a Talulah Gosh-style fast one (""Girls With Guns""); there's one called ""Capital L"" that you can file right next to Marine Research's ""Queen B"" and Heavenly's ""C Is the Heavenly Option"". There is no audible sign that this album didn't come out in 1992-- in its comfortable old fuzz-guitar tone, in its lyrical concerns, in the enduringly liquid curls of Fletcher's voice. They're doing what they love best, and the current American indie scene is finally catching up to what Fletcher and Pursey are looking back toward.</p></div>"|14401.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14401-dansette-dansette/|7.1|Douglas Wolk

Those early releases were classic math-rock, typified by busy guitar lines borrowed from 90s bands like Don Caballero. Maps &amp; Atlases are far from the only band from Chicago to use that sound as a starting point, but they're one of the few to try and move it forward and successfully translate it into pop songs. <i>Perch Patchwork</i> almost leaves the flashy musicianship entirely behind; when it is there, it puts it to good use-- here they turn their quirks into something diverse and accessible.</p>
<p><span>Foremost among those is Dave Davison's voice-- a reedy, almost froggy baritone. (Think Mark Morrison of ""Return of the Mack"" and you're not far off.) Yet he sings naturally and confidently, and even carries many of the songs here on the strength of his performance. ""The Charm"" builds to layered, clattering percussion with no melody at all save for Davison's vocal line-- the anchor and selling point of an affecting love song. Elsewhere, the band is at its best when it leaps furthest outside of its comfort zone: ""Solid Ground"" forgoes complicated instrumental lines in favor of layered production, where guitar, bass, and voice contribute only a fraction of the song's many earworms. The same goes for the bubbly power-pop of ""Israeli Caves""; these are melodically busy tracks, but every addition is balanced and thoughtful, no performer stepping over another, all serving the song.</span></p>
<p><span> On the second half of <i>Perch Patchwork,</i><span> t</span>he fingers get a little more fleet and the math-rock woodshedding shows, and all those busy notes start to run into each other, making the beginning and end of each track less discernible. But taken on their own, many of those songs feature creative left turns, whether it's the Latin instrumentation that crashes the sparse, rubbery riff of ""Pigeon"" or the campfire strumming between the jagged acoustic licks of ""Was"". That track might remind you of the mellower moments on Dirty Projectors' <i>Bitte Orca</i>, and the brief instrumentals that serve as interludes on <i>Perch Patchwork</i> have the gentle folksiness and thick atmosphere of Grizzly Bear's <i>Yellow House. </i> But while Maps &amp; Atlases are milder and less daring than either of those bands, </span><i>Perch Patchwork</i><span> is eclectic and consistent enough that each detour offers its own small reward.</span></p></div>"|14389.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14389-perch-patchwork/|7.4|Jason Crock

Although the label has put out some singles that focus more on pure melody (Pangaea's ""Router"", especially), much of Hessle's catalog has embraced experimentalism rather than formalism, leaning on empty space and skull-rattling beats alike. The result is electronic music that, even more than most dubstep, can walk the line between ""inviting"" and ""alienating"".</p>
<p>It figures, then, that at first listen, the self-titled EP from Hessle co-founder David Kennedy, aka the quixotically-named Ramadanman, calls attention to daggered rhythmic structure and harsh headspace textures. He builds his sound on IDM's irregular pulse and dry, whip-cracking textures. Forget dubstep's broken beat-- here, it's been disassembled, analyzed, and welded back together into a more sinister machine. The rhythms are glitchy and out-of-step, recalling hardcore breakbeat or a less metallic-sounding Autechre, and the basic pulse of these tracks is frequently disorienting, from the low wobble on ""No Swing"" to ""Tumble""'s pounding cadences. It's hard to imagine these sounds being a huge hit on the dance floor-- conversely, it's easy to picture E'd-out clubgoers on their knees, trying not to get seasick from the mayhem.</p>
<p>Yet this EP never feels overly arch or severe, largely due to the playful tics weaved into the compositions. Instead of allowing melodic phrases to complete and establish themselves as themes, Kennedy keeps it tense for extra color. The winding synth that rolls out ""Tumble"" rolls right back to its starting point just as it's reaching the end, curling at the tips like old parchment. The integration of dubstep signifiers comes with a sly grin as well; the squelches of bass that punctuate ""A Couple More Years"" are clipped and comedic. Listen closely to the hill-peaked penultimate cut ""Bleeper"" and you'll hear someone trying to catch their breath. Makes total sense, too, when you consider the pitched-down vocal pleas on ""I Beg You""-- everybody benefits from a good workout, but reluctance and exhaustion are always bookending the experience.</p>
<p>Consider the EP's best track, ""Don't Change For Me"", then, a most divine treat-- a delicious slab of chocolate cake after a day of wheatgrass shots and five-mile runs.  The song starts out with a metronomic click-tracked beat, with building textures that make it seem like just another solidly obtuse cut.  Don't be fooled, though, as a hardcore break rolls in and adds urgency to a gorgeously unspooling vocal sample. It's one of the most flat-out beautiful dubstep-related singles to drop so far this year, and the fact that it's pinned to the tail end of Kennedy's often challenging yet ultimately rewarding effort is a good look, as well as (hopefully) a glimpse at what's to come from Ramadanman.</p></div>"|14372.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14372-ramadanman-ep/|7.9|Larry Fitzmaurice

That's why they're perfect for their ""Late Night"" <i></i>job. They don't fit there because, as critics would say, they're easily digestible; they fit because they're versatile and consistently operate at a high level. They're encyclopedic music scholars who're proud of their chops but don't flash them at the expense of an accessible hook. They never compromise, even though they're refined enough to help set the standards for grown-man class in hip-hop. And it's possible to listen to their last few albums without being reminded they're big-idea concept records, even though their themes leave an impression  fairly quickly.</p>
<p>So after all the delays and discarded material (whatever happened to that ""Peaches En Regalia"" cover?), <i>How I Got Over</i> has emerged as a particularly efficient album. It's the Roots' shortest (a lean 42 and a half minutes), one of their most lyrically straightforward, and a work of strong stylistic cohesion. A decade's worth of personnel changes notwithstanding, it's clear that this is the same braintrust that made ""The Next Movement"" sound so vibrant 11 years ago; the two most prominent instrumental components remain ?uestlove's in-the-pocket drumming and the Ahmad Jamal/Donny Hathaway resonance of Kamal Gray's keyboards. And on the mic, Black Thought maintains his usual level-headed authority, continuing to come across at his best like a down-to-earth version of Rakim.</p>
<p>But what makes <i>How I Got Over </i>work is its sense of purpose. After the jaw-clenching stress rap of their last two excellent Def Jam releases, <i>Game Theory </i>and <i>Rising Down</i>, this record operates as a slow-build mission statement on how to overcome. Everything hinges on the title track, a stirring anthem built from a congas-and-organ backbone that sounds like a funkier, livelier inversion of Steely Dan's ""Do It Again"". As a showcase for Dice Raw and Black Thought's unexpectedly tender singing voices-- as well as the latter MC's ability to elevate simple sentiments with his delivery-- it feels like the group's usual rigorous standards being met. But it isn't exactly an accurate indication of how the album itself turns out sounding.</p>
<p>Instead, it's a pivot point, where everything before its halfway-mark appearance is the tunnel and everything afterwards is the light. <i>How I Got Over </i>is sequenced with a distinct idea of mood progression, changing from defeated, malaise-stricken piano-ballad dirges to defiant statements of survival and resilience. Black Thought's tough lamentations on early tracks ""Walk Alone"" and ""Radio Daze"" pick up where the more introspective moments of <i>Rising Down </i>left off. And even if he pushes a few metaphors past the breaking point or coasts on stating the obvious for a line or two, he doesn't suffer from a lack of relatability.</p>
<p>Once ""How I Got Over"" breaks through the first half's well-crafted melancholy and transitions into its more resolute second half, the sound shifts from glowing downtempo neo-soul to something more energized. ""Right On"" pits Joanna Newsom's lilting voice and harp against one of the most commanding drum breaks on the album; John Legend is artfully deployed as both a ghostly sample (the cathedral-sized ""Doin' It Again"") and an intense live vocalist (""The Fire""); ""Web 20/20"" upends the minimalist snare-driven charge of its <i>Tipping Point </i>namesake and mutates it into a jury-rigged, elastic-ricochet revamp of snap music. Black Thought ups his mood over the course of things as well, and by the time they reach the record's unlikely final hook-- ""Hustla""'s Auto-Tuned crying-baby-- he's turning struggles into strengths for the sake of his next generation.</p>
<p>A lot has been made of the indie rock collaborations on this album, particularly the appearances by Newsom, the Monsters of Folk on ""Dear God 2.0"", and the wordless <i>a cappella</i> chorus from Amber Coffman, Angel Deradoorian, and Haley Dekle of the Dirty Projectors on the intro track ""A Peace of Light"". But their crossover efforts land firmly on the Roots' side of the equation, integrating into their Soulquarian aesthetic instead of nudging them the other way. Meanwhile, the guest MCs do just as much to round out <i>How I Got Over</i>'s personality. The recurring satellite members that bolstered the ranks on <i>Rising Down </i>reprise their roles here<i> </i>(an on-fire Dice Raw, the low-key sharpness of Truck North and P.O.R.N., the obligatory show-stealing Peedi Peedi appearance). ""Right On"" and ""Hustla"" make for a couple of good showcases for promising Philly-via-ATL up-and-comer STS, who's molded his semi-drawl into an agile flow. And there's a couple of fine verses from Little Brother's Phonte and some absolute revelations from L.A. phenom Blu, both of whom sound vital even when they spend most of their time describing their anxiety.</p>
<p><i>How I Got Over </i>has its title for a reason. It alludes to the gospel standard popularized by Clara Ward, and has a similarly spiritual-minded cast to it as its namesake's tribute to the power of belief in helping people reach the promised land. Maybe it's not as explicitly religious, but it regularly alludes to some form of higher power, whether it's God or a more secular sense of things that are simply out of civilization's control. And that's the compelling thing about the Roots on this album: They're not afraid to show humility and frustration when confronted with struggle, operating on the same level of humanity as the people who listen to it. For all the Roots' tight professionalism and clockwork consistency, for all their late-night TV exposure and their status as alt-rap icons, they're not superhuman. But the fact that they know this, that they can make a whole album about coming to terms with it-- that makes them powerful.</p></div>"|14386.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14386-how-i-got-over/|8.1|Nate Patrin

That specific band names will come to mind when discussing Magic Bullets is unavoidable: The Smiths and Orange Juice are obvious, as are the nods to the sunnier elements of twee.</p>
<p>Since these sounds tend to inspire fierce allegiance, referencing them so overtly is risky. And with Magic Bullets, you have to take into account just how close to home some of this stuff hits. Though much of the guitar work here owes at least something to Johnny Marr, it becomes troubling when some of the licks seem practically copied and pasted. At one point, ""Pretend &amp; Descend"" hijacks a riff from ""Bigmouth Strikes Again"" with such blatant disregard, it almost feels as if it should be listed with an asterisk. And even if lead singer Philip Benson shares few vocal similarities with the likes of Morrissey or Robert Smith, he's not above taking time during the more solemn moments on the album to pout like them.</p>
<p>But Magic Bullets get over by being anything but a bunch of miserablists. In this sense, they take a higher road, trying to write honest-to-god pop tunes that work independent of borrowed style. So while they do adopt a sound, they mostly leave the pose behind. You'd expect a song titled ""Sigh the Day Away"" to feel derivatively cheeky when peppered with earnestly-spun lyrics like, ""It wouldn't hurt you to smile, why not try it out for a while?"" But these aren't songs in ironic disguises. Lacking the maddened melodrama and cleverness that bands like Wild Beasts subscribe to, Magic Bullets come off like straight shooters, keeping things fresh, unassuming, and unlabored.</p>
<p>At times here, you get a sense of a restless need to broaden the band's appeal, so that some tracks to come off as too ebullient or sugary. But these impulses are balanced with classic sounds and structures that feel balmy, wide-eyed, and genuine. We'll see if Magic Bullets eventually emerge from the shadow of their influences, but for now, it's difficult to fault these guys when the music sounds good and the gestures seem sincere.</p></div>"|14373.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14373-magic-bullets/|7.2|Zach Kelly

Rather, his Aldous Snow is a hodgepodge of dichotomous frontman archetypes: he's a foul-mouthed bastard like Liam Gallagher and a tabloid-baiting trainwreck like Pete Doherty, but he also possesses the do-gooder messianic complex of Bono and teeny-bopper populism of Robbie Williams. This inconsistency in character hardly matters to the success of the movie, which is a road-trip buddy flick first and a music-biz satire a distant second. But that hasn't stopped Brand from trying to sell his fake rock star in the real world. The film's soundtrack is presented as an official release by Snow's band, Infant Sorrow, and, to ensure Brand's Britpop bona-fides, it taps the songwriting expertise of Jarvis Cocker and the Libertines' Carl Barât, among others.</p>
<p>Brand certainly has the voice that the ruse requires, adopting a convincing Liam-esque whine for the rockers and exuding an appropriately insufferable air of self-importance on the big ballads. However, unlike the gold standards of mock rock-- the soundtracks to <i>This Is Spinal Tap</i> and <i>The Rutles: All You Need Is Cash</i>-- the songs heard on <i>Get Him to the Greek</i> don't cohere into a parallel-universe career retrospective of an artist that you could imagine actually existing. Instead, like the numbers in a musical, their key function is to advance the film's plot and provide its emotional cues. Which means that they don't serve much purpose outside of that context. ""African Child (Trapped in Me)""-- Snow's ridiculously patronizing attempt at a help-the-poor power ballad-- is essentially <i>Get Him to the Greek</i>'s catalyst, the career-killing nadir that sets the film's comeback narrative in motion. But it loses a considerable degree of its outrageousness when heard without its abominable video.</p>
<p>There's a good reason why real-world rock bands have covered songs by <i>Spinal Tap</i> and <i>The Rutles</i>: the tunes may have been written as jokes, but their humor was communicated through a keen application of readily identifiable genre conventions. (Think of how the Tap's ""Gimme Some Money"" perfectly aped not just the freakbeat blues of The Yardbirds and early Rolling Stones, but also the lazy misogyny often expressed within.) <i>Get Him to the Greek</i>, however, is built upon a more generic, vaguely defined base-- popular British rock of the last 15 years-- so there's less fun to be had in picking out its targets. The songs must therefore yield their one-note snickers through the overuse of British vernacular (""Bangers, Beans and Mash""), numbskull declarations of hedonism (see: the Barat-penned ""let's get fucked!"" refrain of ""Gang of Lust"") and elaborate set-ups to crass punchlines (the Cocker/Chilly Gonzales co-write, ""F.O.H."", an ascendant, U2-scaled piano ballad whose source of uplift is finally revealed in the chorus: ""fucking on heroin"").</p>
<p>Ironically, it's the two bonus tracks by Jackie Q-- Snow's starlet ex-girlfriend, played and sung by Rose Byrne-- that are the most successfully subversive, coaxing out the sexual suggestiveness of Spice Girls-style dance-pop to the point where the innuendo turns literal. And Brand does score a direct hit with the faux-Oasis trifle ""Furry Walls"", a rare instance where the song's nonsensical status outside the film actually proves to be its saving grace. To those who haven't seen <i>Get Him to the Greek</i>, the opening line of ""When the world slips you a Jeffrey/ Stroke the furry wall"" may initially seem baffling; however, it's really no more asinine than anything the Gallaghers were spouting off about in their cocaine-supernova heyday.</p></div>"|14402.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14402-get-him-to-the-greek-ost/|5.5|Stuart Berman

Even though many Americans and Europeans are aware of the distortions and exaggerations some Western media outlets have made about Arabic news network Al Jazeera, the bugaboo surrounding the word feels as if it will limit this album's audience. That's unfortunate, because <i>Jazeera Nights: Folk and Pop Sounds of Syria</i> is probably the most dynamic collection of Omar Souleyman's work that Sublime Frequencies has yet released.</p>
<p>Though the tracks on <i>Jazeera Nights</i> were culled from live performances recorded between 1995 and 2009, they sound like they were produced in a studio, with the crackling boom of electronically generated dance beats pushing the music further and harder than even the most adventurous songs from <i>Highway to Hassake</i> and <i>Dabke 2020</i>, Sublime Frequencies' last two Souleyman compilations. The music is a blend of different folk styles-- Iraqi Choubi, Kurdish, Turkish-- mostly played in a tempo best suited for <i>dabke</i>, an Arabic folk dance that's a more jubilant form of line dancing. But Souleyman's music has as much to do with most people's assumptions of ""folk"" as Miles Davis' 1970s work has to do with most people's assumptions of ""jazz."" Musically, they're rooted in their origin's form; but sonically, they depart so fully from traditional instrumentation that they barely resemble previous incarnations of their respective genres.</p>
<p>Unlike <i>Highway to Hassake</i> and <i>Dabke 2020</i>, which had some more languid moments, only ""Eih Min Elemkom"", the last track on <i>Jazeera Nights</i>, has a slow tempo. Most of these songs are paced at a speed that would turn cheetahs into roadkill-- an inexorable progression of serpentine, whiny keyboard lines, twangy ouds, and chaotic hand drums. (Imagine M.I.A.'s ""Bird Flu"" ten times faster, wrapped in blaring, bendy tones with an impassioned, scratchy male voice singing over it
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
and you're still only halfway there.) The pacing of ""Hot Il Khanjar Bi Gleibi"" puts it in the same realm as happy hardcore or bassline, while opening track ""Hafer Gabrak Bidi""'s aggressive kick drum punctuates a menacing keyboard line nearly obscured by a clatter of percussion. The two mid-tempo tracks here are also the two best: ""Labji Wa Bajji Il Hajar"" has a summery synth bounce and ""Mandal/Metel Il Sukkar Ala Il Shai"" is a 10-minute corkscrew of tension and space.</p>
<p>Mark Gergis, who assembled <i>Jazeera Nights</i> and wrote its liner notes, frequently releases music of this stripe-- e.g. folk music filtered through electronic instrumentation, yet halting just before MIDI and computer-based modes of production. Because of his reluctance to embrace contemporary technology-- Souleyman releases most of his music on cassette, most of which are sold in kiosks in his native Syria-- there's a very palpable friction in the music, which is trying to explore present-day styles without eliminating its folk backbone or the eroding shell of recently anachronistic technology. If you're already a Souleyman fan, then you're going to get this, since it ably complements <i>Highway to Hassake</i> and <i>Dabke 2020</i>. But if those two compilations struck you as too distant or monotonous, then <i>Jazeera Nights</i>' distinct collision of pan-chronological party music should be the mode by which you come to understand Souleyman's rich and deep body of work.</p></div>"|14390.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14390-jazeera-nights-folk-and-pop-sounds-of-syria/|7.8|Tal Rosenberg

Efdemin seems to take the ""deep"" in ""deep house"" quite literally: Not content with dubby drums and thwumping bass, he packs his compositions with musical Easter eggs for careful listeners to uncover. Efdemin's second record, <i>Chicago</i>, offers a mostly similar experience, though it's somehow even more austere and composed than his debut.</p>
<p>This measured approach seems initially off-putting. Former Dial label-mate Pantha du Prince-- to whom Efdemin is often compared-- has opened his sound wide to grand, loving effect. Efdemin's fantastic contribution earlier this year to label showcase <i>Dial: 2010</i> hinted at a similar gesture, but <i>Chicago</i> remains buttoned-up throughout. The album's title seems to set up the Windy City as a totem, though Efdemin seems far more interested in the city's masculine, gray skyline than in the playful house music pioneered there in the early and mid-1980s.</p>
<p>It's not that Efdemin lacks playfulness. He intersperses bits of dialogue and field recordings into his music. The album opens with a voice-- also sampled on RJD2's ""Salud""-- saying, ""I can't decide which piece to start with, so I won't start with any of the pieces, I've already started."" <i>Chicago</i> is calm, always composed, and the key to enjoying it is ferreting out the buried bits of humor and beauty as Efdemin's winding tracks snake by.</p>
<p>This is easier to manage during the album's haunting, psychedelic second half. Snapping strings and choral ephemera unbind the wonderful ""Nothing Is Everything"". ""There Will Be Singing"" takes aim at future gospel. ""Round Here"" runs for nine rugged minutes, but its finest moment is a 70-second, beatless synth patch. These aren't hooks so much as rest stops along <i>Chicago</i>'s 77 minutes of beat-heavy, uptempo architecture.</p>
<p>It is, quite frankly, a lot of techno music to take in, especially without memorable refrains or an obvious heater single. There are times <i>Chicago</i> would no doubt benefit from the soft bell tones of Efdemin's earlier work, though the basic premise remains the same: long, spooling tracks with plenty of appeal for patient ears. If you've got the time or the inclination to play hide and go seek with him, Efdemin packs <i>Chicago</i> with enough minutia and depth to bring his initially dry compositions to life.</p></div>"|14363.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14363-chicago/|6.5|Andrew Gaerig

Having internalized the jerky rhythmic lessons of their post-punk influences, they've eagerly outfitted their songs with club-friendly accoutrements and commissioned two albums of remixes. Yet the band is also often considered a major caretaker of trad-rock's rapidly diminishing flame, largely owing to its anthemics and lead singer Kele Okereke's lyrical earnestness.</p>
<p>Now, possessed by the same restlessness that's also lately stricken the Strokes' Julian Casablancas, Kele (having professionally dropped his surname) has made a solo album, and it's widely being framed as a bracing electro-minded departure. Admittedly, <i>The Boxer </i>inhabits electronic music more intimately than any of Bloc Party's proper studio efforts. However, the album's real departure involves less a greater embrace of synths and beats than the abandonment of soaring, big-tent songcraft. Regrettably, the lyrical earnestness remains.</p>
<p>In place of huge choruses and bombast, Kele offers an album heavy on tone, mood, and texture. Unfortunately, his efforts fail to make you forget the absence of things like hooks. Intriguing elements are in place-- the dubstep-influenced beats of opening cut ""Walk Tall"" and ""The Other Side""; the kinetic minute and a half of squelchy synths and seismic breaks on the outro to ""Rise"". But rarely do the piecemeal bells and whistles add up to a worthwhile song, as ""The Other Side"" haphazardly trots out guttural grunts and light tropicalia touches, while ""Rise"" spends most of its running time meandering through a chintzy, xylophone-led groove.</p>
<p>At least those songs give you something to hold onto, which can't be said for ""The New Rules"" or ""All the Things I Could Never Say"" (a song title only Bono could love). Kele is in full introspective flower here, which means we get treated in the former to the gripping admission that he's ""learning to be laid-back about things"" while in the latter we have to put up with a tedious quarter-life crisis caused by an untrustworthy lover who's ""making me older.""</p>
<p>""Everything You Wanted"" is whiny too, but it's more than saved by containing the album's one truly transportive refrain. Alas, the music's rather lukewarm, especially when you set it next to the album's most Bloc Party-ish cut, the driving post-punker ""Unholy Thoughts"". Given Kele's unwillingness to play to his widescreen strengths, perhaps it makes sense that the best moment here happens when he disappears entirely, pitch-shifting his voice into a thinly soft, Michael Jackson-like register on ""On the Lam"". Of course, there's not really a hook there, either.</p></div>"|14381.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14381-the-boxer/|5.1|Joshua Love

But occasionally an online environment can also help nurture the art of the remix, allowing artists to be more open and spontaneous with these treatments, often posting the results free. Case in point: ""Life Magazine"", the first single from darkwave noiseniks Cold Cave's debut,<i> Love Comes Close-</i>- four of the six tracks collected here (the digital purchase features two bonus cuts not found on the 12"") can be found over in the Forkcast section of this website.</p>
<p>So the idea of the <i>Life Magazine Remixes EP</i> seemed somewhat superfluous. Fortunately, <i>Life Magazine Remixes</i> is a rare remix venture that feels strikingly cohesive, containing the dramatic arc of a long player and providing a varied array of interpretations that not only celebrate the original cut but are clearly marked by each remixer's unique voice. The result is not simply a cobbled-together, fans-only collector's item, but a genuinely well-paced and thoughtful work.</p>
<p>Famed electro producer Arthur Baker's ""Not Going Back Remix"" is a perfect way to open the EP and re-acquaint the listener with ""Life Magazine"", as he grabs the juiciest pieces of the original and reinforces them. Of all the tracks here, Baker's stays closest to the source material, splicing and enhancing in a way that's practically remix 101. Here, he chops the synth while slowly recombining the song's vocal and percussive elements: The result is ""Life Magazine"" amplified-- a beefed up, movement-concentrated piece.</p>
<p>Glasgow DJ tag-team Optimo subscribe to a similar club-friendly vibe, even if both of their remixes (their ""Flexi Pop"" offering is one of two digital-only tracks, alongside a terrific jungled-up house jam from Delorean) operate way outside the given source material. The ""Espacio"" mix is overstuffed with sound effects, but Optimo manage to lock down a tubular, funk-heavy groove and enlist some larger-than-life synths. Clubby but in a very dreamy, narcotic kind of way, Optimo place Caralee McElroy's vocal out in front, warping her into some sort of cosmic diva entity-- a neat trick considering Cold Cave's murky aesthetic.</p>
<p>While the A-side helps reupholster some of Cold Cave's poppier elements, the B-sides do their best to deconstruct and redirect the focus on the band's affinity for mood and texture. The tail-end of ""Espacio"" dampens and darkens its sound a bit, and if you don't have to fuss with flipping the record over, blends really nicely into the ambient-minded German producer Pantha du Prince's ""First Flash Remix"". Pantha's offering is expectedly out-there, giving way to some high-difficulty listening-- his dizzying array of clapping percussion and clipped pieces mold into something uncomfortable and strangely pretty. But it's Cold Cave member Dominick Fernow's remix as Prurient that pushes the envelope furthest and succeeds the easiest, employing what feels like an army of corroded, stabbing synths and tremendous feedback that transforms ""Life Magazine"" into a punishing, expertly constructed noise anthem. It's one highlight among many on a 40-minute EP that explores the extremes of ""Life Magazine"", as its remixers deconstruct and help recontextualize the original without simply milking its familiar charms.</p></div>"|14353.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14353-life-magazine-remixes-ep/|7.3|Zach Kelly

As a musician, he's helped negotiate some of the most interesting turns in dance music in recent years, both as a producer and as head of the epochal dubstep label Hyperdub. And then, as an academic, he recently published <i>Sonic Warfare: Sound, Affect, and the Ecology of Fear</i>, a head-turning book that surveys aural culture at its most ideologically expansive and theoretically vital.</p>
<p>But those expecting Kode9 in either of the above modes might be surprised by his habits as a DJ. In the mix, he's more worldly and more in thrall to thrills-- and way more likely to chase down moments of ecstatic confusion. His installment of the long-running <i>DJ-Kicks</i> series finds its way into more than a few such moments, but it wanders nicely as well. Indeed, more exhilarating than any particular selection or segue is the realization, in general, of just how much has been covered when the 63-minute set spins to a close.</p>
<p><i>DJ-Kicks</i> starts out bright and warm, and begins refracting early with the entrance of Aardvarck and Kode9's own ""Blood Orange"" and ""You Don't Wash (Dub)"". The first 10 minutes alone flit through heaving synths, breakbeats, patches of dainty syncopation, heavily modulated basslines, and what might be a thumb-piano-- all highlighting the friction between organic and synthetic, tough and tender, brooding and cool.</p>
<p>From there it all pushes forward through manic rushes and spells of mellow reprieve. The tracklist includes stuff from the Hyperdub orbit (Cooly G, Ill Blu, Ikonika, Zomby, Terror Danjah) and markers of external sounds like South African house (Mujava's ""Pleaze Mugwanti"") and sassy-weird R&amp;B (Rozzi Daime's ""Dirty Illusions""). But nothing in a context so steeped sounds quite the same as it would otherwise. Kode9 is too fidgety for that, and too eager to smash tracks together for what might come out of the collision. Sometimes it's mesmerizing (the moody, glimmering blur around Zomby's ""Godzilla"") and sometimes it's straight-up insane (Addison Groove's ""Footcrab""). Few of the collisions stand to shock followers primed to the ways that ""dubstep"" tends to digress in clubs. But neither have any failed, it's clear by the end, to line up as anything short of a thorough statement of purpose for a musician and thinker with much to say.</p></div>"|14377.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14377-dj-kicks/|7.3|Andy Battaglia

Forest Swords, the UK producer's one-man project, conjures many ideas associated with those tags-- faded memories, ghostly auras, dream states. His music sometimes feels built from allusions and reference points, but the connections to sources are so elusive that <i>Dagger Paths </i>sounds singular first and evocative of something else second.</p>
<p>For me, that ""something else"" is often another artist who has snuck into a stylistic crevice, Mark Nelson, the Labradford member who works solo as Pan American. Like Nelson, Barnes is adept at picking simple rhythms and sounds, repeating them at a pace both languid and insistent, and folding in texture and volume until each piece becomes sneakily dense. Both also prefer wiry, reverb-heavy guitars, which charge their songs like lightning inside a cloud. But where Pan American can sometimes softly float away, Forest Swords is rarely hazy or indistinct. Most of Barnes' sounds are clear-- take opener ""Miarches"" whose echoes are big and bold, less like drifting fog than brisk wind.</p>
<p>That boldness comes partially from Barnes' interest in techno, hip-hop, and R&amp;B. Those influences give him a strong sense of beat and a knack for forceful bass lines. The R&amp;B strain in particular lurks in the background of everything here-- but in case you miss it among the reflecting guitars and rumbling beats, Barnes makes it explicit in an abstract take on Aaliyah's ""If Your Girl Only Knew"". Prioritizing bass over beat, letting every sound decay and dissolve, Barnes crafts a dying echo of the original, as if he hoped to erase it from his memory <i>Eternal Sunshine-</i>style.</p>
<p>What sticks in my mind after listening to <i>Dagger Paths </i>is its visual nature. When I get wrapped up in one of Barnes' tracks, I picture shadowy figures, found filmstrips, or TV movies fuzzed by tape wear. Barnes' <a href=""http://oesbee.blogspot.com/2010/03/forest-swords-video-trilogy-plus-one.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">videos</a> are actually clearer and simpler than that (though <a href=""http://vimeo.com/9696519"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Light""</a> is almost exactly what I imagined), but they all use old footage to reflect the music's sense of dislocation. But it would be wrong to peg Barnes to one set of images or sounds-- my guess is he can do a lot more, and his new single, <a href=""http://vimeo.com/12651822"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Rattling Cage""</a>, has a dubby, Sun Araw vibe. As long as he keeps making music this blurrily evocative and vividly pictorial, any direction he takes will be the right one.</p></div>"|14397.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14397-dagger-paths/|7.9|Marc Masters

What you don't hear so much is how these sites create and foster communities-- virtual ones, obviously, but geographical ones too. Like many other indie bands, Edinburgh's Meursault are releasing their new LP on a small, local label. The difference is that Song, by Toad Records is a spinoff of a successful mp3 blog and podcast of the same name. Together they comprise a triple threat that the Scotsman has called the ""DIY front-line of the city's homespun and rapidly expanding music scene."" Think globally, act locally, eh?</p>
<p>At this point, Meursault have little name recognition beyond the borders of Edinburgh or Hype Machine. But <i>All Creatures Will Make Merry</i>, a more developed and thoughtful follow-up to their craggy 2008 debut, <i>Pissing on Bonfires/Kissing With Tongues</i>, could change that. Don't let the album title fool you: Like fellow Scots Frightened Rabbit and the Twilight Sad, Meursault are ambassadors of misery, self-loathing, and huge, heart-heavy choruses. Most sad bastards can generate a modicum of optimism on January 1. But on ""Crank Resolutions"", the sadder bastards in Meursault declare, ""I broke down on New Year's Day/ And I mixed my drinks/ And I lost my way,"" among hyperventilating electronic beats and pyrrhic victory shouts. It's enormous fun, of course, and I can't wait to see a live audience sob along to every word.</p>
<p>Throughout <i>Merry</i>, the seven-piece band busts out pitter-pattered drums, string swells, banjo solos, and rousing refrains. But Meursault largely retain the intimacy of their origins as the solo project of Neil Pennycook. His voice is confident and warm-timbred, but he always sounds a shade short of losing his mind, and his grim intensity makes even a garden-variety acoustic folk number like ""Weather"" compelling. With only voice, ukulele, and a blanket of lint, the fragile ""One Day This'll All Be Fields"" is a desperate-- and devastating-- little song.</p>
<p>As you might suspect, Neutral Milk Hotel supplies Meursault with plenty of ideas: ""And we will descend from the sky/ And we will bury you alive,"" Pennycook sings like gospel on ""Fields"".  But it would be churlish to fault any band in 2010 for mining the sonics, sincerity, even the iconography, of <i>In the Aeroplane Over the Sea</i>, particularly when they do it well and make it their own. Clenched teeth, furious strum, bodies falling, souls salvaged-- all belong to a shared language anyone reading this review anywhere in the world already knows like a native tongue.</p></div>"|14298.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14298-all-creatures-will-make-merry/|7.9|Amy Granzin

They followed up the 2007 release of <i>HEALTH</i> with <i>Disco</i>, a surprisingly coherent collection that re-jiggered their sinewy, abrasive tunes. On <i>Disco</i>, artists like Pictureplane and Nosaj Thing channeled HEALTH's chaotic rhythmic power into tight, four-on-the-floor tracks and created sweaty, spazzy, and sexy songs from the noisy source material. And most importantly, <i>Disco</i> seems to have influenced them in making new music. <i>Get Color</i> found HEALTH taking cues from those remixes, growing in a more streamlined, synth-heavy, groove-oriented direction.</p>
<p>Which brings us to <i>Disco2</i>. You could say that it's a remix album of a studio collection that was influenced by a remix album. But rather than becoming an indistinct photocopy of a photocopy, the album brings HEALTH's strengths sharply into focus. Though the heavy tribal pounding and drum freak-outs of the originals are mostly stripped away, the new beats highlight how central rhythm is to these songs. The remixes also give a newfound heft to Jacob Duzsik's reedy, almost-feminine voice, which is already higher up in the mix on <i>Get Color </i>than on <i>HEALTH</i>. Javelin's version of ""In Heat"", for example, uses Duzsik's otherworldly vocals as its jumping off point, cushioning the singing in a funky bass line. Fleshing out the productions, the album is carried forward by waves of shimmering synth figures, many of which are ripped from HEALTH's originals, an approach that shines a spotlight on the band's underestimated way with hooks.</p>
<p>Though <i>Disco2</i> is ostensibly a collection about HEALTH, it also serves as a nice survey of some of the more interesting producers on the scene. Montreal-based artist CFCF takes on ""Before Tigers"" and gloms onto the ethereal vocal melody that lurks beneath the guitar squall of the original, turning it into a bittersweet, shimmering song marked by nostalgic 80s synths. But British producer Gold Panda's version of the same track is completely instrumental, a hypnotic stew of repetitive reverberations and glottal percussion. And while both Denver electro-punk Pictureplane and Black Moth Super Rainbow's Tobacco take on <i>Get Color</i>'s best track, ""Die Slow"", their versions-- the former an astral rave jam of Balearic beats, the latter a syrupy psychedelic concoction of squelching synths-- couldn't be more different.</p>
<p>There is one new HEALTH track on <i>Disco2</i>, ""USA Boys"", and the band was smart to kick the album off with it. With its dark, cyclical synth riff, droning, outer-space vocals, and gothy dancefloor melody, ""USA Boys"" not only fits in amongst the cleaner, glossy-electronica vibe of the record, but is also one of its best tracks. This promising development suggests that <i>Disco2</i>, like its predecessor, may be a bridge to the next phase in HEALTH's evolution.</p></div>"|14348.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14348-disco2/|7.8|Rebecca Raber

As a one-line encapsulation of Oasis, it still can't beat the refrain from the first song on the band's first album: ""Tonight I'm a rock'n'roll star."" And yes, there was a time when many indie-minded listeners' first reaction would've been to point out everyone else Liam and brother Noel apparently <i>wanted</i> to be, from the Beatles on down through glam and the Creation back catalog.</p>
<p>In the aftermath of Oasis' 2009 breakup, however, the sentiment (such as it is) behind 1994 debut single ""Supersonic"" rings startlingly true. The men from Manchester lived out a certain simple, populist idea of rock'n'roll stardom: They drank to excess, did lots of drugs, brawled, waged sibling warfare like the brothers Reid and Davies before them, sold millions of records, and made arrogant statements against anyone who saw the role of a popular musician as anything different. At the same time, as their all-too-human 2000s output proved, they could never be more or less than themselves-- simultaneously swaggering and down-to-earth, and, at their best, indelibly melodic.</p>
<p>This combination of characteristics helped spark an unprecedented 2.6 million applications for tickets to the 1996 English gig that gives Oasis' latest compilation its otherwise anonymous-looking cover image. Where 2006 2xCD best-of <i>Stop the Clocks</i> delved into album cuts as well as some of the band's once-sterling B-sides, <i>Time Flies</i> compiles only the 27 UK A-sides, plus, for the U.S. edition, the full album version of stateside smash ""Champagne Supernova"". As a product, then, it's equal parts redundant and incomplete, lacking album cuts like ""Rock'N'Roll Star"" as well as B-sides like ""Talk Tonight"" while adding three mostly unspectacular singles from 2008's <i>Dig Out Your Soul</i>. As strictly a listening experience, though, it's a decent document of a bunch of relatively unexceptional guys who willed themselves to greatness for a couple of years there but couldn't stop being relatively unexceptional.</p>
<p>Oasis never made a record with Brian Eno. They didn't do dystopian electronic concept albums. So to criticize their singles for being obvious or conservative feels almost as beside the point as dismissing Belle and Sebastian for being fey, Lil Wayne for being foul-mouthed, or Rage Against the Machine for, well, raging-- it's just sort of what they <i>do</i>. And what Oasis did really well was take their favorite musical influences and their favorite lyrical subjects and communicate them to a mass audience in a meaningful way, without ever trying to present themselves as if they were doing something that was over anybody's head. The songs hit you or they didn't. In that way, being unexceptional was the band's secret weapon; the further removed the Gallaghers &amp; co. got from their listeners' reality, the less their music seemed to resonate with many people. They had nothing else up their sleeves.</p>
<p>A big selling point of this compilation is meant to be the inclusion of two non-album singles, 1994's ""Whatever"" and 2007's ""Lord Don't Slow Me Down"". Which, whatever. The first is drenched with enough strings to explain why soon-rival Damon Albarn, himself about to release orchestral material such as Blur's gorgeous ""The Universal"", might introduce the tune on ""Top of the Pops"". Noel takes the lead vocal on ""Lord Don't Slow Me Down"", a generically bluesy rocker that understandably earned the group's lowest chart placement in more than a decade; fans obsessive enough to want this already have it on the <i>Dig Out Your Soul </i>bonus CD.</p>
<p>At the very least, these songs exemplify the two basic types of singles Oasis have released over the years. On one hand are the slow, strummy, majestically nonsensical singalongs. Whether acoustic-based like ""Wonderwall"", piano-backed like ""Champagne Supernova"", or with a touch of Coldplay-predicting falsetto like ""Live Forever"", these songs tend to be more yearning and idealistic than is Oasis' general reputation. On the other hand are the cocky, muscular, more uptempo numbers: ""Cigarettes &amp; Alcohol"", ""Roll With It"". Either way, the singles from 1994's <i>Definitely Maybe</i> and 1995's <i>(What's the Story) Morning Glory?</i> still sound like the instantly hummable, immaculately recorded work of outsiders who imagined themselves in their idols' shoes and, for a fleeting moment, convinced millions they just might fit. You're still better off buying the albums.</p>
<p>Since then, Oasis' full-lengths have fallen off sharply, a pattern the singles follow a little imperfectly. For example, while the songs on 1997's <i>Be Here Now</i> are a notch below their predecessors, they're still a cut above most of the tracks that followed; you'll see that here from the deafening helicopter assault of ""D'You Know What I Mean?"", but not so much from the 10-minute ""Hey Jude""/""All You Need Is Love"" orgy of ""All Around the World"". Despite ever-worsening lyrics, the singles from 2000's <i>Standing on the Shoulder of Giants</i> are no longer such disappointments in fuller context. However, the five-- yes, five-- A-sides from 2002's <i>Heathen Chemistr</i>y are absolutely as appalling as you remember. 2005's<i> Don't Believe the Truth</i> offers two rollicking, <i>Highway 61 Revisited</i>-style tracks and one drippy piano ballad, all so-so. <i>Dig Out Your Soul</i> comes off best: Noel-sung ""Falling Down"" fits neither of the two Oasis single categories I've tried to establish here, and it's actually a pretty moving swan song, like ""Setting Sun"" a decade older and wiser.</p>
<p>In a typically unrestrained interview last year with the <i>Sunday Times</i>, Noel admitted that ""I don't fucking know"" what ""Champagne Supernova"" means. ""But are you telling me, when you've got 60,000 people singing it, they don't know what it means?"" he asked. ""It means something different to every one of them."" With Liam already prepping his next band-- called, of all things, Beady Eye-- a bit of Oasis nostalgia is probably inevitable. These singles will mean something different to everyone, but the question is whether they will mean anything to a generation that doesn't already remember them fondly. Here's betting a few of them will. Oasis' view of pop stardom was confining, it's true, but their fatal flaw wasn't wanting to communicate with the masses-- it was their eventual <i>failure</i> to communicate. They were only human, after all.</p></div>"|14392.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14392-time-flies/|6.0|Marc Hogan

He had a point, of course. After a short burst of enchanting indie pop albums by Belle and Sebastian, Camera Obscura, the Boy Least Likely To, and many others in the mid-2000s, a cutesy sensibility has gone on to conquer the box office (Michael Cera, Zooey Deschanel) and the <i>Billboard</i> charts (Owl City). Faced with so much mainstream success, an anti-twee backlash was probably inevitable.</p>
<p>Sure enough, the last couple of years have seen the Lucksmiths break up, Los Campesinos! say <i>adios</i> to their glockenspiels, and Jens Lekman fall oh so silent. Younger indie poppers like the Pains of Being Pure at Heart and Vivian Girls ramp up the rickety distortion, while Swedish labels like Labrador, Service, and Sincerely Yours have expanded indie pop's sonic and conceptual palette far beyond C86 and Sarah Records. No-frills twee-pop definitely never went away, but few new bands lately have resonated much beyond the scene.</p>
<p>Say hello to Allo Darlin': a welcome reminder that any aversion to cutesy music in recent years may have been due not to the aesthetic, but the quality. The London-based foursome are firmly in the tradition of classic indie pop: Australian-born, ukulele-strumming singer Elizabeth Morris also plays in Tender Trap, the current band of Amelia Fletcher, an icon since her years in Talulah Gosh, Heavenly, and Marine Research, while bassist Bill Botting has backed former Hefner frontman Darren Hayman. The 10 songs on Allo Darlin's self-titled debut album, out in the UK on Fortuna Pop!, don't rewrite the formula for wistful bedsit charm as much as show that it can still be carried out masterfully.</p>
<p>Rather than the cloying infantilism of some twee bands, <i>Allo Darlin'</i> focuses its tunefulness on the simple pleasures and modest melancholies of young adulthood. With a flute solo and a John Hughes-inspired video, ""The Polaroid Song"" tackles wistful nostalgia but also sets the album's tone: ""Feel like dancing on my own/ To a record that I do not know/ In a place I've never seen before."" On ""Silver Dollars"", with chords strikingly reminiscent of Lekman's ""Black Cab"", Morris questions her career path and hopes one more gin and tonic will convince her romantic interest to leave with her at the end of the night. ""Kiss Your Lips"" ba-bas like <i>Grease</i> about salty-sweet kisses and Weezer's ""El Scorcho"", ""Let's Go Swimming"" puts Mazzy Star sinuousness behind imagery of a perfect day that ""all the hipsters in Shoreditch couldn't style,"" and ""Heartbeat Chili"" quotes Johnny Cash's ""Ring of Fire"" for a kitchen-sink love story with fewer culinary accidents than Lekman's ""Your Arms Around Me"", but all of the sweetness.</p>
<p>The references continue-- a neurotic lover is no ""Woody Allen""; a sensitive outcast in ""If Loneliness Was Art"" necessitates a mention of UK peers the Just Joans-- but as with the best pop, the overall effect more than justifies any clever borrowing. ""My Heart Is a Drummer"" rejects the notion of guilty pleasures over a chorus to which you can sing ""Girls Just Wanna Have Fun"". Opener ""Dreaming"", featuring a baritone vocal from Pipettes founder Monster Bobby, plays like an urbane update of Heavenly boy-girl duet ""C Is the Heavenly Option"". Which reminds me: In a year when the Hold Steady released a song about a seminal indie pop band, the twee sensibility doesn't really appear to be on the decline-- no matter how many how many jerks have twitchy knees. More likely, it's just getting started.</p></div>"|14354.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14354-allo-darlin/|7.9|Marc Hogan

The all-hook heir to ""There She Goes"" (""Hey Girl""), the heady disco rush of ""Valentine"", and even ""Hooray"" are the sort of songs with slam-dunk choruses that could move a million copies of Delays' deceptively consistent albums-- most of which would then immediately be found in used CD bins, a smaller percentage treasured by a loyal bunch of Anglophiles. Instead, it feels like they're reintroducing themselves with every album, and on <i>Star Tiger Star Ariel</i>, the strain to come on as strong as possible shows more than ever.</p>
<p>The fatal flaw of their previous album-- the overly saccharine <i>Everything's the Rush-- </i>was overstating their case as a pop band. Naturally then, <i>Star Tiger </i>goes in the opposite direction, overstating the case for Delays as a <i>rock </i>band. Of course, ""rock"" is used in a relative sense, and it's silly to deny a band the pleasures of playing louder than ever before.  But the mashed drums and gunmetal guitar tones of their balls-out title track and riff-heavy ""Shanghaied"" don't mesh well with a band whose strength lies in feminizing its sound. Greg Gilbert's voice remains astonishing-- gritty in its lower registers, capable in falsetto-- and it gives <i>Star Tiger </i>its best moments. ""May 45"" might be atypically dark from a lyrical standpoint, vaguely evoking WWII and the debilitation of age, but as Gilbert's rangiest vocal, the chorus builds to the record's peak of rapture. Unsurprisingly, the climax is wordless.</p>
<p>Duncan Lewis, who produced the band's career peak, <i>Faded Seaside Glamour,</i> works the boards here but does so without maintaining that record's charming, hand-crafted sound. Where their debut was sun-kissed, the gleaming corporate rock production leaves too much of <i>Star Tiger</i> feeling over-baked and impersonal. The sequencing drives this point even further-- between the blindingly polished ""Shanghaied"" and ""Unsung"", the admittedly gushy ""Rhapsody"" and ""May 45"" hitch themselves to Gilbert's falsetto and soar.  And while the gentle­ ""Find a Home (New Forest Shaker)"" initially sounds like a letdown as an opener, it sets the tone for what might have been a wiser direction from the band; for the first time in their career, their ballads hold up best.</p></div>"|14391.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14391-star-tiger-star-ariel/|5.7|Ian Cohen

In recent decades in particular, musicians have long spent time building on the post-punk era, then the 1980s. Lately, it's the 1990s' turn to be pillaged as young bands take a second look at the lo-fi sounds, synth-based R&amp;B, and straight-ahead indie rock sounds that were the cutting edge less than 20 years ago. So what do you do if you're a band slugging it out in indie rock clubs that was actually a part of that 1990s sound people are returning to? They may not have asked themselves that specific question, but Jason McNeely and Dan Matz have answered it anyway by revisiting some old sounds themselves on <i>Against Love</i>, their eighth album as the leaders of Windsor for the Derby.</p>
<p>They released their debut, <i>Calm Hades Float</i>, in 1996, and it was mostly an ambient/drone record. I still listen to it occasionally, and it sounds good, though very much of its era-- there's a texture to the sound that characterized most mid-fi indie rock before digital recording setups became commonplace. It's a roughness they'd mostly moved away from over the last decade, building their albums around more traditional-ish songs as they developed the band, and relegating the ambient aspect of their work to a handful of tracks spread across each record. <i>Against Love</i> doesn't really mess with that format much, but from a sonic standpoint, it's a move to reconcile their recent direction with their distant past. It shows clearly in the instrumental tracks, which serve mostly as connective tissue but nonetheless lend the album much of its character. ""Moon Shadows"", positioned almost exactly at the album's midpoint, could practically be a <i>Calm Hades Float</i> outtake, with its deep, swelling loop of a drone. The album also begins and ends with snippets of scraping drone that sounds culled from the same recording.</p>
<p>The vocal songs are mostly quiet and reflective: ""Cursed Ages"" backs its vocal with a repetitive guitar figure and rolling toms, but it's when the Krautrock-y keyboards come in that it really starts to feel like it would have fit in 15 years ago. ""Autumn Song"" similarly looks back, with its heaving guitar, downplayed vocal, and static harmony. Some songs do keep things cleaner: ""Our Love's a Calamity""  is among the band's lightest songs to date, with its sing-song organ part and unison singing on the chorus. The steel guitar on ""Dull Knives"" is similarly bright, but the song itself feels like an exhausted relative of Mojave 3 or even Luna.</p>
<p>The album's tendencies-- toward revisiting the band's earlier, less polished sound and toward clean, clear, and understated songs-- lend <i>Against Love</i> a certain disunity. It's interesting that the band revisits some of its old methods, but the integration isn't quite total. The album's seams don't detract from the quality of the individual pieces, however, and it seems likely that in an iTunes world, different listeners will find themselves gravitating to one of the two sides the band displays here. It'll be interesting to see whether the band continues back toward the loop-based approach on its next album and what it yields.</p></div>"|14360.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14360-against-love/|6.9|Joe Tangari

Pt. II </i>isn't a particularly faithful sequel. It didn't share its predecessor's plot points or characters; at best, it was a similar story refracted through the prism of the current economy. The original <i>Cuban Linx </i>was informed by the flush, Clinton-era times and played out like cinema, nothing but fantastical personalities, desperate optimism, and opulence. But <i>Pt. II'</i>s drug raps were crushingly realistic and bleak, survival the only reward in sight.</p>
<p>So, if nothing else, it's strange to hear Raekwon... well, really enjoying himself on <i>Cocainism, Vol. 2 </i>(as of now, a <i>Vol. 1 </i>cannot be located). The more upbeat <i>Cocainism </i>is a ""rapper's rapper"" mixtape, a display of Raekwon's oft-overlooked, masterful technique. Strangely, Rae's usually more animated cohort Ghostface shows up only in spirit-- ""Ms. Sincere"" is pure wisdom body sweet talk, and the uncomfortably graphic ""Lizz"" is about as close as Raekwon will likely get to his own ""Stapleton Sex"". Instead, it's Alchemist who provides most of the levity, as ""Big Beat"" serves up classic breaks from Billy Squier and Mark Ronson, while ""Wallys &amp; Pringles"" is damn near a tribute to Fast Rap.</p>
<p>But within <i>Cocainism</i>'s 20 tracks, Rae occasionally flashes the sort of hardscrabble conscience that kept <i>Pt. II </i> street level.  ""Keep On"" is the kind of track most fans would likely prefer he go nowhere near-- the beat is polished for Hot 97 display, the hook supplied by someone intended to sound like Akon. But the subject matter remains unapologetically grim as it observes two victims of drug-related tragedy, the first a stick-up kid whose stray bullet turned into a prison lifer, the second a humble, hardworking African cabdriver stabbed up by his coked-up wife. In a crushing detail, Rae mentions in a tossed-off aside how he would often serve as their chauffeur for pickups.</p>
<p><i>Cocainism </i>runs a bit ragged by the end (""Do It in the Park"" and ""Piss in the Shark Tank"" fail to live up to the enormous promise of their titles), even if it avoids some of the more serious mixtape pitfalls. For back-end mixtape rappers, Mean Doe Green and Tommy Nova acquit themselves quite nicely and the bigger names are well-selected; Mobb Deep have rarely sounded more committed as a group recently than they do on ""Road to Riches"", and while Noreaga mostly embarrasses himself trying out a <i>Blueprint 3 </i>flow on ""Slow Down"", he's redeemed by a TMZ-timely punchline: ""We get it poppin' like LeBron James' mom (Delonte West, you foul!)."" Sure, it'd be nice for there to be some sort of unifying thread to <i>Cocainism </i>that could elevate it to elite status, but as anyone who's sat through <i>Immobilarity </i>or can name more than two members of the Ice H20 crew can attest, it's relief enough that Rae is capable of a damn solid rap album working outside of his <i>Cuban Linx </i>franchise.</p></div>"|14358.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14358-cocainism-vol-2/|7.6|Ian Cohen

If an album proves unique, we celebrate it. And then that album makes us think all the more scrupulously about the system it happened to jam. Actress's <i>Splazsh</i> is one of those albums. Actress-- a DJ/producer from London named Darren Cunningham-- slots into a recognizable realm of artists working in the wake of dubstep. But little, if anything, in his sound shares much with dubstep as it's most often understood. His bass isn't very big, his snares don't crack in isolation, his atmospheres don't heave in the air of cavernous negative-space.</p>
<p>So what's the link? A certain formal seriousness and rigor-- a sense of tracks transpiring the way they do for reasons owing to some kind of project, whatever that project (probably rhythmic and arcane) may be. But such talk downplays the many visceral thrills of <i>Splazsh</i>. Even the subtle stuff has an immediate effect: By the end of its sneakily weird eight minutes, opener ""Hubble"" has gently pushed the album into a sort of spinning motion that speeds up and slows down, but never quite stops. The slow-motion speed lets Actress throw in an array of sounds he'll sort through in time: woozy ambient waves, dry drums, crazy lasers, a slow synth arpeggio that sounds lifted from some old grainy sci-fi movie.</p>
<p>And so <i>Splazsh</i> keeps spinning, even as it moves through floaty dreamscapes strewn with sighs and chimes (""Lost"") and austere breakbeat abstractions (""Get Ohn [Fairlight Mix]""). There's almost nothing that ties such disparate tracks together, except for <i>everything</i>. And that <i>everything</i> owes to the simultaneous sense of adventure and control that has made Actress one of the most intriguing electronic-music makers at work today.</p>
<p>Actress himself has called his music ""R&amp;B concrète,"" and that helps illuminate the way he works from both inside and outside a track. He has an ear for building up a song from the bottom (like a pop producer) and then abstracting it from the top (like a <i>musique concrète</i> technician), so that he makes some incredibly strange sounds surprisingly palatable-- and without making a big show of their strangeness. In that, Actress shares a certain allegiance with post-dubstep artists like Zomby (who has made records for the label that Actress runs, Werk Discs). But there's a range of hooks and ideas at play in <i>Splazsh</i> that few others have approached, much less made coherent.</p></div>"|14375.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14375-splazsh/|8.3|Andy Battaglia

The most important thing is that over the course of about a dozen albums with Sixteen Horsepower and Wovenhand, he's never been a proselytizer. Nor, for that matter, has he been cloyingly worshipful. Instead, he uses Pentecostal language to explore fear, doubt, and uncertainty. These feelings are universal, and the fact that Edwards is able to call on a preacher's fervor to energize his singing has produced some bracing moments on record. That Wovenhand have landed on a label owned by the Danielson Famile makes sense.</p>
<p>Sixteen Horsepower was an interesting band for the way it drew mostly American folk traditions into an aggressive, modern sound. Wovenhand, which began as a side project and lately includes fellow Horsepower founder Pascal Humbert on bass, draws a little more expansively on folk traditions. On <i>The Threshingfloor</i>, the band's sixth studio album, you'll hear traces of Indian, Celtic, and Middle Eastern folk mixed in with the rock band setup and Anglo-Appalachian murder ballad templates. The title track is a great example of all these things coming together. The drums swipe at Edwards as he wails, occasionally slipping out of English to sing in a language I can't identify, and the guitar in the instrumental break sounds modeled on Arabic oud music. Many songs have a static chord structure or central drone that lends them a hypnotic quality.</p>
<p>The album's least successful moments generally come when Edwards restrains himself too much with vocal filters, placing a layer of studio interference between himself and you as he sings about Ezekiel. For instance, it keeps the otherwise propulsive ""Denver City"" from fully hitting home. One exception is ""His Rest"", which is one of the most unpretentiously beautiful things Edwards has ever had his hands on. The surprisingly light touch of his singing and the unmoored chord progression infuse the mostly acoustic song a sense of intense longing a million miles away from the fire and fear of something like ""Terre Haute"", with its flailing Celtic flute, fractured drumming, and frantic vocal.</p>
<p>At its best, this album is charged with the fiery spark that makes Edwards so compelling, and it finds both the beauty and ugliness in that. At its worst, it's still enjoyable, if less memorable. Wovenhand have a very well-defined aesthetic at this point, so if you're familiar with the band's past work, you know basically what to expect on <i>The Threshingfloor</i>. If you're not familiar, you might consider looking back to <i>Blush Music</i> or <i>Consider the Birds</i> as a starting point for a worthwhile band that has carved itself a unique niche in the indie rock world.</p></div>"|14332.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14332-the-threshingfloor/|7.3|Joe Tangari

On their debut album, the Constellations have entrusted themselves with the formidable task of redefining a city that's already been famously rendered by artists ranging from Little Feat to OutKast. Not only is the revolving-door collective an amalgam of players from Atlanta's rock, soul, and hip-hop scenes, their album <i>Southern Gothic</i> (released independently in 2008 before receiving this major-label reissue) was envisioned as a travelogue to Atlanta after hours, presenting a nocturnal netherworld of sex, violence, and intoxication. Now, I should note that, aside from a couple of layovers at Hartsfield-Jackson, I've never been to Atlanta. Unfortunately, after listening to <i>Southern Gothic</i>, I still don't really feel like I have.</p>
<p>Recorded back when the Constellations were mostly a studio collaboration between singer Elijah Jones, Gnarls Barkley producer Ben H. Allen, and multi-instrumentalist Devin Donnelly (the band has since expanded into a eight-man group), <i>Southern Gothic</i> wastes no time in establishing its ambitious scope with the psychedelic scene-setter ""Setback"", which frames Jones' streetwise, Beck-ian babble with splendorous synth lines and a monster go-go groove. It's an impressive opener that effectively sets up the magic-realist intent of the project-- but it's a balance of grit and grandeur that <i>Southern Gothic</i> rarely recaptures.</p>
<p>The Constellations' Southern-rock/gospel/electro/soul melting-pot sound feels too temperate and polished to properly complement the unsavory narratives playing out in the songs, which often come off like the work of a mildly eccentric bar band that wants you to think it's wild and dangerous. (You know something's amiss when Asher Roth's fake-Slim-Shady routine on ""We're Here to Save the Day"" pops out more than the muted Cee-Lo monologue on ""Love Is a Murder"".) And Jones' attempts at character-sketch vignettes are undermined by pat barstool philosophy like, ""You've got to take it to the limit,"" and, ""If you really want to live, you gotta be ready to die,"" or tired metaphors comparing life's struggles to the changing weather (""December""). Even worse is how ""Felicia"" squanders its tough Hammond-organ strut on a cringe-worthy chorus that actually pays its prostitute protagonist the Chad Kroegerian compliment of being ""so sexy when you're working on your knees, girl.""</p>
<p>But the Constellations are nothing if not shameless, willing as they are to directly invoke the granddaddy of observational underbelly storytelling, Tom Waits, by appropriating his 1976 crazed-salesman spiel ""Step Right Up"" as the basis for a rubbery nine-minute disco workout. The fact that Jones brazenly adopts a low-end Waitsian warble actually benefits the song, allowing him to convey the dive-bar scenery of Atlanta's Clermont Lounge with a detached sense of humor, rather than trying to oversell the seediness. And as ""Step Right Up"" reaches its conga-funk climax, you get a genuine sense of the late-night abandon the Constellations were trying to capture all along. Perhaps on future recordings, the Constellations' current full-band formation will yield more moments like these-- songs that feel less like brushstroke caricatures of a place and more like lived-in experiences of one.</p></div>"|14382.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14382-southern-gothic/|4.4|Stuart Berman

Von Wagner writes more than a few clunkers on ""MSG"", and ""Babel"" opens with perhaps the most mind-bogglingly obvious line this year: ""There's been trouble on the Gaza Strip."" Generally, though, he thrives in the different settings on <i>Martian's Bloom</i></span><span>, adapting gracefully to the twisty Afropop bounce of ""Holy Rain"" as well as to the country drawl of ""Seesaw Love"". He strains and oversings at times, but part of his aesthetic is pushing himself and his instrument to extremes. The only time he's not convincing is on ""Choo Choo Train to Venice"", a revved-up Crampsy number whose grating din sounds wholly out of place on the album-- more a stunt than a song. Plus, the words ""choo-choo train"" sound especially asinine coming out of Von Wagner's mouth. </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span>With that voice out front and center, the other musicians in Linfinity could be expected to hang back and remain unobtrusive, complementing his performance and assuming nobody's going to pay attention to them anyway. With the erudition of the Bad Seeds and the rawness of the Dirty Three, they provide the nuance and dynamic that Von Wagner cannot and lend local flare to these globe-trotting songs, which range from the swamps of the South to the deserts of the Middle East. Guitarist Josh Collins in particular proves an apt foil for Von Wagner, dogging the singer's vocal melodies and slicing against his notes menacingly. Together, their best moment may be ""Molly Mar of Rome"", which moves from slow and soft to loud and clangorous in a few short minutes. Von Wagner slowly deconstructs his lyrics until he's singing wordlessly, and the band builds to a climactic push that feels earned and unrestrained. The downside to Linfinity's ambitious range, however, is a tendency toward musical tourism; <i>Martian's Bloom</i></span><span> sounds a bit too willfully studious and diverse, and therefore scattershot. On the other hand, it does what a good debut should: it suggests that the band could go absolutely anywhere from here.</span></p>

The Toronto act, now entering their second decade, have built a reputation on filtering tragedies of the heart through a widescreen lens, most excellently on 2004's <i>Set Yourself on Fire</i>. Even 2007's theatrical <i>In Our Bedroom After the War </i>exquisitely mired itself in misery, sounding more like 13 takes on the Smiths' ""Last Night I Dreamt That Somebody Loved Me"" than the original cast recording of <i>Gypsy</i>.</p>
<p>Simply put, then: They know bombast and melodrama, which makes a decent amount of their latest effort, <i>The Five Ghosts</i>, all the more off-putting. For the first time in the band's career, they sound defeated. There's not much urgency, or even a range of emotion, for that matter; rather, much of the record blurs together, forming a single streak of gray. Telling, too, that the more upbeat cuts are the highlights. ""I Died So I Could Haunt You"" and ""How Much More"" both deserve a place among Stars' best work, with the latter working itself into a serene build that sounds like a thousand rockets taking off all at once.</p>
<p>Otherwise, this is a sluggish record, and a good deal of the blame rests on the production. The mix seems so muddy and poorly executed that you have to wonder who signed off on this stuff. ""Fixed"" may sound like it's intended to be this album's ""Ageless Beauty"", but where that song's shoegazed guitars burned brightly, here the buzzy melody ends up sounding as neutered as the song title suggests. The more dynamic instrumental lines are frequently buried in the mix at the expense of bringing out Torquil Campbell and Amy Millan's voices. Campbell aims for an overdue cathartic wail near the end of ""He Dreams He's Awake"" but slams into a mess of tangled vocals and drums. At his best, Campbell's always been a charmingly corny vocalist; not allowing him his hammy release here takes away his greatest strength as a performer.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, though, the middling sound ends up benefitting Millan's vocal performances greatly, affording her breathy coo the bright glow that it's been missing throughout the band's career. On previous releases, her voice has acted as not much more than a pretty-sounding foil for Campbell's, but on this record's best cuts, she sounds like a true frontwoman. She hugs the mid-tempo melodies of ""Wasted Daylight"" and ""How Much More"" tightly. Millan also is featured on the album's finest moment, ""Changes"". Her voice burns with patient regret, as the rest of the band finds their shimmering sweet spot and turns what, in another act's hands, could've been a dull, drum-machined shuffler into the Canadian indie-pop equivalent of Fleetwood Mac's ""Storms"". Stars may spend most of <i>The Five Ghosts</i> resembling sonic equivalents of the album title, but ""Changes"" is all flesh and blood, as well as a suggestion that, even after 10 years, this band ain't quite dead yet.</p></div>"|14349.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14349-the-five-ghosts/|5.7|Larry Fitzmaurice

To mention John Zorn, Lou Reed, and Philip Glass only glosses her collaborations with the American avant-garde. She's also crossed over in interesting and unexpected ways, whether voicing a singing tot in <i>The Rugrats Movie</i><i>,</i> or hitting #2 on the 1981 UK Singles Chart with ""O Superman (For Massenet)"", a doomsday anthem combining the vocoder with an aria from <i>Le Cid</i>. That angelic, robotic voice is often reprised on <i>Homeland</i>, her first new album in a decade, which fans will welcome as an heir to her definitive performance piece, <i>United States</i>. It's also a perfect starting point; an exquisite state-of-the-union dispatch as only Anderson,  America's darkly comic conscience, can provide.</p>
<p>A songful yet distressed Neo-Romantic mode anchors forays into techno, jazz, drone, and minimal electronics. Top-notch guests like Zorn, Antony, and Kieran Hebden add their unique perspectives to Anderson's probing keyboards and violins. The music is spacious, mercurial, and thoroughly conceived. Anderson's vocals hover between speech and song, polemics and poetry, apocalyptic and redemptive fervors. And that's as far as generalizations will go. <i>Homeland </i>teems with the same variety and sprit as the U.S. itself.</p>
<p>These songs have been developing live for years, so naturally, Iraq and Wall Street loom large. The persistence of those quandaries makes the material feel timely, even oracular, a quality for which Anderson is known. ""O Superman"" gained fresh attention after 9-11 for its images of American planes drawing ominously nearer. (On a lighter note, its vocals predicted everything from Imogen Heap's ""Hide and Seek"" to the ongoing Auto-Tune craze.) She's still broadcasting from the day after tomorrow. The organic house track ""Only an Expert"" schematically details the hubris of authorities who consolidate power by creating problems only they can solve. Had the album been delayed a little longer, a verse about the BP oil leak would have fit perfectly alongside the global warming controversy and the banking bailout.</p>
<p>""Only an Expert"" makes a pervasive, subtle theme momentarily explicit: How shared illusions about security and plenitude perpetuate a predictable cycle of cultural, environmental, and existential crises. But this threatens to make the album sound punitive, when somehow, Anderson's wrath feels compassionate. As ""Falling"" would have it, ""Americans, unrooted, blow with the wind/ But they feel the truth if it touches them."" It's confrontational <i>and</i> beautiful, the grim tidings leavened with empathetic portraiture. ""Transitory Life"" is haunting and cunningly crafted. When Anderson sings that her dead grandmother ""made herself a bed inside my ear/ Every night I hear,"" the Tuvan throat singer from the song's intro reappears, the formless cries suddenly given a narrative role.</p>
<p>But the epic ""Another Day in America"" is the album's huge, dark heart. Anderson's voice is pitched down and slowed-- she becomes her character on the cover, a slapstick figure of male authority-- over lingering strings and keyboards. The oration is a vortex of visionary proclamations, pointed fables, downbeat jokes. It makes palpable not only all the pathos and superstition of the American psyche, but the weight of time passing away-- another diminishing resource. Every malfunction of the status quo, Anderson implies, is a chance to start over, instead of rushing to rebuild what always breaks down. Her pessimism might not be comforting, but as oil continues to poison the Gulf of Mexico, it feels awfully prescient.</p></div>"|14317.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14317-homeland/|8.3|Brian Howe

Prior to signing, Chesnutt had been an Athens, Ga., fixture, recording with Michael Stipe and writing off-the-cuff songs about locals in the audience. His four albums on Texas Hotel Records had gained him a cult audience that culminated in <i>Sweet Relief II: Gravity of the Situation (The Songs of Vic Chesnutt)</i>, a benefit album featuring R.E.M., Sparklehorse, Smashing Pumpkins, and Mary Margaret O'Hara. That tribute introduced Chesnutt to a wider audience, and <i>About to Choke</i>, released just a few months afterward, promised to build on that buzz.</p>
<p>Rather than another like <i>Drunk</i> or <i>Is the Actor Happy?</i>, which featured full-band arrangements and some of his most direct songwriting, <i>About to Choke</i> was ""a lonely kind of deal,"" he told <i>The Onion</i>'s <i>A.V. Club</i> in 1998. It mostly featured Chesnutt accompanying himself on guitar, piano, and a Yamaha Portasound PSS-480. It was dark, death-obsessed, and the only potential singles were a country-leaning song about small-town gentrification that might be a paean or a parody and another played on the keyboard's factory settings. Chesnutt wasn't trying to be difficult or disagreeable; he was simply torn between making an album that might appeal to a major label and making one that remained true to his previous records-- i.e., that didn't sound like a sell-out. Hence the title.</p>
<p>Upon its release, <i>About to Choke</i> received faint-praise reviews, and Capitol inevitably passed on releasing his follow-up. Fourteen years later, Plain Recordings' barebones reissue depicts a very curious entry in Chesnutt's tragically truncated catalog. To a certain extent, it's his final solo album, as almost all of his subsequent efforts were marked by creative collaborations that threw his unique talents into sharp relief. Even with that particular distinction, <i>About to Choke</i> is not among his best albums. There are moments that reveal an artist who's both prickly and personable. ""Swelters"" and ""New Town"" contain some of his warmest vocals ever laid down to tape, and opener ""Myrtle"" offers a crucial, comical self-assessment: ""A funny pilgrim on a crazy crusade,"" Chesnutt sings, savoring the consonance and alliteration, ""a saucy Chaucer, a sorry chapter mislaid.""</p>
<p>After the sly Portasound epic ""Little Vacation"", during which he solos masterfully on mouth trumpet, <i>About to Choke</i> actually chokes. Alternating between spectrally spare arrangements and jarringly loud accompaniment, it sounds fragmented, with no thematic or musical throughline threading the songs together. ""Hot Seat"" sounds like an unfinished demo, a rough draft of a song but without the spontaneity, and ""Threads"" unravels as Chesnutt worries over the image of ""Krishna beads in a lockbox safe."" He manages to salvage side two with the strummy seven-minute ""See You Around"", a fitting sign-off and a promise that he'd survive whatever professional setback this album represented.</p>
<p>While it may have received more attention than any previous album before and most since, <i>About to Choke</i> remains arguably his least popular, his least regarded, his least played. But it has aged well-- certainly better than <i>Sweet Relief II</i>-- primarily because Chesnutt never took advantage of the major-label resources. He more or less made the same album he would have made if he'd stayed on Texas Hotel. That is to say, he made a characteristically loopy album: dense with wry wordplay, spare with arrangements, and dark with self-reckoning.</p></div>"|14370.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14370-about-to-choke-reissue/|7.5|Stephen M.

But lately I've enjoyed how Washed Out (Georgia), Toro Y Moi (South Carolina), and Surfer Blood (Florida) have repped the South, proving that sounds like these are possible even when you've got good weather and reasonable rent. Viernes, hailing from the artsy Orlando exurb of Winter Park, are an even better test case. I imagine most people would classify them as dream pop, but what makes this album such a strikingly individual debut is how qualities like lucidity and compositional rigor cut against those parameters. Alberto Hernandez and Sean Moore, the duo behind Viernes (the band now tours as a trio), aren't afraid to drift and float, but they do so with complete control.</p>
<p>After the languid piano and synth snare opener of ""Glass Windows"", ""Sinister Love"" begins meekly, a couple of strangely harmonized ""doot-doot""'s and thrumming bass giving no hint of the lift-off to come. But from there on out, the record is an unpredictable series of expansions and contractions. The title of ""Sinister Love"" is the only discernible lyric, but it's indicative of the unsettling melody swooping in between runs of piano too nimble for human hands. ""Entire Empire"" is cut from the same cloth, but is more in tune with the overwhelming bliss of shoegaze. While the intent of the vocals remains vague (the title is again repeated throughout; these guys aren't much for elaboration), the melancholy harmonies cut against the overwhelming optimism of the beauty of the music.</p>
<p>Though ""Sinister Love"" and ""Entire Empire"" are <i>Sinister Devices</i>' undeniable peaks, that might just be a matter of sequencing. Free-form instrumentals ""Enhanced Pendulum Channel"" and ""Liquid Tunnel"" have an oxidized beauty to them, but Side B of <i>Devices</i> tends to lean on that particular sound a bit too much. ""Faulty Investments"" is a relatively spare, melodically tart piano piece reminiscent of Field Music, and

while the prominence of its vocals makes it something of an awkward fit, the tension it creates with its obscure surroundings makes it the back half's standout.</p>
<p>More often than not, Viernes find a balance between gossamer and grit. The textures of ""Regressive Soul Pollution"" are rich and considered as a guitar evokes both autoharp and gong, while ""Honest Parade"", a synth curlicue evoking older M83 emanating from stormy distortion, flexes similar muscles. These two tracks from the more abstract end of the spectrum, maybe even more than ""Entire Empire"" and ""Sinister Love"", are what make <i>Devices</i> so promising, hinting at what could develop when Viernes grow more comfortable with the idea of themselves as a band.</p></div>"|14361.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14361-sinister-devices/|7.6|Ian Cohen

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Of the many bands that have sprouted from the Grifters, Dragoon may be the most Griftersy of all, building on the soulful lo-fi cacophony of the band's early 1990s material. What's surprising, however, is that Dragoon features neither of the original guitar players or singers. Instead, this is the rhythm section's offshoot: Bass player Tripp Lamkins and drummer Stan Gallimore formed the group with Little Rock native and former Trusty singer Bobby Matthews. The decade-plus since the Grifters went on indefinite hiatus hasn't dulled the musicians' menacing undertow. On Dragoon's debut, <i>The Offending Party, </i>Gallimore still estimates the beat and pounds out emphatic fills, and Lamkins continues to straddle the line between low/rhythmic and high/melodic. At times he's another thudding kick drum, other times another wailing lead guitar. These elements are familiar but welcome, as Dragoon captures the same barely contained chaos, the maelstrom just barely formed into music, as their previous band.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span>Matthews is the new factor in the group, and he simultaneously adds to the scribbly commotion of a song like ""Problemo"" and shapes it into something new. Trusty were briefly signed to Dischord, which explains the hardercore sound on <i>The Offending Party</i>, particularly the declarative rumble of ""Chad's Lament"" and ""Idea Man"". As a singer, he changes his approach on every song, showing off a lowdown howl on opener ""Excuses Excuses"", tiptoeing sneakily on ""I Can Relate"", affecting a mod accent on ""Lugnut"", and declaiming angrily on ""Truce"". Meanwhile, his guitar vies against the rhythm section for supremacy, as if Dragoon is less a band than a knife fight with instruments. ""Problemo"" threatens to fall apart repeatedly, as if Gallimore is sabotaging the groove. But the trio wrestle the song to a proper ending, and its midtempo pace makes it all the more seedily clangorous.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span>Rather than detract from these song

s, that harsh instrumental friction actually enlivens these songs,

distinguishing Dragoon from not only the Grifters and Trusty, but from all their offshoots and acolytes. When the power trio hits the straightaway stretches on ""If You Say So"" and ""Golden Hips"", they sound like their own band, beholden to no particular legacy and anchored squarely in the moment. These 90s refugees aren't living in the past: <i>The Offending Party</i> is worth hearing not simply because the current nostalgia for the last decade's lo-fi has made these musicians suddenly (more) relevant, but mainly because they sound like they haven't missed a beat in years. </span></p>

He roared out of his post-<i>Encore</i> slumber in early 2009 seeming almost puppyishly eager to rap again, spitting verses for anyone who put him in front of a mic with a desperation that suggested he was making up for lost time. <i>Relapse</i>, his 2009 comeback album, found him trying to scratch and claw his way back into the body of 1999-era Slim Shady, but the effect was similar to Metallica trying to revisit their thrash years with 2008's <i>Death Magnetic</i>: The sound was there; the fury, long gone.  No matter how many starlets he tortured and killed in his lyrics, Em couldn't rewrite the intervening years and the enervating effect they've had on his spirit.</p>
<p>So now he's back again, with the follow-up to <i>Relapse</i>, and as its title suggests, <i>Recovery</i> is meant to be triumphant, tracing Em's journey out of depression and drug addiction and back into the peak of his powers. Out of all the depressing aspects of <i>Recovery</i>, the worst is the realization that for listeners the album takes the opposite arc-- the more he motors on about having reclaimed his passion for hip-hop and finally figured out who he is, the more draining the album becomes. Eminem has never really known who he is, which has resulted in one of the most wildly erratic discographies of any major rap artist; at this point, the number of times he's sounded rudderless on record are catching up to the times he's sounded alive. At his best, he has always made a fascinating scramble of his internal turmoil, but the guy rapping on <i>Recovery</i> just sounds devoid of any noticeable joy, personality, or wit.</p>
<p>Not that he's not trying. As on <i>Relapse</i>, Em almost passes out showing us he's still got it, rapping in double and triple time, piling tricky syncopations on top of each other, constructing whole verses with end rhymes buried in the middle of phrases-- basically any kind of pyrotechnical trick he can think of to wow the kind of rap listeners who venerate technical skill above all else. And yet for all the rattling-around-inside-the-beat syllable pileups here, there is almost nothing worth quoting.  He reels off an astonishing amount of cringe-worthy lines, on the order of, ""Girl, shake that ass like a donkey with Parkinson's."" On the menopausal, Diane Warren-esque uplift anthem ""Not Afraid"", he actually strings together the excruciating lines, ""Okay, stop playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap/ I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in a rhythm for you to know it's a wrap.""  Eminem spends nearly half of <i>Recovery</i> insisting he's the best rapper alive, but for the first time in his career, he  actually sounds <i>clumsy</i>.</p>
<p>He can't even coexist meaningfully with a beat-- every producer he works with seems to give him the most attenuated version of their signature sound possible and back away carefully. The liner notes will tell you that <i>Recovery</i> features production by Boi-1DA, Jim Jonsin, DJ Khalil, and Just Blaze along with the usual suspects Mr. Porter and Dre. But your ears will tell you it's the same click track Em's been rapping over since time immemorial-- the only times the beats elbow to the fore are with DJ Khalil's characteristically chunky and unwieldy rap-rock hybrids. Em just sort of drifts through these productions, as haunted and disembodied a presence as 2Pac on a posthumous release.</p>
<p>The only winning moment on the record comes early, with ""Talkin' 2 Myself"", where Em admits he contemplated dissing Kanye and Lil Wayne out of jealousy. ""Thank god that I didn't do it-- I'd have had my ass handed to me,"" he raps, in a rare moment of wry honesty. The climax of the song sees him shouting out Wayne, Kanye, and T.I. in a show of solidarity, but the truth is Em doesn't even inhabit the same universe as these guys. He lives in a world all his own, and for the most part, that world doesn't allow for visitors. When Wayne shows up on ""No Love"", a po-faced duet built on a sample of Haddaway's ""What Is Love"",  the point is hammered home-- the two rappers' verses don't even seem to belong to the same song. Marshall has never played all that comfortably or well with others, but here his solipsism is so overwhelming it negates whoever or whatever else is going on around him. He sucks the air out of the room just by stepping into it.</p></div>"|14380.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14380-recovery/|2.8|Jayson Greene

Those words from Jay-Z's <i>Black Album</i> sounded like expert politicking; Jay was paying tribute to a lauded veteran while justifying his own flossier tendencies at the same time. It made Jay more human and Common more revered. That was in 2003. Now, it's tough to imagine Jay saying those same words.</p>
<p>Though he's two years older than Com, Jay-Z has clung onto relevancy thanks to an uncanny understanding of the grand gesture and ruthless ambition. Com has stayed productive since 2003, too, but his importance in the realm of hip-hop has been damaged by a middling acting career, one awful album (2008's <i>Universal Mind Control</i>), and the fact that the guy principally responsible for his 21st-century comeback, Kanye West, also renders him somewhat obsolete. Considering their unbalanced tally of hits, it's odd that Jay is just now readying his first U.S. greatest hits package for release this summer while <i>Go! Common Classics </i>is Com's second highlights compilation. It focuses largely on tracks made from 2005's <i>Be</i> forward, while 2007's <i>Thisisme Then: The Best of Common</i> compiled highlights from most of his 90s work.</p>
<p><i>Go!</i> starts off with Common's biggest hit, the Dilla-produced masterpiece ""The Light"". Its earthy take on love puts Com's sensitive-boyfriend side to the fore and generally sets the tone for the first half of the comp. This might make sense commercially-- <i>Go!</i>'s release is ostensibly timed to coincide with his new romantic comedy, <i>Just Wright</i>, which I won't watch ever-- but it's an artistic blunder. However socially respectable, Common's female-targeted tracks of the last decade are clunky at best. Whether hopelessly cheesy (""Come Close""), uncomfortably sensual (""I Want You""), or just plain corny (the lone new track, ""Next Time"", a <i>Just Wright </i>tie-in), it's hard to believe any of his come-on tactics would work in even the drunkest of over-30 clubs.</p>
<p>Better is the second side, largely produced by Kanye and featuring Common's righteous-motivator guise. While Kanye used his solo career to experiment and push buttons during the last decade, the majority of his more traditional, soul-flecked beats went to his one-time rival Chicago MC. (By the end of the decade, West seemed to lose interest in his original style entirely-- hence Com's Neptunes-guided brick <i>Universal Mind Control</i>.) West's sample-based strategy worked perfectly with his friend's old-soul demeanor. Successes like ""The Corner"", ""The People"", and ""Southside"" sound chunky, raw, and grown. On those tracks, Common uses his natural affability and attention to detail to connect with the urban everyday. Though he came up in the 90s, Com has an old-school heart-- he still break dances and offers freestyles that sound genuinely spontaneous in concert. And Common nailed his thirtysomething style with 2005's <i>Be</i>, a warm wonder that's a lot more rewarding than this disc.</p>
<p>Here's another trip down memory lane: ""Rap career is over, better off acting."" That's Common ripping into Ice Cube on the classic 1996 dis track ""The Bitch in Yoo"". It's the oldest song on <i>Go!</i> and doubles as a dubious closer considering the contrasting positivity and votive-candle vibes happening elsewhere.</p>
<p>There's no doubt that Common is an important influence on today's mainstream hip-hop-- B.o.B.'s recent smash ""Nothin' on You"" often comes off like a slicked-up version of ""The Light"", and, generally speaking, soft is the new hard-- but it's also increasingly apparent that he may go down as more of a transitional or prescient figure. (Across his 18-year career, Common has had zero Top 40 solo hits.) In the grand scheme, his legacy may be best defined by his award-show-tantrum-prone progeny, who took Com's penchant for wicked wordplay and warm understanding and added a helping of senseless, stadium-rising panache. Kanye as we know him would not exist without Common. And, as flimsy and unnecessary as it is, this late-period highlight reel isn't fathomable without Kanye.</p></div>"|14379.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14379-go-common-classics/|4.5|Ryan Dombal

The band named itself for a complicated manual for scoring games of cricket, and all of its songs were about the sport. It's a goofy concept, but their album was charming and fun, even if (like me) you rarely had a clue what they were singing about. That side project was basically a lark, but it exemplified the key to Hannon's long-term success as the Divine Comedy: He's dead serious about having a good time. His ability to pivot quickly from singing jokes with an arched eyebrow to an unironic meditation on death or a favorite cultural icon is unparalleled. And he approaches it all with a sense of unbridled melodrama that sometimes makes the humor hard to separate from the serious musing.</p>
<p>It works for a few reasons. The most basic is that he has a great voice, and he backs it up with uncanny musical smarts-- the man knows how to arrange a song. But beyond that, he makes good records because he's not afraid to look silly, and therefore he doesn't pull any punches in his songwriting. If he's got a stupid pun in mind, he goes with it and doesn't apologize. He combines that with a foppish image that makes him out to be the hippest square in the room, and it all comes together to put Hannon in his own little pop music niche. <i>Bang Goes the Knighthood</i> is his ninth album as the Divine Comedy, and it gives listeners the kind of trip they can get only from him.</p>
<p>For instance, even as a long-time fan, I approached ""At the Indie Disco"" with caution-- the title looks like a recipe for stained social commentary-- but the song turns out to be the kind of tribute to a subculture that makes you feel like Hannon is actually part of it. He references 10 bands (some directly and others more coyly), and wraps the scene portrait around a real story about two friends who've entered that ambiguous ""are we going out?"" phase in their relationship. Here's him thinking about her on the bus ride home: ""I think of her and I sing the words to my favorite song/ She makes my heart beat the same way/ As at the start of 'Blue Monday'/ Always the last song that they play."" The music even has echoes of 90s indie dance music.</p>
<p>On the jokier end of things, ""The Complete Banker"" is a pretty unvarnished, sarcastic takedown of a straw banker, who is unabashedly greedy, and shruggingly asks, ""If I say I'm sorry, will you give me the money?"" It could be didactic if it didn't marry so well to the barrelhouse bounce of the music-- the easy way the verse melts into the chorus could be used as an example in a songwriting master class. It doesn't all work so well. ""Can You Stand Upon One Leg"" takes a stab at inspirational songwriting, trying to equate the ability to stand on one leg to the ability to do anything else, and it all steers toward a bit of singing slapstick wherein Hannon holds a high note for a ridiculously long time. It's funny once.</p>
<p>As with the last Divine Comedy album, <i>Victory for the Comic Muse</i>, the orchestration on <i>Bang Goes the Knighthood</i> is modest, with strings used sparingly in favor of small-band arrangements and a lot of organ. It's hard to imagine this album converting anyone who's never liked Hannon's work before, but it's built to please anyone who's ever enjoyed a note he's played. His days of creating spectacular extravaganzas may be well behind him, but the more modest ambitions on display here are nearly as enjoyable to hear.</p></div>"|14365.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14365-bang-goes-the-knighthood/|7.6|Joe Tangari

You might have heard that his music involved digital glitches, or that he remixed Tortoise a couple of times, or that he had a side project with Jan St. Werner from Mouse on Mars. The last proper Oval release, <i>Ovalcommers</i>, came out in 2001, so we're talking almost 10 years since he put out anything new under the name. Those making experimental music heavily dependant on software are taking a real risk when they decide to sit a decade out. Things change fast, and people forget.</p>
<p>How much you know and care about the records Oval released between 1993's <i>Wohnton</i> and <i>Ovalcommers</i> will probably have something to do with what you get out of his very different new EP, <i>Oh</i>. Though in truth, the project always seemed to be in a state of perpetual transition. In Oval's early years, Popp worked with Frank Metzger and designer Sebastian Oschatz to make hypnotic and highly textured tracks that often featured a rhythmic pulse that sounded like a skipping CD. Following the departure of Oschatz and Metzger after the gorgeous ambient masterpiece <i>94 Diskont</i>, Oval's music grew increasingly dense and harsh, to the point where it moved freely between placid sounds and flat-out noise. While there was an overriding Oval aesthetic centered around the sonic beauty of digital disruption (Popp's ideas were central to many conversations about electronic music during the time), the specific qualities of the records varied. And that's important to keep in mind when approaching <i>Oh</i>, because this record sounds almost nothing like the Oval we once knew.</p>
<p>Where Oval once felt huge and immersive, <i>Oh</i> is sharp, prickly, and finely detailed. The central sonic motif in most of these minatures-- 15 tracks zoom by in 25 minutes-- is what sounds like samples of guitar strings plucked between the bridge and the tuning pegs. Which is to say that these sounds are high-pitched and metallic with virtually no resonance, though they are digitally looped and stretched and warped when they're not bouncing between the speakers. The recording environment is very dry, which is interesting, because Popp is for the first time working with the sounds of ""real"" instruments, including a drum kit that pops up regularly. Though these are virtual instruments arranged by Popp electronically, they're used in a way that suggests a band with a post-rock bent playing in a room together-- the cymbals splash and the kick drum kicks and the guitar bits buzz and repeat and you get the sense of a trio searching for the spaces that exist in between genres. It sounds a bit like improv, a bit like instrumental rock, and a bit like turn-of-the-millennium IDM, even as it never really sounds like Oval.</p>
<p>With all of its pings and scrapes in the middle and upper part of the sonic spectrum, <i>Oh</i> can be a difficult listen on headphones. In a room, though, the EP opens up, and the logic of Popp's approach becomes more apparent. One thing this music shares with earlier Oval is the sense that it seems just on the verge of falling apart. There's a nice tension here as randomness-- mostly embodied by the frenzied guitar samples-- struggles with order.</p>
<p>It's good to have Oval back, and there's something to be said for re-thinking one's art from the ground up. But there's also a nagging sense here that it's all been done before. Popp's ""virtual band"" moves are reminiscent of Jan Jelinek's likeminded experiments in the early part of the 00s, and the focus on clicky guitar samples is close to the work of the California-based artist Christopher Willits from around the same time. Of course, all of these artists are obscure in the grand scheme of things, so the fact that this sound has been touched on before shouldn't matter to most. Popp has broken more than his share of ground, and now it's time to try something else.</p></div>"|14368.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14368-oh-ep/|6.7|Mark Richardson

But over 10 years and four studio albums, Furler has slowly moved away from the effervescent ballads associated with songs like Zero 7's ""Destiny"" and her biggest solo hit, 2006's ""Breathe Me"". And according to Furler, <i>We Are Born</i> is the album she's wanted to make since 2006's <i>Colour the Small One</i>. Instead of catering to fans of that slow, sultry earlier work, she's brought in old and new songwriting partners to help her craft a fast-paced, upbeat pop album.</p>
<p>Greg Kurstin (Lily Allen, Ke$ha, Natasha Bedingfield) produced the album, and there are glimpses of his recent work-- specifically Allen's <i>It's Not Me, It's You</i>-- on the record's hits. But there is also a lot of the jangly, beat-led pop of more arena-sized British acts like Keane, perhaps credited to co-writer Dan Carey, who has worked with the likes of Franz Ferdinand, La Roux, and Hot Chip. Those hits-- ""Stop Trying"", ""Clap Your Hands"", ""You've Changed"", ""Bring Night""-- are well-tailored to UK radio and club remixes. (Diplo has already put his stamp on ""Clap Your Hands"".) They also happen to be the best songs on the album. But some move too far away from Sia's wheelhouse: ""Hurting Me Now"" uses the bubbly vocal harmonies and disaffected delivery peculiar to Allen, to the point that it could be an <i>It's Not Me</i> track that didn't make the cut.</p>
<p>Many of the songs succeed because the stories sound like Furler's. ""Stop Trying"" has the vocal chants, clap-driven rhythm, and cutesy keyboards of an Alphabeat song, and the chorus-- ""We like you""-- is insistent without being cloying. In her new video for ""Clap Your Hands"", she plays several Jim Henson-inspired neon creatures with Sia heads that dance and chant encouraging lines like, ""Take a chance on romance/ We only get one chance at this."" The music is sunny and more sociable, and it feels driven by the goofy personality that has gradually blossomed out of the brooding vocalist Sia was once pegged to be.</p>
<p>A cover of Madonna's ""Oh Father"" is one of few appearances of the lounge-ready music that dominates her other albums. Soft drums and even softer keyboard twinkles decorate Furler's inimitable tone and impressive twist-and-turn phrasing. But the instrumentation is too thin and the melodies are boring, which is also true of the waltzing ""Be Good to Me"" and ""I'm in Here"". All are examples of the old Sia, tucked discreetly into corners of the album.</p>
<p>Furler and her team are certainly going for it, but they don't reach for the boisterous electronics of pop stars like Lady Gaga, Ke$ha, and Katy Perry, which would be an unbelievable stretch. Instead, the electric guitar, played by the Strokes' Nick Valensi, is the instrumental linchpin of the album. It appears on many of the strongest tracks, underscoring melodies and driving momentum, and it suits Furler's voice. On ""Big Girl, Little Girl"", it introduces some of Charlotte Hatherley's jerky, acid-tinged rock, and Furler's flirty acrobatics mimic it, turning a catchy song into an infectious one.</p></div>"|14296.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14296-we-are-born/|6.6|Liz Colville

That formula served them well through three classic albums (<i>Exit Planet Dust</i>, <i>Dig Your Own Hole</i>, and <i>Surrender</i>) and one pretty good one (<i>Come With Us</i>). But they stuck with it two albums too long. The duo's last two full-lengths, 2005's <i>Push the Button</i> and 2007's <i>We Are the Night</i>, were, respectively, a spotty mess and an outright disaster. After an album like that, it's time to blow things up and start again, and that's what they've done with <i>Further</i>.</p>
<p><i>Further</i> doesn't open with a banger. In fact, there's barely a single track among the album's eight that could be termed as such. There are no hackneyed stabs at British chart relevance, like 2005's clumsy and pandering but (let's face it) successful Q-Tip collab ""Galvanize"", which still gets play as go-to-commercial music during NBA games. <i>Further</i> features vocals on about half of its tracks, but they're all anonymous, mostly used to repeat one mantra or another over and over. And rather than attempting some sort of crossover-dance smash, the Chems do something new here: an album-length suite of warm, gooey utopianism, one that never smashes you over the head with obvious hooks or high-concept floor-fillers. It's a slow, patient piece of work, all vibe and no frenzy. The drums don't kick in until a couple of minutes into track two, and they sound glorious when they finally do. <i>Further</i> is a retrenchment move, and it's a good one.</p>
<p>That retrenchment works best during the album's first two tracks. Opener ""Snow"" has no drums at all; it's all sculpted guitar feedback and bass-based motorik pulse, and it calls up memories of Spacemen 3's <i>Playing With Fire</i> or Panda Bear. Female voices repeat a couple of phrases over and over: ""Your love keeps lifting me,"" ""lifting me higher."" Slow bursts of fuzz build and build, and then we're suddenly at track two. ""Escape Velocity"" is a marathon blissout, with vintage synths piling on top of each other, as well as what might be a chopped up sample of the Who's ""Baba O'Riley"" synth arpeggios. The Chems pack a ton of peaks and valleys into the track's 12 minutes, and the end result is a great piece of giddy zone-out music, something that will probably kill when the Chems take it to the festival circuit this summer.</p>
<p>Nothing else on the album reaches the starry-eyed heights of those first two songs, but the vibe remains intact throughout. ""Another World"" has a soul-sample lope; it could be dusty backpacker hip-hop before the raved-out synths kick in. ""Wonders of the Deep"" lives up to its title with a burbling, impressionist keyboard lifted straight from an 80s PBS nature documentary. ""Horse Power"", the hardest thing here, is sort of a low-key big beat take on clipped, staccato Detroit techno, with a vocoder refrain and a horse-whinny sample that made my wife bust up laughing out loud. The whole album works something like an expansion on the last three fuzzed-out tracks from <i>Dig Your Own Hole</i>. The Chems aren't in the same do-no-wrong zone they were when they recorded that stuff, but <i>Further</i> brings them closer than anyone could've reasonably expected. That late-career slump? It's over now.</p></div>"|14359.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14359-further/|8.0|Tom Breihan

It has all the hallmarks of a classic ""difficult"" record, too, whether we're talking techno or avant-garde classical or jazz or (as here) some merger of the three. It's repetitive, sometimes maddeningly so. Its sound palette is astringent at best and ugly at worst. Even the melodic elements are hammered out with a relentlessness that often turns them into queasy, percussive noise.</p>
<p>Wolfgang Voigt has never shied away from difficulty, of course. Typically, it's taken the form of minimalism, but his most revered minimalist records have been lush, even outright beautiful. Studio 1, Burger/Ink, Gas: None of these aliases trafficked in audience alienation. Quite the reverse, in fact. Some may have revealed their pleasures immediately, as with Gas's deeply affecting mix of mountain-sized melancholy and beatific calm. Others, like the proto-microhouse of Studio 1, required some acclimation time in order to hear the echoes of deep house warmth left after Voigt had gutted the genre of anything pop.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if trying to acclimate yourself to the world of <i>Freiland Klaviermusik</i> will help in that regard. I've listened to it maybe a dozen times, sometimes straight through and sometimes with necessary breaks between three or four of its chilly tracks. It has yet to reveal any hidden warmth to me, and I'll be damned if I can hear the slightest suggestion of pop. Using what sounds like (possibly synthetic) piano fed through various studio effects like heavy reverb-- and nothing else-- Voigt creates 13 tracks that <i>sometimes</i> resemble a strange, drum-less, almost monastic take on techno. But mostly Voigt positions himself as the next step in a lineage of experimental keyboard music.</p>
<p>On <i>Freiland Klaviermusik</i>, you can hear La Monte Young's <i>The Well-Tuned Piano</i>, where endless strings of notes refuse to resolve into a melody for more than a few seconds; Cecil Taylor's solo sound clashes, where the left hand pounds the piano's bass range into submission and the right hand tries to unlearn several decades of virtuoso schooling; but especially Conlon Nancarrow's player piano scores, where that fusty emblem of old west kitsch is made to sound like gunfire, or a factory at peak production, or computer gibberish.</p>
<p>Even Voigt's repetition-- the album's only real structuring device, what keeps it from feeling like free improvisation-- has very little to do with dance music. The merciless throb of synth bass-- or synth bass-range piano chords-- on tracks like ""Zimmer"" may remind you of the darkest end of techno. But there's not an ounce of disco fun in its low-end menace. It's actually queasy at times, especially if you're listening on headphones.</p>
<p>The album's not all spooked-out gloom and crazy-making two-note chords repeated past the point of endurance, of course. The faintest hint of light appears with ""Schweres Wasser""-- think bright Reich/Glass brand minimalism played by an over-excited child prodigy-- and the final third of the album starts to feel like a series of (very) abstract jazz ballads. But from a man that gave the world the concept of ""pop ambient,"" this is an instrumental album that's solely for the hardcore.</p></div>"|14327.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14327-freiland-klaviermusik/|6.0|Jess Harvell

It's been two decades since Devo last attempted a full album of new music-- and 1990's <i>Smooth Noodle Maps </i>wasn't memorable. Then there's the fact that the band seems more interested in their <a href=""http://www.billboard.com/news/devo-how-to-get-ahead-with-advertising-1004097703.story"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">marketing campaign</a> than the music-- a scary enough preference to begin with, but even worse considering said campaign is basically simple crowd-sourcing presented as some kind of conceptual art.</p>
<p>Given those red flags, it's hard not to enter <i>Something For Everybody </i>with expectations set on low, and there are some easy targets right away. The first few songs verge on self-parody-- opener ""Fresh"" is based around what sounds like the Devo preset on a 1989 Casio, while ""Please Baby Please"" offers an annoyingly bouncy cadence recalling the worst of Was (Not Was). Lowest on the ladder is ""What We Do"", filled with labored yelps and buzzword rhymes that come off less like ironic commentary than lazy verbal clip-art: ""Gamin', Prayin', Believin', Maintainin', Textin', Electin', Rejectin', Infectin'.""</p>
<p>Endure those initial hurdles, though, and the rest of <i>Something For Everybody </i>contains some pretty good music-- the kind that actually sneaks up on you a little rather than ham-fisting you over the head. The switch comes in track five, ""Mind Games"", which melts video-game synths into classic Devo riff pinball. From there, the melodies get sharper and more skewed, the beats and synths more diverse and rangy-- evoking everyone from LCD Soundsystem to Mouse on Mars. And most of it is good enough to remind you how most of that ""everyone"" owes something to Devo.</p>
<p>Note that we're talking good <i>music </i>here, not words. The lyrics improve compared to the albums' first three clunkers, but they're still rife with clichés (""It's not over 'till the cows come home/ It's not over 'till the fat lady sings""), dated politics (""I keep tryin' to turn it all around/ But the New World Order wants to take me down"") and self-conscious Devo-isms (""I am a human rocket/ On a mission of deployment."")  Yet when the band is locked in sonically, those lines sound better than they read. Mark Mothersbaugh and Gerald Casale can still bite off words with nervy smarts, like the art-punk/tech-nerds they will forever be.</p>
<p><i>Something For Everybody </i>probably stands closest to 1982's <i>Oh No, It's Devo! </i>in their oeuvre. That record got mixed reviews, and this one probably will too, but I think <i>Oh No </i>is unfairly maligned. It may have been weaker than the band's classics, but its best moments combined art with pop in a way that could sound as good in a gallery as on an <a href=""http://www.hulu.com/watch/42891/square-pegs-muffys-bat-mitzvah"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">episode</a> of a sitcom<i>. </i>There's no similar zeitgest that Devo fits into nowadays, despite their blatant attempts to court ""everybody."" But in the considerable sub-strata made of people who still care about this band, <i>Something For Everybody </i>holds some truth in its name.</p></div>"|14369.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14369-something-for-everybody/|6.6|Marc Masters

The Chicago hip-hop vet is talented, creative, and genuinely funny, and he has struggled mightily to carve his own path as a rapper to little recognition. Before Wale released his <i>Mixtape About Nothing</i>, Fest put out his own oddball full-length mixtape, <i>Man in the Mirror</i>, a goofy and affecting tribute to Michael Jackson where he rapped over tracks of the Jacksons fooling around in the studio and talked back to MJ's interview footage. It was an ambitiously odd and unique project, and it was roundly ignored. His career is a series just-misses: On 2006's <i>Blue Collar</i>, Fest rapped over a loop of the Strokes' ""Someday"", years before B.o.B. decided to start mauling Vampire Weekend songs, and the record bricked. He won a Grammy for co-writing ""Jesus Walks"", but Kanye axed his verse from the final version.</p>
<p>No one's more aware of this than Rhymefest, of course, and on <i>El Che</i>, the endlessly delayed followup to <i>Blue Collar</i>, he's doing his best not to let bitterness get to him. ""Used to be on J Records/ Wrote some Kanye records/ Next Grammy's just mine, this is El Che's record"" he declares, early on, in ""Talk My Shit"". It's not long, though, before all those missed opportunities start to nag at him, and on <i>El Che</i>, they're mostly personified by rappers like Wale and Charles Hamilton, who rode his tricks to wider notice than he did. ""Even before Wale bricked, I tried to pull 'em aside and say, 'them white boys won't sell your shit',"" he claims  later on ""Talk My Shit"", and it feels unpleasantly like gloating. Fest excoriates hipster rappers memorably-- ""boy put some bass in your voice, you sound intimate/ Hip-hop's supposed to have edge, you're so innocent,"" he sneers-- but hearing him grumble about tight jeans and heap insults on someone as woebegone as Charles Hamilton is disheartening, and it deflates the whole ""embattled revolutionary"" theme of <i>El Che</i>.</p>
<p>Rhymefest doesn't have it in him to be righteous anyway, and it's one of his most appealing qualities. Even when he addresses issues larger them himself, he does so in the same goofy deadpan he uses to crack dumb jokes about Tiger Woods. He does layer in a genuinely affecting personal detail here and there, lamenting on ""How High"" how a felony charge kept him from voting for Obama,  but he's quick to smooth it out with a joke. He compares himself to Hellboy on ""Chicago"", and it more or less completely encapsulates his on-record personality: a grumbling, cantankerous, lovable doofus with more on his mind than you might expect.</p>
<p>Like the much better-financed <i>Blue Collar</i>, <i>El Che</i> is a bumpy, imperfect ride. There's no Just Blaze or Kanye production this time around, but that's no excuse for beats that often scan as tepid and anonymous. And while Rhymefest is a rock-solid rapper-- this is the guy who once beat Eminem in Scribble Jam, after all-- he also blunts his own impact with corny jokes. And then there's ""Agony"", about which I can only say that Rhymefest was someone most rap listeners probably weren't looking for an incredibly graphic sex jam from: ""you're like my Buick"" is the most illustrative and safest lyric I could find.  In some ways, last year's <i>The Manual</i> mixtape is a far stronger document of Fest's skills.

Hence the title <i>Two Agents</i>-- but that also fits their music, which melds IDM, krautrock, and post-rock with schizophrenic results. Not that there's much conflict or discordance during this 60-minute double LP. Each track is smooth and well-crafted, with straightforward beats that avoid sharp angles and sudden shifts. The duality comes in how that approach can swerve from highly interesting to predictably rote. In that sense, <i>Two Agents </i>strikes me as a midpoint between two recent records on Smalltown Supersound, Lindstrøm's <i>Where You Go I Go Too </i>and Kim Hiorthøy's <i>My Last Day. </i>Where the former filled long-form IDM with subtle tension and expansive range, the latter's melodic techno was pretty formulaic, though even its numbest tracks were entertaining.</p>
<p><i>Two Agents </i>is pretty entertaining too-- Bucholtz and Goelzer know how to make a strong, pulsing beat, and how to build momentum as it rolls steadfastly forward. When their simple minimalism clicks, it has a gravity that fully engages. On ""Sweet Freedom"", the duo lock into a Neu!-like groove that never hits overdrive, yet still creates thick atmosphere. The same is doubly true of ""Tense Situations"", whose quaking bass line and soaring overtones evoke both post-punk and post-rock, like Mogwai covering Joy Division.</p>
<p>But Signaldrift's mono-chromatic beats can paralyze them into autopilot, like a machine left running while its operators take a break. Take ""Planetarium"", whose stock bass line and mild accents are more wallpaper than texture. Or ""Yesterday's Tomorrows"", which evokes the pretty lilt of Psychedelic Furs without the tense counterpoint of Richard Butler's voice. In those moments, the duo's restraint sands down potential edges into softness. The results are often catchy and propulsive-- certainly good workout music, often on par with LCD Soundsytem's <i>45:33</i>. But, as with Hiorthøy's work, you sense that if some execs made minor tweaks, many of these songs could soundtrack TV commercials or corporate promos.</p>
<p>Still, it would be unfair to judge <i>Two Agents</i> solely by its weaker moments. For an hour's worth of music made with one holistic approach, the album boasts lots of engrossing sections, and no unpleasant moments. Next time out, maybe Signaldrift will splatter some paint outside their taut canvasses, and trust that harder edges and wider divergences won't sully the essential attraction of their music. You can hear the potential for that bubbling under the surface of <i>Two Agents, </i>so it shouldn't take much for Signaldrift to punch some new holes in their sonic shell.</p></div>"|14351.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14351-two-agents/|6.5|Marc Masters

Almost as if it were a challenge, the two decided to make a throwback synth-pop artist the centerpiece of their mix while knee-deep in reggae, dancehall, and hip-hop. Enter UK duo La Roux, who make catchy, demonstrative synth-pop that's nonetheless brittle, stiff, and exceedingly pale.</p>
<p><i>Lazerproof</i> takes instrumental and vocal tracks from La Roux's heavily 80s-indebted album and brazenly mashes them up with beats and rhymes that are almost wholly up-to-the-minute hip, encompassing rap, R&amp;B, dancehall, and dubstep. Surprisingly, it often works, thanks to singer Elly Jackson. She's a dramatic, expressive vocalist, and it seems likely the real reason Major Lazer thought a mindmeld with La Roux sounded like a good idea was because Diplo and Switch knew her voice could still sound great even outside synth-pop strictures. The blend of La Roux's ""Fascination"" with ""Keep It Goin' Louder"", a standout from Major Lazer's own 2009 debut, <i>Guns Don't Kill People-- Lazers Do</i>, is a seamless success, as is the recasting of formerly plinky ""Quicksand"" as a slice of squelchy, steel drum-blessed dance bliss.</p>
<p>At its best, Major Lazer's reimagining lends pathos to La Roux, a quality the synth-poppers were only sporadically interested in conveying on their own album. The mixtape-opening ""Bulletproof (Nacey Remix)"" boldly takes La Roux's best song and turns it into something stark and haunting, full of strings and portentous piano chords. Likewise, the succeeding track powerfully weds Jackson's turn on La Roux's ""Colourless Colour"" to the delicate shuffle of Ken Boothe's classic ska heart-tugger, ""Artibella"". This formula nets further rewards on the tape's blendings of ""As If By Magic"" with Demarco's melancholic ""Fallen Soldiers,"" and ""Growing Pains"" with Drake's ""Houstonatlantavegas"".</p>
<p>Hotwiring Jackson's hysterics to thudding beats works perfectly, but <i>Lazerproof</i> mostly falters when trying to shoehorn rappers and reggae spitters into the equation. That's not to say a great mix can't be woven from the likes of Gucci Mane, Amanda Blank, or up-and-coming female emcee Candi Redd, but the effect of trying to nestle any of their grittily profane verses against Jackon's steely androgyny is just too jarring to work. Unlike slangier, more musically polymorphous former Diplo tape subjects M.I.A. and Santigold, Jackson doesn't play well with others. At least Major Lazer have proven she looks good with a tan.</p></div>"|14336.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14336-lazerproof/|7.2|Joshua Love

Every album, every song, every lyric makes some overt musical or lyrical reference to the New Jersey greasers' working-class heroes-- Bruce Springsteen, Joe Strummer, Tom Petty. And while there ain't a lick of jazz in their music, the Gaslight Anthem give their songs names like ""The Spirit of Jazz"" and ""Miles Davis &amp; the Cool"" and ""The '59 Sound"" in an attempt to recapture some bygone, ineffable standard of hipness that can only be gleaned by staring at old Blue Note album covers. Like Arcade Fire before them, they've also graduated from being mere Springsteen fans to becoming the Boss' onstage duet partners, and on their new album, <i>American Slang</i>, the Gaslight Anthem even try their hand at reggae riddims, because, well, Joe would've wanted it that way.</p>
<p>But the Gaslight Anthem are not a band simply awash in nostalgia; their songs are <i>about</i> the very concept of nostalgia. And most importantly, they understand that nostalgia is not a lens through which we fondly reminiscence about the past, but a gauge by which we evaluate our troubled present. On <i>American Slang</i>, the follow-up to the Gaslight Anthem's 2008 triumph <i>The '59 Sound</i>, frontman Brian Fallon is utterly consumed by the idea that his best days are behind him-- three songs contain a variation on the dewy-eyed phrase ""when we/you were young,"" and on another, he seemingly gets frustrated with his own backward-glancing impulses, angrily demanding, ""Don't sing me the songs about the good times/ Those days are gone and you should just let them go."" So in this sense, the Gaslight Anthem's Springsteen/Strummer worship is less about idolatry and mimicry than a defense mechanism against a modern world that's presented them with no new heroes to aspire to.</p>
<p>For about half of <i>American Slang</i>, the Gaslight Anthem simply barrel ahead like they're making <i>The '60 Sound</i>, with briskly paced rockers like ""Stay Lucky"", ""Orphans"", and ""The Spirit of Jazz"" nudging the band's blue-collar punk towards Replacements-vintage power pop. But elsewhere, the prevailing quarterlife-crisis angst has a perceptible effect on the band's disposition-- where <i>The '59 Sound </i>burst out of the gates, <i>American Slang</i> moves forward in more measured spurts and, in pained power ballad ""We Did It When We Were Young"", it even momentarily succumbs to U2-itis (as earnest rock bands inevitably do).</p>
<p>However, if mid-tempo stompers like the title track and ""Bring It On"" lack the do-or-die exhilaration of the band's best songs-- and rely too heavily on Fallon's strained, rust-covered pipes to deliver the necessary drama-- other attempts at downshifting successfully open up the band's sound. Where most Springsteen-swooned indie-rockers strive for <i>Born to Run-</i>scale grandeur, ""The Diamond Church Street Choir"" effectively opts for a cool ""Spirit in the Night"" sway over which Fallon, like Bruce in his <i>Asbury Park</i> days, offers up rich street-scene details and character portraits of the New Jersey neighborhood that birthed his band. And the aforementioned dub dalliance, ""The Queen of Lower Chelsea"", proves to be <i>American Slang</i>'s emotional center, its skittering rhythm guiding Fallon's tragic-hero protagonist along her lonesome journey from New York to London, en route to the song's heroic chorus. Even if many of the album's lyrics find Fallon looking back in anger, <i>American Slang</i> ultimately proves The Gaslight Anthem are not afraid to move forward.</p></div>"|14355.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14355-american-slang/|7.3|Stuart Berman

If you know both groups, you could probably piece together a bit of a picture of the music on <i>Chasing After Shadows... Living With the Ghosts</i>. It's diaphanous music, with one foot in the deep ambient textures of Stars of the Lid, and another in the more traditional, anthemic, and slightly psychedelic rock of the Church. It doesn't sound quite like either group-- Hammock have a unique sound that lies in the space between, and as with their previous albums, the group focuses here on constructing a sound world you can sink into, a place where the audio captures the feeling invoked by a title like ""The World We Knew as Children"".</p>
<p>The Church's Tim Powles is one of the acknowledged parties, and he's one of three drummers that helps augment the duo of Andrew Thompson and Marc Byrd on several tracks-- drums feature more prominently here than on any of the band's prior releases. Most of the vocals, sung by Christine Glass Byrd, are wordless, bleeding into the glassy texture of strings, guitars, keyboards, and horns as a sort of ghost-like echo of a human presence. The band gets close to sounding like a rock group in places. The chiming rhythm guitar and arcing, contrail-like lead guitar coax melody out of the album-- like Ride or Slowdive slowed down and blissed a lot further out. On ""You Lost the Starlight in Your Eyes"", they actually wrap their voices around some lyrics, an evocative repeated couplet.</p>
<p>For every song like that, though, there's another that sounds like an orchestra breathing or an echo crossing an abyss. Those blurred figures floating in the water on the album cover are a visual analog for the sense of unmoored drift or float created by the album's most ethereal and ambient moments. I try to imagine music videos for it, and all I come up with is slow-motion images of sand blowing off the tops of dunes and seaweed swaying with the tide. It's intensely visual music-- you really get the sense of shapes shifting and forms moving.</p>
<p>Anyone who has liked Hammock in the past will like this. They've made a slight move toward more conventional rock structures here, but not enough to turn off past followers, and probably plenty to draw in a few people who they might not have hooked before. It's a long record, occupying a full CD, and one that's easy to luxuriate in for its full run time. It also leaves open a lot of possibilities for the band's future direction; if they're itching to write more conventional songs without giving up their identity, what they've accomplished here indicates they could do it.</p></div>"|14342.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14342-chasing-after-shadows-living-with-the-ghosts/|7.3|Joe Tangari

Which leads to a weird double standard: Would you automatically think less of a band, however new, if they came out and claimed their major influences were records that came out a year ago?</p>
<p>It's something that feels awfully prevalent when discussing Keepaway's <i>Baby Style EP: </i>not that Animal Collective invented floor-toms, vocal triggers, bird-call harmonies, or production that sounds like you record inside a water bong. They did, however, make it very popular, and <i>maybe Baby Style </i>would exist as-is if <i>Merriweather Post Pavilion </i>wasn't topping 2009 lists by the boatload; there'd just be fewer blogs assuming the Brooklyn trio was a shoo-in for 2010 lists.</p>
<p>Yet while there are plenty of bands drawing from similar inspiration, 99% of them likely won't come up with a single as immediately ingratiating as ""Yellow Wings"". What's interesting about ""Yellow Wings"", and its follow-up ""Family of the Son"" is how at their core, the vocal cadences, spindly guitar figures, and insistent drum beats would've evoked Modest Mouse five years ago. Even it's main lyric, ""I think I finally know what I want/ I want to be two places at once,"" has a certain Isaac Brock-ian logic to it, though in context, it's more a statement of overwhelming wanderlust than existential dread. But check the updated, totally saturated recording: samples stuttering and humidified reverb filling up every open pore. It's crowded, but hardly lonesome.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, <i>Baby Style</i>'s strong introduction is undermined by its remaining three tracks, and you hear a band that too conveniently compartmentalizes itself: ""I Think About You All The Time"" paints with the fluorescent synths of MGMT, and the lyrics themselves could be charitably seen as a parody of the duo's more proggish fantasies (""Imagine a warm labyrinth/ A pair of brown shoes in violets."") It's not a totally jarring turn until the backend of <i>Baby Style </i>(""5 Rings"", ""Evil Lady"") tries to cop the free-flowing bliss of <i>Person Pitch.</i> Their loops and harmonies lack depth and warmth, and the drum-machine switcheroos from reggae shuffle to sopping dub to a waltz wrapped in aluminum are distracting instead of effortless.</p>
<p>So yeah, <i>Baby Style </i>is about as zeitgeist-y as an <i>EP </i>in 2010 can get short of an Ariel Pink tribute, but does it suffer from having the bad timing of not coming out 10 years from now? What separates them from bands like Cymbals Eat Guitars or Wild Nothing that are every bit as indebted, albeit from different points in history? Namely, either a strong enough command of their influences to master an inhabitable universe of them or a prism of personality that lets you know where their record collection ends and Keepaway begin. And it makes <i>Baby Style </i>feel less like a whole artistic statement than a hedge-betting demo: I can tell what Keepaway's been listening to, but hopefully their Lefse full-length will give a better idea of what makes them tick.</p></div>"|14344.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14344-baby-style-ep/|6.7|Ian Cohen

At times, it recalls Fuck Buttons' dance-imbued static throb, the grinding industrial rock of HEALTH, Holy Fuck's electro post-rock patchwork, and to a lesser extent, Trans Am's stadium-rock pranksterisms. Music in his vein thrives when it focuses on the tension between noise and melody.  Florene's tracks seem to be searching for that sweet spot that comes when visceral electronics meet sweeping arrangements.</p>
<p>There are moments on <i>Homemade Extacy</i> where Florene show some promise. The stretched-out vocals on ""Street Caring"" work well enough paired with the track's zig-zagging synth lines, while the electronic screams that take out album closer ""Space Cadets"" or the awesomely raved-out shouts that open ""Invitation to Sailing"" might have you seeing stars, if you're in the right headspace. But these moments are just that-- small bits of something interesting that never manage to coalesce or build momentum.</p>
<p>Despite the basic immediacy of their splatter-electro approach, <i>Homemade Extacy</i> winds up feeling a bit faceless. The biggest issue is that the melodies aren't built on strong foundations. ""Deal With It"" and the opening title track repeat the same ultra-jacked theme endlessly, without much development or variation. Elsewhere, the fogged moans and low tones of ""Depth"" just seem to hover on the surface, and the nearly six-minute track, like so many others here, fails to justify its length.</p>
<p>All of these complaints are just minor quibbles, though, next to the album's greatest weakness: it sounds terrible. Every element of every song is mixed way, way into the red. Throughout, nuance and layering are discarded in favor of an annoying sonic antagonism. By using this ear-bleeding technique exclusively, Florene miss the thing that gives the best noise music its force, using harsh sounds in a way that highlights shifts in dynamics and allows for some surprise. Despite the small bits of potential that crop up here and there, for most of <i>Homemade Extacy</i>, the music never hints at transcendence, which in this world is everything.</p></div>"|14334.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14334-homemade-extacy/|5.4|Larry Fitzmaurice

Even in the realm of hip-hop-- a style famous for its unswerving solipsism-- this is a feat. For comparison's sake, noted mirror watcher Kanye West managed to work only 220 ""I""'s into the verses and hooks of his big break,  <i>The College Dropout</i>. <i>Illmatic</i>; 210. <i>Reasonable Doubt</i>; 240. With <i>Thank Me Later</i>, Drake attempts to enter the pantheon of those rap game-busters by the sheer force of first person singular pronouns. All eyes are on him-- especially his own. But considering this mixed race, half-Jewish, all-Canadian ""Degrassi: The Next Generation"" alum looks and sounds unlike any major rap star before him, betting the house on nothing but himself turns out to be a wise gamble.</p>
<p>Drake is the guy you get drinks with who talks about himself for a few hours-- if you're lucky, he might ask you for advice on one or two things. But this is OK because Drake's stories are better than yours. Like the one about how Lil Wayne befriended and signed him at the height of Weezy's powers. Or how he got with Rihanna last year. Or that time he flashed from a Toronto has-been to a top-flight hit maker off the strength of a self-released mixtape. Of course, there's the classic about sipping a few too many glasses of Ace of Spades and asking Nicki Minaj to marry him. Sounds like a sweet existence.</p>
<p>But there's a problem. Even though he's a rich and handsome 23 year old spreading his music around the world in a five-star fashion, Drake really wants to be in the bottom bunk, hooking up with a girl next to the laundry basket at Totally Normal University, as he raps, ""I wish I wasn't famous/ I wish I was still in school/ So I could have you in my dorm room/ I would put it on you crazy."" Elsewhere, the irony is not lost on him, but he's not taking anything back: ""I know that niggas would kill for this lifestyle/ I'm lookin' forward to the memories of right now.""</p>
<p>
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
<i>Thank Me Later</i> presents its star as a bottle-serviced hip-hop headcase tirelessly searching for love and good times while caught up in his own thoughts. ""While all my closest friends out partyin'/ I'm just here makin' the music that they party to,"" he shrugs on ""Light Up"". Which all seems very Boy Who Cried Penthouse Suite except that Drake manages to make his plight tugging and relatable thanks to a potent mix of empathy, candidness, and grandeur. This is mood music inspired by rap and R&amp;B in equal measure-- sensible for a guy who can match bars with Lil Wayne one second and then sing an effortlessly aching hook next to The-Dream the next. And, largely thanks to sonic co-conspirators Noah ""40"" Shebib and Boi-1da,  <i>Thank Me Later</i> is held together by misty keyboards and dank drums that recall everyone from Sade to Boards of Canada to Massive Attack to the xx (who are thanked in the record's liner notes). And, much like those artists' music, it's understated-yet-undeniable emotion that drives this album more than anything else. The theme is mo' money, mo' heartbreak, and it's everywhere.</p>
<p>Simply, Drake is in love with his own lovelessness. But instead of lashing out against his would-be wifeys à la <i>808s and Heartbreak</i> or falling into token misogyny, his relationship with women is more complicated. Whereas the unofficial mainstream hip-hop LP rulebook previously demanded a couple ""ladies' night"" tracks that were often pandering, insulting, or both, Drake lives for such softness. The brilliant and spare ""Karaoke"" finds him singing about a girl who can't deal with his newly jet-setting ways. ""I was only trying to get ahead/ But the spotlight makes you nervous,"" he says, sounding more committed than a host of melisma-drunk heartthrobs. His relatively progressive and gentlemanly style is contagious, too; on the soon-to-be smash ""Fancy"", T.I. ditches the ""superficial gold-digging bitches"" he once praised on songs like ""Whatever You Like"", instead opting for a single lady with her own BMW and Jaguar in the garage. As if that wasn't enough, Mary J. Blige spiritually co-signs the sentiment by adding some subtle harmonies as the song draws to a close.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Drake's fellow Young Money upstart Nicki Minaj adds to the gender ambiguities, out-manning her host on the diabolical ""Up All Night"", and the album's steamiest pairing has him teaming with The-Dream for the uber-slow jam ""Shut It Down"". That song ends with Drake shamelessly trying to get in a new acquaintance's pants-- ""take those fuckin' heels off, it's worth it, girl,"" he suggests. He's no angel. But even when this Romeo starts tossing dollar bills at a strip club on ""Miss Me"", his ogling is somehow lonely and level: ""I don't judge her but I could never love her/ 'Cause to her I'm just a rapper and soon she'll have met another.""</p>
<p>As much as rap is built on artful navel-gazing, it's also founded in struggle. And just as Drake's dramatically exposed selfishness is unique to hip-hop, so are his adversities. He grew up in an affluent Toronto suburb and was graced with everything but a functional pair of parents, who split when he was three. Like Kanye West before him, Drake vies for superstardom while embracing his non-drug-dealing, non-violent, non-dire history-- one that connects with most rap fans in a completely reasonable way. And, suddenly, all that ""I"" turns into a lot of ""we.""</p></div>"|14367.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14367-thank-me-later/|8.4|Ryan Dombal

That relationship worked out for nobody-- not the band, not the label, and certainly not their fans. Now, living in the shadow of a beloved debut is nothing new, and <i>Make Up the</i> <i>Breakdown </i>is doubly burdened by its P.O.V., since nailing the metropolitan jitters and elegant wastefulness of twentysomethings isn't easy to do twice (see also: Interpol, Strokes).</p>
<p>Hot Hot Heat are back at square one on Dangerbird, and maybe that gave them the message. And while they're not rewriting ""Bandages""-- Steve  Bays' voice has sanded too many of the edges off his yelp for that-- for better or mostly worse, there's a promising return to getting lost and naked in the city again. Whether it's due to their rough decade or just the accumulating bitterness of age, Bays flips the script on his persona-- no longer a victim, he's now spewing venom outward. ""YVR"" begins with the sound of a revving engine as Hot Hot Heat rediscover their full-throttle spaz. ""Times a Thousand"" cops a ""Take Me Out"" disco stomp and turns it militant-- ""It's not my fault that they hate your face,"" Bays spits.</p>
<p><i>Future Breeds </i>is also HHH's first self-produced album; like many rookies behind the boards, they seem to want every instrument loud as fuck. I actually don't mind that pressed-against-the-glass sound from a band that flounders when it fails to be punchy. ""21@12"" is either a threat or conspiratorial pep talk, but it's held together by a spirited hook. The arm-swinging ""Implosionatic"" lives up to its title, and it's what Hot Hot Heat do best, compact, unpredictable and delivered with the scalding energy of a band about to jump out of its own skin.</p>
<p><i>Breeds </i>might be #2 with a bullet in their discography, but it tails off whenever Hot Hot Heat dial down the energy. Unfortunately, this has been Hot Hot Heat's cross to bear-- ""In Cairo"" is still their only successful slow song. Bays isn't a crooner, and when the synths try to play piano ballads, HHH sink into their mid-decade anonymity, almost indistinguishable from Robbers on High Street, White Rabbits, or any other band label heads really hoped people would think sound like Spoon. But even a half-return-to-form was necessary for a group that a lot of people were on the verge of writing off, and a nice surprise if ""the best Hot Hot Heat album since 2002"" still means something to you and you know what they had to do to get there.</p></div>"|14350.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14350-future-breeds/|6.8|Ian Cohen

For the third year in a row, Chicago's Chuck Inglish and Mikey Rocks have infused the three-day weekend with another batch of retro-minded boom-bap tracks about clothes, stereo systems, and herb, all in time for BBQ season. We may never see their long promised debut LP <i>When Fish Ride Bicycles</i>, but these guys clearly have a handle on their audience and their unwavering aesthetic. Not to mention you'll likely have to pay for that release if the guys ever sort out their label woes. In the meantime, <i>Tacklebox</i> is a freebie, and about as close to an album as a mixtape gets, save for the territorial but relatively unobtrusive jabbering of tape hosts LA Leakers.</p>
<p>As with last year's <i>Gone Fishin'</i> and their breakout <i>The Bake Sale EP</i>, <i>Tacklebox</i> finds Inglish crafting spacious, drum-centric beats, over which he and Rocks engage in a rap delivery so zonked-out, it flies in the face of such infrequent weed referencing. This chill approach has always been part of the Kids' routine and the source of much of their charm. They bounce their clever, foggy raps off of each other in ways that seem so effortless, you almost wonder if the they even knew they were being recorded.</p>
<p>On <i>Tacklebox</i>, there's more sneaker-fetishism (""Don't tie your shoes that tight, it looks ugly"") and colorfully irreverent wordplay (""They pay a lot for features, I like lobster pieces/ Can't teach these thing twice, peace, nice to meet ya""), all spat nearly pancake flat. But where this kind of languid approach helped them carve out a niche, the Cool Kids are at a point where their vision of ""laid back"" is getting a little stale. Often borderline expressionless, Inglish and Rocks usually glue themselves to the beat and ride at whatever BPM the production dictates. Somehow, <i>Tacklebox</i> manages to ratchet that down even lower than usual.</p>
<p>Inglish clearly takes pride in his work behind the boards-- each track on the download is tagged with a production credit, with Inglish handling all but two cuts and collaborating on a third. But the beats are so dressed-down that the same the skittery 808s and bass kicks lurch and stall without some tuneful guidance, which the occasional tiny synth squelch or laser accent fail to provide. When Inglish plays outside his comfort zone, these tracks open up: ""Systems"" leans heavy on the robo-funk, while the fractured-jazz of the Tribe-flavored ""Great Outdoors"" and the obtusely poppy, Duran Duran vibing ""Strawberry Girl"" hit the pop pleasure centers hard. And even though highlight ""Good Afternoon"" was produced by the Productionix-- which flips a Cali-funked beach jam into some gooey, breathless 1970s soul-- it shows that the Cool Kids still know how to do the ""laid back"" thing without leaving us to worry if they've been chloroformed. If nothing else, there is proof here that if given the right mood and energy, the Cool Kids still might make a really good LP. On the other hand, perhaps they've already saturated the market for their narrow aesthetic, leaving little room for development or surprise.</p></div>"|14329.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14329-tacklebox/|6.0|Zach Kelly

That is, if he's playing the game at all. Much like his output, about which it's basically impossible to write without conjuring at least one of Roy Orbison, Lee Hazlewood, or Elvis Presley, his decade-long career has served as a testament to an almost perverse disinterest in the modern day. In Hawley's world, rock stars still wear Brylcreem, sunglasses, cigarettes, and reverb, and the twang of a Gretsch is music's <i>lingua franca</i>. If he were remotely interested in winning a mainstream audience, you'd have a hard time proving it.</p>
<p>And yet, despite six albums chronicling his single-minded devotion to a very specific patch of vintage rock, one could make the argument that Hawley's career is still on the ascent. Whether by design or coincidence, his music has recently begun peppering the ad breaks of British television-- it appears what was too somber for radio listeners is ideal for consumers. Likewise, Hawley's last record, <i>Truelove's Gutter</i>, was a career highlight that saw him twist longer, darker shapes out of his considerable songwriting craft. Some critics called it the best album of his career.<br/> <br/> Billed as a collection of songs 'inspired by the ocean', <i>False Lights From the Land</i> is a short but intriguing EP which furthers the notion that Hawley's currently making some of his most beguiling work. Listeners will recognize opener ""Remorse Code"" as one of the aforementioned epics from <i>Truelove's Gutter</i>; clocking in at just under 10 minutes and featuring some of Hawley's finest guitar work, it gets deserved headline status here. The next two tracks are obscure covers, both of which feature vocal contributions from folk duo and Hawley tour alums, the Smoke Fairies.</p>
<p>""Shallow Brown"" is an old sea shanty whose <i>a cappella</i> performance, somewhere between folk and gospel, renders it one of the most haunting things Hawley has ever made. On the Hughie Jones cover ""The Ellan Vannin Tragedy"", meanwhile, Hawley plays Gordon Lightfoot. (With that voice, he can.) With its sleepy piano tinkles and gently stinging guitars, doo-wop lullaby and new song ""There's a Storm a Comin'"" closes out the EP by returning us to Hawley's house style, but not without reminding us that he can still wring magic out of that familiar old formula. If he were a marathon runner, this is where he'd be hitting his stride.</p></div>"|14362.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14362-false-lights-from-the-land-ep/|7.5|Mark Pytlik

Although he's thrown quite a few more colors into his instrumental palette in recent years, he's still mostly working way out in the red, leaving nuance to others. <i>Melted</i>, his latest, boasts a 30-minute runtime that feels closer to 15. Segall gets in, gets out, and gets it done nearly every time.</p>
<p>Melted kicks off with quite the 1-2-3-4 punch: the swarming ""Finger"", the strummy ""Caesar"", the bopalong ""Girlfriend"", the two-faced ""Sad Fuzz"". Each tune spends a little time getting situated then settles into a wide-eyed amphetamine groove, levels well blown out, Segall's slack, bratty howl smeared liberally over top. ""Girlfriend"" in particular feels snappy and effortless. Segall's not taking much time figuring out how to beef up his sound, and while just about everything's bathed in the same warm haze and power trio crackle, he manages to jam the odd nooks and crannies of these straightaway songs with a little squiggly sci-fi guitar, barrelhouse piano, recorder, even the odd vocal collage. Segall's made some fine music in the past, but it's always felt a little hit-or-miss on an LP level, with hooks buried by freneticism and too little emphasis on his natural talent as a singer. <i>Melted</i> seems in some ways like his first proper record-- he's in control of every element of his sound on these first four rippers.</p>
<p><i>Melted</i> gets a little soft in the middle, its title track lost in a sea of haze, ""Mike D's Coke"" coming off almost like a third-rate Ariel Pink number. The tracks exhibit a little more range than his Buddy Holly/early Kinks/Ramones triangulation, but they don't hit as hard, slowing the record's momentum. But things pick up rather nicely from ""Imaginary Person"" on out, riding a wave of sweaty insistence on through to the all-too-hasty end. ""Imaginary"" is a beast, clattering for a spell before breaking into a surfy chug. ""My Sunshine"" bakes and ""Bees"" floats by, but it's the muddy blues of ""Mrs."" that really leaves its mark, a murder ballad in the ""Hey Joe"" mold that Segall slows down just long enough to completely kill.</p>
<p>You're not going to hear many rock records that'll kick you square in the pants quite like this one this year, provided Segall doesn't up and crank another one out by December; the kid's got heart, brains, and quite an ear for a hook, and he throws himself body and soul into these tunes. Segall makes quite an impression in half an hour's time, and <i>Melted</i>'s the best foot he's put forward yet. It still seems like his best records are ahead of him, like he's still got a couple of things to nail, but as it stands, <i>Melted</i> could charm the sweat out of anybody.</p></div>"|14347.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14347-melted/|7.5|Paul Thompson

Reznor had already shown signs of restlessness and an eagerness to move beyond his band's core aesthetic, most obviously on the all-instrumental <i>Ghosts I-IV</i> box set. It stood to reason that he was about to reinvent himself, and given his good taste and formidable talent as a musician, the prospect was very exciting.</p>
<p>As it turns out, he wasn't too interested in a full creative transformation. <i>How to Destroy Angels</i>, the self-titled debut of his new trio featuring his wife and ex-West Indian Girl singer Mariqueen Maandig and his regular collaborator Atticus Ross, essentially sounds just like a Nine Inch Nails record, with the only major difference being that Reznor has turned over lead vocal duty to Maandig. Even that is a relatively superficial change. Somewhat disappointingly, Reznor's first major project with an outside vocalist-- aside from his gigs as a producer for Marilyn Manson and Saul Williams-- doesn't involve him exploring new approaches to integrating vocals into his music or working with a singer capable of performances far beyond his own range, but instead has him writing parts for Maandig that stick to his usual melodic style and phrasing. Reznor had integrated a female voice into his music once before, on ""La Mer"" from 1999's <i>The Fragile</i>, and the result wasn't entirely different from what we have here: a softer, more feminine gloss on Reznor's established style.</p>
<p>This isn't a bad thing. Over the course of two decades, Reznor has expanded his repertoire to the point that his music is instantly recognizable even if he avoids the sort of all-caps declarative screaming that characterized Nine Inch Nails' biggest hits. <i>How to Destroy Angels</i> skips over that aspect of Reznor's work entirely, instead placing its emphasis on plaintive downtempo ballads and tracks dense with rhythm and harsh electronic noise. The songs in the latter category take sounds explored on more recent NIN records to interesting extremes-- ""Fur Lined"" is like a dizzier version of ""Only"" from <i>With Teeth</i>; ""The Believers"" further explores the glitchy, discordant textures of <i>Year Zero</i>; ""Parasite"" includes some of the filthiest guitar noise in Reznor's discography.</p>
<p>When the songs move further away from rhythm and atmosphere, Maandig's flaws as a vocalist become more apparent. Her voice is pleasant and well suited to the material, but she is somewhat lacking in character. When she sings the opening track ""The Space in Between"", her cadence is similar enough to that of Reznor that it's easy to just imagine his more distinct voice singing it instead. In some ways, the EP is like an inadvertent argument in favor of Reznor as a vocalist, proving its value to his music by omitting it almost entirely. When his voice turns up, as when he shadows Maandig's parts with a faint whisper on ""BBB"", it adds a weight and sexual tension to the music that is preferable to her all on her own.</p>
<p>Reznor is his comfort zone here, but that could be part of the point of the project in the first place. Without having to promote this as a Nine Inch Nails record, he's allowed to make greater risks, but he can also enjoy lower stakes. Future How to Destroy Angels releases may find him and his collaborators going further out into unfamiliar territory, but the contents of this EP mostly sound like Reznor working through musical ideas in the studio with his wife and his right-hand man-- being himself and doing his thing with some people he trusts. The changes that are apparent are subtle and incremental, and have more to do with feeling out the mechanics of collaboration and shaking off unnecessary outside pressures than aiming for something fresh and radical. It's not Reznor's best or boldest work, but it's a promising first step down a new path.</p></div>"|14340.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14340-how-to-destroy-angels/|7.0|Matthew Perpetua

As an actor, T.I. is good, not great; his roles in <i>ATL</i> and <i>American Gangster</i> don't exactly suggest that's capable of going all Will Smith on us. But it's easy to see some Hollywood bottom-feeder blowing smoke up the man's ass, trying to convince him to leave behind the no-money world of music now that he's famous enough. But on <i>Fuck a Mixtap</i>e, T.I. shows something that he's already shown over and over again: He's simply a magnificent rapper, perfectly in control of voice and flow and meter and cadence, able to convey volumes in a throwaway punchline and an ad-lib. And you don't get that good at rapping unless you <i>love rapping</i>. (Personal to Brian: Shut the fuck up, Brian.)</p>
<p>The central unifying concept of <i>Fuck a Mixtape</i>, such as it is, is that T.I. is too good for mixtapes, that he's bigger than mixtapes, that he's sick of being compared to rappers who only have a couple of mixtapes out-- but here's a mixtape anyway. In skits, comedians jump on to urge Tip to make an actual album, and on the outro, T.I. fumes about how mixtapes are completley beneath him. And yet here this is. It's not a planned-out album-length statement the same way, say, Yelawolf's <i>Trunk Muzik</i> or Big K.R.I.T.'s <i>K.R.I.T. Wuz Here</i> is; it's just a collection of random tracks that Tip had lying around, tracks that probably aren't quite good enough to make his next full-length. The songs here have big producers (Timbaland, Swizz Beatz, Jim Jonsin) and big guests (Lil Wayne, Young Jeezy, Keri Hilson), but they mostly don't have those indelible, sticky hooks that T.I. is so good at. And given that much of T.I.'s greatest work is also his most commercially seismic (""What You Know""), <i>Fuck a Mixtape</i> immediately registers as Minor Tip.</p>
<p>But that said, it's also a thrilling testament to T.I.'s pure rapping ability, which, it bears repeating, is frankly incredible. And at this point, T.I.'s rapping ability is something that needed proving. He's now back home after spending almost a year in prison on a gun charge that could've sent him away for much, much longer, and rappers can often lose a step when they finish up prison sentences; see Shyne's recent output for a dispiriting example. But T.I. remains in beast mode throughout the tape, attacking every track with a vengeful bile we haven't heard from him in a minute. There are no introspective, soul-searching songs here; he's not concerned with letting us know anything more than how pathetic we are. But he does that with great style, slipping in and out of different rhyme patterns and letting devastating put-downs just slip out: ""Want the title? Buck for it, it's yours/ But you're getting ignored because you're so piss-poor.""</p>
<p>There are throwaway tracks here, for sure, but even those tend to come with at least one moment that leaves me shaking my head at how good this guy still is. And the highlights are a lot of fun. God knows when Tip and Wayne recorded ""Yeah"", since Wayne was headed off to prison around the time Tip came home, but they giddily trade off lines and complement each other beautifully, Wayne's cartoonish lope a great foil for Tip's locked-in snarl. T.I. also repurposes Ice Cube's ""Once Upon a Time in the Projects"", using it to tell a story that actually works as pure narrative. ""Welcome Back to the Trap"" is vintage regal <i>Trap Muzik</i> shit, with a great organ-blasted beat.</p>
<p>And on ""Get Yo Girl"", T.I. raps over the same airy synth-blipping beat that Rich Boy and Yelawolf used on the great but unheralded single ""Go Crazy"". Rich Boy and Yelawolf treated that song like a potential anthem; T.I. just uses it to tell you how lame your girl is: ""Her breath smell like Corona and Patron and marijuana/ She giving me her number, I ain't gonna telephone her."" Rich Boy and Yelawolf got a better song out of it, but T.I. just sounds <i>cooler</i>. That's what <i>Fuck a Mixtape</i> is: An hour of T.I. sounding cool as fuck. It's reassuring.</p></div>"|14343.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14343-fuck-a-mixtape/|7.4|Tom Breihan

Just over a year ago, the Brooklyn indie rock outfit released its debut EP. It was buoyant and sweet and ended on one very high note: ""It Gets Your Body Movin'"". The song is an arm-in-armer, a slow-burning summer anthem whose titular chorus demanded you sing along even if you weren't surrounded by friends. The guitars were light and clean, but you could smell the booze on every single member's breath, from the first chant to the wide-mouthed coda. Now that song sits at the halfway point of <i>Wild Smile</i>, Suckers' first full-length and an effort that bubbles with the same wingnut energy that debut EP did. Its homestretch is still a revelation, and it's not the only one to be found herein. <i>Wild Smile</i> is wild indeed, the band's aesthetic and feel summed up perfectly by the cover art.</p>
<p>The trick is variety. Few songs (see: the forgettable ""King of Snakes"") break free of the same blueprint-- build gradually, build casually, and then get everyone together for a grand finale. Each is constructed the same way, but check out how Suckers decorate the dynamics. Opener ""Save Your Love for Me"" kicks off in soft-rock fashion, swaying just until the drums kick, the guitars gain Neil Young-like heft, and the vocals are vaulted into operatic heights. Listen closely and you'll hear a guitar lick that was ripped from an Oasis song. But what's remarkable is how much each song's ingredients join without creating a mess. Suckers are rarely as sloppy as they seem. ""Black Sheep"" leans as heavily on Modest Mouse as the band has previously, its chorus probably screamed into pickups just like Isaac Brock. While ""A Mind I Knew"" morphs from organ grinder into tribal weird out, ""2 Eyes 2 C"" sounds like Auto-Tuned choir practice and ""Roman Candles"" gets by on whistling plus pinwheeling falsetto. There's a lot going on. And what could have crippled <i>Wild Smile</i> unifies it instead, each influence made their own because they dab it with color and whimsy that's distinctly their own.</p>
<p>Quinn Walker and Austin Fisher's voices can grate a little, both ringers at times for two of the more difficult frontmen of the past few years: Alec Ounsworth and Wild Beasts' Hayden Thorpe. But what could come off as pretense seems silly instead. As they take turns on highlight ""Martha"", they do it with heart you can hear. When they combine to cry Martha's name, horns bleating behind them, they sound free. That you can hear everywhere on <i>Wild Smile</i> and predictably, it's how they choose to close shop: ""Loose Change"" features lullaby piano, ""Seinfeld"" slap bass, a Talking Heads riff, and a crowd of well-wishers to carry the last coda home. Everyone's singing and everyone's clapping and everyone sounds to be having the best time.</p></div>"|14346.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14346-wild-smile/|7.7|David Bevan

He was right. Joe Pernice had already established himself as a talented writer with the Scud Mountain Boys, and the shift from country to tastefully orchestrated power-pop only further focused and highlighted his skills. Alas, like many writers in that field, it was easy to take his talents for granted, and after several albums that incorporated fresh elements of 1980s college rock and AM pop, it was hard not to secretly hope for something, well, more.</p>
<p>Maybe Pernice was secretly hoping for something more, too-- after the band's lush 2006 <i>Live a Little</i> he took some time off to write a novel (<i>It Feels So Good When I Stop</i>), record a soundtrack of covers for said novel, and hit the road as part of a solo tour/author tour combo package. Four years is by far the longest gap between Pernice Brothers records, but the economical 10 songs and 32 minutes of <i>Goodbye, Killer</i> don't find Pernice doing anything more than what he's done in that past: craft polished pop nuggets redolent of several decades of pop nuggets.</p>
<p>Whether that's enough to appeal beyond Pernice's established base is irrelevant (the press notes joke Pernice established his indie imprint Ashmont Records because he and his manager ""were as capable of not selling many records as anyone""). More pertinent to that base is the pared-down nature of these tracks compared to past exercises, often filled out by busy harmonies and sweeping strings. Here most of the music is performed by a quartet led by Pernice and featuring his brother Bob, power-pop lifer Ric Menck, and guitarist James Walbourne (who currently does double duty in the Pretenders).</p>
<p>At this point Pernice's way with a melody and sympathetic arrangement is well known, his singing sharp and well-phrased (despite any number of awkward references and extra syllables he slips in). What's missing is a sense of urgency, a sense of creative compulsion driving these compositions. Songs such as ""Something for You"", the lovely but melancholy ""Bechamel"", and the deceptively peppy ""The Great Depression"" are rich with echoes of Dylan, the Beatles, and other building blocks of, well, everything, but there's nothing new brought to the table. When Pernice brings back the country signifiers on the title track or ""Newport News"", it's not clear just what's being signified other than a stylistic affectation.</p>
<p>""Please don't think I'm cruel,"" sings Pernice on ""The Loving Kind"", ""I've been through this too many times to bullshit you."" The Pernice Brothers are indubitably the loving kind-- that is, the kind of band you could love-- and as Pernice sings earlier on ""We Love the Stage"" with a what-can-you-do shrug, ""love is love."" The guy knows how to write songs, the guy knows how to make records. The guy knows how to make records you want to love. What's missing here, though, is that arrow through the heart moment where admiration and affection turns into adoration. The downside to anyone making it look so easy is that people may eventually agree before respectfully moving on.</p></div>"|14352.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14352-goodbye-killer/|5.8|Joshua Klein

You're a little better off than most Indonesians, and you and your brothers spend a lot of time listening to Australian radio and the Voice of America, singing along to the Everly Brothers and Buddy Holly. It's not really an uncommon story-- it happened all over the world-- but in Jakarta, the Koeswoyo brothers, Tonny, Yok, Jon, Nomo and Yon, took their rock'n'roll dreams to the next level, actually forming a band. They called themselves simply Koes Bersuadara (bersaudara is a gender-neutral term that means siblings), and they started to write their own songs, recording a single in 1962 and an album in 1964 for Irama Records (literally Rhythm Records). And in 1965, things started to get complicated.</p>
<p>Indonesia had been ruled since its independence from the Dutch by Sukarno, a freedom fighter turned dictator who thought rock'n'roll was an expression of Western decadence, famously describing the music of the Beatles as a ""mental disease."" By the mid-60s, Sukarno had largely lost control of the Indonesian economy, embroiled the nation in a pointless war with his unambiguously named ""crush Malaysia"" policy, and leaned most heavily on the PKI, Indonesia's communist party, for support. Stamping out rock music became a sort of crusade for him, an extension of his attempts to exert control over a sprawling and diverse nation. His attempts were a monumental failure: The country produced a huge amount of pop music with clear shades of rock'n'roll and R&amp;B during Sukarno's final years in power.</p>
<p>The Koes Brothers, by this time down to a Beatles-style quartet, had two intentions when they played Beatles songs during their concerts: Indulging their own tastes, and pleasing the crowd. They invariably achieved both, but it was the unintended effects that got them in trouble, namely with Sukarno's censors, who repeatedly called the band in for questioning. In mid-1965, the band was contacting by an Indonesian military officer who wanted them for a residency at a club he owned in Bangkok, Thailand. Before that, they were invited to play a party at his house. When they launched into ""I Saw Her Standing There"", a suspiciously well-placed pro-Sukarno mob outside the house began to riot. The band was arrested and imprisoned for three months without charge.</p>
<p>The other band hired to play the party that night was Dara Puspita, and it was Dara Puspita that wound up with the residency in Bangkok. Dara Puspita were an oddity in 1960s rock'n'roll: a self-contained, all-female rock band. They got their first break opening for Koes Bersaudara, and the two bands became something of a twin engine of raw rock music in mid-60s Jakarta. Dara Puspita evaded the fate of the Koes brothers after the ill-fated party, but they had their own run-ins with censors, including an incident in which they were called in front of an assessment board to play music so the board could decide whether they were breaking the law. They were told the Beatles and Koes Bersaudara songs they played weren't suitable, but when they played the Rolling Stones' ""Satisfaction"", the board gave them the okay</p>
<p>Neither Koes Bersaudara nor Dara Puspita have ever been exposed much to Western audiences, and that makes the first two volumes of Sublime Frequencies' new Indonesian Klasik Pop Nostalgia series  a welcome initial peek into Indonesia's vibrant 60s music scene. Sublime Frequencies is known for a snapshot approach to non-Western music scenes and sound culture, but they're approaching this series with an archivist's attention to detail and information, loading the releases with photos and informative liner notes. Both bands richly deserve the treatment.</p>
<p>When Koes Bersaudara was suddenly released from prison in late 1965, the brothers could have simply decided to hang it up or retreat to plying safer music, but they instead decided to challenge Sukarno, writing a batch of songs that Irama Records was afraid to even record. The band landed at Mesra Records, where they recorded two albums, both of which were released in 1967, just in time to see Sukarno off, as he was deposed by Suharto, who reached out to the West and lifted the ineffective ban on rock music for good. Sublime Frequencies gathered both albums and a rare compilation track on <i>1967</i>.</p>
<p>The first of these albums, given the confrontational title <i>To the So-Called ""The Guilties"",</i> was recorded live in the studio, and the master tapes are long gone, so it has a rough-and-tumble, lo-fi quality to it. A few songs directly address their imprisonment, sometimes in English, while ""Poor Clown"" goes for the throat, belittling Sukarno himself. The guitars echo the early Beatles, and the band switches from two-part harmonies to rock shouting with ease. The other Koes album, a 10"" called <i>Djadikan Aku Domba Mu</i> (Make Me Your Sheep), is more sophisticated, and the band's songwriting makes an impressive leap. ""Bilakan Kamu Tetap Disini (I Wish You Would Stay Here)"" has an explosive chorus, while ""Lontjeng Jang Kentjil (Tiny Bell)"" is also excellent, with soaring guitar parts and an inventive vocal arrangement. Koes bravely didn't rely solely on tempo to carry their songs, writing impressive ballads and mid-tempo tunes that stand up nicely today.</p>
<p>The Dara Puspita volume pulls together 26 tracks from the band's first three LPs and one 10"", showcasing an energetic and inventive band that found all sorts of clever ways to reference their favorite Western songs without outright covering them. ""Pip Pip Yeah"", from their second album, <i>Special Editio</i>n, had a rocketing verse but changes things up for the bouncing chorus, where the band's ""pip pips"" directly reference the Beatles' ""Drive My Car"". You can hear their other influences prominently elsewhere: ""Ibu"" is an uncredited cover of the Beatles' ""She Said She Said"", ""Mengapa"" is reminiscent of the Dave Clark Five's ""Glad All Over"", ""Tanah Airku"" borrows a riff from ""Satisfaction"", and ""Believe Me"", the only English-language track included here, was written by Yok Koeswoyo. ""Believe Me"" is a true world beat classic, a song that could stand shoulder-to-shoulder with just about anything. You can quite literally drop in anywhere on this compilation and hear a long-lost garage rock pearl.</p>
<p>Both Koes Bersaudara and Dara Puspita lasted well beyond the years covered on these compilations, albeit with different lineups-- as Koes Plus, the Koes brothers released another 14 albums and remained one of Indonesia's most popular bands for nearly two decades, and Dara Puspita's 70s LPs are worth hearing, too, as they branched out stylistically and wrote some truly mesmerizing songs. Sukarno died well out of the spotlight in 1970 after struggling with kidney disease, and while today he's hailed as the father of Indonesia, his failure to repress rock'n'roll remains one chapter in a huge volume that proves good art will always outlast bad ideology. It will be interesting to see what other treasures Sublime Frequencies unearths on future volumes in this series (volumes on Panbers, Elly Kasim, Lilis Suryani, Pattie Bersaudara, Eddy Silitonga, the Blue Diamonds, the Steps and Ernie Djohan would all be welcome too), but if you're at all interested in 1960s pop music from outsdie the West, do not miss these.</p></div>"|14312.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14312-1967-1966-1968/|7.8|Joe Tangari

You're a little better off than most Indonesians, and you and your brothers spend a lot of time listening to Australian radio and the Voice of America, singing along to the Everly Brothers and Buddy Holly. It's not really an uncommon story-- it happened all over the world-- but in Jakarta, the Koeswoyo brothers, Tonny, Yok, Jon, Nomo and Yon, took their rock'n'roll dreams to the next level, actually forming a band. They called themselves simply Koes Bersuadara (bersaudara is a gender-neutral term that means siblings), and they started to write their own songs, recording a single in 1962 and an album in 1964 for Irama Records (literally Rhythm Records). And in 1965, things started to get complicated.</p>
<p>Indonesia had been ruled since its independence from the Dutch by Sukarno, a freedom fighter turned dictator who thought rock'n'roll was an expression of Western decadence, famously describing the music of the Beatles as a ""mental disease."" By the mid-60s, Sukarno had largely lost control of the Indonesian economy, embroiled the nation in a pointless war with his unambiguously named ""crush Malaysia"" policy, and leaned most heavily on the PKI, Indonesia's communist party, for support. Stamping out rock music became a sort of crusade for him, an extension of his attempts to exert control over a sprawling and diverse nation. His attempts were a monumental failure: The country produced a huge amount of pop music with clear shades of rock'n'roll and R&amp;B during Sukarno's final years in power.</p>

Emeralds, Tim Hecker, Kevin Drumm, Gavin Russom, Ben Frost, Black to Comm, and Oneohtrix Point Never are among a current wave of artists synthesizing their way to a kind of liquid nirvana, sculpting music into impossible shapes right there in the air between your speakers. Oneohtrix Point Never is the alias of Daniel Lopatin, a Brooklyn musician whose tarnished sci-fi yearnings are evident in his titles-- ""Betrayed in the Octagon"", ""Transmat Memories"", ""Laser to Laser"", ""Hyperdawn""-- and in his penchant for sad, sourly tuned analog synthesizers. Oneohtrix Point Never's music is in love with technology but finds it nevertheless a source of sadness, anxiety, and gleaming fatigue, as well as redemption.</p>
<p>Last year, his album <i>Rifts</i> collected two and a half hours of previously released material-- the albums <i>Betrayed in the Octagon</i>, <i>Zones Without People</i>, and <i>Russian Mind</i>, plus selections from various CD-R and cassette releases-- that added up to a remarkably singular vision. <i>Returnal</i> is much more compact, only eight tracks in 40 minutes; by design, it's more focused, sounding mostly like a set of music created with a specific set of instruments in a concentrated span. But it goes further than <i>Rifts</i>. It's denser and more complex. The clear 16th-note arpeggios that drive so many Oneohtrix Point Never tracks, when they appear at all, have been layered and blurred to the point of losing their definition. There's plenty in the swarming sound to compare to Emeralds' recent album <i>Does It Look Like I'm Here?</i>, which was also released by Peter Rehberg's Editions Mego label.</p>
<p>The album begins with a chaos that's uncharacteristic for Oneohtrix Point Never-- a wailing voice, feedback squeal, synthesizer drones, and overdriven drum blasts combust like a rocket on its launch pad. The track, ""Nil Admirari"", is an unexpected invocation of noise music, and also the only cut of its kind on the album. (It's not hard to see Rehberg's confrontational touch behind its sequencing.) In contrast, ""Describing Bodies"" is comparable to the ethereal shimmer of Wolfgang Voigt's Gas project. It emerges into earshot like a shape in the fog: A densely layered bed of strings supports a meandering synthesizer melody, but whatever motion is in the notes is all but swallowed up by the mass. ""Stress Waves"" is caught somewhere between the pulsing cycles of 60s minimalism and the untethered drift of Berlin's Chain Reaction label. It's gorgeous, heartbreaking even, but abstracted in a way that keeps it from tipping into the maudlin.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the arpeggios familiar from <i>Rifts</i> and <i>Zones Without People </i>return on the title track. It's a nostalgic sound, drenched in retro-futurist melancholy, conjuring a nightclub of the near future as it might have been imagined by some straight-to-VHS movie from the early 1980s. After the agonized atomic blast of ""Nil Admirari"", this is the record's other big surprise. Electronically processed and harmonized vocals lend it a palpably pop touch; throw a kinetic minimal techno rhythm underneath it, and it might be the Knife. ""Ouroboros"" is Lopatin at his sweetest, with keening synthesizer melodies not so far removed from something Boards of Canada might make; beatless, it moves with a rare, stately grace.</p>
<p>And then ""Preyouandi"", the closing track, takes the album subtly somewhere else. The slow, blurred synthesizers are of a piece with most of the album; muted, incidental vocals feature the same processing as the voice on ""Returnal"". But the soundfield rattles with percussion and delay, a glitchy rumble reminiscent of Vladislav Delay at his most dissipated. Paired with the opening ""Nil Admirari"" it bookends the record in percussion, something not often heard in Oneohtrix Point Never records-- and rarely heard quite this way.</p>
<p>You could call this ambient music, or <i>Kosmische</i>; it's certainly indebted to Tangerine Dream and Klaus Schulze. But it also sounds unusually original, which is a word you don't get to use so often. I'm tempted to say that it's an unusually tactile music, as though you could hear Lopatin feeling his way across the surfaces of his machines. (It is, without a doubt, incredibly sensuous music.) But I'm not sure that that's true, either, given the way the sounds so often seem to materialize out of thin air. Having softened his attacks and smeared his notes into indefinite shapes, he seems to sever the music from any kind of causality, so that it simply floats freely, morphing, rippling in a dance of infinite regeneration, like some perfect lifeform.</p></div>"|14326.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14326-returnal/|8.2|Philip Sherburne

As a group of underage buddies from the Toronto suburbs, their antsy take on post-Strokes rock was an easy upload for music blogs upon the 2006 release of their snappy <i>A Lesson in Crime</i> EP. Back then, their chances of living beyond the next Hype Machine cycle was anyone's guess, and any notions of longevity seemed moot for a band that preferred to wrap things up around the two-minute mark. But as other 2006 indie upstarts like Annuals, Be Your Own Pet, and Voxtrot have blown up or faded away, Tokyo Police Club endure. This is not a coincidence.</p>
<p>For a band that originally got great mileage out of their bubbling exuberance, TPC's 2008 LP bow <i>Elephant Shell</i> was a relatively stately surprise. Settling into a combination of 1990s emo-pop and 00s post-punk fizz, the group were growing up quick. (Perhaps too quick for some.) Singer and bassist David Monks' yelps were now grounded in gravel, his scratchy throat specked with Conor Oberst, Britt Daniel, and even a little bit of Paul Westerberg. Meanwhile, his words were often cryptic and deathly.</p>
<p>On the follow-up, <i>Champ</i>, TPC pull back on some of the beyond-their-years seriousness. Monks is still waxing about lost time and half-sour childhood memories, but he's also referencing 90s R&amp;B duo K-Ci &amp; JoJo and confessing his admittedly unwise dreams of wedding a dancer or ""a vegetarian who can't stand to be wrong."" The album title sounds like a casual term of endearment or a floppy dog. The polished tunes give off major-chord gleam. And the album opens with two pre-school-ready superlatives: ""Favourite Food"" and ""Favourite Colour"". These guys know how to make wasted youth blister, and <i>Champ</i> is brimming with radio-ready, ""woo hoo"" hooks for a right-of-the-dial station that no longer exists. Maybe they should chat with Phoenix's product placement team.</p>
<p>The new album is hardly a huge leap from <i>Elephant Shell</i> in most senses, but it does find TPC reaching out, growing more comfortable, and letting loose. The songs are a tad longer, and they earn the time. The tempos are upticked slightly, the background vocals more freewheeling. And at the center is guitarist Josh Hook's wafting high notes and Monks, who can't figure out girls or teen dreams despite his good intentions.</p>
<p>""I'm on your side so introduce me to your friends,"" he pleads on ""Boots of Danger (Wait Up)"", while the surging ""Big Difference"" has him powering through uncertainty with the help of some pointed counter melodies from Hook: ""I could get to know you better and never know you well."" This comes after the lighthearted grilling of one of TPC's best yet, ""Favourite Colour"", which has Monks wide-eyed, asking about the little things that can mean a lot. ""Tell me what's your favourite colour?"" he wonders. ""Tell me how's your younger brother?/ Tell me what's the very first record you owned?"" There's no bitterness or sarcasm or malice in Monks' quaver. He means well, even when he doesn't know exactly what hell he means.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it's Monks' worn-out benevolence that most separates TPC from other buzz-bin bullshit worth no more than a few megabytes. Like how the miles-wide smile known as ""Not Sick"" has the band embracing their early 20s while looking back with fondness. It's all twinkle and pop, like eyeing a county fair from above. ""Carolina, happy belated!"" hollers Monks, ""Always golden, still the greatest."" It's the end of angst. And it suggests this band could be even better late. Still, it ends right on time.</p></div>"|14335.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14335-champ/|7.6|Ryan Dombal

No wonder: The Dublin-based singer and songwriter's former group, the Immediate, imploded three years ago over ""existential differences."" In February 2009, hometown label Any Other City released Villagers' <i>The Hollow Kind</i> EP. There's a YouTube video from around the same time where O'Brien can be seen fronting at least a quartet, and the performance is stirring, though the guy looks a bit like Conor Oberst and Tracey Thorn in a ""how would their kids be?"" Photoshop mash-up.</p>
<p>Much as Oberst has wrestled with his own identity crises, shifting from Bright Eyes and Desaparecidos to his given name, Villagers' debut album obsesses over the gap between electric band and acoustic troubadour. In a recent appearance on ""Later... With Jools Holland"", O'Brien performed solo; in fact, he plays almost every instrument on <i>Becoming a Jackal</i>, and his portentous lyrics, falsetto-prone quaver, and Simon &amp; Garfunkel tunefulness are essential to the album's appeal. At the same time, the record is a bit more varied than the typical singer-songwriter drabness-- check the Battles-battling drum break at the end of mask fable ""Ship of Promises"", the bossa nova lilt to the Leonard Cohen breakup of ""Set the Tigers Free"", or the jarring crash that ends orchestral-pop opener ""I Saw the Dead"". O'Brien promises to ""meet you in between what I say and what I mean,"" and he's savvy enough to know the difference.</p>
<p>It seems significant that Villagers signed to Domino, a label better known for Franz Ferdinand, Arctic Monkeys, and Animal Collective; O'Brien recently told Brooklyn Vegan that Cass McCombs, another singer-songwriter with indie-rock appeal, was the matchmaker. So sure, O'Brien's falsetto-prone quaver suggests the righteous sincerity of Irish vocalists from Bono to Damien Rice and Glen Hansard, but <i>Becoming a Jackal</i>'s title track-- also its first single-- keeps 21st-century disillusionment beneath its sepia-toned teenage dreams: ""Before you take this song as truth/ You should wonder what I'm taking from you."" In a recent Resonant Frequencies column, Pitchfork's Mark Richardson talks about the thin line between maudlin and sublime, and to be sure, effort-laden over-seriousness occasionally combines with a tendency toward lazy rhymes here to put dirges like ""The Meaning of the Ritual"" and ""To Be Counted Among Men"" slightly on the wrong side of that divide.</p>
<p>Still, if you're willing to follow O'Brien over the top, there are glimmers of <i>I'm Wide Awake It's Morning</i>, or even that fleeting moment on <i>Funeral</i> when the Arcade Fire break out into a Motown bounce. ""Pieces"", the song Villagers perform in that old live YouTube clip, reappears on <i>Becoming a Jackal</i>, still exploring that line between band and balladeer, but also person and persona, emotion and cheap sentiment. Amid doo-wop piano and lofty strings, O'Brien describes the dilemma of the public artist who airs private confessions: ""There's a way down/ That I wish I had not found/ You split yourself in two/ One for them and one for you."" Shoring these fragments against the ruins of modern-day romance, O'Brien before long starts howling like a wolf, or a jackal, or a singer-songwriter, or a band leader. It's worth watching to see what he-- and Villagers-- will become next.</p></div>"|14322.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14322-becoming-a-jackal/|6.9|Marc Hogan

Alessio Natalizia is the more traditional musician of the pair, known mostly for his dreamy bedroom pop as Banjo or Freakout. Sam Willis is a producer and co-founder of the popular dance podcast series Allez-Allez. They both live in London, share a deep affinity for the kraut and ambient sounds of bands like Neu! and Harmonia, and linked up last year when Allez-Allez remixed the Banjo or Freakout track ""Dr. No"". Together they make music that sits at the middle point between their individual projects-- slow-burning guitar pop with a propulsive dance backdrop.</p>
<p>Their self-titled debut offers a downcast, almost shoegazer take on club music. Tracks are primarily instrumental and center on the contrast between Natalizia's treated guitars and Willis' crude synths. The production's on the lo-fi end, but it lends an evocative quality to the record, and the best songs play up the nostalgia with aching hooks. Opener ""Burnt Sienna"" is a good example of their range. It starts out with some light drum pitter-patter and ambient wash, builds into a powerful guitar drone, then opens up halfway through with a trashy synth melody. All the noisier bits suddenly become danceable and the song moves from anxiousness to something more hopeful.</p>
<p>Not everything on the record is quite this good, though there are a handful of other noteworthy tracks. ""Soft Cover People"" is another fine mixture of ambient noise and electronic melody; ""Gaberdine"" takes a tech-y <i>Computer World</i>-style arrangement and flips it into something straight-up haunting. But there's also some interstitial stuff here that feels slight-- songs like ""Cylopean Remains"" and ""Strawberry Sect"" don't hold up so well on their own. And ultimately they make the record feel a bit scattered and tossed-off, more like a side project than a cohesive statement. Still, if you're interested in the intersection of all these sounds-- ambient, bedroom pop, noise, drone, techno-- there's surely something here for you.</p></div>"|14338.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14338-walls/|6.6|Joe Colly

Amid now cavernous low-end, sandwiched between synths, sirens, and Wasner's Sarah McLachlan-esque vocals (not corny at all!), Freeland raps. It's a brave experiment, but the verse sounds out of place, one ill-advised misstep that's buffered by the four pieces of new material Wasner and Stack also recorded.</p>
<p>Those are all fantastic. ""My Neighbor"" is a rollicking strummer that meets Wasner's voice perfectly. The guitar tones boast nice crunch, Stack's drumwork adds just as much texture as verve. Where Wye Oak have sounded fairly correct and erect before, here they sound completely relaxed. Same goes for the clean chords of ""Emmylou"", which at times, despite that harmonica, sounds like it could have been lifted from a Death Cab demo. Those first two songs sit nicely atop the much more quiet second half of the EP, a setting in which Wye Oak usually seem most capable of mesmerizing.</p>
<p>""My Creator"" sets out to be a fingerpicked ballad before finding an extra gear by way of some very subtle saxophone coupled with organ. Overall, the duo have made good use of keys here more than in the past, a layer that serves them well. ""I Hope You Die"" has been up for freeload since March, and it is to date one of Stack and Wasner's finest moments. They don't make their way into a noise wash choosing instead to build upon a simple keyboard pulse, layer by layer, twirling synth to softer sax, until the song feels as though it's floating a few inches off the ground. When playing with negative space like they do here, Wye Oak seem to do the very same. Not at all the kind of EP that serves as stopgap or reintroduction, <i>My Neighbor/My Creator</i> stands up on its own.They're still at their best when milking silences.</p></div>"|14345.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14345-wye-oak/|7.2|David Bevan

It's not just that they were making great music; they'd been making great music for roughly a decade already. But these were the years during which they coalesced into this whole iconic <i>thing</i>, the Cure-- a sound, a look, and a sensibility that a few kids in every other high school could build whole identities around. Or at least whole wardrobes, decoration schemes, and notebook scribbles. One of my first big memories of listening to <i>Disintegration</i> involves wandering around the Colorado State Fair, from the agriculture show to the gang fights by the midway. This is a kind of reach I doubt Robert Smith ever imagined.</p>
<p>And yet there they were. You could say-- again, from an American perspective-- that it started with two things. There was <i>Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me</i>, a 1987 double album that scatters in a lot of different directions. This is something the band always did well: listening to their ""many moods"" pop records is like exploring a new city, where every storefront and side street offers something unique. The same went for <i>Standing on a Beach / Staring at the Sea</i>, a collection of singles stretching from 1978 to 1985, that was critical to introducing this band to North Americans.</p>
<p>But mostly there was <i>Disintegration</i>: the record where Robert Smith approached turning 30, got engaged and then married, got annoyed with the way his band was working, and went off by himself to write something deep and serious. <i>Disintegration</i> does not ""scatter."" It's a single, grand, dense, continual, epic trip into core stuff the Cure did well. They'd always been good at this kind of album, too. If <i>Kiss Me</i> is a crowded, teeming city to explore, listening to <i>Disintegration</i> is more like standing in the middle of some vast, empty space-- the kind of ocean or plain where you can see the horizon in all directions. You can sense that focus straight from the first minute, during which some wind chimes knock around in an empty void, and then the band bursts out with one of the most overwhelmingly grand openings I
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
've ever heard on a pop record-- a slow-motion, radiant synth figure of such scale that Sofia Coppola has plausibly used it to soundtrack the coronation of Louis XVI.</p>
<p>It's no wonder this was meaningful to a lot of teenagers: The sheer emotional grandeur of tracks like that opener, ""Plainsong"", make a great match for the feeling that everything in your life is all-consumingly important, whether it's your all-consuming sadness, joy, longing, or whatever. And yet <i>Disintegration</i> is not a very teenagey album. It's not an emo whine, and it's not a big miserablist mope, either; one of its most popular tracks, ""Lovesong"", was written by Smith as a wedding present for his wife. ""I will always love you,"" it keeps promising-- not the way you sing that in a giddy love song, but like it's a grave, solemn, bloody commitment. It was a top 10 hit in the U.S.</p>
<p>This is the thing: The album has a reputation as some huge, dark, crushingly depressive experience. It's not entirely unearned. If you want to be crushingly depressed with <i>Disintegration</i>, or frustrated, or self-loathing, it'll embrace you right back. But it'll embrace other things, too. A whole lot of this album's appeal is that it's <i>comforting</i>, practically womblike-- big, warm, slow, full of beauty and melody and even joy. The trick, I think, is how well it serves as a soundtrack to that feeling that everything around you is meaningful, whether it's beautiful or horrible or sublime: This is an album for capital-R Romantics, not sulkers. It's muscular (like on the title track), wistful (""Pictures of You""), ghostly (""Closedown""), seething (""Fascination Street""), and yeah, morose, but what's striking is how each of those qualities can reach really, really far into your gut. It's not a record for the dead-inside: Get far enough into this album, and I will almost guarantee <i>you will feel some shit</i>.</p>
<p>It's monolithic, and most of the songs work the same way. A lot of them are mostly ""intro"": The steady pulse of bass and guitar underneath, while glacially huge synth lines and liquid guitar melodies sparkle through the foreground. After a while, Smith's voice comes in, echoing calmly, surveying the ocean around him. On <i>Kiss Me</i> he yowled and croaked and had fun with it, but he spends the length of this album turning in tense, restrained performances, calm and steely and grave. The parts where he actually lets loose and starts raving are explosive. The title track, for instance, plunges further and further into a frustrated wail before climaxing on one phrase: ""Both of us knew/ How the end always is."" (You can take that climax as harrowing or cathartic or just plain fun.) Songs like this aren't organized around parts and movements, just steady repetition and emotional build. So at some point you realize that the intros aren't really ""intros,"" not just a period of waiting for things to start: sinking into the sound of this album-- a sound whose every element feels huge and magnificent-- is the whole point.</p>
<p>And that, to be honest, is the one drawback of this reissue. If I'm remembering correctly, the first pressings of <i>Disintegration</i> actually said, in the liner notes, ""this album was mixed to be played loud, so turn it up."" It was intentionally created with headroom to spare, and designed to be full of space-- every instrument surrounded by air, every echo trail clear and audible, an album that was above all comfortable to listen to. Like most remasters these days, this one has to pump up the volume toward modern levels, which means smushing things together and making parts fight for space. I'm not so cranky that this usually bothers me, but this is one album where it might really eat away at the point-- those horizons you used to be able to see in all directions have been moved miles closer.</p>
<p>On the plus side, there's the rest of the package. Previous reissues in this series have included home demos that felt more like curiosities than anything useful. But the ones here are enlightening; it's marvelous to hear them and consider how Smith's instrumental sketches came together into anything as <i>complete</i> as this record. (You can also chuckle at the cheery-sounding ones that obviously got axed along the way.) With this package, in fact, you can go from home demos to studio ones, from studio demos to the album, and then from the album to the third disc-- 1989 live recordings of each track, in order. And where are these ""crushingly depressive"" ghouls playing them? At Wembley Arena, in front of more than 10,000 people.</p></div>"|14288.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14288-disintegration-deluxe-edition/|10.0|Nitsuh Abebe

The building blocks of his music-- lightly plucked guitar, unhurried vocals, the occasional anti-establishment lyric-- makes it understandable for skeptics to paint him as merely a dorm-room fave.  But even though it sounds strange to say, ""there's more beyond the surface,"" to his unadorned music, at points <i>Veneer </i>and <i>In Our Nature </i>felt like what Krautrock or even minimal techno might sound like if they consisted solely of acoustic guitars. While it wasn't a sound that gave him a lot of room to maneuver, there always was underlying rhythmic force that could be hypnotic and haunting at the same time.  And it's a quality that his reformed band Junip amplifies, quite literally, on <i>Rope and Summit</i>.</p>
<p>""Got a rope and summit,"" González sings repeatedly at the outset, and while it's an economically evocative lyric, it's a bit of misdirection as to how Junip works. Theirs is a sound that doesn't move upward so much as downhill, accumulating its mass with sheer momentum. What's interesting is how little González needs to be pushed. A solo version of ""Rope and Summit"" might have been the most propulsive thing on any of his prior albums, but Elias Araya's drumwork gives it a vital pulse, while Tobias Winterkorn's drafty synths put meat on the bones. The rhythm section plays with a steady hand throughout <i>Rope</i>,<i> </i>favoring simplicity and shade while retaining the uncluttered sonic arranging that so often serves as a trademark of González's.</p>
<p>But while the first half of <i>Rope and Summit </i>seems to suggest that Junip could very well be González songs hooked up to jumper cables, ""At the Doors"" and ""Loops"" show that they can go slack without falling apart or falling asleep. The former rides its dank bassline and rumbling tom fills for eight mesmerizing minutes, feeling like it was effortlessly unearthed from a jam session that could've gone on for twice as long. And when González gently sings ""disconnect the loops"" on <i>Rope</i>'s gorgeous final track, it reflects on a looseness that fits somewhere between the late Talk Talk's more exploratory compositions (its central riff does have a passing resemblance to ""Taphead"") and the supine sungazing of Brightblack Morning Light.</p>
<p>I'll concede that the actual ""rock"" factor of ""Jose González's rock band"" is overplayed: The only distortion on <i>Rope </i>pops up as a light dusting on González's vocals. But what can't be overstated is that this is a <i>band</i>, and one that plays with a sympathy toward each member's sounds, so that <i>Rope </i>comes off like the work of a band that's been together for a decade rather than off and on. We won't have to wait long to hear more from Junip-- a full-length drops in September, and if it holds serve from <i>Rope, </i>the only disappointment will be that González could've been holding out on us for too long.</p></div>"|14341.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14341-rope-and-summit-ep/|8.0|Ian Cohen

Aside from its rudimentary sound quality, it's formally identical to this album, the Congolese band's second studio disc: the amazing sound of electric likembes (metal thumb pianos) playing through fuzzed-up amps and jury-rigged mics, augmented by drums, the occasional whistle, and some call-and-response yelling. Reportedly, the band is used to playing for hours on end. They could go on like that forever, which is both <i>Assume Crash Position</i>'s strength and its flaw.</p>
<p>It's been five years since <i>Congotronics</i> introduced Konono to a broader international audience. That record reached people who didn't know a thing about Congolese music, but loved the band's ping-buzz-crack timbre, admired their punkish ""use whatever materials are at hand"" attitude, and know a killer groove when they heard one. The group has released a few live discs since; it recorded with Björk and had a split single with the Dead C. Konono tour a lot, too. But being a touring act on the American and European festival circuits means you have to have a new record out every once in a while, which means you have to have a new bunch of songs and some kind of artistic evolution to act as a news peg.</p>
<p>Konono, though, simply aren't a song band. They're a live act that does one thing, unbelievably well, and in their way they're as formally limited as Sleep or the Stooges. And ""artistic evolution"" would be as much a disaster for them as it was for, say, the Ramones: As ""Mungua-Mungua"" demonstrates, they pretty much perfected their basic approach more than 30 years ago. So <i>Assume Crash Position</i> (reputedly a loose translation of the band's name) is a set of attempts to make a record that's not just <i>Congotronics</i> again, without destroying Konono's essence. Unsurprisingly, a couple of the four long jams that form the album's skeleton have been in their repertoire for a while: ""Konono Wa Wa Wa"", which gets an eleven and a half minute workout here, appeared on the live <i>Lubuaku</i> in 2004, and ""Mama Na Bana"" turned up on 2007's <i>Live at Couleur Cafe</i>.</p>
<p>There are a few divergences from the formula. ""Thin Legs"" is a brief likembe-less piece, just drums and voice; ""Wumbanzanga"" throws in some electric guitar and what might be keyboards; ""Guiyome"" sounds like it's just the head of what might be a much longer piece, and segues straight into ""Konono Wa Wa Wa"". And the closer, ""Nakobala Lisusu Te"", is septuagenarian bandleader (and amp-builder) Mawangu Mingiedi's solo, unamplified, forgettable voice-and-likembe piece. The formula beats all of the divergences--and that may mean that recording this magnificent band in the studio a second time was superfluous.</p></div>"|14314.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14314-assume-crash-position/|5.7|Douglas Wolk

He writes for his own voice, an instrument with a uniquely warm wryness and a limited range, which means his melodies are homey and modest, as if he's making them up on the spot. More crucially, his songs-- crammed with stray details and wonderfully skewed insights-- are strongly tied to his part huckster, part good ol' boy personality. Prine's a songwriter's songwriter, which means that the very traits that ought to make him hard to cover only make covering him an attractive notion. Many have pulled it off, too: George Strait, 10,000 Maniacs, Fairport Convention, and Johnny Cash.</p>
<p>Even so, an album of Prine covers is a dodgy proposition. It's bound to be erratic; tribute albums are by nature inconsistent, and the particulars of Prine's songwriting make it likely that just as many people will stagger as will step lively. By focusing on several insightful interpretations and by spotlighting some of Prine's lesser-known tracks, however, <i>Broken Hearts &amp; Dirty Windows</i> actually has some surprisingly high highs and some lows that are as forgivable as they are inevitable. No one covers ""Sam Stone"", thankfully, nor ""Hello in There"", ""Paradise"", or his biggest single, ""Come Back to Us Barbara Lewis Hare Krishna Beauregard"". Of course, someone's going to tackle ""Angel From Montgomery"", an aching, oft-covered tune that is one of Prine's most popular. Old Crow Medicine Show make it sound pretty rote, with singer Ketch Secor even mimicking Prine's distinctive cadence. They sound a bit overwhelmed.</p>
<p>For the most part, these are fan choices, revealing the less-explored depths of the tributee's catalog and reveling in the often contradictory aspects of his songwriting. Few of the artists, however, can actually capture that hardened ambiguity, that sense of laughing while crying. Recasting one of Prine's more boisterous songs as a quiet solo folk rumination, Josh Ritter savors the details of ""Mexican Home"", singing ""Take the fan from the window/ Prop the door back with a broom"" like he wished he'd written that line. But he sounds overserious, which makes the composition seem a bit stuff. Likewise, Sara Watkins has a perfectly lovely voice for the melody of ""The Late John Garfield Blues"", but she misses the song's gruff self-deprecation. Even though Prine wrote it in his mid-twenties, it's a song for and by a middle-age man.</p>
<p>But others strike a finer balance. Abandoning the ethereal folk of Bon Iver, Justin Vernon invests ""Bruised Orange (Chain of Sorrow)"" with an earthy gravity, packing in a novel's worth of detail in just four minutes. On ""Spanish Pipedream"", the Avett Brothers have a blast realizing that hippie escapism is both futile and fun, and it's been years since Conor Oberst has sounded as volatile and energetic as he does on ""Wedding Day in Funeralville"". The Drive-By Truckers' turn ""Daddy's Little Pumpkin"" into a bluesy stomp, and Mike Cooley sings it like he wrote it for Jerry Lee Lewis' lascivious leer. But the best moment may be Lambchop's ""Six O'Clock News"", a lesser-known track from Prine's 1971 debut. Singing in a clipped cadence, Kurt Wagner finds the ideal balance for the whimsical (""'God bless this kitchen,' said the knick-knack shelf"") and the grisly<span> </span>(""the whole town saw Jimmy on the six o'clock news/ His brains were on the sidewalk and blood was on his shoes""). It's a dark song, barely leavened by its glimpses of humor, but that's Prine's secret: heartache demands humor, and vice versa.</p></div>"|14337.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14337-broken-hearts-dirty-windows-songs-of-john-prine/|6.8|Stephen M.

He has a strong ear for proportion and balance, as if a single misplaced sound could trigger a collapse. At worst, his music can feel conservative and utilitarian, or overly cautious. There's a thin line between having an indelible personal stamp and charting by numbers. But at best, Arnalds' lucid forms and themes produce an agreeable opulence.</p>
<p>Before he was playing indie chamber music on tour with Sigur Rós, Arnalds played drums in hardcore bands with names like Fighting Shit. It is tempting to try and exhume some vestige of hardcore from his music, but that's a dead end. Arnalds' latest LP, with its almost hilariously generic post-rock title (the darkness, the ellipses, the vaguely heraldic voice!), is soft in every conceivable way: It's melodic, sensitive, rhythmically subdued. The most you can say is that a few tracks feature very prominent climaxes with laidback rock percussion, at which times the starry nocturnes flood with daylight. The occasional live drums, shimmering synths, and celestial vocal harmonies allow more force than usual into Arnalds' music, and it's a good look for him, even though he tends to be a dead ringer for Balmorhea, Peter Broderick, and Dirty Three at such moments.</p>
<p>The greater part of the album finds Arnalds up to his usual tricks, pouring honeyed strings back and forth over piano. His mildly irritating habit of launching his phrases in such rigid tandem they feel yoked together crops on ""Þú Ert Jörðin"", but the twist from natural to distorted tone in the piano line is beguiling. He has a fine knack for seductive yet tricky themes-- the circular, open-feeling phrases of ""Loftið Verður Skyndilega Kalt"" are especially good-- that live or die by their contexts. The piano and string duet ""Kjurrt"" is Arnalds as pure wallpaper, but ""Undan Hulu"", whose straightforward setting flirts with a similar fate, distinguishes itself with an uncommonly eloquent string part. The tempo shift on ""Hægt, Kemur Ljósið"" is delightful simply because it's so rare; the music more often has the intractable gait of a sleepwalker.</p>
<p>As Arnalds' boldest and most ambitious take on the form he's pursued so single-mindedly-- the robust yet ethereal, mid-tempo tearjerker-- <i>...And They Have Escaped the Weight of Darkness</i> is a success for the composer, and for listeners who don't balk at a little unabashed pageantry. Now that he's perfected that voice, another album of the same would be redundant, so let's hope that next time, he'll try something new-- perhaps something freer and less varnished.</p></div>"|14278.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14278-and-they-have-escaped-the-weight-of-darkness/|7.0|Brian Howe

The Cleveland trio may favor methodical cadences in their music, but their releases come fast and furious. According to Discogs.com, they've put out around 40 releases in just four years, most of them CDRs and cassettes. There are variations of mood and intensity, and each major release has its own particular signature, owing in part to changes in gear and technique, and in part to being a band that improvises and records non-stop. Any given album feels like a snapshot of the band in time.</p>
<p>But <i>Does It Look Like I'm Here?</i> is the first Emeralds record you might be able to call ""pretty."" Listeners accustomed to the multi-vectored force of last year's <i>What Happened</i>, with its crush of competing swells, might initially be taken aback by the linear progressions here. Emeralds also finally seem to be playing actual notes, not just dialing in frequencies.</p>
<p>The songs are shorter-- aside from one seven-minute jam and a 12-minute blur, everything is around three or four minutes long. That's partly because they're dividing their music into smaller grids and speeding up the changes. On <i>What Happened</i>, tones rolled out in languid fashion. That's still true here, but most of the album's tracks are built around arpeggiated backbones, bubbling sequences in 8th, 12th, or 16th note formations that focus the music's energy in a directed stream.</p>
<p>If what set Emeralds apart before was the fact that they sounded unlike almost anything else, here you can hear distinct echoes of other artists, whether it's the burbling synthesizer music of 70s musicians like Edgar Froese and Klaus Schulze, or arpeggio-prone contemporaries like Oneohtrix Point Never, Jonas Reinhardt, or Gavin Russom. ""Double Helix"" finds a halfway ground between the gritty shuffle of early Kompakt and the Balearic drift of Lindstrøm and Prins Thomas. And ""Now You See Me"" is an honest-to-god waltz led by folky strummed guitar.</p>
<p>But there's something about Emeralds' sound that really is theirs alone. (Timbrally, the band has never sounded richer-- thanks in part to James Plotkin's mastering job-- and that's especially true of the luscious heavyweight vinyl pressing, cut at Berlin's Dubplates &amp; Mastering.) The way they set loops against loops, with super-fast pinwheeling  oscillations buzzing out of control on top, turns their tracks into  perpetual motion machines, gathering  incredible force as layers accrue. It's a big part of the magic of this  band, and what distinguishes even their most new age-flavored compositions: the overload of information, the spray of frequencies, the thrilling, viscous rush.</p></div>"|14275.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14275-does-it-look-like-im-here/|8.3|Philip Sherburne

On the Swedish hardcore band's final album and masterpiece, David Sandström's shivering tings signal a sort of warning. They usually come right as the band launches from tense, coiled quiet into all-out assault-- or, if they're already in assault mode, from one head-spinning riff to another. Those transitions come up a lot on 1998's<i> The Shape of Punk to Come</i>, and they keep you on your toes. Throughout the record, the band found some platonic ideal of tension-and-release, mutating constantly and pulling in all sorts of vaguely silly genre-leap ideas (chintzy techno beats! jazz breaks!) without altering the fundamental heaviness that they were so great at. It's the sound of a world-class hardcore band deciding that they're done with hardcore, that they want to push their music in all sorts of unexpected directions, and then just ending up with an amazing hardcore album at the end.</p>
<p><i>The Shape of Punk to Come</i> has always been an album with a certain mystique, from the Ornette Coleman-referencing title (Coleman tweaked the title of a book by H.G. Wells for his LP <i>The Shape of Jazz to Come</i>)<i> </i>to the clouds-gathering whisper of a closing track, ""The Apollo Programme Was a Hoax"". It's far and away the best thing Refused ever did, and it's also the album that broke Refused up; they could reportedly barely stand each other by the time they got done with the thing. Besides the world-exploding album, Epitaph's new reissue includes all kinds of extras: A furious live album, a documentary, the incredibly pretentious original liner notes, music videos, and footage of the band playing every song on the album in concert. It's a lot to get through, and it's almost all rewarding; you learn, through crystalline recordings and grainy video, that Refused were the type of live band that would slice the top of your skull off.</p>
<p>But what the whole package doesn't offer
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
is a sense of context. For all the bluster of the title, it's not like the album invented angular guitar spazz-outs or prevented punk rock, as a whole, from falling into MySpace-emo hell a few years later (though it is telling that Paramore-- arguably the best of the MySpace emo wave, for whatever that's worth-- liberally quoted Refused's ""Liberation Frequency"" on their first album). <i>Refused Are Fuckin Dead</i>, the accompanying documentary, is supposed to explain why the band broke up in the wake of this clarion-call album, but it mostly just consists of arted-up landscape shots and ex-band members speaking as vaguely as possible about how much pressure they put on themselves. (Pet peeve: No chyrons to identify who's talking. Come on.) We don't learn what these guys <i>did</i>.</p>
<p>So here's what I think they did: They synthesized some of the greatest ideas to come out of American hardcore in the 1990s, and gave them just enough production sheen so that they sounded <i>huge</i>. Nation of Ulysses and Born Against were two of Refused's favorite reference points, and you can hear Nation of Ulysses' sloganeering, off-kilter skronk and Born Against's grainy, ferocious all-angles roar all over the album. But neither of those bands ever produced a document as viscerally gripping as <i>The Shape of Punk to Come</i>. That's partly because those bands never cared much for fidelity, whereas you can feel every one of Refused's snare-rolls in your chest. But it's also because Refused were great songwriters.</p>
<p>It's a stretch to link what this band did to Sweden's tradition for popcraft; after all, they weren't working with verse-chorus-verse structures or striving for melodic clarity. But it's pretty amazing how intuitively the members of Refused knew how to put together a hardcore song. Every track holds back at the right moments, explodes at the right moments. ""New Noise"", now and forever their defining statement, has an intro that lasts more than a minute-- insinuating, building, teasing, drawing back, and then suddenly shooting off out of nowhere. And when it kicks in, singer Dennis Lyxzén screaming, ""<i>Can I scream?!</i>"" as the guitars blast in behind him, is just a singularly thrilling moment of music. The guitar-crunch frenzy and Ric Flair whoops that follow are monstrous, but it's that intro that sticks with me.</p>
<p>And the album has plenty more moments that annihilate. Lyxzén's yelping, pleading, wailing vocal on ""Liberation Frequency"". The shockingly pretty quiet bits on ""Protest Song '68"", right before the fragment-bomb drums rip through. The epic, mournful gypsy violin on ""Tannäuser/Derivè"". The album absolutely does not sound like the work of a group of dudes who aren't speaking to each other. Rhythmically, all members are locked-in, feeding off each other's energy and authority. (Even without those cymbal taps, you could make a pretty good case for Sandström as the best punk drummer ever; he's on fire throughout.) They also sound like they trust each other enough to allow in potentially dubious ideas, like the cheesy Casio-techno breaks that occasionally pop up. And even those moments work in the context of the album; they're the parts where you get to compose yourself in anticipation of the next onslaught.</p>
<p>Those techno bits underline how over the top <i>The Shape of Punk to Come</i> can get, sometimes to the point of ridiculousness. The first lyric on the thing is this awkward-as-fuck line: ""I got a bone to pick with capitalism, and a few to break."" The title of the song ""Deadly Rhythm"", it turns out, refers to ""the production line."" But as hammy as those gestures might be, they also reinforce the album's central theme: Complacency is a creeping, crippling disease, one that every structure of society seeks to encourage, and it's something you have to flail against constantly, every day. As simplistic as that concept might be, it's also a potent one, and it led these guys, screaming in their second language, to make an album as brain-obliterating as this one-- even if it spun them to pieces in the process.</p></div>"|14330.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14330-the-shape-of-punk-to-come-a-chimerical-bombation-in-12-bursts-deluxe-edition/|9.4|Tom Breihan

The occasion was a celebration of the Chicago-born Shel Silverstein, and therein lies the writer's broad appeal. Silverstein, of course, wrote some of the most beloved children's books of all time (<i>Where the Sidewalk Ends</i>, <i>The Missing Piece</i>, <i>A Light in the Attic</i>, <i>The Giving Tree</i>), but his cartoons and poems also appeared regularly in the pages of <i>Playboy</i>. Silverstein wrote plenty of songs, too, ranging from kiddie fare (the diaper-set staple ""Boa Constrictor"") to songs made famous by the likes of Loretta Lynn (""One's On the Way""), Dr. Hook &amp; the Medicine Show (""The Cover of 'Rolling Stone'""), and Johnny Cash, who famously recorded both ""25 Minutes to Go"" and ""A Boy Named Sue"".</p>
<p>It's the late Silverstein's friendship and frequent collaboration with singer Bobby Bare that brought about <i>Twistable, Turnable Man: A Musical Tribute to the Songs of Shel Silverstein</i> and its attendant all-star cast. Bare recorded several of Silverstein's songs, beginning in the early 1970s, and eventually son Bobby Bare, Jr. got in on the act too. Between the two of them-- and of course taking into account Silverstein's enduring appeal-- an uncommonly good line-up of other friends and followers quickly came on board. Alas, Oldham's not here, but plenty of Silverstein peers (such as John Prine and Kris Kristofferson, both of whom had written with Silverstein) are, plus younger fans (like My Morning Jacket and Andrew Bird), with Silverstein's whimsical but memorable compositions given an array of welcome if mostly safe readings.</p>
<p>Perhaps most unconventional is Bird's take on the title track, if only because Bird apparently knew Silverstein only as a writer and crafted his own Bird-like tune around the poem he picked. Yet several other tracks here reveal a few subtle new facets of Silverstein and performer alike. My Morning Jacket, for example, recorded a version of ""Lullabys, Legends and Lies"" true to its roots (it was the title track of Bare's 1973 collection of Silverstein songs), but much more straight-up country than the band is generally known for (MMJ closes the album with a similarly conservative-- duration aside-- ""26 Second Song""). Frank Black and Joey Santiago turn ""The Cover of the 'Rolling Stone'"" inside out, into a strange conflation of Black's own country forays and Santiago's trademark skronk. Dr. Dog turns the folky ""Unicorn Song"" into a kitschy 60s trip.</p>
<p>Of course, plenty of acts on hand provide exactly what you might expect. Lucinda Williams' haunting version of ""The Ballad of Lucy Jordan"" underscores what Bare has noted as the relative dearth of female-centric songs in the Silverstein catalog. Against all odds, Todd Snider does ""A Boy Named Sue"" justice by simply following Cash's lead and not taking himself too seriously. Likewise good-sport Kristofferson's rendition of ""The Winner"" offers well-phrased winking couplet after couplet, and keeping in character John Prine sounds suitably and effectively grizzled on ""This Guitar Is for Sale"". Alas, Nanci Griffith's predictably over-earnest ""The Giving Tree"" leans too hard on sentimentality, and while Sarah Jarosz fronts the Decemberists' bluegrass spin-off Black Prairie for a fine take on the prostitute tale ""Queen of the Silver Dollar"", the results don't rise above ""Prairie Home Companion"" fodder. Country legend Ray Price, on the other hand, makes ""Me and Jimmy Rodgers"" sound like a decades-old jukebox staple.</p>
<p>And then there's ""Daddy What If"", a sweet novelty that sums up the project quite nicely. Bobby Bare had a country hit with the song back in 1973, featuring his then six-year-old son as a duet partner. Here Bobby Bare, Jr. repeats the gesture, only with his own small daughter doing duet duties. If anything, neither this song nor anything on <i>Twistable, Turnable Man</i>, is particularly definitive, but Silverstein's simple songs don't really lend themselves to definitive performances (OK, ""A Boy Named Sue"" aside). Designed as such or not, they're not really songs for anybody in particular. They're songs for everybody, made to be passed on from generation and generation like a well-worn copy of <i>A Light in the Attic</i>.</p></div>"|14325.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14325-twistable-turnable-man-a-musical-tribute-to-the-songs-of-shel-silverstein/|6.8|Joshua Klein

One of its most striking songs is ""Fot I Hose"", a dance track with infectious bass synths scudding over a sizzling rhythm section. It's the song that turned me on to Norway's Casiokids two years ago, when it appeared on a sampler CD for the 2008 Øya Festival in Oslo. When I saw them live, they augmented their genial free-for-all of dance, electro-pop, indie-rock, and Afro-pop styles with giant marionettes, shadow puppets, and videos. My impression was of an ambitious but humble band working hard to make their demanding music sound effortless, as to provide their audience with a frictionless good time.</p>
<p>While Casiokids hail from Bergen-- not exactly a cultural backwater, having already produced Datarock and Annie-- it took the support of Kevin Barnes (Of Montreal) to get them signed in the U.S. The foreign vocals were probably the sticking point, which has turned into a point of pride for Polyvinyl, who claim that this is the first Norwegian-language pop album ever released stateside. But this is no stretch for American audiences who've embraced bands like Dungen and Malajube. Casiokids' silky vocal harmonies, running the gamut from Brian Wilson-classic to Animal Collective-quirky, amply distinguish the songs by emotional register. In light of this trendy, appealing sound, it seems crazy that it took so long for these great vibes to infiltrate American bars.</p>
<p>It's also a blessing. Young bands seldom get to incubate any more, and Casiokids used their prep time wisely, piecing together a proper album instead of rushing to pad out a few inspired tracks with filler. The record has a unified vibe and a strong sense of balance, but also varies greatly from track to track. ""Grønt Lys I Alle Ledd"" is languorous and loping, with a breezy indie-rock feel, while ""Verdens Største  Land"" is sleek and taut, more European and cosmopolitan. These two styles are the album's bedrock, but scattered about you'll find digested traces of spaghetti Western, British folk, and Afrobeat. Woodblocks, guiros, and handclaps texture the organic-feeling melodies. The first half is stronger, but nothing feels throwaway-- the passion and the new ideas are always there. Concise at eight songs, it doesn't feel miserly, just smartly pared down.</p>
<p>The overall aesthetic is a deep-contrast balance of tropic and cosmic. This is especially pronounced on ""Togens Hule"", which opens with a spacey duet for bleating and whistling synths that would feel right at home on album by diskJokke. It's the kind of screwy, endearing curio that Casiokids use to lighten up their music, but it turns into a more serious-business synth anthem that reprises the feline ""ya ya ya"" harmonies from the first track, bringing the album to a satisfying close. This speaks to Casiokids' sensitivity to the listener's desire for gratification, a concept to which so many bands seem either ambivalent or hostile. Their self-indulgent gestures exist only to set up generous ones, sticking around long enough to delight, but not to alienate. If they start to chase their muse too far into left field, they catch themselves and double back. Their patient, considerate way of working has paid off with an uncommonly ripened and grounded debut.</p></div>"|14303.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14303-topp-stemning-pa-lokal-bar/|7.6|Brian Howe

The album was asymmetrical and nuanced, but it was never encumbered by pretension or obviousness, and its gravelly sound gave it the feel of an old, lived-in rock record. <i>Living</i>, Pontiak's fifth album in two years, has some of that same rawness, but it lacks the intricacies that distinguish Pontiak's rock'n'roll from everyone else's.</p>
<p>Even though there are a dozen songs on <i>Living</i>, it basically relies on four types of song structure: riffy blues-rock; rumbling noise; gooey sludge; and swampy, often acoustic, dirges. Rarely do the styles converge in a single track or expand on familiar sounds, something that is particularly crippling when roughly half of the album is instrumental. To its credit, <i>Living</i> is cohesive, with the songs fluidly oozing into each other. But the loose lyrical concept of the album-- something about a ""lemon lady"" and an evocation of geographical locations, possibly during the apocalypse-- is about as half-baked and muddled as I imagine the band was while they were making this album.</p>
<p><i>Living</i> was recorded on an old reel-to-reel in a farmhouse, and it sounds like it. This could have given the album a singular murkiness, but instead it obliterates the music's sonic depth. The rhythm section is mostly absent; the mix chars the drums and nearly evaporates the bass. There were moments on <i>Maker</i> where this was also the case-- but whenever that was so, the width of guitar feedback would shroud the rhythms, absorbing the energy of one aspect of the sound without compromising it. Here, on ""And by Night"" and ""Second Sun"", the rumbling drum fills and bass hits would have benefited from being louder and thicker, making them more than just a giant, nondescript interlude into the next part of the album.</p>
<p><i>Living</i> does become more dynamic towards the end, with the morphing ""Lemon Lady"" and the tension of ""Thousands Citrus"" standing out as highlights. The opening track, ""Young"", scorches, its swinging crunch exhibiting the imprints of Black Sabbath and Deep Purple without being derivative of either. The rest of <i>Living</i> works pretty well as background music: I washed a difficult load of dishes without ever being distracted by it. Yet the sound of this album doesn't strike me as the kind the band wishes their audience would associate with the mundane. It seems like they wanted to make a spooky, rural record that also rocks-- but <i>Living</i> rarely does.</p></div>"|14311.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14311-living/|5.6|Tal Rosenberg

The New York duo of Mike Stroud and Evan Mast has been stylish and functional from the start, right down to their name, which expresses the same concussive energy as their stomping hooks. Their sound-- slick electro-pop infused with hip-hop-- emerged fully formed on their 2004 self-titled debut, quickly making them a highly recognizable brand, and six years on, it retains the vitality that made it click in the first place.</p>
<p>Album number two, <i>Classics</i>, was more of the same, but fiercer. And though it would still be a few years until Ratatat began to earn rap production credits, cutting two tracks for Kid Cudi's <i>Man on the Moon</i>, they were already polishing up their hip-hop bona fides with a compelling remix series. From there, they decamped from Brooklyn to the Catskills' Old Soul Studios to record <i>LP3</i>, which managed, somehow, to derive no perceptible influence from the change of scenery, and had about as much charisma as its utilitarian title. Ratatat's style was in need of freshening up, and adding more keyboards to their live set didn't quite do the trick.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, <i>LP4 </i>is staler still, collecting the tracks from the Old Soul sessions that weren't released on the last record. Stroud and Mast attempt to provide some distinctive qualities by tossing in some novel instrumentation, but the inclusion of ""Mahalo"", a thin interlude that was already the B-side of <i>LP3</i> single ""Shiller"", suggests bucket-scraping. An array of harpsichords, Japanese strings, and talkboxes are grafted on here in a seemingly desperate attempt to add some kind of variety, but the effects ultimately wind up feeling like limp distractions.</p>
<p><i>LP4 </i>makes the classic mistake of trying to fix an exhausted sound by inundation instead of revision. Familiar fuzz-bomb chords and slinky, wailing guitar leads provide the foundation. Otherwise, quirky vocal samples still loosely frame the instrumentals, and soft-focused genre exercises-- a little bossa nova here (""Party With Children""), a little Balkan folk there (""Bare Feast"")-- still prevail. Even the tightest tracks, like ""Drugs"", feel lukewarm compared to earlier work in a similar vein, while ""Neckbrace"" wanders through a rogue's gallery of studio indulgences without ever finding a clear center. Ratatat always aimed for the flashy yet mass-produced flavor of sub-luxe fashion and lifestyle accessories-- and for at least two albums, they hit their mark. But at this point, their sound is wearing increasingly thin and producing diminished results.</p></div>"|14331.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14331-lp4/|5.2|Brian Howe

Bearing a passing resemblance to Ralph Macchio's <i>Karate Kid</i> nemesis William Zabka, Pierce prances and preens through a performance of recent single ""Best Friend"" in a series of stilted robot dance moves, sweeping game-show-host hand gestures, and bug-eyed facial expressions, while delivering the arch, Morrissey-worthy lyrics (""You were my best friend/ But then you died"") in a hammy, lounge-singer baritone. But then, given Pierce's track record, it's not surprising he has a healthy appreciation for the absurd; this is a man, after all, who called his old band Goat Explosion.</p>
<p>In 2005, Goat Explosion-- also featuring future Drums co-founder Jacob Graham-- changed its name to the somewhat less ridiculous Elkland and were snapped up by Columbia Records during the post-Franz Ferdinand/Killers major-label rush to sign any new wave-inspired band with swooping-fringe haircuts. However, the failure of Elkland's glossy, stadium-sized synth-pop to connect with the masses would seemingly account for the Drums' more modest, minimalist reinterpretation-- and reinvigoration-- of the same 80s mope-pop inspirations (New Order, the Cure, the Smiths, Orange Juice), one that's more likely to ingratiate itself to fans of the Labrador and Sincerely Yours rosters than KROQ programmers.</p>
<p>It says a lot about the Drums' confidence that they've left two of their best (and best-loved) early songs, ""I Felt Stupid"" and ""Submarine"", off of their full-length debut-- and they're not entirely missed either. (The band did retain its biggest blog hit-- ""Let's Go Surfing"", a cheeky retort to the recent blissed-out, beach-crazy strain in indie pop.) However, other songs that try to build upon the ""Stupid"" template-- accelerated click-track drum beats, one-string Barney Sumner guitar riffs, and woe-is-me verses that lead to cloud-parting choruses-- don't always improve on it, with the cutting observations of ""Me and the Moon"" (""you still sleep with your back to me"") overshadowed by the annoying shout of ""eeyoh!"" that punctuates each chorus run. And there are times when Pierce's outsized persona meshes awkwardly with his band's understated approach, like when he uses the stark arrangement of 50s-throwback ballad ""Down By the Water"" as an excuse to test out his back-of-the-arena wail.</p>
<p>More so than their well-curated influences, it's this tension-- between the band's populist and insular tendencies-- that most defines the Drums at this point in their career. Conventional wisdom dictates that the Drums will simply follow the New Order evolutionary path toward writing big-tent festival anthems (a future prophesied by the anthemic, widescreen synth-pop of ""Forever and Ever Amen""). But there is just as much evidence to suggest-- particularly in the album's less exuberant but more revelatory second half-- that the band this band truly excels in more intimate spaces, like the affectingly desolate motorik pop of ""I Need Fun in My Life"" and the wonderful ""I'll Never Drop My Sword"", a winsome, jangly ode to perseverance featuring an appealingly effete vocal that Pierce should adopt more often. No surprise then that the suggestively titled closer ""The Future"" provides little indication of what it holds for the Drums: Pierce's chesty bellow sees him prepping himself for a lifetime of camera-mugging late-night talk-show appearances, but the symphony of glockenspiels ringing throughout the song projects an air of snow-globe serenity, and of a band that's eager to insulate itself from external hype and pressures.</p>
<p>Like the Strokes, another fast-rising band of pretty-boy New Yorkers, the Drums have successfully answered the challenge of parlaying buzz-generating singles into an album that's well stocked with instantly appealing pop songs. Unlike the Strokes, however, the Drums lack a certain element of surprise-- they so faithfully adhere to 80s post-punk and new pop influences even after a decade where those sources have been thoroughly milked. But then that could ultimately be to the Drums' benefit-- in that they're so behind the curve, they're practically ahead of a new one.</p></div>"|14333.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14333-the-drums/|7.5|Stuart Berman

It's becoming increasingly obvious that <span>Trentemøller accomplishes this by infinitely re-inventing combinations of a relatively scaled-down toolkit: The frequent intermingling of shadows of minimal techno beats, the cutting austerity of surf rock whammy dives, 8-bit orchestras swelling into static. It's maybe most charming that <i>Resort</i> throws everything but the kitchen sink at you, but ""everything"" could pass muster at your local supermarket's express aisle.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span>Such moody, humanistic motifs dominate <i>Into the Great Wide Yonder</i>. Surf-inspired reverb guitar dots the record's highlight tracks, especially on ""Silver Surfer, Ghost Rider Go!!!"", on which cymbals and synthetic handclaps ride a wave of guitar fuzz and synths into surprisingly psychedelic territory. Unfortunately, <i>Yonder</i>'s further analog forays are met with sometimes mixed results. Featuring the vocal talents (!) of fellow Dane Marie Fisker, <i>Yonder's</i> first single ""Sycamore Feeling"" opens with sleigh bells and the strums of an acoustic guitar: not exactly your everyday Nordic producer-type cut. The happy accidents only occasionally hit paydirt, however, as Fisker's smoky vocals somehow manage to vamp awkwardly over the chorus. There's almost too much to process considering Trentemøller's <span> </span>studiously prepared low-key arrangement.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span>Throughout, <i>Yonder</i>'s melo

dic sensibility is only occasionally led by vocalists, featuring the guest talents of </span>Solveig Sandnes and Josephine Philip (also Danish) and Guillemots vocalist Fyfe Dangerfield, but at all points the collaborations want for <span>Trentemøller's melodic instrumental sensibilities. Take ""Neverglade"", which under-utilizes Dangerfield's suitably dangerous yowl. The head Guillemot recalls echoes of Elliott Smith and incessantly repeats Pavement homages to the ""weatherman's sign of crooked rain, crooked rain."" His contribution's confused homage seems counterintuitive considering the co-collaborators' varied talents.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span>However, not all the tracks lack the verve of Trentemøller's best instrumental work. The closing ""Tide""'s lilt, its piano, live percussion, and church-bell effects soar. Some of the record's instrumental tracks, conversely, distort Trentemøller's agnostic stance towards dancefloor beats and electronic textures. You certainly don't blame him for seeking his own analog path, but some of <i>Yonder</i>'s instrumentals lean on variety at the expense of a compositional base. Take <i>The Last Resort</i>, released in October 2006: That singles comp was an autumn record that nevertheless pounded down (in its special-edition, two-disc glory) like a premature hundred and 50-minute winter. By comparison, <i>Into the Great Wide </i><i>Yonder</i> toes the line: Either it's a cold and intricate mélange of kaleidoscopic, cybernetic styles, or it's a simple hot mess.</span></p></div>"|14306.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14306-into-the-great-wide-yonder/|6.5|Mike Orme

Shortly afterwards, they graduated to larger local indie Twin/Tone for 1989's <i>Blue Earth</i>, then to American Recordings for 1992's career-making <i>Hollywood Town Hall</i>, yet even as the Jayhawks became alt-country forebears, <i>The Bunkhouse Album</i> (as it became known among fans) remained more myth than music, a rumor on primitive online message boards that became currency for anyone who claimed to have heard it. Now, nearly 20 years after most diehard fans have drifted away, when the Jayhawks barely exist as a band, the album is finally getting a reissue, making its way to CD and digital for the first time ever.</p>
<p>Fifteen years ago, this reissue would have made a lot more sense. Predating Uncle Tupelo's debut by four years, it's one of the earliest alt-country documents, a harbinger of the 90s roots movement that would contrast so sharply with that decade's pervasive irony. And yet, in 2010, when that trend has played out, it sounds like an artifact from a very different era. For the Jayhawks, <i>The Bunkhouse Album</i> is a record of their earliest days; it was made only a year after they'd formed and reveals the band at a very early stage of development, when they were just figuring out what they wanted to be.</p>
<p>The blend of Bakersfield and old-time country with classic rock elements didn't come easy for them yet, but those tight harmonies between Mark Olson and Gary Louris, which have since become the band's defining trait, are present almost from the first notes of opener ""Falling Star"", as if they occur naturally and effortlessly. Olson, the primary lyricist on this album, writes about petty crooks, drunks, cherry pie, and jail, yet he's never quite believable: Those subjects seem more like country signifiers-- what he thinks these types of songs should be about-- and less like any kind of lived experience or personal observations.</p>
<p>What redeems these songs-- what makes them sound like the band has been playing them for more than just a year-- is the production by Charlie Pine, a Minneapolis stockbroker who became their de facto manager and No. 1 fan. He gives songs like ""People in This Place on Every Side"" and ""Six Pack on the Dashboard"" crucial depth, emphasizing the interplay between the instruments, especially the guitars. Louris' and Olson's licks intersect in interesting ways, while Marc Perlman's bass bobs along underneath. They're a good band on their way to becoming a great one, so if <i>The Bunkhouse Album</i> isn't a revelation, it serves as a new point from which to measure the Jayhawks' progress.</p></div>"|14248.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14248-the-jayhawks/|6.0|Stephen M.

Maybe he'll be back and maybe he won't: His band's first kiss-off was <i>They Could Have Been Bigger Than the Beatles</i>, back in 1982, and they recorded one of the greatest goodbye-to-all-that albums ever, <i>Closer to God</i>, a decade after that. MGMT's ""Song for Dan Treacy"" was a conceptual variation on Treacy's own ""I Know Where Syd Barrett Lives"", an encomium to a hero who's still alive but lost. Somehow, though, the TVPs keep turning up to get the final word in.</p>
<p>Treacy's persona has always been a sort of tormented dandy-- a frail, high-aesthetic gentleman who's been screwed by coming from the wrong end of the British class system, filtering his fury through Pop Art and pop songs-- and he's never been shy about showing his scars. But after all the drugs and the professional struggles and the jail time, he seems somewhat impaired as a songwriter and performer. He's definitely not <i>gone</i>, like latter-day Brian Wilson or Syd Barrett, and a good deal of his old sharp-toothed wit is intact, but not all of it. He sounds not just scarred but damaged. So <i>A Memory Is Better Than Nothing</i> is an album about hurting so badly that it's no longer possible to express the pain clearly, which makes it tough to listen to but also tough to dismiss.</p>
<p>The band isn't just Treacy, fortunately; he's got a backup team to flesh out his sketches, and most of these songs have nicely realized arrangements propping up his wobbly voice, more or less in the mode of the first few Television Personalities albums. ""All the Things You Are"" is the sort of crushed-hearted throwaway he could have pulled off at any time in his career; when he gets to the big chorus of ""She's My Yoko"", it sounds like he's making a Herculean effort to pull himself together, but he does make it.</p>
<p>A couple of songs make good use of Johanna Lundström's voice, which is fragile in a very different way--the skeletal version of ""The Good Anarchist"" that appeared on a single a couple of years back was sung by Lundström without Treacy, in fact. (He adds a verse to this take, which ends with the kind of sped-up elfin voices he used on ""I Know Where Syd Barrett Lives"" decades ago.) When the album's bad, though, it's wretched: the five minutes of aimless jamming at the end of ""My New Tattoo"", the doomed come-on of ""Come Back to Bed"", the limp ""See Emily Play""-isms of ""Except For Jennifer"", the way ""If You Don't Want Me"" tries and fails to build a song out of a single half-baked idea. Too often, <i>A Memory</i> depends on its listeners' own memories of Television Personalities' fuming force to contextualize a band mustering up the few resources that remain to them.</p></div>"|14302.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14302-a-memory-is-better-than-nothing/|4.2|Douglas Wolk

From the beginning, Pink was presented as an outsider, a recluse who obsessively recorded at home and had compiled hundreds of unheard songs. The notion that he was a supremely strange person making music in his own world was fully supported by the string of albums, singles, and EPs that followed. First, there was the music itself, which saw Pink using an ultra lo-fo recording set-up to re-imagine cheesy AM radio jingles and lost new wave tracks as surreal, art-damaged pop. His music could be bizarre and disturbing, with warped voices and dark subject manner evoking loneliness, bad drugs, and alienation; it could also be sweet and even sincere, celebrating the pleasure of a well-rendered verse melody and a good chorus.</p>
<p>Then there was the fact that the recordings themselves had apparently been excavated from a cache of material from another time: The vast majority of the music he's released since 2004 was written and recorded years earlier, mostly between 1998 and 2002. So a certain amount of mystery was part of the package, and the recordings weren't giving anything away. His releases never struck me as possessing the level of genius his most ardent supporters hear in them, but that was OK, because he didn't seem like he was setting out to make masterpieces.</p>
<p>Something unusual has happened to Ariel Pink since he first started sharing those tapes with the wider world, though. Think of it like the cliché about <i>The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico</i>, but on a smaller, more craft-y scale: His records didn't reach a lot of people, but many of those who heard them were inspired to start home recording projects of their own. So as different kinds of lo-fi music bubbled up from the indie underground in the last couple of years-- from more placid chillwave to roughed-up garage rock to abstract instrumental music-- and many of these bands were talking about his influence, all of a sudden Ariel Pink started looking way ahead of the game. And now, he's been given a chance to do something few artists working on his scale ever do: record an album more or less professionally for a large independent label and enjoy all the increased attention such a leap provides. He did not waste the opportunity.</p>
<p>Oddly, the difference in fidelity isn't what sets this record apart from earlier Ariel Pink releases. While much of the tape hiss that marked those records is gone, along with the degraded audio quality that came off those old, decaying cassettes, this is still a pretty modest-sounding LP, recorded simply and cleanly but not, from the sound of it, expensively. Haunted Graffiti, which began as an abstract concept, has also turned into a full band featuring experienced members who've spent years playing in established independent acts, and each took care to get their various parts right. The vocal harmonies overlap just so, the guitar fills are in the right places, the drumming is tight and precise, and bassist Tim Koh in particular colors the songs with striking rhythmic and countermelodic depth. It turns out that these details make a big difference, even while the album adheres to the hazy overriding aesthetic of Pink's earlier records. The fact that this is, in a sense, Ariel Pink's first group of songs created to be released together and presented as a whole-- as an <i>album</i>, rather than as a collection of songs recorded years ago-- sets the table for a new focus.</p>
<p>We know from interviews that Ariel Pink grew up absorbing throwaway pop from the 70s and 80s, finding a way to make it all fit into his cracked worldview. Something overlooked about those songs, though, is that the people writing them were pros who knew something about intros, codas, and middle-eights, how a certain kind of chord change can cause the turnaround to the chorus to hit a little harder. Ariel Pink's best songs are <i>surprising, </i>and there's a real sense of musical delight on <i>Before Today</i>; the sections sound logical but never predictable, and there are wild bridges and short bits that emerge seemingly randomly but wind up taking the song somewhere unexpected. So ""L'estat (Acc. to the Widow's Maid)"" goes from a rollicking organ-led opening section to a catchy call-and-response chorus hook the Monkees might have liked to a short double-time instrumental section to a jubilant coda, and all the while the stitches never show. Songs like ""Little Wig"" have so many interesting interlocking parts that they can almost feel proggy, despite their relative brevity and tight pop structures.</p>
<p>Since a number of these songs exist in earlier versions on other records, it's easy to hear how they benefit from <i>Before Today</i>'s more worked-over approach. ""Beverly Kills"" was a fine song in its original incarnation on the 2002 edition of <i>Scared Famous</i> (it also appeared on last year's <i>Grandes Exitos</i> comp), but it has so much more power here. Opening with roller-rink keyboards, a popping bass, and car chase sound effects, it feels loose and casual until the falsetto vocals snap into place, sounding suddenly  like Philip Bailey on a lost Earth, Wind &amp; Fire jam. The delicate soft rock of ""Can't Hear My Eyes"", also heard twice before in slightly cruder forms, benefits greatly from just a few more dabs of production mousse. It's a song that <i>wants </i>to be slick, bringing to mind carefully layered singles by Alan Parsons Project, complete with swells of synthetic strings and a smooth sax interlude.</p>
<p>And then there's ""Round and Round"", one of indiedom's most unifying and memorable songs in 2010, which is barely recognizable from its early four-track incarnation as ""Frontman/Hold On (I'm Calling)"". It's another song of smartly integrated units of melody, any one of which might be built out into a great song of its own, but which together become something astonishing. Its circular bassline doubles with low-chanted voices that build up tension and mystery, a connecting section that opens the song up with a high-pitched plea, and an interlude section with a ringing phone and some jazzy keyboards, all of which build to the massive sing-along chorus. ""Round and Round"" was mastered at Abbey Road, and not a cent of that cost was wasted. It is endlessly replayable.</p>
<p>Alongside these grabbier tunes are tracks that retain the uncanny, otherworldly sense that has been a constant thread through Ariel Pink's music. Best among these is ""Menopause Man,"" which goes from grim deadpan verses to a fascinatingly beautiful chorus that sounds beamed in from another era, yet remains elusive and difficult to place. But even given the varied style and tone on <i>Before Today</i>-- there's a queasy instrumental and a faithful cover of the 60s garage rock song ""Bright Lit Blue Skies""-- it feels of a piece and uniformly strong, and there's so much going on that it only seems to improve the more you listen to it.</p>
<p>It's a rare feat for artists to maintain a truly unique sound while taking their music in a direction that appeals to a wider audience. For those who've been following along for a few years, this is a groundbreaking record that condenses and amplifies Ariel Pink's most accessible tendencies. But the brilliant thing about <i>Before Today</i> is that no prior knowledge of his catalog is required. Newcomers can dig into this record and absorb all of these weird and wonderful songs now, and save the backstory for another day.</p></div>"|14324.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14324-before-today/|9.0|Mark Richardson

Thus, when ""Collector"", the second track from Here We Go Magic's second LP and first as a full band, <i>Pigeons</i>, began to make the blog rounds, there was quite a bit of chatter about the album possibly being the band's-- and its bandleader, Luke Temple's-- breakout moment. Makes sense: It's hard to listen to ""Collector""-- one of the finest pieces of post-Sufjan Stevens chamber pop-- and not get excited about <i>something</i>. Can anyone be blamed for hoping that the rest of the record would endlessly vibe on that theme?</p>
<p>Whatever the case, <i>Pigeons</i> is not the sparkling, fully realized breakout effort many of us hoped from this band. Nothing is as precisely organized and self-contained as ""Collector"", as the album's other similarly rhythmic, pulsing moments arise more from Here We Go Magic's reliance on looped melodic fragments than any discernible krautrock influence.  As such, <i>Pigeons</i> feels less divorced from the bedroom freak-folk of the project's self-titled debut (recorded by Temple all by his lonesome, with the assistance of a looping pedal or two) than it seems the logical extension of that aesthetic.</p>
<p>Somewhat surprisingly, especially given the debut's minor faults, the woodshedded feel of <i>Pigeons</i> is a good look for the band. Here We Go Magic are doing something more interesting-- something weirder; they're trying out takes on jittery new wave, tone-smeared dream-pop, and high-pitched Kiwi pop with success. The normally frustrating aspect of transitional albums is that bands that make them tend to get lost in their own experimentation; instead, Here We Go Magic attack their shape-shifting sounds with enthusiasm and purpose, applying details like the honking keyboard line in ""Old World United"" and ""Hibernation""'s bouncy bass to flesh out songs rather than as affectations.</p>
<p>As such, <i>Pigeons</i>' most straightforward and formal moment, the shuffling ballad ""Bottom Feeder"", is the big brick here, mostly because of how comparatively uncomplicated it is. Sure, Temple's voice can be most affecting when accompanying an unadorned, superficially pretty melody but sandwiched between the spiky psych-rock of ""Surprise"" and the (literally) astral throb of ""Moon"", the song is a momentum killer. Temple saves his biggest curveballs for the end-- the abstract 1-2 punch of ""Vegetable or Native"" and ""Herbie I Love You, Now I Know""-- but they don't feel tossed-off or willfully obscured. Like the bulk of <i>Pigeons</i>, they represent a good band still finding its way to becoming a great one. Whether they'll reach the end of that path is another debate, but for now, listening to this group of folks mess around is still a treat.</p></div>"|14318.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14318-pigeons/|7.5|Larry Fitzmaurice

The Numero Group, the consummate Chicago cratediggers, found out that a vinyl bootleg of sampled material from their <i>Eccentric Soul</i> series was making the rounds. It comprised dozens, possibly hundreds of loops, breaks, and vocal snippets copped from as many as 70 <i>Eccentric Soul</i> releases strung together in a 40-minute DJ mix. As salt in the wound, the nondescript-looking 12"" was stamped with a punny label: ""Numbero."" ""We've been bootlegged before, certainly... but this really takes the cake"", Numero wrote in a blog post.</p>
<p>Ready to shut down the counterfeit operation, ""an interesting thing happened,"" Numero said. ""We kinda got hooked on the flawlessly arranged pastiche."" So they did some digging, and discovered the DJs behind the mix were the mysterious production team Shoes, creators of lauded underground remixes and edits of everyone from Al Green to Detroit-house hero Moodymann. Numero decided to flip the script: They seized the vinyl from the pressing plant and released the bootleg themselves, even keeping the ""Numbero"" imprint.</p>
<p>Unprecedented as it sounds, there's plenty of history for this sort of release. Some of pop's most famous records started out as bootlegs-- from Dylan's <i>Basement Tapes</i> to the Beach Boys' original <i>Smile</i> and Prince's shelved-for-years <i>Black Album</i> from 1987. In each case, the public's desire to hear these albums outstripped the record company's wish to keep them under wraps, and Numero is smart to get out in front of this mix because it's precisely the kind of thing people would track down regardless. (Not to mention the savvy it takes to recognize a great mix when you hear one and, uh, bootleg your own bootleg.)</p>
<p>The album works on a few levels. It's first and foremost an excellent breaks record in the grand tradition of Street Beat's <i>Ultimate Breaks and Beats</i> series from the late 80s. (The title and dodgy skeleton cover art is an homage to that collection.) But there's more to it than that. The album is both a reverential snapshot of the breadth of the <i>Eccentric Soul</i> series and a pretty seamless DJ mix in its own right. It can be a little difficult to tackle, though. The record's split into two long tracks-- essentially a Side A and B-- and Shoes rearrange the source material in such a way that it's nearly impossible to identify all of the original songs.</p>
<p>But that digging is part of the fun with an album like this, and there are noteworthy tracks for soul connoisseurs to pick out. Them Two's ""Am I a Good Man"" makes an appearance on Side A, spilling into a locktight groove; Side B opens with the Four Mints' ""Row My Boat"" and pulls a funky guitar line from the Majestic Arrows' ""Going to Make a Time Machine"". Shoes take great pains, though, to weave all these tracks into long, groove-heavy sections that take on a life of their own. Ultimately the result feels a lot like sample-based records by DJ Shadow or the Avalanches-- you know a ton of work went into it, but it still sounds effortless.</p></div>"|14323.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14323-eccentric-breaks-and-beats/|8.3|Joe Colly

His one-to-two minute songs bristle with energy, and he doesn't so much play as hurl them, like a happy toddler bouncing toys off a wall. This relentlessly upbeat spirit, plus an effortless way with melody, helps make <i>Year of Panic</i> one of the most ingratiating half-hours of lo-fi pop of the year.</p>
<p>Perhaps because he's assembling all the pieces himself, Scharf's crash-pop ditties are surprisingly intricate-- songs that rush by at first as a primary-color blur turn out to be a busy little tangle of moving parts. He loves weird sounds, and his songs prickle with detail; ""Summer of Panic"" and ""Crystal Veins"" are repeatedly attacked by swarms of wiggling B-movie lasers, while ""Our Lives"" switches out guitars for a ukulele. ""The Boys Are Out"" breaks down less than 30 seconds into its length into a small traffic jam of noises-- bleating guitars, a hummingbird hi-hat pulse, an anchoring bass line-- and it's like watching a galloping processional of Keystone Kops.</p>
<p>As a songwriter, Scharf seems to think only in hooks, which is part of the reason he's able to sustain this madcap energy for <i>Year of Panic</i>'s duration. Separate any song into its individual elements and you'll find yourself holding a handful of wriggling earworms. The hyperactive descending keyboard riff of ""Bad Attitude"", for example, is infectious enough for most songwriters to call it a day, but Scharf's just getting started: toss in some chugging power chords, a jigging bassline, an unexpected key change and breakdown, and <i>two</i> killer vocal melodies and you've got his idea of ""enough."" <i>Year of Panic</i> overflows with this kind of manic generosity.  Chalk it up to some lo-fi pop version of ""colonial fever,"" but Scharf's ambition and spirit burns brighter than a lot of his Stateside contemporaries, and his debut is as joyfully immediate as it is compulsively replayable.</p></div>"|14310.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14310-year-of-panic/|7.9|Jayson Greene

These 22 tracks are cross-outs and corrections, revealing the different iterations of his songs as well as a general idea that his songs are never set or settled. That mercurial aspect of Stith's music is not a little surprising, considering the obvious care and thought that goes into each of his arrangements. <i>Appendices</i> caps a particularly fruitful period for the graphic designer turned musician, who culled the tracklist from a series of digital EPs released throughout 2009. Yet, it seems best to think of everything up to this point as one sovereign work, an ongoing album released piecemeal: Each song not only emanates from the same otherworldly perspective and conjures the same spectral ambience, but comments on the others, echoing sounds and lyrical phrases.</p>
<p>On the first disc of <i>Appendices</i>, Stith is the active creative agent, determining the snaky arrangements and sustaining that eerie mood across a dozen tracks. ""Around the Lion Legs"", a standout from the <i>Curtain Speech</i> EP, appears here as a ""slow dance version,"" moving much more slowly and muting that cascade of voices that gave the original its peculiar power. Likewise, the ""brass version"" of ""Braid of Voices"" adorns one of the best songs from <i>Heavy Ghost</i> with soft horns that form curlicues of sound in the background. As standalone tracks, they pale slightly to their ""finished versions,"" but as rough drafts, they offer intriguing glimpses of paths not taken and reveal Stith's careful editorial eye. His take on the Ronettes' oft-covered ""Be My Baby"" unbricks that wall of sound and reduces the song to a wet-blanket study in easy reinterpretation, but his version of Randy Newman's stalker drama ""Suzanne"" is perhaps the comp's best moment, as Stith insinuates himself into the song's blues structure with startling ease and into the title character's life without losing any of the dark humor. For an artist who rarely comes across as spontaneous, the cover sounds remarkably well read, turning his typically warm ambience into something much more menacing.</p>
<p>By contrast, on the second disc Stith is largely just another instrument, his voice another sound to be manipulated and his arrangements another object to be carefully deconstructed and reassembled. The remixers, including Michna, Son Lux, Clark, and Rafter, prove less adventurous than Stith himself. Rather than break the spells of his songs, they simply reconstruct or augment them, offering few dramatic interpretations. There are some nice flourishes, such as the mildly funky drumbeat on Michna's rethinking of ""Thanksgiving Moon"". Bibio's clattery remix of ""Abraham's Song"" stands out by undercutting Stith's soft vocals with jarring beats that barely hold to the beat, as if the whole song could crumble in on itself. Similarly, New Jersey singer-songwriter Dayna Kurtz covers ""Thanksgiving Moon"" as if it were a from-the-ground-up remix, recasting it as a jazzy torch song that is earthy rather than ethereal but shows just how malleable these songs can be when wholly removed from their original settings. Of course, no one knows or practices that better than Stith himself.</p></div>"|14320.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14320-heavy-ghost-appendices/|6.5|Stephen M. Deusner

. In and amongst the acoustic narratives that populate the album is a sludgy, metallic rocker (""Love and Hate""), rhythmic, Tom Petty-ish roots-pop (""Evening Star""), and a delicate duet with hometown chanteuse Alela Diane (""The Tree"", the album's best song) that allow Earley and his crew to flex little used muscles and grow in surprising directions.</span></span></span></p>

followers and curious newcomers alike.</p>
<p><i>Tiger Bay</i> is sort of Saint Etienne's best album. I say ""sort of,"" because it depends who you ask, but also because it depends which version you ask them about. There are different track listings and different covers and everything. This deluxe edition stays truest to the original UK release, which is a bit odd, seeing as in the liner notes Stanley is quoted as saying that <i>Tiger Bay</i> ""needed a couple more punchy pop songs."" The 1996 German reissue, an editorial favorite around here, includes probably the group's <i>punchiest</i> pop song: Eurodance smash ""He's on the Phone"", which isn't on either disc of this volume.</p>
<p>No matter. Originally released in 1994, <i>Tiger Bay</i> still makes for the subtlest, most cinematic, and pretty much indisputably <i>last</i> of Saint Etienne's astounding initial burst of albums. The record's blend of pastoral folk and silvery electronics was worlds apart from Union Jack-waving contemporaries' phony Beatlemania. More recent atmospheric-folk records like Goldfrapp's <i>Seventh Tree</i> haven't quite been able to get there, either.</p>
<p>The geographical Tiger Bay bustled as a 19th-century Welsh port, gave its name to a 1950s Hayley Mills slice-of-life film, and has since been rebranded as Cardiff Bay, a contemporary leisure and entertainment district. Saint Etienne's <i>Tiger Bay</i> can evoke all three locations at once. Just see ""Like a Motorway"": It borrows the melody of traditional song ""Silver Dagger"", coolly recounts a suburban melodrama, and runs on pulsating synths befitting Giorgio Moroder. It never breaks for a chorus.<br/><br/>The rest of the album brilliantly explores this crossroads between pre-modern, modern, and ultramodern. Underworld's Rick Smith, who mixed and engineered ""Like a Motorway"", also lends a futuristic sheen to instrumental opener ""Urban Clearway"" and wordlessly urgent harmonica trip ""Cool Kids of Death"". For orchestral folk, there's acoustic ballad ""Former Lover"". Sometimes <i>Tiger Bay</i> wants too much, like dub meeting traditional song on ""Western Wind / Tankerville"", or Massive Attack's Shara Nelson howling into a gale on the downtempo ""On the Shore"". The poppier moments hold up best: the flamenco-Eurodance weirdness of ""Pale Movie"", the Bacharach-house swoon of ""Hug My Soul"", the unadorned yearning of ""Marble Lions"".</p>
<p>Eight years later, <i>Finisterre</i> was a return to urbane form for Saint Etienne. After a pair of albums that were, by their standards, underwhelming-- comparatively old-fashioned 1998 Sub Pop debut <i>Good Humor</i> (no ""u""), recorded in Sweden, and sprawling 2000 Sean O'Hagan/To Rococo Rot collaboration <i>Sound of Water</i>, recorded in Berlin-- the group jetted back to London. The city was in transition, and so were they. The clever spoken-word samples they'd used until <i>Tiger Bay</i> were here again, and the stylish dance-pop was, too, only with a crucial difference.</p>
<p>No longer the café-hopping naïfs of the early years, these were suburban adults reclaiming the city nightlife. That's more or less the subject of surging acoustic-house opener ""Action"". Sometimes they mature gracefully, as on the easy-listening ""Stop and Think It Over"", but not always: Would you check out the electro muscle on critic-baiting ""Amateur""? Other times they remember not to grow up at all, whether with galloping vocoder flirtation ""New Thing"" or the gorgeously textured stomp of ""Shower Scene"". Slinky, self-referential ""B92"" continues to impress even after Annie's ""Heartbeat"" and Little Boots' ""Stuck on Repeat"" have helped take this idea to fluxpop extremes. Wildflower's cutesy rap on ""Soft Like Me"" still isn't fashionable, but the song's title is an invitation; those who accept it won't mind.<br/><br/>Elsewhere, the bonus tracks are the expected hodgepodge. On <i>Tiger Bay</i>'s second disc, German-edition tracks ""Hate Your Drug"" and ""I Buy American Records"" are welcome, as are the Christmas songs-- add them to your holiday playlists now, before you forget-- while the previously unreleased demos, though historically interesting, are no match for the album versions. <i>Finisterre</i> has its hidden gems, too, such as ""Soft Like Me""-like instrumental ""Primrose Hill"" or the laidback pop of ""Anderson Unbound"". But it's mostly curios: an electro banger for a canceled ""Dr. Who"" compilation, a Serge Gainsbourg genre exercise, and pretty decent Lee Hazlewood and Beach Boys covers. The low point comes on <i>Tiger Bay</i> extra ""Black Horse Latitude"", when Cracknell wonders, ""Is Michael Jackson's <i>Dangerous</i> as 'bad' as people say?""<br/><br/>For people who own the original records, the best reason to shell out some cash this time around is probably the film counterpart to <i>Finisterre</i>, which comes on a DVD with limited-edition versions of its namesake album.

Bringing Southern bounce back to its bass roots by mashing it up with European electro-house? Somehow A-Trak made it work, mostly through sheer force of mixing skills and some surprisingly compatible beat selections. Going back to it now to hear ""Walk It Out"" or ""Hustlin'"" over the hyperactive snarl and throb of post-Ed Banger club music transcends its genre-stunt origins, creating a snapshot of club rap's tentative late-2000s forays into a thugged-out hip-house revival.</p>
<p>A sequel might have less to worry about as far as justifying its concept, but more on its shoulders when it comes to living up to a great predecessor. <i>Dirty South Dance 2 </i>gets a bit more focused in the process: Unlike the anything-goes, geographically-shaky definition of ""Dirty South"" displayed on the first mix, <i>DSD2</i> leans heavily on the current front line of Southern hitmakers, the post-Soulja Boy/Gucci contingent sharing time with vets like Young Jeezy and Birdman. (And Consequence, who's from Queens, but OK.) That grounds it a bit deeper in a specific regional tradition-- nobody's rapping in French on this one-- but still lets a host of stylistically distinct backing tracks shift momentum and mood.</p>
<p>When it clicks, it brings new dimensions out of both tracks in the mix. The singsong cadence of Roscoe Dash's ""All the Way Turnt Up"" sounds even more Pixy Stix giddy when it's fitted to the hiccup of Claude Von Stroke's ""Vocal Chords"". Laying Dorrough's ""Ice Cream Paint Job"" over The Ones' cartoon-80s electro track ""Blast"" turns a 20-mile-an-hour boulevard cruise into a high-speed trip around the Nurburgring, but it heightens the original vocal's cockiness. And say what you will about Soulja Boy as an MC, but it makes a lot of sense to transplant his simplistic dance-rap into a subtle-as-a-pile-driver house track like the Martin Brothers' ""Dum"".</p>
<p>Those moments all work
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
because A-Trak's not content to merely let the acapellas and the instrumentals meet each other halfway--  the best segments of the beats are isolated, ramped up, and deftly cut for ideal momentum, while the vocals are stitched into the mix so precisely you'd think they were originally spit over a house beat. That does make the awkward matchups stick out more. ""Vampires Going Ham"" is the most egregious example: replacing Grade A Muzik's brilliant Def Jam '86-gone-ATL beat is a tall order, and using DJ Touché's horror-prog ""Vampires"" necessitates that Pill's flow be chopped up and spread out until all the urgency and punch is completely drained from it. And no matter how hard you try, you just can't make Ludacris sound at home over an old-school piano house track.</p>
<p>Well, nothing ventured, nothing gained; at least the majority of <i>Dirty South Dance 2 </i>is enough to make you feel like there's still some life in this franchise yet. (And A-Trak released this mix on his site for free, meaning you get a hell of a lot more than you pay for.) Still, there are a couple signs of restlessness here. A-Trak drops the mash-up conceit for a couple of exclusive tracks-- Carte Blanche's Kid Sister collaboration ""Do! Do! Do!"" and DJ Craze's remix of Donnis' ""Gone""-- both of which are excellent but feel more like intermissions than continuations of the mix. And then there's the last track, which pulls out a sudden, final left-turn away from the electro-house vibe: that's Yung L.A.'s ""Ain't I"" over Joker's euphoric wobble-bass colossus ""Tron"", and its arm-swinging lope annihilates everything in the previous 43 minutes. A <i>Dirty South Dance 3 </i>might still be enjoyable, but A-Trak's practically guaranteed that <i>Dirty House Dub </i>would be a monster.</p></div>"|14308.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14308-dirty-south-dance-2/|7.3|Nate Patrin

That said, staying the course isn't exactly what the Melvins are best known for, so while the transformation of ""The Water Glass"" mid-track from state-of-the-art sludge into an honest-to-goodness marching song is unexpected, the fact that the Melvins opted to switch gears isn't a shocker.  After all, it's following those sorts of counterintuitive impulses, for better (various B-sides from their 1997 AmRep singles collection) or worse (their Leif Garrett-flavored cover of ""Smells Like Teen Spirit""), that make this band worth a damn as it proudly trudges into its third decade.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, <i>The Bride Screamed Murder</i> is one of those cases where taking the road less traveled leads to nowhere. Some fans might beg to differ, of course.  They'll roll with the punches offered by indecisive three-in-one tracks like ""Inhumanity and Death” and ""Electric Flower"". Maybe they'll view the arch grunge moves of ""Hospital Up"" as a pithy meta-commentary, and get a chuckle out of the tune's Spinal Tap jazz odyssey rooster-crowing coda.  They might also get a kick out of the twerpy ending to ""I'll Finish You Off"", where someone's scat-tastic be-bopping leads to the ""My Sharona"" hook is banged out while ""My Generation"" is sung over it.  When it turns out that such an ending actually foreshadows a lugubrious Flipper-like stumble through ""My Generation"", what was a brief moment turns into a seven-minute-long joke.</p>
<p>However, if that all doesn't sound appealing to you, you'll probably hear <i>The Bride Screamed Murder</i> as an album full of unfinished sketches and lazy doodles masquerading as proper tunes.  The digressions will either come off as failed experiments or unfunny jokes, a handful of good ideas undercut by either their context or their brevity. Any patience engendered by the Melvins' countless good works will be tested by those willing to slog through this scattershot mess.  <i>The Bride Screamed Murder</i> is the sort of album one might expect from a long-in-the-tooth group trying to rediscover its purpose and rejuvenate itself.  That it comes on the heels of what seemed to be the band's rejuvenation makes it all the more disappointing.</p></div>"|14313.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14313-the-bride-screamed-murder/|5.2|David Raposa

Still very much an old soul, his weathered vocals and done-me-wrong worldview has put him in league with characters who have been around much longer than McCauley's 24 years. ""The lonely road is behind me,"" McCauley sings over a melodramatic organ on the doo-wop tinted track, and there's conviction in his words. It sounds like a pretty nice place to be.</p>
<p>But Deer Tick are still a long way from the Promised Land. Over the course of three albums, it's become clear that McCauley likes his band just the way it is and is not interested in growth or deviation. And since Deer Tick have never really stood out, another round of slightly-better-than-average, plainspoken alt-country tunes isn't an invitation to invested listening. It's become increasingly difficult to get behind this band that keeps fighting the same fight-- win, lose or draw.</p>
<p>Deer Tick have gained a reputation for their raucous live presentations, but on record is another story. The addition of ex-Titus Andronicus guitarist Ian O'Neil seems lost here, with McCauley spending a good chunk of time behind the piano, leaving the rest of his band to contribute the odd embellishment. Working within such an uncluttered space, most of the weight has to be carried by McCauley alone. Occasionally, he hits the mark-- ""Goodbye, Dear Friend"" might be heavy handed, but it's a kind and uncomplicated elegy that finds McCauley carrying a drunk comrade to bed ""like a pallbearer,"" and too soon the chore transforms into sad reality. And ""Piece by Piece and Frame by Frame"", a rejection tale with all the trappings of a murder ballad, finds him waxing pathetic again, but this time in the guise of a delusional, almost frightening love-fool. The approach suggests that a Nick Cave anthology would open up a world of possibility for him.</p>
<p>So it's too bad that the majority of <i>The Black Dirt Sessions</i> is so familiar, as the band dutifully strides through the same well-worn territory, perhaps even less palatable in their stubborn sameness. At least ""Mange"", the album's failed centerpiece, has the stones to rip off ""Sympathy for the Devil"", even if the outcome is about as contrived as you could imagine. Elsewhere, there are far too many aimless laments and meager ramblers that fail to register at all, let alone stick-- even if the ""riskier"" decisions don't always pay off, at least they're not boring. Deer Tick close the album with a nearly identical, piano-driven version of ""Christ Jesus"" from their debut, a decent song but certainly not worthy of a reprise here. It's here that we can most clearly see Deer Tick's focus as a band, one that's grown so comfortable in its own skin that it's begun to sag.</p></div>"|14307.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14307-the-black-dirt-sessions/|5.6|Zach Kelly

So if you live in a place like Blacksburg, Va., home of the Virginia Tech campus and not much else, and you want to be in a tropical punk act (Facepaint), an introspective singer-songwriter project (Jack &amp; the Whale), or a band that covers Kate Bush instead of Dave Matthews (Wild Nothing's breakthrough rendition of ""Cloudbusting""), you'll probably have to do what Jack Tatum did and start them yourself.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><i>Gemini </i>finds Tatum constructing a striking, solitary monument to just about anyone who moped, sulked, or bedsat their way through the 1980s. His love of dreamy, fuzzy, handcrafted guitar-pop isn't far removed from the Radio Dept. or the Pains of Being Pure at Heart, but he displays a more comprehensive and widespread commitment to classic indie pop sounds. Revivalism notwithstanding, his craftsmanship is undeniable and the details are spot-on: Check the reflective bell tone in ""Live in Dreams"", the Cocteau Twins-like, artificial synth tom in ""Drifter"", and the Johnny Marr homage in the twinkly guitar fade-in that begins ""Our Composition Book"".</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">While Tatum plays hopscotch with his collection of 4AD, Factory, and Slumberland records, <i>Gemini </i>has plenty more to offer than sonic verisimilitude.<span> On a</span><span>lbum opener </span>""Live in Dreams,"" he sings, ""Our lips won't last forever and that's exactly why/ I'd rather live in dreams and I'd rather die,"" and the lyric plays out like<i> Gemini </i>in miniature: While Tatum's words can edge on maudlin, his delivery is more romantic than dreary, and there's a sly, understated, and subtly addictive melody that gorgeously frames his sentiments. And melodies like that one, which the album features in spades, are ultimately what make <i>Gemini</i> more than just another indie pop record, and often more than the sum of its parts. Of course, that's not to say that each of them connects instantly. Though a handful of immediate standouts reward first listens, the record's debt-to-influence ratio may initially seem to overshadow the strength of the music. However, repeat spins reveal Tatum's strikingly innate sense of songcraft, as these tracks gradually earworm their way into daily life.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Similar to Bradford Cox's early work as Atlas Sound or the more similarly indebted Nick Harte of Shocking Pinks, Wild Nothing doesn't feel like a facile genre exercise so much as honest personal expression borne of intense musical fanhood.<span> And in a strange way, it becomes something of a deceptively joyous affair, a reminder of why so many songwriters retreat to bedrooms or garages to lose themselves in the music-making process. </span><i>Gemini</i><span> is grand when it sulks, and even better when it's in motion-- check the falsetto hooks of ""Confirmation"" and ""Summer Holidays"", or the clattering, kinetic ""Chinatown"". Tatum carves a tunnel from Ibiza's beaches to Manchester's rain-soaked fairgrounds, and in the process, captures a lot of what is exciting about underground music's current classic indie-pop fixation.</span></p></div>"|14280.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14280-gemini/|8.2|Ian Cohen

And with good reason. The Glaswegian quartet had been shoved aside by two major labels-- first Geffen, then Sony-- and its longtime UK home, Creation Records, closed up shop entirely in 1999. By the time the group's ninth album, <i>Man Made</i>, finally arrived in 2005-- via the bands' own PeMa Records label in the UK and Merge in the U.S.-- is was noticeably unsettled. Each glistening Byrds-inspired harmony masked lyrics that pondered death, impermanence, and regret. ""There is more to learn than I've aimed for/ So much under the sun I should play for/ Before I'm taken in,"" sang bassist Gerard Love, one of the group's three songwriters, on ""Time Stops"". It was a good record, but coming from a band that built its reputation on sugar sweet power-pop, it was a bit of a downer.</p>
<p>Fortunately, <i>Shadows</i> finds the band feeling a bit more hopeful. Album opener ""Sometimes I Don't Need to Believe in Anything"" begins with Love singing about feeling alive and ends with the band skipping through a cascade of angelic da-da-da's. He's not the only one feeling better, either. ""Dark clouds are following you/ But they'll drift away/ I watched the night turning into a day,"" sings guitarist Norman Blake on ""Dark Clouds"".</p>
<p>Maybe they've just had more time to relax these days. At Teenage Fanclub's current clip-- two 12-song albums per decade-- the band's three principal songwriters need only crack out 1.7 decent tunes per year. The pressure for forward motion is off, too. Nobody is really looking for the group to undergo a major makeover, just to crank out a few dependable hooks. From that perspective, <i>Shadows</i> is a success. Blake's ""Baby Lee"", with its chiming open chords, is as sturdy a song as the band has ever delivered. Love's contributions are a little more ambitious. The lightly psychedelic ""Into the City"" ebbs and flows through tides of phased guitar into an outro of soaring Beach Boys-worthy harmonies. Guitarist Raymond McGinley closes the album out with the somber country-tinged ""Today Never Ends"".</p>
<p>On <i>Man Made</i>, Teenage Fanclub seemed to be suffering a sort of rock'n'roll midlife crisis--grappling with the onset of middle age and wondering if the end was nigh. Five years later, <i>Shadows </i>finds them at ease once again. They're happy enough to kick around three or four chords, looking for new spins on the same songs they've been banging out since their grunge-era classic <i>Bandwagonesque</i>. Like a long-married couple, Teenage Fanclub have given up on surprise in favor of consistency. But that doesn't mean they're miserable.</p></div>"|14267.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14267-shadows/|7.4|Aaron Leitko

This is a band that produced one self-titled LP in 1990 before their melodically gifted but cantankerous leader Lee Mavers declared he'd never release another record. Nevertheless, a few La's reunite live every couple of years, sparking rumors about new material...that never materializes. If nothing else, the optimistically titled and lavishly packaged <i>Callin' All</i> suggests that their record company has finally accepted what fans realized at least a decade ago: The cow’s run dry.</p>
<p>Supposedly, Mavers has squirreled away songs in the intervening years, but he doesn't share his stash here. In fact, the band didn't cooperate in any way on <i>Callin' All</i>. How then does Polydor/Universal fill four CDs? There's about a disc and a half worth of material fans might legitimately want, including all of the band's singles and B-sides and some decent demos that never made it into the studio. Then there are six versions of the La's one big cross-border hit. With its hooks, jangle, and now-iconic guitar intro, ""There She Goes"" is an undeniable classic. The La's render it with such gentle, genuine wonder (about a girl or smack, to name the best-supported theories), that 20 years on the song still gets play whenever an evocation of non-specific longing is needed. And, admittedly, the overproduced album track has aged badly, making a demo or two welcome. But <i>six</i>? ""Timeless Melody"", the band's truest statement of purpose, appears eight times, ""Son of a Gun"" six, ""I.O.U."" four, and so on.</p>
<p>The La's were a superb live act, and two of the set's discs round up concert and radio recordings. This might be cool if the same or similar material hadn't been available online for years for free or if the record company hadn't already released the definitive La's live collection, <i>BBC in Session</i>, in 2006. ""Never before or since the La's has there been so much fascination and reverence for a band with so slender an output,"" journalist Will Hodgkinson opines hyperbolically in a glossy booklet <span> </span>padded with oversized photos and a month-by-month timeline of the band's active run. If this sounds like the bottom of the barrel being scraped, it is.</p>
<p>But even a disingenuous cash-grab can provide an opportunity for historical reflection. The La's one album is a near-perfect synthesis of scouse skiffle, early American rock'n'roll, and British Invasion sounds. Mavers had a genuine talent for earworms and economical song construction, and if he'd tried harder to play well with others instead of pissing them off, bassist John Power might have contributed more like the exceptional jangle-stomper ""Alright"" (two live versions of which make the box set).</p>
<p><span><span>Great art, the prevailing theory on the subject goes, forces the artists who follow it to think differently. By that definition, the La's aren't great, or even very good; Britpop, for example, would have happened regardless, in much the same way. For record companies, of course, great=profitable, and Universal would have consumers believe that the short-lived La's were the greatest band that never really was if it means they can sell the same material over and over. But you know what? Fuck greatness. It never adequately quantifies the intense relationship fans have with certain songs or the way they make them feel. On these terms, the La's own a small, glorious pop legacy. Bypass the bloated $60 set and buy their $12 album.</span></span></p></div>"|14319.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14319-callin-all/|4.9|Amy Granzin

For Jada-- in 2009's cratered rap economy, and coming off two heavily A&amp;R'ed solo albums--  it was a commercial triumph.<span> </span>Kiss would go on to praise <i>The Last Kiss </i>as his best marketed album, and all the while, tracks like ""Broken Safety"" and ""Cartel Gathering"" had everyone else wondering if a record of nothing but vivid gun talk over grimy beats would've done just as well as all of those joints with Mary J. Blige and Trey Songz.<span> </span>It certainly would've been cheaper.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">One of the year's most entertaining mixtapes, <i>The Champ Is Here 3</i>, now<i> </i>makes you wonder if it's a moot point anyway: If nothing else, <i>The Last Kiss </i>helped finance this.<span> Li</span>ke most of the best mixtapes around, <i>Champ</i> is informed by the spirit of competition, and it's no coincidence that boxing and basketball are the parallels to which Jada draws his own work.<span> </span>As with his best stuff, there's a pugilistic grace to his rapping here; nearly every line draws contact, but unlike associated ""punchline"" rappers, there's little wasted movement surrounding his pithier <i>bon mots</i>. Beyond proving Jada can create a cohesive document of his prodigious skill, <i>Champ Is Here 3</i> combats some of the problems that have dogged him over the years.<span> </span>There's a run with instrumentals from the Game's ""Bang"", Young Jeezy's ""Sky's the Limit"", and Rick Ross' ""Maybach Music 2"" that suggest<span> </span>Jadakiss doesn't have the poor ear for beats after all.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">This is unlikely to be anyone's introduction to Jadakiss, more likely to appreciate by his connoisseurs.<span> </span>And that's perfectly fine-- 90s East Coast rap mavens will appreciate Jada rapping over Brand Nubian's ""Slow Down"" and ""Who Shot Ya"", as well as Uncle Murda returning from the major label hinterlands to steal ""Pussy"" and ""It's Whatever"" with his absurdly hilarious brand of blustery ignorance.<span> </span>LOX historians can indulge in Jada and Styles' nearly unparalleled tag-teaming raps on ""Top 5 Dead Or Alive"", while Sheek Louch becomes increasingly entertaining in his delusion, boasting ""I wore shiny suits when I was down with Diddy"" as if anyone listening to a Jadakiss mixtape in 2010 was unaware of that.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><i>The Champ Is Here 3 </i>ain't perfect, but at least it's for the reasons mixtapes typically ain't perfect.<span> </span>Original tracks like ""All Falls Down"" make you wait out forced hooks for Jada to start rapping again, and are here to remind you why Jada's Def Jam records so rarely live up to their capability.<span> </span>Meanwhile <i>Champ's </i>second half is littered with also-rans-- the D-Block d-listers who are effortlessly eclipsed by Jada on ""Coach of the Year"", while Masspike Miles and inexplicable DJ Drama associate La the Darkman prove why they remain the definition of ""bum-ass mixtape rappers.""<span> </span>But with all that said, <i>The Champ Is Here 3 </i>serves as comfort as Jadakiss says things like ""it's enough money for everybody"" while talking about the proposed follow-up, <i>Top 5 Dead or Alive.<span> </span></i>Maybe it'll be the fourth straight lame Jadakiss solo album, but isn't it a bit ridiculous that his followers complain that his retail albums are weak when his best work is available for absolutely nothing?</p></div>"|14316.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14316-the-champ-is-here-3/|7.7|Ian Cohen

Much of the reason for that record's mediocrity can be explained by that line, as Merritt's willowy voice and limp folk-pop hooks found themselves floating off entirely into the ether upon being paired with frustratingly vague, moony lyrics choked with overcooked metaphors (""Night is a gypsy;"" ""I ran like the wildest horse"").</p>
<p>Leaning hard on blithe mid-tempo grooves and useless pleasantries, Merritt was in danger of writing herself off wholly into benign irrelevance, a Sheryl Crow with some indie cred. Blessedly, however, her newest album, <i>See You on the Moon</i>, finds Merritt finally figuring out how to say just what she means, taking full advantage of her gift for intimate, fragile songwriting by attaching it to words that speak quietly but directly to real states of love, both in union and in discord. Wonderful opener ""Mixtape"" is about something as modest as showing love through song selection, and when Merritt breaks out the metaphors it's to charmingly liken herself to a B-side, not a galloping stallion. Meanwhile, the mid-album one-two punch of ""Never Talk About It"" and ""All the Reasons We Don’t Have to Fight"" not only ruminate on strained relationships but also mimc their syntax; like estranged couples walking on eggshells afraid to trigger another eruption, the songs leave out the details and stick to language that's neutral on the surface but secretly freighted with emotion.</p>
<p>In general the album is somber and reflective, and it consistently suits Merritt well. Even when her imagination is given freer rein here, it's in the service of sincere meditation rather than glib pronouncement-- Merritt may imagine ""my typewriter strapped with diamonds to my chest"" on ""The Things That Everybody Does"", but she also self-deprecatingly concedes, ""a mountain's still a mountain…no matter what I’d like it to be.""</p>
<p>Musically, less is almost always more in Merritt's universe. The album's two trad rockers, ""Six More Days of Rain"" and ""Live Till You Die"", are also its biggest duds, as Merritt continues to evince zero facility for broad-stroke anthemics. ""Papercut"" may represent an improvement, riding the sort of coolly spacious mid-tempo groove that’s successfully propelled Rosanne Cash and Chrissie Hynde in the past, yet Merritt lacks their commanding vocal presence. Her delicate pipes may consign her to small sketches and close studies, but Merritt's at least proven with <i>See You on the Moon</i> that she has the lyrical goods to deliver intimately pleasurable, deeply felt folk-pop.</p></div>"|14315.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14315-see-you-on-the-moon/|6.7|Joshua Love

Dubstep artists like Zomby (who actually composes on an Atari) have mostly reinforced these parallels. Guido, who along with fellow Bristol youngsters Joker and Gemmy is lumped into the dubstep-offshoot wonky or purple, also frequently receives the ""video game music"" tag. Guido's music, though, has little to do with anything bright or glitchy. A self-professed fan of soundtracks to ornate dreamworlds like those of the Final Fantasy series, Guido's debut album, <i>Anidea</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">, is composed, patient, and a lot closer to phantasmal R&amp;B than anything written for an xBox.</span></p>
<p>Guido (née Guy Middleton) doesn't yet have the can't-miss-prodigy aura of scene-mate Joker, but that's probably due to lack of material more than aura-killing misses. He shares Joker's sternum-rumbling mids and a general fondness for saturation but little else. Crucially, he is less menacing. A pianist trained in jazz and classical, Guido stuffs his tracks with MIDI instruments until they resemble funky plastic symphonies. He exposed his R&amp;B roots on the vocodor'd slow-jam ""Beautiful Complication"" and amped expectations with last year's ""Way U Make Me Feel"" (which reappears here as a pop-vocal track). Guido's love of horns and 1980s vocal-heavy R&amp;B also link him to current hip-hop producers like Polow Da Don; Guido's banging ""Mad Sax"", which flips a looped saxophone into a siren blare, needs guest verses yesterday.</p>
<p>Guido is anything but showy-- he releases his music on the Bristol-based, Peverelist-run Punch Drunk records-- and <i>Anidea</i> unfurls rather than bludgeons. The eponymous opening track is almost too reserved, its simple four-note patterns politely serving as a base for several sputtering melodies.  It's not until the fifth track-- ""
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
Beautiful Complication"", with Aarya's mesmerizing, pitch-shifted vocals-- that <i>Anidea</i> forcefully demands attention. Then during <i>Anidea</i>'s grinning mid-section Guido rolls out ""Mad Sax"", the tumbling soul of ""You Do It Right"", and icy after-party of ""Take Me Higher"". He calmly pulls out all the stops: quivering bass, sensual saxophones, piercing feedback, but <i>Anidea</i> never sounds stuffed or overproduced. Guido doesn't twist knobs or dazzle on the piano. He just delights in sounds, all sounds.</p>
<p>Joker once said of the proposed purple music, ""It's not a genre, but purple is the color we all get along with."" The lack of genre on <i>Anidea </i>is apparent: Guido doesn't style his music so much as caress it. <i>Anidea</i> impressively never even seems like techno, though it will never be mistaken for an organic live-band recording. The first third of the album, initially too methodical, eventually reveals itself. The arcing synths on ""Woke Up Early"" start to sound bright and sturdy. The glorious horns that send of ""Cat in the Window"" are modestly triumphant. Guido can stack sounds with his pals-- pull up to a stoplight with ""You Do It Right"" blasting and watch heads turn-- but he seems content to pile them neatly. This impulse, to compose, will serve him well in a scene hellbent on the next movement. For now, <i>Anidea </i>is plenty: gray R&amp;B lit by television glow and one of the finest post-dubstep full-lengths yet.</p></div>"|14270.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14270-anidea/|8.3|Andrew Gaerig

The Parisian producer's latest is that much in touch with some of electronic music's more prevalent trends of the moment: broken beats, woozy aural effects, and the lush sounds of vintage funk and R&amp;B, all filtered through hip-hop's rhythmic, lyrical bounce. Which isn't to say that Onra is merely trend-hopping; if anything, the stylistic evolution of <i>Long Distance</i> is more of a logical extension from his already established sound. Onra's previous two full-lengths, 2007's <i>Chinoiseries</i> and 2009's <i>1.0.8</i>, were wonderfully rooted in J Dilla's dusty-crate beat tape aesthetic, the former (and stronger of the two) coming both after James Yancey's tragic passing and before Dilla's hazy, sample-heavy sound really started seeping its way into electronic music's consciousness.</p>
<p>On both releases, Onra did a better Dilla than most who namecheck Dilla do right now-- but they also had a certain clinical aspect to them, as if he was performing more of a musicologist's role instead of a musician's. That detached aspect is completely absent from <i>Long Distance</i>; instead, this record feels warm and luxurious. That effect is partially achieved through Onra's use of vocal samples. One of the defining characteristics of J Dilla's masterpiece, 2006's <i>Donuts,</i> is how snatches of vocals weave in and out without ever completing themselves, reducing what would have been hypeman shouts to evocative fragments that convey hip-hop's emotive, rather than literal, signifiers.</p>
<p>Onra pulls a very similar trick with R&amp;B vocals here, creating muted, stuttering eroticism via the staggered cries on ""Sitting Back"" and, later, layering dusky, husky titular moans atop a one-sided phone conversation amidst the nocturnal nervousness of ""Girl"". He understands that literalism is totally unnecessary when conveying how something ""feels""-- or, more succinctly put, that less is more.</p>
<p><i>Long Distance</i> definitely carries Dilla's sonic stamp on a few tracks, and its own beat tape-esque structure is reminiscent of <i>Donuts</i>' formatting-- but more often, Onra takes his production cues here from the dense, out-of-phase production on Flying Lotus' <i>Los Angeles</i>. Beats ebb and flow with irregularity, always staying present but choosing to smack against your eardrums with varying levels of force-- a stylistic tack that, in the hands of a lesser talent, could seem disorienting. Luckily, Onra keeps an evenly accessible keel on things, even on <i>Long Distance</i>'s more abstract passages (the head-nod bounce of ""Oper8tor"", ""Rock On""'s jacked handclap funk).</p>
<p>This record isn't just for headphones, either. It's a summer album, too, conveying images of spraying fire hydrants, street fairs, and melted popsicles. Hell, there's some straight-out <i>hits</i> on this record: the KISS-FM grandeur of the title track, featuring funk-styled vocalist Olivier Daysoul; Missouri R&amp;B smooth-talker Reggie B's buttery turn on ""High Hopes"". Forget the album title-- <i>Long Distance</i> plays its hand close to the heart, coming out all the better for it.</p></div>"|14305.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14305-long-distance/|8.0|Larry Fitzmaurice

<p class=""MsoNormal""><span>As a member of the Hollies, as a solo artist, and especially as one-third of Crosby Stills &amp; Nash, Graham Nash has exerted a strong influence on late-2000s indie rock, acting as a touchstone to scores of earnest young folkies pushing harmonies to the forefront of rustic Americana. Although he was never quite as pervasive as Brian Wilson, Ian Curtis, or Bruce Springsteen-- indie's holy triumvirate of the last decade-- Nash's music has inspired pretty much any recent harmonizing group. In retrospect, it seems inevitable that artists would rally around Nash and especially his 1971 solo debut, <i>Songs for Beginners,</i> his most sustained and personal effort. Grassroots Records and <span>(((folkYEAH!))) Presents</span> have organized a track-by-track tribute to that album, choosing the usual suspects to cover Nash's post-hippie compositions: Fleet Foxes' Robin Pecknold, Vetiver, Alela Diane, and Mariee Sioux, among others.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span>Out of either reverence or timidity, most of them stick pretty close to the originals. Covering ""Better Days"", Brendan Benson of the Raconteurs even retains Nash's eerie organ theme, which re-creates the same ominous atmosphere. The best track, unsurprisingly, may be the one that takes the most liberties: Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy translates ""Simple Man"" into Spanish (""Hombre Sencillo"") and recasts it as a mariachi tune. More than simply a stunt, it proves startlingly effective, as Oldham trusts Nash's plaintive hook to make sense in any language.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span>A controlled singer who stood out even in CSN&amp;Y, Nash was also one of the better songwriters to rise out of Woodstock Nation, with a good ear for conflating the personal with the political. That makes ""Military Madness"", the opening track on <i>Songs</i><i> for Beginners</i> as well as <i>Be Yourself,</i> such a compelling song. It may be a peacenik anthem, but Nash anchors it in the story of his own birth: ""In an upstairs room in Blackpool, by the side of a northern sea,"" he sings, ""the army had my father, and my mother was having me."" On their cover, Port O'Brien and the Papercuts emphasize those autobiographical details as singer Van Pierszalowski injects the song with a palpable sadness, as if he's actively trying to keep from growing jaded and cynical.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span>To its credit, <i>Be Yourself </i>gives equal weight to both the folk and the pop halves of Nash's folk-pop sound. Eschewing the twangy vibe of the original, the Moore Brothers highlight the twisty melody of ""Man in the Mirror"", while Sleepy Sun rough up the horn-driven ""Chicago"". The folkies have it a bit tougher, though. Nile Nash can't figure out how to put her stamp on ""Wounded Bird"", which her father wrote following his break-up with Joni Mitchell. Rather than communicate that heavy heartache, her cover just sound wispy and slight. It could be anyone singing anyone else's song.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span>On the other hand, Pecknold strums up an easygoing version of the title track, taking the verses solo and layering himself into an ethereal choir for the chorus. That rough-hewn extemporaneity makes the lyrics sound like a personal mantra or an internal monologue rather than an exhortation to listeners. Too bad more artists didn't take that advice. It may be ironic to name a tribute album <i>Be Yourself</i>, but these artists take too few musical or interpretive risks, so how could the album possibly live up to that title? All it shows us is that Nash has many fans these days, but it doesn't really tell us why. </span></p>

That's a deeply ridiculous example of <span class=""misspell"">stoner</span> logic at work, but it's also pretty emblematic of where this particular rap legend is living these days. <i>Suite 420</i> is Devin's seventh solo album, and rappers barely ever reach that level of career longevity without, at some point, moving beyond their comfort zone and trying to reach a bigger audience. But Devin's persona's never changed one iota-- he's still the self-deprecating <span class=""misspell"">stoner</span> everyman who'd sooner spin some shaggy dog story about a failed quest for sex than portray himself as a larger-than-life superhero. <br/><br/>On the four solo albums he released on Rap-A-Lot Records, Devin found ways to spin humor and pathos out of that state of being, and the often-gorgeous production of those records didn't hurt. (DJ Premier <span class=""misspell"">might've</span> never made a track prettier than ""<span class=""misspell"">Doobie</span> Ashtray"", Devin's classic lament about learning <span class=""misspell"">somebody's</span> smoked his last joint.) But since parting ways with that Southern rap powerhouse label, Devin hasn't been able to maintain the sweep and lushness of those earlier solo albums. His tracks, often self-produced, have felt like cheaper approximations of those warm, expansive older tracks, and Devin himself has sounded bored and distracted much of the time, never finding the storytelling groove he once had. It makes sense. After all, you can't remain in a state of <span class=""misspell"">bluntedness</span> without losing some level of focus.<br/><br/>As on his last album, 2008's <i>Landing Gear</i>, <i>Suite 420</i> finds Devin in such a low-key mode that he's practically speaking inside his own head. ""Still <span class=""misspell"">Comin</span>'"" is a song about grinding hard, doing everything you can to make a living in the music business-- except Devin lets the entire song pass by without offering a chorus, just staying silent for a few bars between verses. It could almost be a high-concept joke. He forgoes rapping for entire songs at a time, preferring instead to sing in a surprisingly confident honeyed coo. But every beat
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
works in the exact same no-budget vein: An electronic lope with barely-there drums and maybe an acoustic guitar or something. And another Devin album of diminishing-returns weed-and-girls raps over that type of beat feels entirely unnecessary.<br/><br/>But even if S<i>uite 420</i> doesn't have any burning need to exist, it sure isn't unpleasant. Devin's built up enormous reservoirs of goodwill over the years, and his sloppy-grinning persona remains one of <span class=""misspell"">rap's</span> most effortlessly likable. And even his most generic stories come with little hints of specificity that reveal way more. (On, for instance, the otherwise aimless infidelity track ""I Gotta Ho"": ""She's just another ho; we'll have to leave it at that/ Cause her husband's overseas, fighting hard in Iraq."") He still finds hidden melodies on tracks that would've left almost any other rapper adrift, and his airy choruses still get stuck in your head. He still comes through with a good joke every now and then. It's good to hear him still recording, even if he's deeply entrenched himself in his own wheelhouse and barely has a single surprising moment in the album's whole hour. But if the album never existed, <span class=""misspell"">nobody's</span> life would be much poorer for it-- possibly even Devin's. At least he finally got to release an album on April 20.</p></div>"|14309.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14309-suite-420/|5.3|Tom Breihan

(Now that I'm thinking about retro, I'm thinking about Folgers Coffee ads: Tonight, we're secretly replacing this noisy cassette-label band from the mid-80s with something that came out last week-- let's see if people know the difference, or if they care.)</p>
<p>Trash Kit are three British girls who are single-mindedly faithful to a very specific style born in the late 1970s: small-scale, distortion-free punk like the Slits and the Raincoats. Guitar, bass, drums. Not too many overdubs; nothing too professional (professionalism, in their case, being a handicap). What made their influences sacred is their sense of kinship and solidarity: sometimes, everyone plays on the same beat; sometimes, songs speed up and slow down; sometimes, they sing in unison. The emphasis is on togetherness. I hesitate to get too mystical about it, but these are bands that tap into musical communication in a  borderline-tribal way-- it's like twin language, spoken with wooden spoons on pots and pans.</p>
<p><i>Trash Kit</i>-- their debut-- is a brief, spirited album. There are 17 songs, and it's 27 minutes long. One typical pattern for a pop song is verse, chorus, verse, chorus, bridge, chorus, chorus. A typical Trash Kit song is verse. Just verse. Or maybe they spend thirty seconds revving up together and then they play the verse. The band plays like they're chasing down their own songs. Sometimes, they skin their knees.</p>
<p>The music is scrappy, but also sweet, almost domestic. (This is a juxtaposition that the Raincoats-- who wrote songs like ""Fairytale in the Supermarket""-- understood, too.) One of the girls in the band is a PhD student. They have a song called ""Bad Books,"" which is one minute and five seconds long, and goes, ""In the library, that's where you'll find me. Bad books! Dirty looks! Bad books! Dirty looks!"" On ""Fame""-- maybe the catchiest and most coherent thing you could call a ""song"" on the album-- they sing, ""We ride the Megabus, we're all famous now!"" This is them at their best: direct, playful, and passionately unsophisticated.</p>
<p>I would hate if any of this made them sound cute, ""cute"" being a word that most people usually use when they want to emphasize how insignificant and pettable something is. Trash Kit work within their own world, which is small, but pretense-free. Presumably, they have hard times and deep thoughts like anyone, but none of it ever comes up-- instead, they retreat into these little games of musical four-square. Overall, there are times I want more from the album-- more verve, more yip, more small challenges. And while the thought of all these young, backward-looking bands makes me vaguely depressed, there's something about Trash Kit that I find heartening: Instead of treating their retro style of choice like an outfit picked from a closet, they treat it like unfinished business.</p></div>"|14284.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14284-trash-kit/|6.6|Mike Powell

The Swedish singer and songwriter has no fear of pop: A platinum seller in her own country, Robyn cracked the <i>Billboard</i> top 10 in the late 1990s working with famed teen-pop producer Max Martin. As the daughter of a couple who ran an independent theater company, however, Robin Miriam Carlsson is also a woman who enjoys doing things her own way.</p>
<p><i>Robyn</i>, first released in Scandinavia five years ago on the newly liberated singer's own Konichiwa label, ultimately led to a UK #1 hit, a tour with Madonna, and Snoop Dogg remix spots. Major labels turned out to be a necessary evil, but the deal's on Robyn's terms now. ""It's pop music, you know?"" she told us earlier this year. ""It's entertainment and at the same time it has to mean something to me. I like dealing with that balance.""</p>
<p>With<i> Body Talk Pt. 1</i>, the first of a potential three new albums tentatively scheduled for 2010, Robyn doesn't just walk the line between what she has called the ""commercial"" and ""tastemaker"" realms. She obliterates it. Immaculately produced, fantastically sung, and loaded with memorable choruses, this eight-song effort has plenty to please everyone from post-dubstep crate diggers to teen tweeters-- often at the same time. Like most of Robyn's best tracks, though, from mid-90s teen-pop hit ""Show Me Love"" to ""With Every Heartbeat"" a decade later, <i>Body Talk Pt. 1</i> is capable of not only appealing to many different people, but also touching them emotionally.<br/><br/>""Play me some kind of new sound/ Something true and sincere,"" Robyn begs on ""None of Dem"", a dark, tense, early-morning type of dance track featuring Norwegian electropop duo Röyksopp. She's not being hypocritical. Opener ""Don't Fucking Tell Me What to Do"", a talky electro-house tirade against electro-age anxieties, really isn't like anything else in the singer's discography. ""Dancehall Queen"", her so-wrong-it's-right collaboration with tastemaking Philadelphia DJ/producer Diplo, may have purists grumbling at its 1980s dancehall synths, subwoofer wobble, and ""Sleng Teng"" shoutout-- the title's sideways allusion to ABBA appears to have gone generally overlooked-- but ""I came to dance, not to socialize."" It's here, dancing, with a chorus that Santigold and Gwen Stefani might kill for, that Robyn is free from all the worries that are ""killing"" her at the album's start.</p>
<p><i>Robyn</i> reintroduced Robyn as a Missy Elliott-loving badass. <i>Body Talk Pt. 1</i> texts that persona into the 2010s. Most similar to songs like ""Konichiwa Bitches"", ""Cobrastyle"", and ""Curriculum Vitae"" is first preview ""Fembot"", a Klas Åhlund co-write that flips the script on Robyn's track for Röyksopp's 2009 <i>Junior</i>. On ""The Girl and the Robot"", Robyn was the neglected lover ""asleep again in front of MTV."" Here, to wonderful effect, she's a ""scientifically advanced hot mama.""</p>
<p>But Robyn seems most comfortable watching from afar as somebody else goes home with her prize. Dancing, the narrator's escape on ""Dancehall Queen"", becomes a prison of her own making on the album's emotional peak, ""Dancing on My Own""-- a clear descendant of Robyn's girl-loses-boy, boy-ties-Ms.-Whatshername's-laces classic, ""Be Mine!"". With unadorned piano and strings, ""Hang With Me (Acoustic Version)"" is closer to ""Be Mine! (Ballad Version)"" and hits similar emotional notes: You say you're just friends, well that's OK, but don't you dare ""fall recklessly, headlessly in love with"" her. If she's sitting on a killer dancefloor version of this one, good luck.</p>
<p>In an album full of songs that manage to be both specific and universal, ""Cry When You Get Older"" might prove to be the most enduring: a prom song, a graduation song, an end-of-summer-camp-PowerPoint song. Dudes like Max Martin and Peter Bjorn &amp; John meet at parties and brag about what great melodies they've written, Robyn told us a couple of years ago; this is one worth bragging about. The lyrics are conversational, the synths respond, and there's a Prince reference to go with a Smashing Pumpkins' ""1979""-like perspective on teenage ennui. Everybody in the back, quote it: ""I lost all my faith in science/ So I put my faith in me.""<br/><br/><i>Body Talk Pt. 1</i> ends painfully soon, but at least it ends with a pair of tracks focusing on Robyn's soulful voice. In addition to ""Hang With Me"", there's ""Jag Vet En Dejilg Rosa"", a Swedish traditional song the singer performed over Björn Yttling's piano accompaniment in a 2007 tsunami memorial. Here she's backed by bells, and her touch is lighter. Robyn's vocals aren't only about singing; they're also about untranscribeable details like the little flutter when she sort of smiles at herself on this slow song, or her goofy ad libs between lyrics on faster songs. Above all, Robyn puts herself on the line-- loses her cool for the sake of emotional connection-- like few other contemporary vocalists.<br/><br/>In 2000, a guy I know e-mailed Robyn about singing technique. In her reply, she gave detailed advice about maintaining his jaw muscles, hips, back, tongue, and vocal chords. ""But the most important thing,"" she wrote, ""is to be happy, and I don't mean that you always should be in a good mood. Because all the emotional stress that you feel is reflected in your body and can easily affect your voice-- which is a good thing if you take care of it. Because it is a tool that will help you get to know yourself and remind you when it's time for you to look inside for answers."" Head and hips are both important, but the heart is still the strongest muscle. Bring it, <i>Body Talk Pt. 2.</i></p></div>"|14294.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14294-body-talk-pt-1/|8.5|Marc Hogan

On Born Ruffians' full-length debut, 2008's <i>Red Yellow &amp; Blue</i>, his voice was a tightly coiled spring that popped off in all the right places, hugging the record's herky-jerky rhythms close and often acting as a primer for the splashes of colorful guitar riffs that ran throughout the record. Even more impressive was his memorable turn on ""Jamelia"", from Caribou's latest, <i>Swim</i>. Lalonde softly vibed over the track's muted tones and shuffling beat before exploding during its fireworks finale.</p>
<p>So, yeah, guy's got some chops-- not that you would be able to tell from Born Ruffians' sophomore full-length bow, <i>Say It</i>. Lalonde seems to be cursed with a sense of tonal amnesia here; he squeaks when trying to reach his upper register, and when he takes on a lower end, it almost sounds like a piss-take. Sometimes, he sounds out of breath after singing just a few bars of melody; other times, he tries to cram so many melodic syllables into a single run that you wish he'd go get himself a spritzer and chill out or something. The overall result sounds untrained and amateurish-- not off-kilter, just plain off.</p>
<p>That amateurishness, unfortunately, extends to most of <i>Say It</i>. Much of the material sounds rushed and half-finished, like a high schooler trying to write a research page paper during his lunch period. Drummer Steven Hamelin sounds so loose that his kit might just collapse if touched-- and when the time comes for him to add some urgency, he struggles to keep the tempo altogether. Most of Lalonde's guitar lines are skeletal where they should be muscular and overdone when more restraint is needed. It feels like the band has completely forgotten any sense of instrumental competence or urgency that was well exhibited on <i>Red Yellow &amp; Blue</i>.</p>
<p>Save for the charmingly slack ""Blood, the Sun &amp; Water"", it appears they forgot the key to compelling song structures as well.  Songs like ""Oh Man"" and ""The Ballad of Moose Bruce"" open with promising melodies but go nowhere, repeating themselves <i>ad nauseam</i>, as if they were out of ideas. Worse, ""Retard Canard"" and ""Higher &amp; Higher"" lack any sort of structure altogether, the former hitting melodic dead ends that don't take and the latter sounding like a tunelessly arrhythmic Talking Heads rip-off.</p>
<p>Both lazy and painfully forced, <i>Say It</i> is a paradoxically bad album-- fitting, then, that the album's most melodically inoffensive cut, ""Sole Brother"", is the biggest lyrical stinker. ""Sole Brother"" slowly concerns into what might be the most inane First World Problem expressed in musical form so far this year: doing your chores. Lalonde whines (literally) about having to help his 77-year-old grandfather with yard work, before issuing the following piddling complaint: ""You never ask sister/ To help with the chores that are physically straining/ And sometimes/ I wish/ That I was/ A sole brother."" (Even worse is the song's second half, sung in thin-lipped falsetto by Hamelin, in which he namechecks rappers like Raekwon, Ghostface, and Lil' Wayne, professing, ""I love you/ I wish I was a soul brother."") Yes, he wishes his sister didn't exist, because he has to rake the leaves. Lord knows what his sister will think once she hears this record.</p></div>"|14299.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14299-say-it/|3.8|Larry Fitzmaurice

Nah, not really. Grossi's gauzy, twinkly Active Child songs feel at once rather humble and astronomically huge. Bits of Animal Collective's stacked harmonies, <i>Dazzle Ships</i>' askew shimmer, and M83's post-New Order epic pulse coalesce in Grossi's tidy yet titanic sound, stretched out over six songs and 30 minutes on the <i>Curtis Lane</i> EP. Precious? More like prodigious.<br/><br/>Tracks here<i> </i>comes in a couple of varieties: there's the hazier, sultrier, slower numbers, and the ones you can dance to. Grossi's smart to keep the two sides in balance, but while the thumpier numbers have their charms, they seem a bit timid next to the others' sky-streaking grandeur. ""I'm in Your Church at Night"" seems to stretch on forever, matching Grossi's heaven-sent falsetto to a lush rumble not unlike a screwed'n'chopped ""In the Air Tonight"". His compositional skill is really something, moving beats and harp plinks and negative space in and out without disrupting the majestic scope of the tunes. His falsetto, a touch meek on its own, has a dreamy incandescence when piled on top of itself. The harp's far from the focus here, but coupled with his voice, it provides a organic counterpoint to the synthetic sounds constantly shuffling underneath him.<br/><br/>Grossi's hand as a dance producer isn't quite as steady; deft as he is at matching sounds, there's a reason you don't hear much harp in house music, and the throb he throws under half the tunes here never quite seems to knock hard enough to actually enter the realm of the danceable. Perhaps that's not the point, but the reedy ""Take Shelter"" doesn't have quite as much vitality as the stretchier stuff, sounding at times like any number of bedroom Bernard Sumner. A stuttery sample of Grossi's voice makes head-nodder ""When Your Love Is Safe"" the best of the dancier bunch, but ""Weight of the World"" is bogged down by too much thump and a sharp vocal downshift; his falsetto's lovely, his tenor not so much. It's not that Grossi oughta give up trying to get people to move, but his dance music's just a smudge too cerebral, and besides, the more extravagant numbers are moving enough as is.<br/><br/>Grossi's limited means seem to have pushed the cosmic, stately side of these tracks to the forefront; these tunes might be huge in effect, but they're fairly modest in execution, and one hopes Grossi can maintain that homespun feel should bigger and better things befall him. And they oughta; lord knows if I were charged to soundtrack the big smooch in a teen movie I'd snatch up the rights to ""Wilderness"" or ""I'm in Your Church at Night"" post-haste. These songs just feel climactic, durable, far greater than the sum of their parts. If this guy can almost get you to dance to harp songs, just imagine what he might be capable of creating.</p></div>"|14301.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14301-curtis-lane-ep/|7.7|Paul Thompson

Seven centuries of English occupation will do that. Almost 15 years after Super Furry Animals, Gorky's Zygotic Mynci, Catatonia, and Manic Street Preachers drew attention to their tiny country's music scene, newer Welsh artists like Race Horses and the Joy Formidable are plugging along amid considerably less media fanfare. Now add Cate Le Bon to that list, with a bullet.</p>
<p>On her debut album, the Cardiff-based singer/songwriter introduces a beguiling, idiosyncratic voice almost designed not to call attention to itself. No relation to Duran Duran star Simon, Le Bon is probably best known for her fembot guest spot on ""I Lust U"", from Super Furries frontman Gruff Rhys's Neon Neon project a couple of years ago. Yet on <i>Me Oh My</i>-- first released via Rhys's fledgling Irony Bored label last fall, and finally for sale in the U.S. this month-- she buries her pop hooks like the childhood animals that gave the album its working title, <i>Pet Deaths</i>, and lets her freak-folk flag fly half-mast instead.</p>
<p><i>Me Oh My</i> is an understated work, but by no means an underwhelming one. Le Bon's coolly enunciated vocals, resembling an earthier Nico or an eerier Victoria Bergsman, are the biggest draw. But the ""Pale Blue Eyes"" twang of ""Sad Sad Feet"" (""Baby, I'm headed for the black"") or recession-era Neil Young of ""Shoeing the Bone"" (""These are hard times to fall in love"") should earn enough repeat listens for the rest of the songs to reveal themselves. Accompanied by members of Gorky's Zygotic Mynci, Le Bon elsewhere updates the 1970s Welsh psych-folk reveries and fuzztone free-for-alls that Rhys has ably documented on his <i>Welsh Rare Beat </i>compilations. If side two opener ""Terror of the Man"" is a rare droney snoozer, rough-hewn details such as the retro-futurist synths on the title track help make up the

difference. ""I fought the night and the night fought me,"" Le Bon sings. The night wins, of course. But, on a modest scale, so do we.</p></div>"|14218.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14218-me-oh-my/|7.3|Marc Hogan

For this kind of group, an easy way with both old and new, composed and improvised, is essential, and Brooklyn Rider has it. On <i>Dominant Curve</i>, they've chosen to unify the album thematically more than musically, and they focus on exploring how the ideas of French composer Claude Debussy, who lived from 1862 to 1918, have traveled forward through music to the modern day. To that end, they've chosen to perform Debussy's own ""String Quartet in G Minor"", and Rider violinist Colin Jacobsen has composed his own four-movement quartet titled ""Achilles' Heel"" (Debussy's given name was Achille-Claude), which effectively explores similar rhythmic and harmonic concepts to the Debussy piece. The quartet also commissioned original compositions from Japan's Kojiro Umezaki, Uzbekistan's Dmitri Yanov-Yanovsky, and American Justin Messina that explore some of those same ideas in very different ways.</p>
<p>The reading of the old Debussy piece, originally written in 1893, is intense and lively, full of sharp dynamic shifts and subtly virtuoso playing that imparts amazing tonal and textural variety to the score. The third movement in particular is gorgeously ethereal. This piece is a natural choice for the group. When Debussy composed it, he was just embarking on his most celebrated phase, in which he became keenly interested in modal harmony, unusual scales and sound combinations, and ethnic music from outside Europe, including Indonesian gamelan, which informed some of his rhythmic ideas. Brooklyn Rider have built their repertoire on a restless interest in synthesizing global sounds and Western classical music. Jacobsen's piece, written to act as something of a descendant of ""String Quartet in G Minor"", also uses modal composition and shares some arranging sensibilities with its predecessor, making extensive use of pizzicato playing, rhythmic patterns, and non-standard bo
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
wing techniques-- the second movement is especially dramatic.</p>
<p>The other pieces are steps further removed from Debussy but still share elements with his ""String Quartet""-- notably the modal harmonic structures and tendency to call on the players to use odd techniques. Umezaki joins the quartet, playing a traditional Japanese wood flute called a shakuhachi-- his ""Cycles (What Falls Must Rise)"" is a textural piece that incorporates electronic manipulation. Messina also joins the quartet, controlling electronics on his own string quartet arrangement of John Cage's 1948 composition ""In a Landscape"", which was originally intended for piano or harp. It's a haunting piece to begin with, but this version, with its emphasis on high, sustained violin tones can make the hair stand up on your neck. It's Yanov-Yanovsky's ""...Al Niente"" that also strives for the drama inherent to Debussy's work, creating a harmonic smear that full-bodied violin runs can leap out of at its beginning and proceeding through odd rippling passages to a quiet and long decay.</p>
<p><i>Dominant Curve</i> succeeds in its attempt to bridge a classic work of a great composer with the work of that composer's stylistic descendants. Debussy's music and ideas still hold a lot of creative possibilities today. In performing the work of the man himself, Brooklyn Rider bring the ""String Quartet in G Minor"" vividly to life. On surrounding pieces, they extend invitations to listeners of modern minimalism and post-rock. With more work like this, Brooklyn Rider seem poised to earn attention on their own terms-- regardless of which composers they work with.</p></div>"|14263.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14263-dominant-curve/|7.5|Joe Tangari

Perth three-piece Tame Impala play with some of the ingredients of arena rock as well but do so in aid of more leftfield, organic sounds and interesting excursions. The result is a cleanly executed and frequently dazzling debut:<i> Innerspeaker</i> is a psychedelia-heavy outing that toys with paisley pop, stoner vibes, and an expansive array of swirling guitars.</p>
<p>On first listen, <i>Innerspeaker</i> provides a lot of dots to connect: There are patches of late-60s American psychedelia, buzzy Motor City riffage, and decades of British pop, ranging from the pastoral pop of the Kinks to the vivid expansiveness of the Verve to the narcotic warmth of the Stone Roses. Frontman Kevin Parker shares an eerie vocal similarity with John Lennon, both in tone and in the way he allows his voice to soar with each melodic turn or rhythmic surge. Though most of the album is a little restrained lyrically, Parker's rapturous phrasing conveys the meaning. Mixed by Flaming Lips collaborator Dave Fridmann, each component here is set on an even plane, allowing bass lines and delay-swept guitar bursts to melt into one another, cultivating a uniform feel that's vintage, far-out, and irrepressibly cool.</p>
<p>By all accounts, fixing their gaze so intently on established influences should play as either disingenuous or forced. It's difficult to be so plugged-in to a vintage feel without the music seeming time-capsuled, but the band's vibrance help these songs sound very much alive. Tame Impala aren't taking a purely revisionist approach-- you aren't left with a feeling that their intention was recreate some lost Love demo or an Jimi Hendrix Experience deep cut. If anything, their record points to some of the same roads traveled recently by bands like Animal Collective or Liars, but dials back the eccentricities and difficulty level, leaning on the guitar rather than electronics, and focusing their efforts through more traditional pysch-rock prisms. They aren't as adventurous as their more offbeat peers, but because of their lazer-guided hooks and tangible pleasures, they might wind up reaching more people.</p>
<p>This is very much an album's album-- it sounds best as a piece, where you can get lost in its heady expanse. With the kaleidoscopic stereo-panning on ""Why Won't You Make Up Your Mind?"" or the maddening stomp on ""Bold Arrow of Time"", <i>Innerspeaker </i>demonstrates a subtle yet encompassing sense of control, never obstructing the grander motifs while still offering a variety of odd details that guide you back to the album's hooks. There aren't any standout singles on<i> Innerspeaker </i>in the sense that it's unlikely that people are going to be asking you to throw on certain tracks by name (though if in a pinch, ""Expectation"" and ""Why Won't You Make Up Your Mind?"" should suffice nicely). But when an album is able to tinker with and update familiar textures and moods without blurring the lines too much or just plain overdoing it, you can believe that psych fans will be asking for it to be thrown on regardless. If you're smart, you'll oblige them.</p></div>"|14279.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14279-innerspeaker/|8.5|Zach Kelly

But he also has arguably the best ear for beats of any of his contemporaries, which turns his handicap into an asset more often than anyone could've imagined. Jeezy likes his tracks to be huge, oppressive things, their heavy gothic melodies only underscoring the titanic chaos of the drums. That lends him an urgency; he must really have some shit to say if he's willing to scream over that insanity. On his last album, 2008's <i>The Recession</i>, Jeezy found a loose unifying concept that channeled all his strengths into something better, turning him into a voice for the anxiety about the then-nosediving markets. Among other things, that was a smart way out of the endless drug-talk that his previous records had threatened to turn into cliche. But now he's back with the sequel to the mixtape that first put him on the radar, talking that same old drug-talk once again. And guess what? It still sounds pretty great.<br/><br/>For the first 10 or so tracks of <i>Trap or Die II</i>, Jeezy's in rare form, finding tracks denser and more feverish than anything he's ever rapped over. Drum patterns frantically jackhammer each other, trebley synth figures erupt out nowhere, and even the tracks that sample old-school soul seem to be almost entirely horn-stab. It's severe, physical music, almost a circa-2010 Southern gothic take on the Bomb Squad's dizzying barrage. It might be no accident that the two strongest songs here are called ""Insane"" and ""Lose My Mind"". The latter is, incredibly enough, Jeezy's new single-- a bold move, considering that the thing can make you feel like you've got voices in your head screaming at you. Jeezy and guest Plies come almost completely unhinged, screaming hoarse self-aggrandizement over what sounds like a symphony composed for car-alarms.<br/><br/>But Jeezy doesn't keep that energy up for long. Like a lot of mixtapes, <i>Trap or Die II</i> is too long, but unlike most, it's too long in a neat and orderly way, with almost all the strongest tracks front-loaded into the tape's first half. After that, Jeezy starts to relent, cranking out decent but unmemorable tracks that just seem to take up space. ""Hood Politics"" and ""Go Hard"" and ""My Tool"" reiterate the same motivational medication talk that Jeezy's done hundreds of times before, usually better. The hooks fall flat. ""Ride Wit Me"" somehow manages not to turn its Scarface and Trick Daddy guest-spots into gold. By the time the tape ends, you're exhausted. But once you delete the last half from your iTunes, you've got an EP-length release of ride-out music as fiery and visceral as anything you're likely to hear this year.</p></div>"|14289.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14289-trap-or-die-ii/|7.2|Tom Breihan

<p class=""MsoNormal""><span>Late last year, </span><i>The Chicago Reader </i><span>ran a story hailing the Ponys' return to the live stage. After releasing three seismic full-lengths, the most recent and and most commercially successful<span> for Matador, they did as that album's title suggested: They turned the lights out. The beloved local garage band had been progressing quietly over the years and just as their ball had seemed to really begin rolling, they took a break. Everything went silent. They began hibernating for what has seemed like some weird, indie rock eternity. So as that story made its way out of Chicago and onto the computer screens of nerds elsewhere, it brought with it a wave of excitement. ""We play in bands to write songs,"" guitarist Brian Case told the </span><i>Reader</i><span> of their decision to stop touring and rest. And after some of that, the itch to begin writing again brings us five songs in the form of the </span><i>Deathbed +4</i><span> EP, the whole of which acts as a jolting reminder that yeah, the Ponys are back.</span></span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span> An EP was a great way to get their beaks wet again without having to shoulder the songwriting weight of a full-length right away. In that same article, Jered Gummere promised that new material would further emphasize the Ponys rhythm section, including his wife/bassist Melissa Elias. He kept that promise. Lead mp3 ""Check the Door"" begins with a cymbal crash, drummer Nathan Jerde's steady tribal beat burning up the song's foreground for the following four minutes. Through Gummere's improved Ian Curtis impression and welcome, menacing guitar crescendos, the beat isn't buried. It makes for a much stronger, more muscular song, something that can be said more convincingly for every other slice of the EP.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span>Traditionally, the Ponys have been devout frontloaders. Not the case here. For the first time, the choicest cuts can be found closer to the record's center. Alongside the post-punk splash of ""Check the Door"", the titular track feels like one strut toward ""Is It Working"", one of the Pony's finest moments and the EP's apex At just two and a half minutes, it's short compared to the rest of the bunch. But it roars. Gummere ditches the vocal affect, the tempo lunges, and the twin guitars buzz as they antagonize one another.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span><span>""Pop Culture (Revisited)"" ensures there's no lull in its wake. When Gummere declares ""we are the pop culture,"" he punctuates it with an eye-rolling, hair-flipping ""uh-huh."" It's awesome. The snark sounds just as acidic as it did when the band first dropped <i>Laced With Romance</i></span><span> in 2004. The swagger is still there. While ""The Walk"" kicks in, it brings to mind Wolf Parade and does so with a great sense of theater. But behind it, in the meat of the EP, is where the Ponys announce they've returned. Rumble to quake, it sounds like reason to be excited they're still making music, even more so for what's to come.</span></span></p></div>"|14295.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14295-deathbed-4-ep/|7.8|David Bevan

Listening to this record front-to-back feels like a staring contest with the void, as the Australian duo of Lucy Phelan and Matthew Hopkins thrash through 1960s psych, harsh dub, and early Sonic Youth, if nobody in that band cared about guitar solos or arcane tunings. It sounds like they don't care about much of anything at all, actually as long as whatever they've got when they plug in makes one hell of a racket.</p>
<p>And it does. ""Heavy"" is definitely the operative word here, which makes <i>Heaps of Nothing</i> a departure from 2007's comparatively sparse <i>Blood Pressure Sessions</i>. There's serious stomp anchoring songs like ""Wrong Room"" that add urgency to the band's blank stares, and the track's very few chord changes end up coming off like gut-shot reverberations. The album is bookended with two songs, ""Mysterious Oven"" and ""Blank Minds"", that wear doom metal's brown-sound misery like a second skin.</p>
<p>When they're not adding slight color to their garbage-in-the-rain sonic aesthetic, Naked on the Vague are knee-deep in the mud, throwing in keyboard washes and distorted breakdowns lest they get too comfortable. You can rarely understand what Lucy Phelan is actually ""singing"", but when a voice is capable of exulting forcefully endless antagonism and apathy over amp-blown sermons like ""The Joke"", words aren't necessary.</p>
<p>All this noise and negativity can get tiring after a while. Although <i>Heaps of Nothing</i> can be a blast to listen to in small doses, as an album it embraces sonic overkill. This record is definitely a step closer to a more accessible sound, but it's still far from melodic. It's visceral stuff, and when it's brought together in album form, the listening experience can feel like a marathon. As such, it's just as easy to lose your patience (in the case of the seven-minute centerpiece ""Sacred Youth"") as it is to let <i>Heaps of Nothing</i> beat you into submission.</p>
<p>Stick with this one, then, or at least afford it more than a few listens. If you don't, you might miss Naked on the Vague's surprising sense of humor, like Phelan's ""In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida""-ripping organ line that kicks open ""These Days"" before it's torn apart by Hopkins' hacksaw guitar lines. Or the so-obvious-it-had-to-be-intentional Daydream Nation guitar lick that introduces ""Mysterious Oven"". Despite the chaotic, nearly inscrutable din that they create, Naked on the Vague walk away from <i>Heaps of Nothing</i> with a whole shitload of personality.</p></div>"|14266.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14266-heaps-of-nothing/|7.3|Larry Fitzmaurice

On <i>Vespers</i>, this group-- led by former Antony and the Johnsons guitarist, and current member of Slow Six, Stephen Griesgraber-- makes it way through a collection of stately, handsome pieces. Greisgraber is also Redhooker's writer, but his songs don't focus on his guitar playing (excepting one Clogs-like turn in ""Friction"", with his winding arpeggio driving the track). Instead, he's content to hover in the background on tracks like the contemplative ""Standing Still"" or the swelling ""Trip And Fall"", ceding the spotlight to the trio of strings players and bass clarinetist in the group. For four of its six tracks (including the patiently haunting ""Bedside""), <i>Vespers</i> sticks to this script, offering tasteful melodic motifs for the players to encircle and play off of for five to six minutes. It's enjoyable music, even if it may come off as somewhat unoriginal. If you're not a diehard fan of the music proffered by aforementioned groups, then what Redhooker does here, though they do it well, might not be something you absolutely need to hear.</p>
<p>That said, both skeptics and converts should be interested in checking out the album's two longest tracks, ""Presence and Reflection"" and ""Black Light Poster Child""-- at 27 minutes total, the comprise over half of <i>Vespers</i>' running time. In an interview for online Glasgow zine <a href=""http://earz-mag.com/2010/02/redhookers-vespers-track-by-track/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Earz Mag</a>, Greisgraber described their inspiration: ""For years I had been interested in the idea of improvising with a small ensemble, capturing the live sounds of that ensemble, and replaying them so that the improvisers would not only be reacting to each other in real time, but also responding to what may have been played minutes before."" Through the use of Max/MSP software, Greisgraber was able to realize that idea's potential. Whether it's the freedom of not having to follow sheet music, or just a happy confluence of luck and skill, these tracks find Redhooker discovering sounds from their instruments they might otherwise not have discovered, and opening up new vistas as a result.</p>
<p>The interplay between the players is both careful and curious, each seemingly trying to gently push the others along while not straying too far from what's come before. Coupled with the ""feedback loop"" of what they've already played emerging in the background, the end results of these two explorations are shifting, unsettling near-ambient drones that still manage to engage. On ""Presence"", the improvisations gives way at a pre-planned point to a more structured movement, and the shift is jarring in the best possible way. There's no such change in ""Black Light"", but the track's gradual construction of its haunting wall of sound is no less intriguing for such an absence. In light of these explorations, returning to the more composed confines of the other tracks on this record is almost a disappointment. <i>Vespers</i> as a whole is a fine album, especially for a debut. But though the group proves themselves to be excellent players, they seem to truly rise to the occasion when they're on unfamiliar ground, which is something I hope they explore further on future records.</p></div>"|14287.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14287-vespers/|7.2|David Raposa

All that grief he got for appearing in two <i>Alvin and the Chipmunks </i>movies? Hell, having <i>The Squeakquel </i>on the same IMDB page as <i>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</i> means getting paid <i>and </i>having one of the weirdest résumés since Raul Julia. It also means that for all his reputation as an edgy, confrontational crank, he's still got enough versatility to switch to lighthearted family fare and back. And if you go back to his previous two CDs, <i>Shut Up, You Fucking Baby! </i>and <i>It's Not Funny</i>, you might be able to catch the absurd undercurrent that allows him to run that kid-friendly/shock comedy range. Those were polarizing sets, ones where detractors claimed he came across like a pompous, arrogant know-it-all. But that onstage persona worked because he made it clear that beneath all the seething irritation with other people's stupidity was an anxious sense that he had no idea what to do except freak the fuck out. There was fear and anger in his material, but it was the same kind of fear and anger felt by every thoughtful type who's ever felt outnumbered by hostile morons.</p>
<p>All that said, there's something inexplicably missing from <i>Bigger and Blackerer</i>, his latest comedy record<i>.</i> It's definitely not the confrontational stuff-- he touches on rape, racism, necrophilia involving famous Holocaust victims, anti-Semitism, drugs, pedophilia, and the ridiculousness of organized religion. It's not the left-leaning political material-- of course Cross has something to say about scares over Obama's ""death panels."" And it's not the self-aware showmanship; the CD opens with an intentionally ludicrous Tom Jones-style number about all the edgy, anger-provoking (yet cosmonaut-free) material yet to come in the set, while the DVD cut of the set kicks off with a foul-mouthed grade school kid in glasses and a bald cap impersonating Cross for a few minutes before pulling an Axl Rose (""Are you recording this? No way, I specifically said no recording of any kind!"") and stomping off the stage.</p>
<p>But in contrast to <i>It's Not Funny</i>, his last comedy album released a full six years ago, <i>Bigger</i> is missing the sense of the gleefully ridiculous that colors Cross' best material. At his peak, he could be calm and bitter and manic and naïf-like all during the same train of thought, and in the process he could pull out words and phrases and associations nobody else could think of while dismantling things you thought you already knew. Here, instead of magnifying the lameness of dumb consumer products or religious mythology with increasingly elaborate non-sequiturs or references to sad-but-true cultural detritus, he tries to carry things by restating obvious, familiar arguments-- Mormonism's as much of a fraud as Scientology; Tea Party protesters are ignorant-- and rambling through labored, joke-deficient setups as though these observations were automatically funny on face value. And while the edgy stuff does a great job of pushing buttons-- like where he discusses his plan to buy a commemorative MLK vanity license plate reading ""NGR LVR"", or taunts Orthodox Jews for dressing ridiculous-- it's not in the context of mocking the hypocrisy of institutionalized discrimination that made this kind of material work for him before. Cross has never come across as this needlessly crass.</p>
<p>Maybe the most telling stretch of <i>Bigger and Blackerer </i>is the 14-and-a-half-minute portion of drug talk early in the set, where he transitions from goofing on ""Intervention""<i> </i>to discussing his own experiences with getting fucked up. It's material Cross has dealt with spectacularly in the past-- few moments of wasted, existential panic in comedy can match the ""answer your telephone"" bit in <i>Fucking Baby</i>-- but aside from a pretty funny routine about what it's like to try and hide how high you are in a convenience store (which, like many of the bits, benefits greatly from watching Cross act it out on the DVD), it's a bit too personal and unpleasant to laugh at. When more than one audience member shouts ""woo"" at Cross' admittance of being fucked up on drugs and alcohol for the last 10 years, Cross' retort-- ""unless you're a dealer, it's not gonna turn out good""-- only underpins how uncomfortable the whole thing is. And that's before he admits that those years of abuse led him to the point where he'd wind up shitting his pants in public.</p>
<p>Cross is a talented performer, a gifted writer, and arguably the reason so many people have wound up getting into the alt-comedy scene in the first place. And there's still flashes of Cross' brilliance at points: There's a great bit on the DVD where he yells at his hearing-impaired interpreter for telling different jokes than him-- and anti-Semitic ones at that-- which David then transitions immediately into a bit comparing the guilt-trip name of an eco-friendly product (""If You Care"") to a passive-aggressive rabbi. And the last joke in the set, where he talks about how he overcame more than 30 years of chronic depression-- ""the entire time, I had a rock in my shoe""-- is a perfectly understated bit on how hard it really is to overcome mental blocks. So it feels kind of gratuitous to single <i>Bigger and Blackerer </i>out as a misstep, especially at a point in his career where the backlash has long since threatened to overwhelm the goodwill. But by shifting his tone from thoughtful, us-vs.-them irreverence into misanthropic venting, Cross has lost a lot of what made his standup appealing in the first place. His career isn't a writeoff, but I've got a bad feeling about that velvet-painting album cover-- you don't often see one depicting the skinny Elvis.</p></div>"|14233.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14233-bigger-and-blackerer/|5.6|Nate Patrin

Not your average singer-songwriter, she is both supermodel and wife to Jack White of the White Stripes, Dead Weather, and Raconteurs. As the story goes, Elson, who's written and performed for several years with the Citizens Band cabaret troupe in New York, had written a heap of songs on her own. White coaxed out a few, enjoyed what was probably his eighth or ninth eureka moment that day, and rounded up a war party to take into his Third Man studio in Nashville. He was going to help her record her debut, <i>The Ghost Who Walks</i>, and he hooked it up pretty nicely. The list of players is as long and impressive (see: Jackson Smith, son of Patti/husband to Meg White/""brother-in-law"" to Elson lends his guitar talents) as the level of scrutiny attached is intense. No matter which angle you take, it's safe to say Karen Elson has one very enormous shadow to escape. And to do that, the songs here would need to be great rather than good.</p>
<p>They are merely the latter. White sat behind the drumkit here (his fills in ""Garden"" are one of a few arresting moments to be found) as well as took production reins, his devotion to all things analog a superb match for realizing the American roots music Elson's taken a shine to. While that setup makes it even more difficult to separate her from her bio, White has reeled out another warm recording you can almost hold. That's audible from the first organ notes and strums (Elson's) of the titular opener, a murder ballad. It's not an especially remarkable song, but it's sharply arranged and beautifully played. The same can be said for the antebellum twirl of ""Cruel Summer"" or country march of ""The Birds They Circle"" or actually, the album from head down to its boots: each composition is fleshed out as well as it can be, the end result still a kind of Appalachian wallpaper music that after further inspection and subsequent listens, leaves the record sounding much more flims

It's the launch of a very strong closing trio, the closing wails of ""Mouths to Feed"" more chilling than any other corner of the album. Elson's voice doesn't boast the same force as a Neko Case or (onetime White muse) Loretta Lynn, but it's not wimpy either. It communicates through and through that she really loves singing these songs. Whether she's capable of making them her own isn't something <i>The Ghost Who Walks</i> can tell us.</p></div>"|14300.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14300-the-ghost-who-walks/|6.3|David Bevan

Compare his sudden rise with that of his obvious influences, like Pimp C, whose impact was still just being recognized upon his death, or T.I., who toiled in the Atlanta underground after a major-label false start before beginning his ascendancy. K.R.I.T. is a talented artist, a rapper with dimension and ambition who has learned much at the feet of the masters. His new record, <i>K.R.I.T. Wuz Here</i>, is a strong release from a kid who has a lot of ideas and approaches, although he hasn't quite established himself as a distinctive star, and often falls back on a collection of well-crafted southern rap clichés. The fact that we're even talking about him today is because he stands on the shoulders of some rappers who didn't have such an easy path to critical acceptance.</p>
<p>It helps that K.R.I.T. seems uninterested in following the paths of major-label creative casualty B.o.B., who seemed to outgrow rap before he could even grow into it. Instead, the rapper joins a first wave of new artists (G-Side, Yelawolf, Pill) working a vein of Southern rap traditionalism, embracing the production aesthetics of UGK and Organized Noize. K.R.I.T.'s ear is his biggest strength; as a producer, tracks like ""Return of Forever"" and ""Country Shit"" find him revitalizing the staid indie rap template with the 808s and swagger of Southern rap.</p>
<p>As a rapper, K.R.I.T. still seems to be working his persona out, as if his talents have leapt ahead of his sense of self. Just as he deftly emulates great producers, his rap influences are the best of the best; choosing Pimp C as a stylistic forefather suggests he identifies with strong personalities, even if he's working his way through them to find his own. And T.I.'s topical breadth and lyrical flexibility serve a strong example for an artist uninterested in painting himself into a corner. Goodie Mob certainly laid a blueprint for his more socio-political verses. It's also smart of him to work with rappers like Curren$y-- the most charismatic nu-South backpack rapper. If K.R.I.T. follows this path, he could end up with a truly great career.</p>
<p>And while this tape is strong, it's as much about potential as it is an achievement in itself; as great as it sounds hearing K.R.I.T.'s scrappy rap style ride ""Country Shit""'s energetic beat, the track is almost undercut by its topical genericism. Tracks like ""Just Touched Down"" and ""See Me on Top"" feel like steps further back; standard soul loops, archetypal exercises flawlessly executed but ultimately quite empty. The flip is tracks like ""They Got Us"", ""Children of the World"", or ""Small as a Giant,"" where K.R.I.T.'s reflective, conscious approach shows signs of personal honesty, political frustration, and hints at the person hidden behind the music.</p></div>"|14285.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14285-krit-wuz-here/|7.7|David Drake

And over their seven-year existence, London pranksters the Chap have taken a considerable amount of glee in skewering social mores and aspirational affluence, with a manic, meta-pop approach that doesn't so much plant tongue in cheek as pierce it right through. But like the satirical UK periodical for which they're named, behind the Chap's broadly sardonic front lies a sincere hope for a better, more humane way of living. On album number five, <i>Well Done Europe</i>, the Chap continue their mission of mocking the finer things in life, but also zero in on the suppressed anxieties that go along with obtaining them. <br/><br/>To that end, the Chap's ethos owes less to such esteemed class commentators as Ray Davies and Jarvis Cocker than to the likes of Kraftwerk and Steely Dan-- bands who observed high-society behavior not from the sidelines, but within it. Like the Chap's previous albums, <i>Well Done Europe </i>frantically plunders myriad pop subgenres-- post-punk, 1980s New Pop, hard rock, electro, pastoral psychedelic folk, krautrock, Afro-funk, laptop glitch-pop-- in a manner that reflects the ravenous consumerism and rat-race pressures detailed in its songs, complete with references to summer homes, frappuccinos, Shakira, white-water rafting vacations, characters with upper-crusty names like Holden and-- especially on-point in the wake of the Icelandic-volcano eruption-- the marvelous efficiency of European air travel.  <br/><br/>But on <i>Well Done Europe</i>, there's a more palpable sense of the emotional void that no amount of luxury goods can fill-- where the nocturnal techno-pop of ""Few Horoscope"" leans heavily on the trusty old post-punk saw of portraying romance as a mechanical process (""it's too late...to reboot/ The passion""), the similarly austere ""Obviously"" effectively ruminates on the eternal question of modern-day, computer-world  dependency, as two disconnected voices repeatedly ask, ""Is anybody still out there?"" And if songs like ""We'll See to Your Breakdown"" and ""Even Your Friend"" stay true to the band's openly scornful, hyper-pop aesthetic, there's an insidious, understated allure to the bass-throbbed ""Well Done You"" and the shimmering jangle of ""Pain Fan"" seemingly designed to have the very middle-management types caricatured within tapping along on their Beemer steering wheels during the morning commute. On 2008's <i>Mega Breakfast</i>, the Chap cheekily declared their intent to make ""proper songs for real folk!"" <i>Well Done Europe</i> delivers a surprise punchline: they weren't joking.</p></div>"|14291.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14291-well-done-europe/|7.7|Stuart Berman

Both players have made marks on the Eau Claire scene that fostered Bon Iver's success-- Moen drumming for Amateur Love and Laarks, Pisano once the frontman for Wilco-worshipping Wars of 1812. But <i>Inter-Be</i>, their debut, is a record tethered to time more than geography. It's a small collection of songs Pisano cranked out in one feverish evening and brought to Moen shortly thereafter, every hook and cranny fleshed out to sound like it's been Skyped in from a front porch 50 years ago. The signal is clear.</p>
<p>M. Ward has long been a force in indie rock's old-timey lane, and Pisano and Moen reside very much in his spirit, using what sounds to be almost exclusively vintage gear. Pisano sings in a rangy falsetto. His songwriting is ragged, understated, and striking above all else. Moen's textural contributions are just as subtle. Though <i>Inter-Be</i> sounds roughly hewn at times, it's an album woven together with great care and a sharp ear for detail. Opener ""Crutch &amp; Cane"" is as airy and breathable as gym shorts, Pisano working up a nice shuffle over Moen's locomotive drumwork. As a jumping-off point, it captures one of two moods Peter Wolf Crier maintain, the brooding, laser-focused tumbling of ""Hard as Nails"" its counterpoint. Toss on some headphones and you can quickly get a very good sense of how these two meet in the middle as they fingerpick over tom ripples over wily vocal harmonies. It's not as effervescent as say, a Dodos explosion, but it's equally haunting in it's own quiet way.</p>
<p>""Down Down Down"" and ""Untitled 101"" are two more beautiful moments, amblers gussied up with synth and saloon piano. On ""Demo 01"" Pisano goes even more pastoral, recalling Devendra Banhart at his most still. Where <i>Inter-Be</i> suffers, it's in the limited number of gears/speeds their sound allows them-- their binary nature can serve to mute a middling song (""Lion"") or highlight a bad one. The minor-chord plodding of ""For Now"" is one such example of the latter, its verses trying and hook invisible enough that despite Moen's layering, it simply falls flat. It's not a matter of being locked in; there's just always a much more listenable, toothsome option elsewhere. Take ""You're So High"", a simple set of chords glued to a beat that just works. Though similar to a lot of the other material, it's the album's sturdiest, a song that finds Peter Wolf Crier at their best. Plainspoken, it is exactly how it's presented. We need more of that.</p></div>"|14290.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14290-peter-wolf-crier/|6.9|David Bevan

An unnecessary shroud, at that; Lazaro is actually Ishmael ""Butterfly"" Butler of the 1990's Native Tongues-leaning collective Digable Planets-- and, later, of the more pessimistically inclined group Cherrywine.</p>
<p>Lazaro's approach is a refreshing change-- leading with your work instead of your persona; asking fans to interpret it rather than provide them answers. It's clear that he wants his art to be taken seriously, and based on his output so far it certainly will. Shabazz Palaces' first two mini-albums,<i> Of Light</i> and its self-titled follow-up, are almost as paradoxical as the project's identity politics. Lazaro occasionally spits conscious verses about struggling and corruption, but he's also not afraid to go all hardhead and talk tough. <span> </span>His lyrical subjects can be quotidian, frequently focusing on food and hanging out; his song titles, however, are frequently so long-winded that including all of them in full here would break any sensible editor's word count. The beats are dense and, at times, haunted; at the same time, this shit would sound great booming out of passing car windows.</p>
<p>That is especially true of <i>Shabazz Palaces</i>, which acts as a dark, challenging foil to <i>Of Light</i>'s relative playfulness. The beats here take equal cues from the blown-out sci-fi dystopia of Company Flow, the harsh static antagonism of Anti-Pop Consortium and Dälek, and Los Angeles' Brainfeeder collective's head-swimming ganja burn. Impeccable reference points-- and the way they're synthesized is impressive-- but these abstract beats have never been easy to convincingly rap over. But Lazaro handles it with intensity on every track here, moving with the rhythm no matter how irregular it may be.</p>
<p>The chameleonic role Lazaro plays within these compositions is aided by his grizzled, gruff voice, which sounds worlds away from the smoother vocals he displayed with Digable Planets or Cherrywine. It could be assumed that this noticeable change was brought on by years of toiling under the radar of hip-hop's fickle hype machine. It's easy to compare Ishmael Butler's artistic transformation into Palaceer Lazaro to Zev Love X's transformation to MF Doom: Both started out in earnest-talking early 90s collectives, and once the optimism ran dry, they laid low before reemerging as wizened, idiosyncratic, and enigmatic.</p>
<p>Of course, reemergence doesn't always guarantee eternal success, as Doom's ever-unspooling narrative shows.

With Everything But the Girl, it seemed like her every long-held note wore away the ideal of the stable relationship-- ironic considering that Thorn ended up marrying her co-collaborator Ben Watt. Considering that she and Watt are on a presumably happy course, what with the marriage and the kids and all, <i>Love and Its Opposite</i> seems a unusual effort. The opening cut, ""Oh, the Divorces!"", says it all: With spare and folksly instrumentation behind her, Thorn pleads ""Who's next? Who's next?"" implying love's unfortunately serial nature. She's certainly playing a character here, but her resigned candor convincingly suggests that she's been burned enough to carry a record suspicious of love's charms.</p>
<p>Take the title. Thorn invites poetic discussion of what love's opposite actually <i>is</i>, and it sure as shit doesn't have to be hate or war. On ""Long White Dress"", Thorn suggests that romance does little but gunk up her head, and at this point it's better to settle. Love's opposite? Might as well be reality. Whether she herself believes it or not, the record all over laments the perfectionist disappointment of eluding true love. The curiously ham-fisted ""Singles Bar"" has Thorn's narrator just past her prime but still trying to fit into the Sexy Jeans, desperate to reel in a guy and the satisfaction to which she once felt entitled but somehow missed. The cliché ""I wish you'd help me out of this mess/ I wish you'd help me out of this dress"" sums up the shortsighted, long-in-the-tooth gal 20 years removed from the Everything But the Girl heyday.</p>
<p>Working once again with British producer Ewan Pearson, Thorn further dials down the synthesizer-based production that garnered her and Watt their greatest fame. 2007's <i>Out of the Woods</i> was a relatively low-key affair, but <i>Love and Its Opposite </i>plays more like a conventional singer-songwriter album. The shift in gears isn't unwelcome: Thorn, as always, exercises that smoky voice to great effect. It's not especially clear how much self-aware Thorn's hammy singer-songwriter character is, because if you don't suspend a bit of disbelief, then ""Singles Bar"" and ""You Are a Lover"" seem more a stilted narration of an unhappily independent woman inhabiting Lilith Fair's second stage. It's nice to think, however, that Thorn's earnest, middle-aged concept album, saddled as it is with its middle-of-the-road folksiness, illustrates that it's not all about love vs. hate, but the truly adult idea of still caring vs. no longer giving a shit.</p></div>"|14297.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14297-love-and-its-opposite/|6.9|Mike Orme

You could start from the beginning, 1997's <i>Waters Ave. S.</i>, but that record is filled with the sort of angsty, electric Pac NW indie-rock that is largely uncharacteristic of his catalogue as a whole. You could start with his first folk-leaning LP, 1999's <i>Rehearsals for Departure</i>, which has one of the best and most tender songs he's written, ""Eyes For Windows"", or 2002's comparatively upbeat <i>I Break Chairs</i>, but there's not much to make either stand out from the pack. If nothing else, Jurado has been oddly cursed by his own consistency.</p>
<p>Produced by the increasingly ubiquitous Richard Swift, <i>Saint Bartlett, </i>Jurado's ninth record is, finally, a striking departure. So much so that only the sound of his voice keeps you from thinking this could be the work of someone else. The change is noticeable right off the bat, announced by the lushly stringed baroque pop of ""Cloudy Shoes"", and it continues throughout<i></i>, with meditations on 1950s girl-group balladry, thorny Neil Young-esque guitar rock, and cavernous chamber-pop.</p>
<p>Swift deserves a fair amount of credit for the reinvention that's on display here, and his ear for instrumentation does wonders for these songs. The woodblock percussion that backs ""Arkansas"" gives the tune a slight ramshackle bent, while Swift applies the perfect amount of guitar fuzz to turn ""Wallingford"" into a gentle stomper. Most impressively, the application of subtle space in ""Kalama"" lends a new gravitas to Jurado's voice, effectively making him bigger than his own sound.</p>
<p>Despite Swift's major contributions, <i>Saint Bartlett</i> is still very much a Damien Jurado album. His best work has always been marked with heartache and desolation, and it's a testament to his strengths that even on <i>Saint Bartlett</i>'s most upbeat songs, he manages to convey feelings of loneliness and loss. It helps here that he's still working within his lyrical wheelhouse. The mood on <i>Saint Bartlett </i>ranges from bitter to desperate and back again. Mostly, though, Jurado claims ownership of <i>Saint Bartlett</i>'s achievements simply by turning in his strongest songwriting to date. Even the straightforward folk cuts here have more potentcy, especially on haunting ""Beacon Hill"".</p>
<p>The songs on <i>Saint Bartlett</i> would be considered an achievement for any artist-- but the fact that they come 13 years into a career makes the album even more of a triumph. Maybe the record's accessibility and lushness could lead to a bigger audience for Jurado, but in any case, it's a welcome surprise from a journeyman so dependable he risked being forgotten.</p></div>"|14258.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14258-saint-bartlett/|7.9|Larry Fitzmaurice

The Los Angeles-via-Washington, DC psych-rock trio have spent much of the past decade dusting off the knotty proto-metal of yesteryear-- as performed by bands like Vanilla Fudge, Blue Cheer, or Black Sabbath-- and pushing it toward darker, druggier, and heavier extremes. Coming two years after the band's last proper release, 2008's <i>Old Growth</i>, <i>Three Kings</i> is an unabashed homage to Led Zeppelin's concert film <i>The Song Remains the Same</i>-- packaging a live recording and a few new studio tunes with a DVD that cuts between performance footage and loopy dream sequences.</p>
<p>While the relatively high viscosity of Dead Meadow's music is an asset to the band's studio releases and live sets, it doesn't translate to the screen very well. In general, the heaviest personalities on stage at a Dead Meadow concert are the band's amplifiers. Stripped of the high volume and gut-churning low end, the band inevitably loses some urgency. During ""Sleepy Silver Door"" Jason Simon lays a strong case for his inclusion in the guitar-hero pantheon, but he's not much of a showman. His only stage move is to work the wah-wah pedal.</p>
<p>The fantasy sequences, which do a sort of headshop take on Alejandro Jodorowsky's surreal cult film <i>The Holy Mountain</i>, are meant to alleviate the burden of excitement during some of the band's jammier excursions. But they mostly just suggest that Dead Meadow does, indeed, have a sense of humor. Simon along with bassist Steve Kille and drummer Stephen McCarty strut about in wizard garb. During one animated sequence, a group of bipedal weed-creatures self-immolate, then the moon inhales the smoke and, well, you get the idea. The studio tracks are largely standard issue, too, the kind of groovy head-nodding prog-blues that the band can write in its sleep at this point.</p>
<p>As a monument to Dead Meadow's live show, <i>Three Kings</i> largely flounders. But when combined with the mp3-only bonus t
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
racks, it does work pretty well as a de facto greatest hits album, offering up solid takes of material from across the band's discography. And the DVD's main narrative-- three young men toy with the dark intrigues and are swept up into a bizarre alternate reality-- has some strange, possibly unintentional, parallels to Dead Meadow's own career. Here are three East Coast indie-rock guys (two members were once in the scrappy emo band the Impossible Five) who took a glimpse behind stoner-rock's veil and wound up tripping through a psychedelic wormhole, that deposited them, for better or worse, in Hollywood.</p></div>"|14247.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14247-three-kings/|6.7|Aaron Leitko

MGM's Jack Armondo's nylon-stringed electric guitar has the same prickly yet supple tone, and his streamlined riffs leave behind the same glittery trails. The guitar stabs on ""Fingerprints"" are so Nick Zinnerishly juiced-up they actually <i>splash</i>. And while Gretta Rochelle may ""hear a thousand voices/ Possessing me,"" we can usually make out only one of them. Like Karen O, she runs on a rheostat, transitioning smoothly between low-wattage sultriness and a floodlit blare. At one point, she even breaks out the clock onomatopoeia from ""Tick"".</p>
<div><span>On the other hand, this is an entirely different kind of band. While YYYs seem intent on carrying similar influences into the future, MGM are self-aware, crafting a period homage that avoids sounding dated thanks to the band's raw primordial stomp. (Gretta Rochelle is the drummer and singer, and handles both tasks with a lot of physicality.) They seem to long for a regional heyday: There is something very ""Chicago"" about their 90s-rock nostalgia. Like Sybris, they salute an era when the Windy City was home to one of the world's biggest, most ambitious alt-rock bands, the Smashing Pumpkins, and they strive, in a pared-down and punked-up way, to recapture that spirit of high-stakes drama.
</span><p>The limply retro Blondie sing-speak Rochelle deployed on ""Bitches"", My Gold Mask's minor (and rather silly) 2009 hit, reappears for portions of ""All Up in the Air"", but the new music is much better-- generous with epic breakdowns, mini guitar symphonies, massive drum and cymbal crashes, and lusty choruses. It's referential without feeling canned; a rambunctious DIY energy mortars together the big moments. ""Violet Eyes"" is clearly their killer track, with one of those forehead-smackingly simple arrangements that can be so effective when delivered with enough energy: It's mainly a lean sequence of riffs, fizzy syncopated woodblocks, and an instantly memorable vocal melody. ""I like shooting arrows in the dark/ I like driving nails into your heart!"" Rochelle sings with bratty sweetness, the lines whizzing up and bursting like fireworks on their end words.</p>
<p>But to say My Gold Mask are explosive is a compliment with a built-in criticism: They hit hard and fizzle quickly. Nothing else here has the impact of ""Violet Eyes"". ""All Up in the Air"" changes the tone, with off-kilter guitar sharking through all kinds of cool parts-- perhaps too many. The song gets lost in the signifiers. They shift again on ""Fingerprints""-- it's a bit like the xx playing a medley of riffs from Metallica's <i>Black Album</i>-- to similarly blurry effect. By the reheated ""Circle Mass"", they seem to be out of ideas. Still, the bottled lightning of ""Violet Eyes"" makes My Gold Mask a band to watch-- if they begin to achieve that kind of unbridled immediacy more consistently, they'll be a powerhouse.</p>

The duo's <i>Train of Thought </i>was one of the reasons indie rap felt so vibrant in 2000, and 10 years later it's an underground classic. But from that point onwards, Talib Kweli and Hi-Tek have been doing good for themselves on their own. Ever since Jay-Z pointed to him as a lyrical ideal on <i>The Black Album</i>'s ""Moment of Clarity"", Kweli seems to have treated it as both an honor and a challenge. He's subsequently grown into the role of an uncompromising lifer: spitting double-time, folding internal rhymes in on themselves, toying with meter in a way that would leave other MCs tripping over their own tongues, and building his countless metaphors and punchlines into big-picture politics and vivid narratives. And Hi-Tek's production style has developed a similar non-complacent comfortability, subtly honing down and polishing his intricate club-caliber neo-soul to the point where it sneaks up on you instead of knocking you over.</p>
<p>So <i>Revolutions Per Minute</i> isn't as momentous a revival as it might seem-- it's just, well, another good Talib Kweli album with more solid Hi-Tek beats, an example of good chemistry between two artists who happen to have good chemistry with lots of other collaborators. And it might be tempting to take something like that for granted, maybe start picking apart its flaws instead. There are a couple: It's never a good idea to open an album with that old ""I'm an escapee from a 1950s educational film and I'm here to tell you how record players work"" bit. Someone decided to invite Chester French over for ""Get Loose"" for some reason. And while the Estelle-featuring ""Midnight Hour"" makes for a better Black Eyed Peas single than the Black Eyed Peas, farty big-band horns and cornily delivered lines like ""We riders on the storm/ Touch me baby, like the Doors"" aren't why you are interested in this record.</p>
<p>But those are minor demerits, and the things people <i>do </i>listen for-- conscious yet unpretentious lyricism delivered with acrobatic dexterity over on-point, no-gimmick beats-- are all over this album. Kweli and Hi-Tek never had to rework their styles to stay on the cusp of mainstream-name status, so they've spent more time playing to their strengths than distracting themselves from them. When Kweli gets political (depicting the oil industry's impact on the Middle East and Nigeria on ""Ballad of the Black Gold""), deconstructs the industry (the fame-as-seductress ""Got Work"") or just goes battle-ready with three of his sharpest peers (the Jay Electronica/J. Cole/Mos Def posse cut ""Just Begun""), he finds new lyrical angles on subjects with which he's long been familiar. And whether Hi-Tek pulls together a minimalist beat with lots of breathing room (""City Playgrounds""; ""In the Red"") or a dense, lush track piled high with soul vocals (""In This World""; ""Ends""), he entrusts his work to an MC who bridges freestyle spontaneity and crafted precision. Their easy stylistic rapport shouldn't be a shock, but it's still a minor surprise how rewarding it can be. Waiting a decade for Talib Kweli and Hi-Tek to collaborate on an album might have resulted in a nostalgic reunion. But while you were waiting, two rewarding careers built themselves up into the only kind of legacy that could produce it.</p></div>"|14292.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14292-revolutions-per-minute/|7.5|Nate Patrin

Last generation's gleaming chrome-and-plastic tomorrow gets fed through a chemical bath by some junkshop customer with a home recording studio, and it comes out the other end as a shambling wreck of digital decay, Frankenstein-stitched into discolored reveries or blown-out squalls.</p>
<p>Black Moth Super Rainbow frontman Tom Fec has been on both the mellow and the noisy sides of that mutation process. And where BMSR's last CD release, <i>Eating Us</i>, was a loud but frequently pretty collection of woozily psychedelic prog-pop, Tobacco's second solo album <i>Maniac Meat</i> is all fuzz and snarl, tar-pit bass and rusty-hinged drum machines smashed into corroded analog synths that sound like they were found in a backwoods scrapyard. Think of Boards of Canada's bucolic science-filmstrip wispiness run through a grease-caked doom metal/funk filter, or El-P's noisier productions with the dread and horror replaced by giddy bewilderment. I don't namedrop lightly-- it's actually a familiar, comfortable ride if you keep previous experiences with <i>Geogaddi</i> or <i>Fantastic Damage</i> at the forefront of your head while listening to this.</p>
<p>That's more of a case of kinship than replication. Tobacco shares those artists' samples-and-synths methodology towards similar hip-hop-skewing ends, but he tends to keep a finer balance toward both sides of his ""ugly beauty"" approach. Tobacco's inhuman, vaguely menacing but mysteriously cheerful filtered voice has a lot to do with that. It's the source of much of the album's decayed-future personality, drawing ambiguous threats, damaged come-ons, and grotesque accusations through unsettlingly fragile vocoder whispers: ""Lick the witch/ Make a friend tonight""; ""You got sick from a lolly lolly lollipop/ You feel free when you're killing me"". It's not the only voice, of course: a pair of Beck cameos on ""Fresh Hex"" and ""Grape Aerosmith"" feature the same postmodern lyrical ambiguity that made him famous, and evoke the mutant electro of his circa-<i>Midnite Vultures</i> B-sides. But Fec's tone of subtly unhinged, deceptively naïf-like menace-- or deceptively menacing giddiness, depending on what you've just fed into your system-- runs the show.</p>
<p>That goes double for the motley collection of jury-rigged electronic debris he funnels his music through. Synthetic and live drums alike are both amplified to the point of borderline physical discomfort, basslines melt into riffs that growl like oversized predators, and the treble end is dominated by distorted analog buzzes that sound more like Nintendo superbikes than any kind of easily-graspable hook. But then a bright keyboard melody will jump out-- a Cars-like siren wailing over the hopped-up punk racket of ""Constellation Dirtbike Head""; a glimmering electric chime piercing the machine-shop boom-bap of ""Motorlicker""; soul pianos and fluttering synths that make ""Six Royal Vipers"" sound like the <i>Tron</i> version of Willie Mitchell's Hi Records sound-- and the ghosts of prog rock, g-funk and new wave past manifest into a recollection of how audacious those old sounds used to be in the first place. It doesn't take a lot to make old technology sound damaged and creepy. But taking the next step and making that creepiness sound appealing is what makes <i>Maniac Meat</i> the feel-weird hit of the summer.</p></div>"|14260.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14260-maniac-meat/|7.6|Nate Patrin

Greif-Neill (the sometimes-guitarist for Ariel Pink's Haunted Graffiti and one-third of the Samps) made a simple admission in an interview with Vice about his sample-based collective: ""I can tell you that we have no idea what we're doing."" On the surface, we could take him at his word. Here are three Californians taking time out from their other bands to put together a little EP, often via web, with no desire to play any of the material in a live setting. Often, this sort of homemade pleasure project can be a little too indulgent, and as long as the day job is working out, there's really little risk. But <i>The Samps</i> is a tight, wonderfully nuanced little outing where all that pleasure really shines through. Each experimental element here is firmly supported by genuine grooves and an ability to distill a variety of pop genres-- from cartoonish electronics to hammy disco boogie-- to their gratifying essences. And even if the result is sometimes unrefined, it's anything but uninformed.</p>
<p>For a debut that packs such a punch, it's a little surprising that it runs for all of about 15 minutes, including two schizoid interludes that work as intros to each side. But with the four tracks that remain-- complete with retrograded funk and R&amp;B, chintzy video game noises, and the occasional glam rock pose-- it feels as if the guys have hand-picked the highlights from some non-existent long player. Each of these tracks could be a standout single. So instead of faulting <i>The Samps</i> for being a too short, you could also look at it like the weeding has already been done for you.</p>
<p>Though these songs are accessible, there's still room for a little tinkering and some full-blown left turns into the strange. Take ""Hyperbolic"", which starts as a springy, robotic B-boy jam and pulls a U-turn right into a blippy lite-rave track. These head-turning shifts provide some insight into how these tracks were crafted. Sometimes this interplay obstructs the groove, as a perfectly hooky concoction is hijacked and reworked as a result of another member taking the reigns and reinterpreting the sounds and ideas. While this kind of collaborative process might not make for a terribly smooth listen, it surely creates a more dynamic-- and ultimately more engaging-- space for these tripped-out grooves to incubate in.</p></div>"|14262.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14262-the-samps-ep/|7.7|Zach Kelly

This time out, the job of recording falls to Matt Bayles, who brings to his duties here the same meticulous determination to give every sound its own space, the way he did on <i>Oceanic </i>and <i>Celestial</i> for the late, lamented Isis. The album sounds fantastic, filling up all the room it's given; even the crowd noise comes through with a bright clarity that matches the emotional resonance of Mono's work.</p>
<p>The music itself-- mostly drawn from last year's<i> Hymn to the Immortal Wind</i>-- very much follows the stream Mono have been navigating since their inception. As early as 2001, they were incorporating strings into their sound, and their previous two albums featured, respectively, a string quartet and a chamber orchestra, so working with a full-fledged, complete orchestral arrangement must have seemed like a natural progression. The arrangements, mostly done by Wordless Music Orchestra conductor Jeffrey Milarsky and Mono guitarist Takaakira Goto, are written to take full advantage of the new range of instruments at the group's disposal. The treatment of the songs never seems tacked on, and Mono never makes the mistake of wasting orchestral resources on tacky string stings and other cheap flourishes.</p>
<p>Yet while Mono avoid the pomposity that often goes along with orchestral collaborations, <i>Holy Ground</i> is most effective when the arrangements are written to take full advantage of both the depth of the orchestra and the power of the rock band they surround. The first two tracks illustrate how good the pairing can be, as does the electrifying treatment of ""Halcyon (Beautiful Days)""; all three maximize the potential of the concept by bringing Goto and Yoda's guitars and especially Yasunori Takada's increasingly underutilized drums to the fore and letting the orchestra support them. On other tracks, though, the cart is put so fully before the horse that it's difficult to distinguish what's happening from a manipulative film score. Mono have always been susceptible to overwrought emotion, but by bringing in so many instruments that are inextricably linked in our cultural receptors to specific feelings and moods, they risk becoming an unusually refined melancholy-moods outfit.</p>
<p><i>Holy Ground</i> is also an extremely intense listening experience; at its end, the listener is, by design, emotionally drained. It's hard to imagine listening to it more than once in anything like a casual way. It comes with a DVD of the original live performance which is much more effective, since it conveys the entire work with the singular experiential power it was intended to have. They may shed some listeners as they define themselves down to an ever-purer expression, but there's no question that Mono is doing exactly what they want to do at this point in their career.</p></div>"|14272.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14272-holy-ground-nyc-live-with-the-wordless-music-orchestra/|7.1|Leonard Pierce

But this prolific L.A. group actually sounds more free since transitioning from music that makes your skull hum to music you can hum along to. Last year's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13851-raiders/"">Raiders</a></i><i> </i>saw them reveling in the doom-metal that had always bubbled under the surface of their noise. Now they do the same on <i>Burners</i> with other sides of their sound-- namely, grooving krautrock, gothic sludge, and the psych-garage of the Stooges and Spacemen 3.</p>
<p>Which is not to say that the three pieces here sound unlike Robedoor. The backbone that anchored their previous drones-- a burrowing low-end rumble-- is still intact. At this point it's hard to imagine they could make an album without it. But at times in the past, Robedoor's massive vibrations could get overwhelming, even claustrophobic. The injection of propulsive drums and churning bass stretches the band into brighter territory, while also giving shape to their underlying roar. This development recalls the transformation that members of drone-mongers Double Leopards underwent when they formed the more groove-oriented Religious Knives. So when a tribal, Can-like rhythm burrows through the fuzz and howl of ""I Thought You Were the Devil"", what might have been a two-dimensional drone becomes a three-dimensional song.</p>
<p>That expansion comes partially from simple math. Until last year Robedoor were the duo of Britt and Alex Brown; <i>Burners </i>is their first album made completely as a trio with Ged Gengras. Gengras' talents, most of which manifest as lightning-strike drumming, would widen any group's sound. But a bigger factor than numbers is attitude. Where <i>Raiders </i>captured L.A.'s smoggy wonder, <i>Burners </i>looks farther outward to what Britt calls ""theme songs for dead desert borderlands"". That wide-angle lens is most apparent on ""Burning Man"", a 19-minute track taking up all of Side Two. Here, the trio opens with a sonic pan across a dusty landscape, almost falling asleep to the lumbering beat. But when Gengras detonates his cymbals like a bomb, the Browns launch into a Spacemen 3-style sway that constantly grows. It's another case of Robedoor finding freedom in structure, and another creative belt-notch for this expansive outfit.</p></div>"|14274.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14274-burners/|6.9|Marc Masters

<p><span style=""font-style: normal;""><i>CMYK</i> is only the third release from London electronic producer James Blake, who is only 21-- and the reason I keep saying ""only"" is because I get a little dumb thinking about how much ground he's covered in so few steps. His style is already recognizable: progressions of thick soul and jazz chords (a product of years of piano lessons), pitched-down and mangled vocals (often his own), and mid-tempo beats that balance synthesized sub-bass with handclaps, snaps, and other humanizing soundlets. But each of his releases-- last year's ""Air &amp; Lack Thereof"" / ""Sparing the Horses"" single, February's <i>The Bells Sketch</i> EP, and now, <i>CMYK</i> EP-- also sounds like its own project, filled with private rules and concepts. He's writing his theme and his variations at the same time.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-style: normal;"">Blake isn't peerless, exactly. He's got collaborators and associates. (Untold and Mount Kimbie-- two artists he's done remixes for-- come to mind.) But Blake's peers are better known for the boundaries they're breaking down than the ones they're reinforcing, which is to say that Blake-- who appears to have a brain full of uncategorizable ideas-- is in a good position to do whatever tickles him. (The BBC DJ Gilles Peterson had him as a guest on his show last week, where he talked about his plans for a vocal-and-piano EP, and how he'd just had his mind pried open by seeing Joanna Newsom live. From any other contemporary electronic producer, I'd be surprised.)</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-style: normal;""><i>CMYK</i> is built from samples primarily from 90s R&amp;B. Sometimes, they're incredibly obvious-- obvious like ""I hope James Blake doesn't end up with legal fees"" obvious. Other times, he crushes them beyond recognition. (We know from a Rising interview last month that Brandy is on there somewhere, and R. Kelly, too.)</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-style: normal;"">The title track draws on both Kelis' ""Caught Out There"" and Aaliyah's ""Are You That Somebody""-- songs that helped define the years they came out in by sounding two steps ahead of everything around them. This is canny for plenty of reasons, I think, but I'll be brief: Blake takes two R&amp;B archetypes-- the Spurned Woman and the Secret Lover-- and imagines them in a back and forth. It's modern homage to old ideas. But if you know the songs already, it's also an exercise in warming up your cultural memory-- both tracks are over 10 years old but under 15, a kind of dead zone for nostalgia, not yet retro-ready but no longer current. He's not reminding us of something we've forgotten or telling us about something we never knew about, he's reanimating songs that are probably just at the edge of peoples' thoughts. (It's also a statement of allegiances: though Blake-- as Harmonimix-- has worked with Lil' Wayne's voice, he doesn't seem to be as interested in current American hip-hop and R&amp;B as much as he is in picking up where Timbaland and the Neptunes left off at the end of the 1990s.)</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-style: normal;"">But what makes the track isn't its samples, its the way Blake integrates them. Everything on <i>CMYK</i> is remarkably balanced: throwback sounds (a soul singer) next to contemporary ones (filtered synthesizer sweeps); deeply processed sounds (a vocoder) next to clean ones; moments of dissonance and digital noise next to a consonant progression of organ chords. One minute it's naked, the next it's obscure. Blake's songs-- three- and four-minute long pieces of electronic pop-- have no real space or time. They're not dance tracks. They're deeply retro and slightly futuristic-- which is to say they're contemporary. They're made on a home computer, but sound like the work of an animatronic band.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-style: normal;"">I keep thinking of the Wong Kar-wai movie <i>2046</i>, ostensibly a love story with parallel narratives, one set in the 1950s, one set in 2046. The superficial surroundings of the past are different from the future, but at one point, two characters say the same exact thing: ""Leave with me."" The context, though, is different, and changing the context changes the meaning. And when the meaning is changed, communication breaks down. In both cases, the characters are somehow misunderstood, and the misunderstanding leads to heartbreak. James Blake plays in these gaps-- these modern gaps-- in ways that are both clever and sympathetic. ""Do androids dream of electric sheep?"" is an old question. Blake's trying to figure out how convincingly they sing gospel.</span></p></div>"|14229.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14229-cmyk-ep/|8.3|Mike Powell

In this case, please set aside the prejudices: Beach Fossils aren't merely trying to evoke the feeling of sand between your toes, and even if you think you've mentally checked out of anything summery and lo-fi, this is a wonderful record. Dustin Payseur's Captured Tracks band claims influence from improvisational jazz, classical music, and Stereolab, and his songwriting owes more to loop-based composition than garage-bound woodshedding. From the functionality of the song titles on down, <i>Beach Fossils </i>has purpose and economy. It's built on cleanly picked single notes stacked over complementary bass patterns and unobtrusive drums.</p>
<p>Despite working in generally constricted song patterns-- there's little in the way of verse/chorus structure-- Payseur has no problem letting his vocals and guitar craft hooks. In fact, it's the guitar riffs that you'll probably end up humming: check the pitch-shifted Peter Hook homage on ""Daydream"", the tight ""Youth"", or ""Sometimes"", on which Payseur falls just shy of soloing. Drift and atmosphere also work for Beach Fossils: the breezy coda of ""Window View"" feels like it could drift forever as long as it handed you a lemonade part of the way through.</p>
<p>The way Payseur's vocals are masked with reverb brings to mind the early singles of the Clientele, while the interlocking musicianship bears a lot of similarity to their tourmates in Real Estate. But while Payseur has an ingenuity with melody, what keeps him from reaching the heights of those acts is a lack of true immersion. The Clientele's Alasdair MacLean works in miniature, capturing evocative details that we otherwise miss in our daily lives; Real Estate's Martin Courtney is big-picture, using a generalized suburbia as a backdrop for larger philosophical points. In comparison, the mundanity of <i>Beach Fossils </i>can be deflating, and you don't catch much on the fifth listen that you didn't on the first-- a song called ""Vacation"" is about taking a bus out of town, while ""Golden Age"" and ""Daydream"" are nearly every bit as literal.</p>
<p>Yet the lack of guile can also be a strength, giving <i>Beach Fossils</i> a directness often attributed to more aggressive styles of music. Detractors might claim that this stuff isn't particularly challenging, but in light of its near-Memorial Day release date, doing so feels like criticizing white t-shirts or ice cream cones. This is an uncomplicated soundtrack for relief, which ""Lazy Day"" puts forth most pointedly.  It's something like the photo negative of Wavves' ""So Bored"", not just sonically but philosophically-- having fuck all to do isn't some sort of grounds for cracking up, but for kicking back and enjoying it.</p></div>"|14281.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14281-beach-fossils/|7.8|Ian Cohen

Sandwiched between those two is a more experimental but equally appealing set from British producer James Holden. Better known in the UK than in the U.S., Holden has his own imprint (Border Community) and has carved out a name with high-profile remixes for acts as varied as Madonna and New Order. His own tracks are progressive-minded, drawing from IDM, trance, and psychedelic music, but retain a distinct rhythmic quality.</p>
<p>For his DJ-Kicks mix, Holden mostly picks from outside club music for a set that draws heavily on experimental techno, kraut, and ambient sounds. In the disc's liner notes, he writes about being displeased with the current state of techno and wanting to provide an alternative with these tracks. And it is different: Holden chooses music that probably wouldn't fit in a regular DJ set (tracks by experimental acts like Lucky Dragons and Eric Copeland) but the mix hangs together remarkably well.</p>
<p>Largely it works because of Holden's production skill. He'll tweak the pitch or key of a track or blur one song into the next so that this disparate material feels unified. Legowelt's Italo-inspired electro sits comfortably next to Walls' ambient pop. And the mixing is such that you almost don't notice the transitions between songs. A stretch in the middle of the album illustrates it well: It opens with Holden's tech-y remix of Mogwai's ""The Sun Smells Too Loud"", spills into a loose Steve Reid/Kieran Hebden jam, and then finally into ""Punkte"" by Ursula Bogner, sort of a squelching minimal-ambient piece. Heard apart, these songs are wildly dissimilar, but Holden finds a rhythmic balance and makes them sound natural together.</p>
<p>Part of the appeal here is simply song choice; these are good, obscure picks that represent an interesting slice of leftfield dance and indie music. But it's also pacing: Holden's got a knack for long, deliberate builds, and this record has a nice fluidity to it. There are beats, but generally the propulsion is more organic-- ultimately the mix feels more like a krautrock record than something you'd hear in a club. But it is dance music. ""The dance you do lying in bed or driving your car or riding the bus is still a dance,"" Holden says in the liner notes. That's the key. Approach Holden's mix with an open mind, and you might reconsider what's danceable.</p></div>"|14283.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14283-dj-kicks/|7.7|Joe Colly

On third K album <i>Splash</i>, though, the real move is from Jay's usual Land of Nod to somewhere near what used to be called Alternative Nation. This is an elegant place, as Jay envisions it, full of yearning and wonder, but at times it can also come to resemble an empty stage set.</p>
<p><i>Splash</i> represents only the latest sonic evolution from one of the recent pop underground's more intriguing stylists. After sleepwalking through a cinematic cityscape soundtracked by buoyant 50s doowop and brittle 80s indie on 2008's <i>A Place Where We Could Go</i>, Jay added John Hughes synth romance and swaying winter-formal rhythms on last year's <i>Slow Dance</i>. With <i>Splash</i>, Jay's shift toward the sloppy guitars and meaty chord progressions from MTV's ""120 Minutes"" heyday is, at least on its surface, no less masterful. His voice remains adrift between the airiness of former tourmates Deerhunter's Bradford Cox and the hiccupy dramatics of Morrissey, while jangling or distorted guitar melodies bound forward with a new sense of purpose, occasionally replaced by piano or streaked with feedback. The drums gallop now, rather than canter; the rollicking title track is perhaps the most urgent song in Jay's small, confident catalog. ""Walking down the street at night with your headphones,"" he whispers at the end of tantalizingly brief ""Someday Somewhere"", seeming to describe the ideal listening conditions.</p>
<p>However, the increased directness of Jay's latest approach also exposes how thin some of his songwriting ideas can be, resulting-- at a scant 27 minutes-- in what is paradoxically this often-ethereal artist's least substantial album. Although billed as less aloof than previous releases, <i>Splash </i>doesn't really offer any easier way in than its predecessors. Jay still cuts quickly between his typical vivid images, here of street-lit cities, evening BMX rides, and pouncing jaguars, but this time he's no longer in a world all his own, and the artists who've been here before left more memorable impressions. ""I was there wishing on a star/ Knowing it probably won't go very far,"" Jay sings on the draggy ""A Sliver of a Chance"", for example. With a repetitive, note-bending guitar line that distinctly recalls Modest Mouse, finale ""Why Is This Feeling So Strong?"" opens up the most-- ""It can't ever happen, can it?""-- but it's still basically more of the same, unlikely to win over many new converts. Jay sings at one point of an ""elusive angel,"" and one hopes his next plunge is toward something just as angelic, only less elusive. With <i>Splash</i>, the water's fine; it's merely the flesh that's weak.</p></div>"|14214.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14214-splash/|6.3|Marc Hogan

One Pains of Being Pure at Heart later-- the Slumberland sensation that features Guild frontman Kurt Feldman on drums, and utilizes Guild guitarist Christoph Hochheim on tour-- and the band that was around before POBPAH even formed is now better known for their membership in that group.  The surprising success of the Guild's day job isn't the only thing that's changed between then and now.  For one, the Guild is now a trio, with Christoph's twin brother Anton joining on drums.  Also, instead of going the self-production route (as they did with <i>Jaws</i>), the new album was recorded with Telefon Tel Aviv's Joshua Eustis.  While these changes are the most apparent, they're not the only things that separate the Guild's debut and <i>Spirit Youth</i>.</p>
<p>It takes only a listen to the two released versions of <i>Youth</i> track ""Dream About Me"" to see what's different.  The song was first released as a single in July 2009, a month before Kanine Records issued a remastered version of <i>Jaws</i>.  That version of the song is in line with the sound of the Guild's debut.  Right from the start of the track, the crunch and hiss of the 8-bit additions are put front and center, while the drum machine backing gives the track a stiff, brittle edge that undercuts its melodic ease.  It's a wholly enjoyable pop tune, but the sound at times overwhelms the actual song.  That's not the case with the version of the track available on <i>Spirit Youth</i>.  Hochheim's less-exacting ""real"" drumming softens the song's blows, and Eustis (as he does throughout the album) ably integrates the one-up aspects of the tune-- they're not excised from the song, but the bloops and bleeps are focused on only for brief moments, and instead are interwoven into the background. Instead of being treated like the featured attraction, those sounds are just part of an ensemble that doles out its spotlight time wisely and sparingly.</p>
<p>That said, it's in the songwriting department where the true growth in <i>Spirit Youth</i> is realized.  Feldman and friends still wear their hearts on their sleeves in that passive-aggressive emotive fashion, but they've found better ways to accessorize.  They haven't done away with the polychromatic sheets of guitar strumming by any stretch; I'm partial to the Lush tones of ""My Chariot"", as well as the Sugar (as in Bob Mould) rush provided by ""Through the Snow"". It's just that these tried and true moves are attached to a stronger and more varied collection of songs that balance mid-tempo ballads (like epic album closer ""White Moth"") with three-minute pop thrills.  By downplaying the elements that made the Depreciation Guild initially stand out from the crowd, <i>Spirit Youth</i> is a decidedly less distinctive album than their debut.  However, by making that choice, they've made what turns out to be their best.</p></div>"|14282.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14282-spirit-youth/|7.6|David Raposa

In that time, he's managed to avoid being lumped in with other soul revivalists thanks in no small part to his template-- a combination of simple, authentic-sounding R&amp;B songcraft peppered with a digital production ethic. So far, it's been an effective act, but as with any predicated partly on the past, it's hard not to feel like it might have a shelf life. <i>Compass</i> marks Lidell's third record since that re-invention, and finds him jettisoning the Stax-inspired framework that he so confidently established on 2005's <i>Multiply</i> in favor of a mish-mash of different ideas and sounds, some of which could reasonably be classed as R&amp;B, and some not.</p>
<p>Make no mistake, though, <i>Compass</i> isn't another sweeping re-invention of Lidell's sound, nor is it even really a particularly cohesive collection of songs. It is, instead, a messy and manic record, one that's more concerned with the moment than with any overarching aesthetic or tone. It sounds, basically, like the work an artist in transition. It should come as no surprise that Lidell apparently wrote all 14 of these tracks in under a month; <i>Compass</i> has all the good and bad hallmarks of such a speedy birthing process.</p>
<p>Recorded in Los Angeles, New York, and Canada, <i>Compass</i> features guest performances from Gonzales, Feist, Nikka Costa, Wilco's Pat Sansone, Chris Taylor of Grizzly Bear, session drummer James Gadson, and another artist who knows a thing or two about flirting with pastiche-- Beck. While the spirit of Mr. Hansen's collaborative free-for-all Record Club sessions looms heavily over the equally loose <i>Compass</i>, it's Gadson whose presence is most felt; that <i>Compass</i> is Lidell's bangingest record is almost enough to atone for the fact that it's also his patchiest.</p>
<p>What's most telling and perhaps encouraging is just how many of its highlights fall outside of Lidell's original template. Built out of a suitably naked a cappella and a booming low end section, opener ""Completely Exposed"" has almost no mid-range instrumentation, but ranks as one of the most vital things he's ever recorded. Elsewhere, ""Your Sweet Boom"" is nearly as bottom-heavy and culminates with a burst of vocals; ""She Needs Me"" rolls along on a slippery, MOR-flavored groove that's more early-80s than mid-60s; the gorgeous ""Compass"" boasts classical guitars and a dusky, Latin backbeat; closer ""You See My Light"" is so light and gently delivered that it feels barely there at all.</p>
<p>As for <i>Compass'</i> misfires, well, there's a few, but it almost feels academic to dwell too much on them. This is a transitional record, an in-betweener, one that Lidell may eventually look back on as a door to something else. The good news for all of us is that even when he's down, he's not out.</p></div>"|14273.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14273-compass/|6.6|Mark Pytlik

That's it. Just Africa. We don't learn where in Africa he moves, or what he does when he gets there. We just hear ""Africa,"" like the entire continent is some gigantic symbol for rebirth and redemption. It's meant to be a triumphant ending, but it's frustratingly out-of-reach, missing the specificity that could've made it satisfying. There's something of that same nagging well-intentioned vagueness to Nas' latest venture, as well.</p>
<p>Nas is in a tough spot right now, coming off of a couple of half-successful, attention-grabbing concept albums and a costly, spiteful public divorce. So it makes sense for him to link up with the scion of one of the most universally beloved figures in all of music, making a back-to-basics move that pushes him away from rap and tabloid politics. Nas and Damian Marley are both sons of celebrated musical figures, so god knows they probably have plenty to talk about. Five years ago, Nas guested on Marley's ""Road to Zion"" and sounded great doing it. Onstage together at SXSW, they had a lively chemistry, Marley chatting madly over the ""N.Y. State of Mind"" beat and Nas giddily playing hypeman on ""Welcome to Jamrock"". And first single and album opener ""As We Enter"" promises great things, Nas and Marley furiously trading off tag-team punchlines over a track that perfectly splits the difference between dusty NY boom-bap and warm post-dancehall reggae.</p>
<p>But too often on <i>Distant Relatives</i>, Nas and Marley fall into a sort of middlebrow funk, kicking overripe platitudes over sunny session-musician lopes and letting their self-importance suffocate their personalities. Marley's never done his best work shooting for inspirational. On his best tracks, he brings less of his father's wizened optimism and more of the gravelly, demonic snarl of dancehall-schooled avengers like Sizzla or Capleton. Nas, meanwhile, is best at tense, tactile details: The feeling of gunpowder burning your nostril hair, the dank smell of piss in the project elevator. In trying to make what basically amounts to a modern-day Bob Marley album, they've both pushed themselves away from their strengths.</p>
<p>Nas strays into either the too-general (""I reach 'em like Bono/ So get rid of your self-sorrow"") or puzzling paranoia (""If satellites is causing earthquakes, will we survive it?""). The production, mostly from Marley and brother Stephen, tends too often toward stifled, Grammy-bait guitar solos and tinkling, expensive R&amp;B sheen. The track ""My Generation"" is all the album's worst impulses put on display, a sickly attempt at gospel with Joss Stone yowling all over the chorus and a truly dogshit Lil Wayne guest verse-- all in service of fuzzy, feel-good preachiness. On tracks like this one, the dorm-room philosophizing gets a little thick.</p>
<p>But even with all that, the album is still a true collaborative affair, two deeply talented guys with amazing, evocative voices finding common ground and exploring it. So when it does work, it's serious. ""Nah Mean"" puts a nasty mid-90s NY rap beat in service of some ferocious snarling from both principals. ""Land of Promise"" is devastating old-school dancehall toughness, not far removed from Marley's own ""Welcome to Jamrock"", with Nas finding new cadences for his dusky monotone. ""As We Enter"" and ""Patience"" respectively sample Mulatu Astatke and Amadou and Mariam, both to great effect. When these guys stop trying to be positive and just <i>vent</i>, they do great things. Nas sounds most like himself in the last minute of ""Strong Will Continue"". The song is mostly pretty bland, five minutes of sloganeering before Nas suddenly turns ugly, wondering if his ex-wife cheated on him, bringing up Bruce Lee's family curse, raging at nobody in particular, then breaking everything off with haughty style: ""See a nigga disappearing with the baddest honeys in the whole spot, yeeah."" With all the heavy-handed philosophizing all around it, it's pretty thrilling to hear Nas suddenly going all ""Oochie Wally"" on us, if only for a second. But then the song ends, and it's back to the preaching.</p></div>"|14265.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14265-distant-relatives/|6.1|Tom Breihan

Sure, Vampire Weekend may catch message-board flak over the socio-economic disparities between their privileged upbringings and the impoverished African musicians who've inspired them, but they've never been labeled a minstrel act or, worse, racist-- tags that dogged Spencer and his band, the Blues Explosion, through their mid-1990s heyday. Really, Spencer adopted black musical tropes and affectations-- be it the hysterical hoots and hollers of Little Richard or the self-referential shout-outs of Flavor Flav-- no more flagrantly than Elvis or Mick Jagger or Captain Beefheart before him. But amid the time's otherwise sexless indie-rock culture, Spencer's speed-freak lover-man act made him a godsend to some and an easy target to others.</p>
<p>Compared to the recently released compilation<i> Dirty Shirt Rock 'n' Roll</i>-- which emphasized the more accessible, funkier tracks in the JSBX discography-- these two reissues plant us firmly back in the eye of the storm circa 1996, the year the New York trio's notoriety was at an all-time high. From its nervous title on down to its queasy, claustrophobic production, the band's fourth album, <i>Now I Got Worry</i>, sees the Blues Explosion aggressively reacting to both critical attacks and increased commercial expectations. Not only was it the follow-up to 1994's underground breakthrough <i>Orange</i>, it was also the first JSBX release to benefit from the wider distribution afforded by Matador's (short-lived) partnership with Capitol Records. But the closest thing to a sell-out move here was getting ""Weird"" Al  Yankovic to direct the video for lead single ""Wail""; <i>Now I Got Worry </i>begins with a tortured scream (on the opening declaration of ostracization ""Skunk"") and ends face down in the dub sewage of ""Sticky"", with hardcore blitzkriegs (""Identify"") and profane Dub Narcotic covers (""Fuck Shit Up"") in between.</p>
<p>But what's most remarkable about <i>Now I Got Worry </i>is that the Blues Explosion's grimiest record was also their most sonically ambitious. Recorded in the wake of the band's 1996 collaboration with R.L. Burnside (<i>A Ass Pocket of Whiskey</i>), <i>Now I Got Worry </i>sees the trio adapting to the bluesman's brand of hypnotic, in-the-pocket electric blues, but filtering it through the cut-and-paste funk aesthetic favored by contemporaries like Beck, the Beastie Boys, and Cibo Matto. Spencer, of course, had been flirting with hip-hop since his Pussy Galore days, but here the abrupt breakbeat edits and dubby textures feel less like tentative dabbles and more like strategic devices used to better convey the songs' anxious energy. In that sense, the Blues Explosion became a more pure blues band the more artfully they reconstructed that idea. (The 12 outtakes included here-- not including the four bonus radio-promo ads-- reveal the extent of experimentation the band underwent to achieve <i>Worry</i>'s near-perfect blues/beats /punk/dub synthesis, from the chilled-out slide-guitar groove of ""Cool Vee"" to the brown-note funk of ""Buscemi"" to the kamikaze garage-rock of ""Dig My Shit"".)</p>
<p>If <i>Now I Got Worry</i> is an expression of the Blues Explosion's agony, then the flagrantly titled<i> Controversial Negro</i> captures the ecstasy, showcasing them in the one environment where they never had to worry about anything: on stage. The album, recorded at Tucson's Hotel Congress shortly after <i>Worry</i>'s release, was first released officially in Japan and as a limited-edition promo item in the U.S. Not only does this reissue finally grant easy access to a thrilling, peak-era performance from one of best live bands of its time, it tacks on the show's previously unreleased six-song encore plus another nine songs from a '94-era gig at Tucson's DPC.</p>
<p>Barring the fadeout between sets, you'd be hard-pressed to tell you were hearing two different shows: for all the evolutionary strides the band had made in the studio between 1994-96, the Blues Explosion remained a raw and relentless force onstage. In this context, the <i>Worry</i> track ""Can't Stop"" is less a hot-headed boast of sexual stamina than a literal description of the band's ability to charge through an hour-long show with nary a pause, abruptly shifting into or rearranging songs on the fly like they were making a mix tape of themselves in real time. Even when Spencer gets a moment to catch his breath on the extended breakdown of ""Blues X Man"", he takes the opportunity to reiterate what his band is all about-- ""I'm talking about fucking! Eating pussy! Makin' love! Sucking cock!""-- while the breathless encore run from ""Bellbottoms"" through to ""Full Grown"" brings all that dirty talk to a delirious climax. Guitarist Judah Bauer once said that the Blues Explosion expend more energy in a single show than most people do in a 40-hour work week; on<i> Controversial Negro</i>, they log more than enough overtime to start collecting their 401ks 30 years early.</p>
<p>The Blues Explosion were never really the same after their 1996 tear-- 1998's <i>Acme</i> delved deeper into beat science at the expense of ferocity, while 2002's <i>Plastic Fang</i> went too far the other way, presenting the Blues Explosion as a conventional, Stonesy rock'n'roll outfit that paled next to new schoolers like the White Stripes and the Hives. And in today's indie-rock landscape of blissed-out Animal Collectivists and downcast Nationals, the Blues Explosion are arguably more out of time and place than they were back in the mid-90s. But where the value of reissues is generally gauged by how well the old recordings fit into the current musical climate, the fact that <i>Now I Got Worry </i>and<i> Controversial Negro</i> still sound like little else out there now only makes them feel all the more necessary.</p></div>"|14235.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14235-now-i-got-worry-controversial-negro/|8.5|Stuart Berman

Fans sniff out gems, report on hot streaks, <i>predict </i>hot streaks.  Just like anything based on speculating, things can change quickly; there are market forces at work.  More so than most of her peers, Ellen Allien is in control of her own stock.

One song sounds like the xx, another like Goldfrapp. During ""Sun the Rain"", the xx soundalike, Allien sings, ""Some days life feels so easy,"" which is perfect: Allien's statuses as scene leader and lifetime artist seem assured, and <i>Dust</i> sounds like a fun, comfortable reflection of that.</p>
<p>An inveterate collaborator, Allien worked with German producer Tobias Freund on <i>Dust</i>.  A shapeshifter himself, Freund helps Allien navigate the album's veering styles.  Allien is a rich sound designer, embedding earworms into deceptively simple productions.  ""You"" is a straightforward bass-and-guitars affair until its bridge opens up, briefly, to teardrop synths.  ""Should We Go Home"", the album's longest and loosest track, emerges from a long beatless passage with a burrowing two-note patch. Allien gets into trouble only when she slips into old habits.  She overplays her hand a bit on ""Flashy Flashy"", repeating, mantra-like, ""Flashy flashy flashy flashy disco lights"" in a husky whisper.  We get it: dance music can be facile and image-conscious and still fun.  Her insistence on adding her treated voice to nearly every track kills the momentum of those that don't need it.</p>
<p>Allien's earned the right to experiment, but more importantly, she's earned patience. If you can't cotton to ""Huibuh""'s gentle playfulness or ""Sun the Rain""'s guitar pop, you might be missing the point of an artist like Allien. <i> Dust</i> isn't necessarily brave-- Allien has approached territory like this before-- but it's definitely a departure, with just one track, ""Ever"", offering clubby beatmaking.  Techno fans already love Allien's old work. <i> Dust</i> offers new challenges: to enjoy her stumbles, to trust her instincts.</p></div>"|14244.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14244-dust/|7.1|Andrew Gaerig

The spacious production Amm has been working with lately has only been glimpsed on compilations and 2008's double CD retrospective <i>Demonstration Tape</i>. With his latest, the backward-glancing, bare-bones vocoder-and-synth sound tracks like 2004's ""Remote Control"" are largely gone. In their place are more structured and ornate synth-pop tracks, as well as some dips into house.</p>
<p>There are traces of Amm's nostalgic analog sound in the album's intro, outro, and shorter tracks like ""Life-Size Image"". And while the sweet, chattering analog patterns he's known for remain, he pulls in new textures-- claps, pops, hisses, purrs-- to give the material more complexity. There are also frightening surprises like ""Take Me Home"", which begins with a bit-crushed beat and blips of tinselly percussion that phase in and out, creating the atmosphere of a creepy underground tunnel. Amm then emerges from the shadows in a Darth Vader voice to ""sing"" a couple of verses of a come-on (""Take me home today/ I'm in disarray/ Promise that you'll try/ Take me home tonight"").</p>
<p>Amm excels when his breezy synth patterns find that sweet spot between suggestion and declaration, and what turns a soundscape into a song is Amm's skill at building drama and momentum without overdoing it. On ""Loss for Words"" he does it with vocoder-free vocals and a blanket of strings underscored by a bass line. On the excellent ""A Product of the Process"", he does it by starting with battlefield-inspired effects-- a marching beat and gunshot-like percussion-- then adding an ascending bass pattern and turning up the volume. As adorable as Solvent's instrumentation can be, the project seems to have lost some its timidity on this album.</p>
<p>Some of his experiments go too far. ""Formulate"" and ""No One Should Be Living Here"" feel out of place, featuring harsh, bleeping synths and dizzying, aquatic beats fit for Rex the Dog's catalog. The vocoder makes an appearance on both, and in truth, most of the vocals on the album feel unnecessary. But Solvent's synths, as usual, speak volumes.</p></div>"|14239.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14239-subject-to-shift/|7.0|Liz Colville

It's a 70-minute, 18-track epic  comprising two suites, each beginning with an overture, telling a futuristic story starring a messianic android. It's not even the beginning of the saga-- the  first sequence was her debut EP, <i>Metropolis: The Chase  Suite</i>. The songs zip gleefully from genre to genre, mostly grounded in  R&amp;B and funk, but spinning out into rap, pastoral British folk, psychedelic rock,  disco, cabaret, cinematic scores, and whatever else strikes her fancy.  It's about as bold as mainstream music gets, marrying the world-building  possibilities of the concept album to the big tent genre-mutating pop  of Michael Jackson and Prince in their prime. Monáe describes <i>The  ArchAndroid</i> as an ""emotion picture,"" an album with a story arc intended  to be experienced in one sitting, like a movie. It most certainly works  in this way, but at first blush, it's almost too much to take in all at  once. The first listen is mostly about being wowed by the very existence  of this fabulously talented young singer and her over-the-top record;  every subsequent spin reveals the depths of her achievement.</p>
<p>The  most impressive thing about <i>The ArchAndroid</i> isn't that  it bounces between genres, but that it does so without compromising  quality or cohesion. Its most recent antecedent is André 3000's <i>The Love  Below</i>, but Monáe and her songwriting partners skillfully avoid that  album's overreach and missteps, showing a similar level of fearless  creativity but with greater focus and discipline. Despite the  style-hopping, the album is sequenced so that many of the songs flow  together seamlessly, and the shifts in tone seem intuitive rather than  jarring. Monáe's dramatic structure goes a long way toward keeping this  from being an incoherent pile-up of affectations, providing a narrative  through line that makes sense of the transitions, and implies momentum  and resolution even if you're tuning out the lyrics.</p>
<p>The success  of the album is also due to Monáe's raw talent as a  vocalist. She inhabits each style with natural grace, nailing the  subtleties of rapped verses and tight harmonies as well as she can belt  out a climax or deliver a punky growl. Much like fellow sci-fi magpie  David Bowie, Monáe sings with the confidence of a star, but is  essentially a vocal chameleon who places the needs of her songs ahead of  her ego. Her performances can be jaw-dropping-- check out the  transition from gentle folk phrasing to showstopping vocal runs on ""Oh,  Maker"" for one example-- but she never gets in the way of her songs,  which rely as much on her star power as the remarkable versatility of  her band.</p>
<p><i>The ArchAndroid</i> is deliberately conceived as a  world unto itself, but Monáe very carefully places herself in a broader  cultural context, as much out of ambition as wide-eyed fandom. Her liner  notes list off inspirations for each track, ranging from references to  <i>Star Wars</i> and Stevie Wonder album art to Salvador Dali and ""the atomic  bombs in Muhammad Ali's fists."" She comes off like an enthusiastic  student of the arts, eager to create on the level of her top-shelf  reference points. Her naked desire to become iconic is endearing-- mainly because she is actually effective in presenting a look and a  sound that is unmistakably her own, even when her influences are front  and center. Everything that goes into her music comes out skewed, and even  the most familiar elements of classic R&amp;B-- percussive horn stabs,  scratchy rhythm guitar-- suddenly seem fresh and modern rather than  nostalgic and reverent. Her choice of outside collaborators has  a similar effect in creating a context for herself, establishing  kinship and aesthetic continuity with the unapologetically bohemian poet  Saul Williams, the forward-thinking hip-hop of Big Boi from OutKast,  and Of Montreal's flamboyant psychedelic funk.</p>
<p>Monáe's  sci-fi mythology is an inspired addition to the rich canon of  Afrofuturist art, but it's not necessary to buy into her elaborate high  concepts to get the basic appeal of her music. Her imagination and  iconography deepen the record as an experience and give her license to  go far out, but it ultimately serves as a fun, flashy framework for pop songs with universal lyrical sentiments. The first  of the two suites mainly deals with identity and self-realization; the  second is essentially a set of love songs. As with all  the musical genres blended into <i>The ArchAndroid</i>, Monáe uses the  conventions of science fiction as a means of communication, tapping into  mythic archetypes for their immediate resonance and power. And where many  concept albums run a high risk of being pompous, cryptic, and  self-important, Monáe keeps things playful, lively, and accessible. It's  a delicate balancing act, but Monáe and her band pull it  off, resulting in an eccentric breakthrough that transcends its novelty.</p></div>"|14271.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14271-the-archandroid/|8.5|Matthew Perpetua

Front and center, between tick-tocking guitars, frontman Yannis Philippakis begins to <i>sing</i>. When Foals' debut, <i>Antidotes</i>, sent the UK press into hyperbolic fits three years ago, Philippakis boasted what Pitchfork's Tom Ewing perfectly described as a ""blank bark""-- one faceless particle amidst many mathematically arranged dance-punk elements. Philippakis was often indecipherable in a way that encapsulated those problems Foals' music suffered from as a whole: Their songs were fussy, calculating, and impenetrable, despite a ton of hooks. They could knock you down and they could make you glitch out, but finding an emotional connection was a challenge. In <i>Total Life Forever</i>, the Oxford quintet have not only opened up themselves and their sound, they've done so without abandoning the path that put them on the tips of tongues from the beginning.</p>
<p>They started by turning their songs inside out. Each of <i>Antidotes</i>' tracks was vacuum-sealed and tightly-packed, little space to be enjoyed between every pinballing polyrhythm and guitar figure. Though Foals were wise to add layers of horns and other muscles to the mix, it was difficult to feel as though there was any place to hang out within the song as a listener. At every turn,<i> Total Life Forever</i> is inviting. Much more alive than earlier efforts, it's an album with a complexion that constantly changes with time. When Philippakis' voice is first introduced in ""Blue Blood"", it's done with cavernous levels of reverb, his thin, delicate falsetto distant and sweet enough to recall My Morning Jacket's Jim James. The rest of the band quickly begin to do its thing with fewer rules: There's a much looser, much funkier feeling at work here, the poppy skronk of ""Miami"" or Chili Peppered licks of the titular track two early examples at work.</p>
<p>The album's second half doesn't fare so well, drowning at times in aqueous atmospherics. Single ""This Orient"" begins with some fizzy vocal textures and snare cracks only to morph into leftover Bloc Party. ""Alabaster"" doesn't boast any of the energy one could find in ""After Glow"" and closer ""What Remains"", both of which make devastating use of their song structures. But those missteps sound simply like growing pains. Without doubt, the record's finest moment is sprawling early blog hit ""Spanish Sahara"". Foals' music has frequently felt monumental in scope, often at the expense of the listener. But the way this one song in particular blooms, from its first traces of guitar melody to tear-jerking coda six minutes later, garners more goosebumps with every listen. It sounds exactly like what they set out to accomplish, done fluidly and organically. And in there, from the first few seconds to the very last, is a clear pulse. It's not difficult to find.</p></div>"|14269.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14269-total-life-forever/|7.6|David Bevan

Both 2007's <i>MADE</i> and 2008's <i>Emeritus</i> were almost alarmingly bleak-- mournful, embittered dispatches from a self-imposed exile-- and spending time in them was rewarding and exhausting in equal measure. Each was also branded Scarface's Retirement Record, but these weren't glitzy Hov-style send-offs; they were ""alone in a motel with a bottle of Jack and a gun"" sorts of situations.</p>
<p>It's a relief, then, to hear him rapping again with <i>Dopeman Music</i>, and it's even more gratifying to find him limber and energized. Scarface is calling <i>Dopeman Music</i> a mixtape, a run-up to his forthcoming studio album, tentatively titled <i>Under Oath</i>, and maybe because of the lowered profile, he seems looser and more engaged with the world. The beats are hard-hitting pieces of blaxploitation soul, and Scarface barrels his big-shouldered way through them with vigor. Outside of two unknown Face Mob compatriots-- B. James and Monk Kaza, who keep pace with their mentor impressively-- there are no guest rappers. But there is a palpable sense of the light being let in; Scarface calls out fellow Houston vets Z-Ro and K-Rino, yes, but also finds time to namecheck Ludacris. T.I., Wayne, and Kanye West (turns out that Scarface is an <i>808s &amp; Heartbreaks</i> fan). Hell, there are even a few skits here-- and they're sort of funny!</p>
<p>""Re-engaged,"" of course, doesn't equal ""light-hearted."" As ever, Scarface deals in weighty stuff: pain, loneliness, remorse, injustice. Always a bracingly economical writer, he freeze-frames systemic racism with just five words on ""The N Word"": ""White judge, black court reporter."" He's thoroughly unconvinced anything in this regard has changed: ""Bottom line is, I'm a black man, so my S-K-I-N/ Is my S-I-N,"" he raps wearily on ""The Ghetto Report"". Scarface has never been much a ladies' man; one of the few songs addressing women on <i>MADE</i> was bluntly called ""Go"", and here, ""Get Lost"" offers basically the same sentiment. He can sometimes sound crushed under the weight of his misanthropy, but here he comes off as oddly sanguine. ""Yeah, I made a little money, but it's gone now,"" he sighs on ""Lyrical Assault"", not sounding particularly perturbed. He throws some good vibes to his former bandmates Willie D and Bushwick Bill later on the same song: ""A Geto Boy till the end, got the plaques to prove it/ Out the group, but I still blast the music.""</p>
<p>Even his death threats, which are usually blood-freezingly direct, are more playful than usual: ""You'll burn in your Isuzu/ Pussy, you boo-boo/ Now boo-hoo and beg for mercy/ Start prayin, cuz if it's Heaven tell the Lord them boys dirty,"" he taunts on ""Wanted"". <i>Dopeman Music</i> is definitely a modest affair, slighter and more straightforward than Face's albums. But he sounds unmistakably rejuvenated, and if it took a one-off mixtape to reconnect Scarface to his love of making music, than maybe he should make more mixtapes.</p></div>"|14268.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14268-dopeman-music/|7.7|Jayson Greene

Fucked Up frontman Damian Abraham once told me that Trash Talk has ""the most violent pits I've ever seen"", then told me a story about watching two 14-year-old girls punching each other in the face while the Sacramento hardcore band was playing. Frontman Lee Spielman manages to project an air of livewire danger and omnidirectional contempt even between songs, something rare even to hardcore frontmen. The band plays its brand of fast, borderline amelodic hardcore without frills or clean edges; there's no hint of, say Converge's technical precision, or Iron Age's old-school thrash melodic sense. The band just bashes out its rage-fit growls extremely quickly, without regard for subtleties like hooks or song structure.</p>
<p>For a band like this, the show is the thing, and records are more like souvenirs, or previews. But <i>Eyes &amp; Nines</i> actually does a good job capturing the instability of the band's live set. For one thing, it's not even 18 minutes long, even factoring the relatively epic 4:30 doom metal excursion ""Hash Wednesday"" into the equation. For another, it's deliberately messy. The guitars raggedly bleed into each other, and every lyric is delivered in the same wracked, high-pitched scream, whether it's Spielman or one of the other guys singing. Without a lyric sheet, you're only going to pick out the odd word or phrase (""sadistic psycho,"" ""no one can save you now""). On a few songs, the band slows things down toward the end for riff-heavy mosh-part breakdowns, and when those come in, you can practically see the fists whipping around.</p>
<p><i>Eyes &amp; Nines</i> doesn't quite sound like it was recorded at a basement show somewhere; the fidelity's a little higher than that. But the recording is kept purposefully raw, and the immediacy is there. ""Hash Wednesday"" is the type of thing that should just <i>destroy</i> live; after all the hyperspeed riffage of the songs that came before, it's slow and full of empty space. The drums don't even kick in for more than a minute, which is longer than a lot of Trash Talk songs last, and the whole exercise gives the band a chance to sound straight-up <i>evil</i> rather than just grimy and pissed off. And though you can probably listen to the album more than once on your morning commute, it still works as a full-immersion experience, its sludgy roar hitting hard on a visceral gut-level.</p>
<p>The album never pushes hardcore in any unexpected directions; that's not what it's there for. Really, <i>Eyes &amp; Nines</i> could've come out at any point in at least the past 15 years, so if you're looking for innovation, look elsewhere. But for those of us who had formative, life-changing experiences screaming in our friends' faces in wood-paneled basements or tiled VFW Halls while bands like bands like Pageninetynine or Milhouse played, it's a real treat to hear that a band like that is still around, still perfectly conveying absolute fury. If you're in the right mood, <i>Eyes &amp; Nines</i> could turn out to be exactly what you need.</p></div>"|14102.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14102-eyes-nines/|7.8|Tom Breihan

Where once the sets showed the French label's strong ear for emerging sounds and knack for finding connections between different strands of electronic pop, they now seem to be playing catch-up. The best tracks on last year's eighth installment-- the Drums' ""Let's Go Surfing"", Memory Tapes' ""Bicycle""-- had already crossed the threshold of high-level attention long before getting tracklisted. But at least the inclusion of those tracks felt borne of genuine appreciation. The latest Kitsuné comp, on the other hand, kicks off with Washed Out's <i>High Times</i> highlight ""Belong"", which in this context comes over as a cynical, trend-riding move.</p>
<p>""Belong""'s inclusion seems even more fish-out-of-water once you've slogged through the 77-minute parade of second-rate blog-house acts featured here. The worst cuts are almost mesmerizingly awful pastiche, like the bleating emo-pop of Gamble &amp; Burke's ""Let's Go Together"" or the bizarre astro-kraut of Yuksek's ""Supermenz (We're Not)"", which spirals into endless monotony. Worst of all is the Zebra + Snake Remix of the Good Natured's ""Your Body Is a Machine"", which comes off as a poorly thought-out cross between post-Lily Allen confessional pop and the xx's clever minimalism.</p>
<p>There are some decent tracks. Both Gypsy and the Cat's ""Time to Wander (Joan of Arc Remix)"" and the Twelves' redo of Kitsuné regulars Two Door Cinema Club's ""Something Good Can Work"" could work well mixed into a good DJ set. Elsewhere, Jamaica's ""Short and Entertaining"" snaps like a solid Phoenix A-side, and there are good ideas buried in other tracks that hint at something more. The deeply psychedelic drops of Crookers' collaboration with French pop band Yelle, ""Cooler Couleur"", for instance, go nearly unnoticed due to the overly grating chorus, while Penguin Prison's ""Animal Animal"" would get a thumbs-up if it weren't for college-ska-band lyrics like, ""I wish Mike Tyson was my friend/ Then I would tell him everything.""</p>
<p>In a sense, this uneven and filler-stuffed set is an accurate reflection of Internet musical culture. If these 18 selections were spread out over several weeks of postings on a second-rate dance blog, we'd grab the good material and accept the mediocre-to-awful tracks as part of the deal. Grouped together like this, the set winds up seeming like tastemaking with no sense of taste.</p></div>"|14252.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14252-kitsune-maison-9/|4.6|Larry Fitzmaurice

Despite dozens of hits, putting together a cohesive album often seemed to be beyond the Stones, tripped up by either manager Allen Klein's publishing-rights parasitism or the band's 1970s hubris. That leaves a catalog in which only <i>Exile</i> is built not on hits but on vibe and: the album's singularly sleazy sound and making-of legend.</p>
<p>To create <i>Exile</i>, the band escaped Britain as tax exiles, decamping to a French villa. Paradoxically, the posh surroundings created the band's rawest effort. They were a heroin-ragged band, jamming late into the night with calloused fingers and vocal cords in a stale basement with sweaty walls. So the best thing a remastered reissue of the record can do is not give the production a bath, a shave, and a haircut. Happily, this new cleanup job doesn't Photoshop out the flaws and flubs, with the band's loose performances still presented in all its debauched glory.</p>
<p>Of course, like most treasured nuggets of rock history, that story is undermined by pesky facts. In <i>Stones in Exile</i>, the documentary released with this 38th anniversary reissue, producer Jimmy Miller talks about isolating each band member in a different room of the villa to make the impromptu studio work. That's a fitting image for the Rolling Stones at the time-- while the band was musically at its peak, it was in practice at its most fractured, with singer Mick Jagger and bassist Bill Wyman barely involved for the bulk of the recording. The <i>Exile</i> we know and love is actually the hybrid product of two sessions, two bands really: the Keith Richards-led material from Nellcôte shotgun-wed to the Los Angeles gospel dabbling of Jagger and co-conspirator, keyboardist and former Beatles collaborator Billy Preston.</p>
<p>In a way though, Jagger's lack of involvement may have been the key to <i>Exile</i>'s success (and probably explains his oft-voiced dislike of the record). With Richards at the helm, the record sounds closest to the American roots music the band relentlessly name-dropped. Vocally, Richards' nasal whine fights for space with Jagger more than anywhere else in their history, adding thrillingly imperfect harmonies. The rest of the supporting cast also gets more of the spotlight: the brilliant barrelhouse piano of Nicky Hopkins singlehandedly defines ""Loving Cup"" and ""Torn and Frayed"", Mick Taylor adds counterpoint leads and the toodling bassline of ""Tumbling Dice"", Al Perkins' pedal steel and Bobby Key's sax contributes soul and country cred.</p>
<p>But despite his relative absence, Jagger's contributions on the back half of the record give <i>Exile</i> its dramatic arc. Though the album's concept record status has always been somewhat oversold, the plot does chart a rough path from drunken late-night revelry to next-day regret: The last third of the record looks back on the first two-thirds with a wince and a headache. ""I Just Want to See His Face"", ""Let It Loose"", ""Shine a Light""-- there's a profound need for redemption here unique to the Stones, an odd moment of guilt for a band known for consequence-free sexual bluster. As the last complete sentence of the album says, ""you're going to be the death of me.""</p>
<p>Unlike the album proper, the bonus tracks are given a clean scrubbing, and it's blatantly obvious in places that Jagger's vocals are circa 2009, not 1972. That added grooming offers the experimental results of an <i>Exile</i> <i>sans</i> Nellcôte-- still a band in the zone, but more Jagger-dominant and sterilized. Still, many of the unreleased songs work: ""Plundered My Soul"", wins on the merits of its falsetto backing vocals, and ""So Divine (Aladdin Story)"" is like a pastiche of <i>Aftermath</i>-era Stones played by an older, saltier band.</p>
<p>If allowing Jagger to touch up those vocals was the price to pay to allow <i>Exile</i> receive the tribute it deserves, it's still a bargain. All the same, it's a bit strange to see the Stones, somehow still alive, on the talk show circuit celebrating the product of their darkest years, treating their addictions, tax evasion, and near-breakup as just a colorful set piece on Rolling Stones: The Ride. The true thrill of <i>Exile on Main St.</i> is that it doesn't require all that backstory to be dramatized and Ken Burns-ed-- all the pain, fun, joy, and regret of being the biggest rock band on Earth, kinda loving it and kinda hating it, is right there in the filthy grooves of the record. Oh, what a beautiful buzz.</p></div>"|14264.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14264-exile-on-main-st-deluxe-edition/|10.0|Rob Mitchum

While DM indeed brought some psychedelic side dishes to Dan Auerbach and Pat Carney's meat-and-potatoes blues-rock table-- a little pan flute here, some spaghetti Western guitar licks there-- <i>Attack &amp; Release</i> had its share of samey-sounding midtempo cuts, suggesting that the duo were content to write variations on the same theme. Subsequent side projects (both worked in Damon Dash's not-disastrous rap-rock experiment Blakroc, and Carney formed Drummer) suggested that they probably felt this creative stagnation, too. As for Auerbach's basically-a-Black-Keys-album solo effort, <i>Keep It Hid</i>: guy's gotta get it out of his system somehow.</p>
<p>New challenges, as well as time apart from their main outfit, have served these guys well. <i>Brothers</i> is the loosest they've sounded since 2004's <i>Rubber Factory</i>. The Keys haven't undergone a drastic sonic shift or anything-- at this point, no one is going to mistake them for anyone else, especially if they keep putting out songs like <i>Brothers</i>' first two singles, ""Next Girl"" and ""Tighten Up"". The former is boilerplate Black Keys, complete with a burned-barn riff for a chorus and lyrics about wayward women; the latter, the only Danger Mouse-produced cut on the record, features a whistle-heavy melody that wouldn't have sounded out of place on <i>Attack &amp; Release</i>. But you don't come to the Black Keys for reinvention.</p>
<p>Instead, <i>Brothers</i> finds Carney and Auerbach augmenting their sound with some new stylistic tics, suggesting that they might've learned something from working with Danger Mouse. ""Too Afraid to Love You"" feels spooked-out thanks to Auerbach's distanced vocals and some haunted harpsichord, while the <i>Jock Jams</i> beat on ""Howlin' For You"" and ""Black Mud""'s winking nod to CCR's ""Green River"" find the Keys in an uncharacteristically playful mode.</p>
<p>Most striking on <i>Brothers</i> is Auerbach's incorporation of falsetto. The man has honed his speaker-blowing howl for so long now, it's genuinely surprising to hear him try another vocal style. Even more surprising is how good he is at it, too: he's controlled and natural on ""Everlasting Light"", vibing with high-pitched restraint and turning the tune into a lo-fi T. Rex stomper, while on penultimate track and Jerry Butler cover ""Never Gonna Give You Up"", he lets loose over a shimmering Motown melody.</p>
<p>If there's one thing that keeps <i>Brothers</i> from jumping the gap between a ""very good"" album and a ""great"" album, it's the running time. When it's all said and done, the 15-track set runs almost an hour long, causing one to think that the Keys might have done the best material here a disservice by shoving so much onto one album when they could've easily saved some up for their next release. It makes a skeptical fan like myself wonder if the Keys spent themselves creatively here, and if the next record will just be more back-to-basics trad-blues mediocrity. If the next Black Keys record builds on <i>Brothers</i>, though, they still have some good music ahead of them.</p></div>"|14222.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14222-brothers/|7.7|Larry Fitzmaurice

I mean, roughneck rhyming over J Dilla, Black Milk, and Oh No beats-- how could this fail? But for the most part, I felt like I stumbled upon an indie version of Memphis Bleek's <i>M.A.D.E.</i>, where an embarrassment of production riches were squandered on someone who had no problem portraying himself as a token street soldier. A lot of people told me I'd underrated it, and listening to <i>OJ Simpson</i>, I'm inclined to go back and find out if they're right. Guilty Simpson's second record is so cohesive, so focused, and so flat-out fun, I'm amazed it's the work of the same guy.</p>
<p>What's at first striking is that two tracks of erratically paced skits and assorted chatter totaling about four minutes pass by before we actually hear Simpson rap. <i>OJ Simpson </i>is entirely produced by Madlib, so if that structure puts you in the mindset of either <i>Madvillainy </i>or Lord Quas, it's for good reason. Though it lacks the bottled-lightning brilliance and brevity of the former and the bugged-out demeanor of the latter, Madlib still tailors it to Simpson's individual talents.  Through a haze of stand-up routines, half-remembered conversations, and fake news broadcasts, <i>OJ </i>feels like the work of someone equal parts class clown and playground bully, daydreaming about his next lay, next high, or, most often, next chance to knock some sucker out.</p>
<p>But while Madlib clearly plays a large role in determining the album's vision, it would be a mistake to overlook how Guilty Simpson rises to the occasion.  While Simpson maintains his bullish, no-frills cadences, he's exponentially more playful and humane than he was on <i>Ode to the Ghetto</i>'s gangsta to-do checklist. It's a pleasure to hear him spitball multi-layered rhymes that never call attention to their own ingenuity; you get something of a Simpson synopsis in a line like, ""I go at your street with aggression/ The same way I go at a beat and wreck sessions/ Then shoot a load on your freak at Best Western.""</p>
<p>But while <i>OJ </i>mostly stays within a zone of gunplay and battle rap, when Simpson delves into something other than his ability to hold his own on a mic or a barstool, he provides crucial insight to his surroundings. The rise-and-fall narrative of ""Karma of a Kingpin"" is a statement of the universality of the selectively scrupulous drug dealer that would justify his destructive trade by occasionally paying his customer's electric bill. Meanwhile, his J Dilla tribute ""Cali Hills"" reminds me of what Raekwon's ""Ason Jones"" did for Ol' Dirty Bastard, brave in its willingness to explore an occasional mundane humanity rather than legend or caricature. The only spot where <i>OJ </i>really falls flat is ""Back on the Road Again"", where Madlib's pitched-up sampling plays it a little too straight, and Simpson's wearied tour lament does the same.</p>
<p>But as highlights crop up throughout the sprawl-- Madlib's zombie funk on ""Coroner's Music"", the cyclical, effortless hooks of ""Hood Sentence"" and ""New  Heights""-- the temptation arises to strip <i>OJ Simpson </i>for parts. Yet, beyond providing important pivots for mood (""Something Bad"" and ""Something Good"" in particular), a three-track run toward the end of the album that lacks any sort of interlude is strong, but a bit ordinary. If <i>OJ Simpson </i>really were just a quantum leap for Guilty Simpson as a rapper, it would already be one of the year's best surprises, but strange digressions and all, it's something that honors his legacy by sounding like it could hold its own within Stones Throw's impeccable mid-00s run.</p></div>"|14259.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14259-oj-simpson/|8.0|Ian Cohen

Though it's ostensibly about Christianity-- ""Holy Bible Time!"" he announces at the outset-- Daniel Higgs' wandering journey is more about mind and spirit than scripture. He's fascinated by how mantras can kill the clock, how obsessively turning over a word or phrase can induce time-defying meditations. When he asks you to ""Say God""-- a request he makes about 100 different times during the 11-minute title track-- the point seems less about the word than how often you should repeat it. For Higgs, the answer to the question of ""how often"" is probably ""forever.""</p>
<p>If that makes <i>Say God </i>sound like something other than music, well, it is. It's more like metaphysical stand-up comedy, or maybe free-form sermons, centered on Higgs' rambling speech and extemporaneous warbling. He'll pick an idea, vary it, dart around it, and land back on it, over music so minimal and distant you often forget it's there. The opening track, ""Hoofprints on the Ceilings of Your Mind"", sets that template immediately. Higgs is so obsessed with the title and how many ways he can sing it that he ends up addressing the obsession. ""I worked really hard on this song, harder than usual,"" he confesses. ""It sounds corny, but this song became a way of life for me."" At the end, after getting re-mesmerized by his own singing, he wakes up again: ""Well, now it has begun. I enjoyed the beginning very much!"" All this OCD-ish self-hypnosis can be tedious even when it's amusing. But spiritual rituals often require you to endure tedium in order to reach something more profound. In that sense, Higgs' exercises are worth the work.</p>
<p>Besides, even with all the preaching, <i>Say God </i>can be pretty musical. Two straight-up instrumentals are perhaps the album's most moving pieces, especially ""Song For Azariah"", a mantra made of banjo plucks. But even Higgs' word-centered material is more like music than speech. He turns phrases into riffs and sentences into solos, counterpointing his own ideas like a horn-player reacting to a drummer. Following that progress can put you into weird frames of mind, where everything suddenly seems more profound. When I first listened to the 17-minute track ""Root &amp; Bough"" on headphones during a subway commute, the section in which Higgs suddenly bursts into electronic drone-- only to cut it off just as abruptly-- lasted exactly as long as my trip up an escalator. I could almost hear Higgs laughing, thrilled that one of his cosmic jokes had found an accidental punch line.</p>
<p>So <i>Say God </i>is funny, exhausting, and sometimes uplifting. Whether it is actually ""entertaining"" is a chicken/egg question-- do monks enjoy chanting, or the effect it has on their minds? Is a grueling workout fun, or do you remember it that way afterwards? Certainly there are moments here<i> </i>that you can laugh along with, zone out to, or get inspired by. But often at the end of these mental marathons, I find myself less interested in retracing the steps than in recapturing the feelings that result. The pleasure of following Higgs down <i>Say God</i>'s shapeless paths lies more in where he takes you than how he gets you there.</p></div>"|14256.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14256-say-god/|7.0|Marc Masters

The music of Can loomed large over Cave's previous releases, marrying the focus and drive of krautrock to muscular, raw noise rock. Now that they've slowed down, it turns their needle towards another Can-inspired act, Stereolab-- especially on opener ""Hot Bricks"". The track's clean guitar plucking and head-bobbing rhythm puts them in a mellower and slightly more static zone; it sounds like Cave are returning to the well-- at least at first.</p>
<p>But while none of the tracks points toward a new direction on its own, they do have an arc when listened from end to end, giving the EP a self-contained feel rather than just a hodgepodge of new tracks.  ""Teenager"" gets closer to the band's comfort zone, adding urgency and grit to familiar rhythms while also holding something back: The echoing guitar riff reaches higher and the group vocals go from chanting to wailing, but the climax feels perpetually around the next corner; it's insistent and cathartic without playing at full throttle. The EP's tension reaches its peak on closing track ""Brigitte's Trip (White Light/White Jazz)"", which again nods to Stereolab in its stilted beginning rhythms and glassy Moog tones, though it's not long before they reach a full-band crescendo and stretch out for a solid five minutes of languid jamming, still trying to find a common branch between minimalism and largess.</p>
<p>The buildups and freakouts on ""Brigitte's Trip (White Light/White Jazz)"" may be predictable by the EP's end, but every time someone leans on the wah-wah pedal or holds down a shimmering keyboard chord, it always feels natural and earned, as if those elements were lurking unnoticed in the background the whole time. If anything justifies the final song's 13-minute runtime, it's the band's easy mastery of tension and release, as well as the steady pulse they maintain even through their most indulgent moments<i>. Pure Moods</i> doesn't quite tap into something more distinctive for the band, but they remain proud and inventive purveyors of the kraut- and psych-rock tradition. It's an encouraging creative left turn that won't let any of their listeners down.</p></div>"|14250.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14250-pure-moods-ep/|6.6|Jason Crock

More of a good thing's not usually a bad thing, but even fans of<i> Cease</i> admitted it was a merely lateral move, one Ben Bridwell and his Band have seemingly taken great strides to correct since. <i>Infinite Arms</i>, their third record, took some 16 months to record and was compiled from dozens of tracks. Ryan Monroe, Tyler Ramsey, and Bill Reynolds joined the fold-- Bridwell is now the only member of the band who featured on <i>Everything--</i> and each of the Horses lent a hand to the songwriting this time around. Hell, Bridwell's even going around saying stuff like ""in many ways, this is the first Band of Horses record."" And the result of all this new blood, a year-plus of hard work? More of the same, yet somehow much less.</p>
<p>It seemed clear Band of Horses knew their strengths; gigantic, unabashedly earnest choruses, flittery verse melodies, and that honeypot in Ben Bridwell's throat. They are not, and never have been, the most musically dexterous or lyrically sophisticated band around, but when they're on, a dorky-when-you-say-it line like ""the world is such a wonderful place"" could really hit you below the neck. But <i>Infinite Arms</i> rarely seems to just go for it in the way <i>Everything All the Time</i> and <i>Cease to Begin</i> did, lyrically or musically. Despite a few minor and largely unobtrusive additions to the instrumental palette, the playing feels tentative, reviving old melodies (""Laredo"" is practically more ""Weed Party"" than ""Weed Party"") and putting a softer focus on the new ones. The aw-shucks naïvety and brash overstatement is dialed down; there are precious few heart-tugging, glass-in-air moments. And Bridwell pulls his formidable voice back, often mewling in a kind of Seals and Crofts-style close harmony or occasionally offering his bandmates the mic without him. Despite all the additions and subtractions, it's decidedly the work of the same band, but if <i>Infinite Arms</i> were, as Bridwell suggests, the first Band of Horses record, I doubt we'd be this curious about the third one.</p>
<p>True to form, there are some lovely moments that would've sat nicely on their previous records: The Brian Wilson-indebted highlight ""Bluebeard""; the familiar yet spirited ""Laredo""; the knotty melodies of lead single ""Compliments"" and ""Dilly"", which will knock around your head for a while. <i>Infinite</i>'s got a nice, leisurely way about it, and while a few moments exhibit more flash, Phil Ek's crystalline production once again does a nice job staying out of the way. But their slowpoke anthems and sunburnt rave-ups feel so worn-in, they're growing shapeless. A few well-placed lyrical potboilers could've really spruced up the drabber numbers, but the words here mostly range from the mundane (""oh, my love, is that you on the phone?"") to the goofy (""I was thinking it over by the snack machine/ I thought about you in a candy bar"") to cringe-inducing nonsense (the album-ending chorus of ""if Bartles &amp; Jaymes didn't need no first names, we could live by our own laws and favor."")</p>
<p>Most frustrating about <i>Infinite Arms</i>, though, is that what it's really missing seems almost intangible; it's tough to quantify ""heart,"" but that's not far off. Could be all the months in the studio, might be just plucking the wrong dozen from their tunes, but <i>Infinite Arms</i> just feels less tender, less personal, more twang-by-numbers than the last couple, despite its familiar sound and many of the same principals. There's much less of that sky-spanning, obtuseness-be-damned freedom that characterized their biggest (and, generally, best) moments in the past, and worst of all, that tug in Bridwell's throat feels muted, like even he's not really feeling it. Which is up there with <i>Infinite Arms</i>' most relatable sentiments.</p></div>"|14243.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14243-infinite-arms/|5.3|Paul Thompson

They can test the waters with a quick, don't-hold-us-to-this EP, or roll the full-length dice and hope their sound stands up without pinning them down. Rangda-- the trio of guitarists Sir Richard Bishop (Sun City Girls) and Ben Chasny (Six Organs of Admittance) and drummer Chris Corsano-- have figured out a way to do both. <i>False Flag</i> is like two three-song EPs checker-boarded into one stellar album. Each odd-numbered track offers improvised blare, while the evens are all structured songs. That division may seem pretty Jekyll/Hyde, but <i>False Flag</i> never feels like play-acting. Together only half a year, Rangda is already making music that sounds both fully developed and open-ended.</p>
<p>Which means that the trio's noisier leanings are just as drenched in thought and interaction as their melodic side. Their all-out improvisations could have easily sounded like weekend workouts, but intense concentration and muscular effort course through these escalating jams. Most impressive is the telepathy between Bishop and Chasny. On opener ""Waldorf Hysteria"", their racing chords have a rhyming quality, as if the pair were playing catch with a ball of noise. Corsano fares just as well. His cascading drumming on ""Fist Family"" is so entrancing, it locks the guitars like charmed snakes into long, humming tones.</p>
<p>Snake charming and other Eastern rituals factor in everything Bishop does, and there are traces of his worldly influences throughout <i>False Flag</i> (the band name comes from a Balinese demon queen). But those influences are never played up as exotic or grafted on like a fake accent. Raga-ish guitar figures are mostly just hinted at, and the ritualistic breaks in ""Serrated Edges"" are as natural as those in the best Sun City Girls blasts. In fact, the most intriguing influences here are Western. ""Bull Lore"" sounds like Earth's dusty twang mixed with the hypnosis of the Beatles' ""Because"", while the soft ""Sarcophagi"" evokes the halting minimalism of Loren Connors.</p>
<p><i>False Flag </i>ends with a blissful vista called ""Plain of Jars"", perhaps the closest thing here to a Six Organs/Sun City hybrid. Again, Western influences poke through, particularly the drifting, we've-got-all-night excursions of Sonic Youth's ""Rain on Tin"", Neil Young's ""Down by the River"", and Jimi Hendrix's ""Third Stone from the Sun"". But what's most striking about ""Plain of Jars"" is how much shorter it feels than its 15-minute length. Close your eyes and you can practically see all the different paths Rangda might have trekked down were they not restricted by the confines of a recording. The same is true of <i>False Flag </i>as a whole-- its fertile sounds suggest a wide-open future for a band that hopefully has a long life planned.</p></div>"|14249.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14249-false-flag/|8.2|Marc Masters

Because the group is made up of six women and because the novel concerns a tragic female heroine, it's tempting to read the name choice as a feminist stroke, but listening to Effi Briest gives the impression that it suits the band more for its German resonances than its gendered ones. With its loose song structures, throbbing tempos, and especially its heavy emphasis on hypnotic bass grooves, Effi Briest's full-length debut, <i>Rhizomes</i>, draws a direct line to krautrock legends Can and Amon Duul through post-punk acts like Public Image Ltd. and the Pop Group that themselves were deeply influenced by the psych-era Germans.</p>
<p>Out front, however, vocalist Kelsey Barrett is pure late-70s London, her wandering, atonal yelps and unintelligible declarations readily inviting comparisons to the likes of Polly Styrene and Ari Up. When she's paired with quicker rhythms, as on ""Mirror Rim"" (which features a neat lyrical gimmick of relying solely on palindromes) or ""Long Shadow"", Effi Briest come off as perhaps too-faithful post-punk revivalists. It's actually fortunate then that most of these grooves are more ponderous-- when Barrett's voice is evoking the B-52's on ""New Quicksand"", the band is rumbling moodily behind her rather than attempting to sound proto-new wave. The music's deliberateness is also good for accentuating the true bone-rattling brilliance of some of these basslines, particularly on the opening title cut, the ultra-Can-indebted ""Cousins"" and the space-rock headtrip ""Nights"".</p>
<p>Rather than offer a straight facsimile of any one specific sound or era, Effi Briest have expertly synthesized roughly 15 years' worth of brooding, seismic rock, which is no small feat. Still, there's really nothing on <i>Rhizomes</i> that would indicate the last 25-30 years of music ever happened. If I played you just about any one song here and told you it was a lost 70s nugget, you'd probably marvel at Effi Briest's stylistic command, but you'd probably totally believe it was a relic too, and with good reason. Until the group starts acknowledging that <i>Metal Box</i> didn't come out six months ago, their sound will remain somewhat of a dead end, albeit a great-sounding one.</p></div>"|14261.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14261-rhizomes/|6.3|Joshua Love

It doesn't stop a whole mess of bands from aiming to nail down the same vibes, among them the garage-throb in the Velvets/Spacemen 3 vein. Woven Bones work in that sound, as do fellow Austinites the Black Angels; mainstays like Black Rebel Motorcycle Club and the Warlocks have long made the stuff their stock-and-trade. But on their debut LP, <i>In and Out and Back Again</i>, the airtight, breathless Woven Bones set themselves apart from every one of those bands by, well, somehow coming closer to the intangible qualities these groups valued from Spacemen, et al. in the first place.</p>
<p>Bones leader Andrew Burr's tunes are lean little rumblers, built around the thwack of the drum and the ceaseless thump of Matt Nichols' bass. They're so skeletal that 10 seconds of strum at the top of ""7 Year Mirror"" seems an eternity amidst all the go-go-go. Verses and choruses seem almost interchangeable, though there's hardly any time to decide which is which. These tunes seem almost too cool for melody, favoring instead a dry, mesmeric peal. You'd be hard-pressed to finger a highlight amidst these 26 svelte minutes, given the record's compositional tunnelvision, yet the effect's not samey but, rather, hypnotic.</p>
<p>Burr's voice sounds built for dirty rock'n'roll--all bratty disaffection somewhere between Iggy circa <i>Fun House</i> and Echo and the Bunnymen's Ian McCulloch. He and the Bones have a superior sense of economy-- there's no mistaking that these songs are built from just bass, guitar, and drums. Burr's not crafting true takeaway moments yet, but the mood <i>In and Out</i> carries seems to linger, and prolonged exposure pulls the dark curtains back a bit to shed a little light on these sneaky almost-hooks. It's that sullen mood, though, that's <i>In and Out</i>'s greatest success-- it sounds lively, whipsmart, and half-drunk, like the band can't wait to set up and bum out. True, <i>In and Out</i> would be a better record were the songs a bit better defined, but its brief runtime and distinctly dingy feel go a long way to make up for any compositional shortcomings. This is garage-drone with a distinct whiff of carport about it, and that's just not a vibe you can convincingly fake.</p></div>"|14253.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14253-in-and-out-and-back-again/|6.6|Paul Thompson

The band has always had a mysterious, subterranean sound, but their name has never felt more appropriate than it does on their fourth album, <i>Alt Er Tabt</i>. It's a dark, tense record full of spartan arrangements and songs built more around moody atmosphere than melodic hooks. Almost every instrument and voice on the record is covered in a layer of grime, and the result of all these filthy sounds rubbing together is oddly beautiful. More remarkable is the fact that, a mere two years ago, Under Byen seemed poised to broaden the scope of their sound on the <i>Siamesisk</i> mini-album, which was recorded with a chamber orchestra.</p>
<p>Beyond my confounded expectations, <i>Alt Er Tabt</i>'s unnerving throb initially put me off-- there seemed to be little going on behind the texture. But a few subsequent listens revealed an album that's hard to get out of your head once you've given yourself over to it. Under Byen convey a sense of forward motion with very few conventional beats, using a knowledge of harmony and interlocking instrumental patterns to accomplish a task normally relegated to a drum kit. The gothic claustrophobia of Henriette Sennenvaldt's weirdly processed and chorused vocals (entirely in Danish) serves as a sort of central spine around which the band can pivot, at times locking in on complex patterns and at others letting the patterns fall away in favor of a brief moment of light.</p>
<p>One of the most haunting elements of the music is Anders Stochholm's harmonica, which is employed only occasionally but always effectively. He uses it to create an extremely elemental sound at the climax of ""Unoder"", a song that creeps and scrapes along, pushed forward by repetitive phrases until the harmonica blares out a strangely joyful and simple tune. The moment is a turning point, as the song is subsequently overwhelmed by frenzied violin and cello, playing a theme that sounds like a Philip Glass soundtrack to a crossing of the River Styx.</p>
<p>It's these shifts and sudden moments, when the band gives you a glimmer to latch onto, that ultimately make <i>Alt Er Tabt</i> a good, even special album. Under Byen give themselves over completely to a particular way of doing things, in the process crafting an album whose utter strangeness is arresting and whose consistency of vision is impressive.</p></div>"|14236.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14236-alt-er-tabt/|7.6|Joe Tangari

Television. It's kinda soul-crushing in a way to listen to 'Perfect Day' and say, 'I'm gonna go write a song like that,' and it'll be fucking horrible by comparison."" At that point, the Strokes had yet to squander their leather-clad, LES cool, and LCD Soundsystem were still, mostly, a Williamsburg blip. But over the past five years, things changed. Drastically. In 2010, early aughts trendsetters like Interpol and the Strokes are NYC relics, outpaced by a gang of stridently preppy, chart-topping Columbia grads and a 40-year-old Brian Eno obsessive. On <i>This Is Happening</i>, Murphy once again shows off his encyclopedic knowledge of all things post-punk and zip-tight. But he's also swimming up some serious stuff himself, including Eno and David Bowie's sacrosanct Berlin trilogy. And against his own prediction, it's far from horrible; it's actually pretty perfect.</p>
<p>""I spent my whole life wanting to be cool... but I've come to realize that coolness doesn't exist the way I once assumed,"" said Murphy in a recent <i>Guardian</i> feature. This realization probably has something to do with his rising cultural cache. After all, Murphy has done what all other music fiends only dream about-- he's flipped the system and become the embodiment of coolness. This is a phenomenal coup. And he's quick to rationalize his current status to the <i>New Yorker</i>: ""I understand that if someone's going to make me his idea of cool I can't control that.""</p>
<p>It's somewhat ironic, then, that Murphy's reign as New York's ambassador of post-hip-everything finds him nearly <i>losing</i> his cool on <i>This Is Happening</i>. His early singles and first album were him joking to himself, <i>Sound of Silver</i> was a collective rush of us vs. them, and now it's about him and her. This is also by far the bloodiest LCD Soundsystem album-- a series of bare, lacerating manifestos about distance between people, set to the fizzing art/dance-rock greatest hits inside Murphy's skull. ""Love is a murderer,"" he sings on ""I Can Change"". He's not kidding.</p>
<p>On the hypnotic dirge ""Somebody's Calling Me"", the vocal chameleon tries on narcotic whispers while taking Iggy Pop's sleazy, empty-eyed ""Nightclubbing"" out of the club and into the bedroom. And though ""All I Want"" borrows that sliding Bowie guitar and kraut-y beat, Murphy makes it singe with his own tour-born regret, loss, and fatigue: ""You learn in your bed you've been gone for too long/ So you put in the time, but it's too late to make it strong."" Even considering his bold-name touchstones for <i>This Is Happening</i>, it would be shortsighted to cry rip-off; Murphy is remaking essential 70s art-rock in his own hyper-modern, self-aware image.</p>
<p>This fearlessness burrows its way into the rest of the album, making it more of a self-help guide to relationship hangovers than a woe-is-me fest. Opener ""Dance Yrself Clean"" starts quiet and stuffed with circular paranoia: ""Talking like a jerk except you are an actual jerk, and living proof that sometimes friends are mean,"" Murphy mumbles to himself. ""All My Friends"" this is not. But then a massive, meaty synth expands the speakers, lifts the singer up, and plops him down smack in the middle of the dancefloor. LCD Soundsystem has always excelled at making sounds for moving bodies, but now that motion is more entangled with other, less exuberant emotions. Potentially misguided frat anthem ""Drunk Girls"" is a punchline-laden lark that ends with, ""Be honest with me, honestly/ Unless it hurts my feelings."" On earlier records, Murphy could sound like he didn't really mean it while hollering on the fly, but <i>This Is Happening</i> confirms him as a top-tier vocalist and lyricist capable of mixing heavy and light, lyrical and self-deprecating, sometimes in the same line: ""Love is an open book to a verse of your bad poetry... and this is coming from me.""</p>
<p>Murphy's vast  perspective and all-knowing mien are invaluable assets to his success. Recorded in L.A. instead of his hometown, <i>This Is Happening</i> finds the unlikely rock star zooming out even further in search of the realness and truth mentioned on the album's ""music about writing music"" track ""You Wanted a Hit"". And on the virtuoso rambler ""Pow Pow"", he seems to locate a perch where he can ""relax"" and ""see the whole place"" and understand ""advantages to both"" sides of any argument. Sounds nice. But by the end of the song, he's beset by confusion, numbness, and a false sense of security. ""What you want from now is someone to feel you,"" he croons. At first, Murphy showed how to let loose without losing your cool; now he's figuring out how to break down without cracking up.</p></div>"|14257.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14257-this-is-happening/|9.2|Ryan Dombal

Still their ever-present grimace has never felt quite as fixed as it does on their latest, <i>A Small Turn of Human Kindness</i>. Many longtime fans found 2008's <i>Life... The Best Game in Town</i>, which played at times like a sampler of Milk's many past successes, neither weird nor challenging enough, <i>and Small Turn</i> is a sharp shift towards the slow, somber, and fucking bleak. These are moods they've explored plenty in the past, but never with such a single-minded dedication to the downcast.</p>
<p><i>Small Turn</i> airs its grievances to the tune of near-funereal doom metal; tempos crawl, chords hang in the air like stink, riffs unfurl over many minutes, and frontman Creston Spiers' yowl reaches untold heights of lowness. This sort of grimy dirge-metal isn't new to the Milk lexicon but before, there was at least a glint of levity to offset the withering stare. Nothing about <i>Small Turn </i>suggests anyone is kidding around.</p>
<p>The album is nothing if not deliberate; its musical arc, from the listless ebb of its first third to the more dynamic midsection through to the stirring, hard-fought climax of its last couple of tracks, feels as unified as the record's bearish, behemoth sound. Valleys abound, but there are few peaks. Indeed, this monochromatic record can seem like 45 cheerless minutes all in a row, but the meticulous structure starts to show itself after a few listens, and its most decrepit bits verging on thrilling once you're familiar with them. The album's most electrifying segment comes at the end of half an hour of clamber, when a delicate piano line replaces the bleary guitars and Spiers' voice finally drops from a bellow to a whisper before letting the growl go yet again. For as unshowy and willfully acrimonious as <i>Small Turn</i> gets, there is a level of mastery here that is easy to respect even when it's a little hard to love.</p>
<p><i>Small Turn</i>'s greatest strength is also its primary flaw; they do this particular sort of downtrodden as well as anybody, but given all they're capable of, it's a shame that they limit themselves to such a small sonic palette. Still, it's yet another curiously strong record from one of today's most interesting bands, a worthy successor to their downtrodden pre-hiatus LPs, and one hell of a buzzkill.</p></div>"|14240.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14240-a-small-turn-of-human-kindness/|7.8|Paul Thompson

The  line-up, for one thing-- Johan Angergård is the composer, and Karolina  Komstedt is the singer. Her voice is always polite and gentle; his songs  are consistently tuneful in the low-key way that characterizes contemporary Scandinavian indie pop. Within this template, the  duo have gone through a surprising number of stylistic shifts-- at  various time slipping comfortably into trip-hop,  twee, bossanova, dub, and dance-pop. Their experimentation has yielded  hit-or-miss results, but their willingness to explore and ability to  change up their formula without sacrificing the band's essential  character is commendable.</p>
<p><i>The People's Record</i>, the duo's seventh  full-length, is their boldest work to date. Whereas previous Club  8 releases had toyed with danceable beats, Angergård's new songs are  built upon dense polyrhythms that borrow extensively from Western  African, Brazilian, and Afro-Cuban music. Thanks in large part to the  group's nimble rhythm section, these sounds have been integrated into  their established Euro-indie aesthetic with nuance and grace. The  emphasis on rhythm seems natural, and the songs seem to be constructed  from the bottom up rather than arbitrarily tossed into these beat-heavy  arrangements.</p>
<p>Club 8 have never sounded deeper, darker, or  funkier. Komstedt's voice is still thin and wispy, but her melodies are  given more bounce when contrasted with the festive, lively percussion of  ""Western Hospitality"" and ""Isn't That Great?"" ""Dancing With the Mentally  Ill"", the album's highlight, is haunting and groovy and somehow  manages to echo late-70s Fleetwood Mac as much as twitchy post-punk and  West African funk. When the songs settle into mellower grooves, the  music bears a superficial-- though flattering!-- resemblance to Taken  by Trees' album from last year, on which Victoria Bergsman's soft,  heavily accented voice was paired with Pakistani rhythms and  instrumentation.</p>
<p>Though <i>The People's Record</i> contains some of the  best music of Club 8's career, it doesn't hold up well as a complete  album. There are no outright duds, but the sequence is front-loaded to  such a degree that there is an obvious drop-off in quality by the middle  of the set. From there on out, it's a case of the same ideas executed  with less inspiration and weaker hooks. Komstedt's voice, though sweet  and pleasant, has a way of seeming disengaged and characterless without  the benefit of compelling melodies, which drags down mediocre cuts such  as ""Like Me"" and ""We're All Going to Die"". At 10 songs and just about  37 minutes, the album is not overlong, though only about half of that  running time accounts for top-shelf material. It's a fine record to  cherry-pick, but something of a chore to sit through in its entirety.</p></div>"|14245.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14245-the-peoples-record/|6.2|Matthew Perpetua

The primary overlap point would be a knack for microscopic detail. Using an array of oscillators, arpeggiators, and crazy sounds you can't easily place they gather errant scraps of instrumentation and noise into uncanny wholes. But when we say ""drone,"" don't think dark and dense-- this is lively, diverse music.</p>
<p>Konntinent is a little more forbidding than his peers, but his sound world is just as wonderfully kaleidoscopic. On <i>Opal Island</i>, brooding guitars add delicate melodies to micro-electronic mirages. Rhythms are jagged, but feel purposeful and fluid. There is plenty of peculiar, splintering noise, but almost no murk: The record simply wouldn't work without the clear production, which captures the unique curve and heft of each sound. Konntinent's materials aren't just drones, hums, and disarticulated tunes; but also glitches, unruly microphones, the muffled roar of blank tape. Clicks and pops embellish the melodies, and scraps of extreme frequency swallow up portions of signal. He ranges broadly over the stereo spectrum, creating sub-rhythms with hard pans to immerse the listener in a spacious, unevenly shifting sound.</p>
<p>While each track is made of similar, elusive materials, the atmosphere often changes, from the opiated death disco of ""44 55 33"" to the slack guitars of ""Frost Fair"". The tracks shapeshift so gradually you barely notice it, though momentous changes occur in almost every one. Voices occasionally pop in: Konntinent's own grayscale murmur, and a winsome turn by Lisa Madisson on the calming ""Dry Eyed"". To call these effects dreamlike is clichéd but correct-- you're in one place and then, suddenly, another. People appear, say incomprehensible things, then vanish. On the margin of deceptive banality, extraordinary events flicker. If you like hearing the esoteric pleausres of sound art rendered tangible, intuitive, and explicity emotional, Konntinent is as rewarding as the best of his peers.</p></div>"|14234.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14234-opal-island/|7.8|Brian Howe

Its video-- a crude, Dada-esque PowerPoint presentation-- was uploaded to YouTube and soon found its way to other non-music-related websites under the ""humor"" tag. It seemed like a misinterpretation, if not a slight against the band. But after hearing their debut, that classification makes a little more sense.</p>
<p><span>Rather than using wit or irony to indicate their cleverness,</span> Wounded Lion come off as affably goofy, more like class clowns than arch satirists. Over the 4/4 beats and simple strum patterns that dominate the record, singer Brad Eberhard nods to geography (""Hunan Province""), astrology (""Belt of Orion""), and centaurs (""Pony People"") in a mannered and earnest singing voice. On ""Degobah System"", a song whose lyrics promise ""crazy shit"" yet refuse to acknowledge Star Wars outside of the title, the singer's slurred yapping sounds a little more like Adam Sandler than Jonathan Richman. As the band picks up the pace in the album's later half, Eberhard documents the mysterious ""Omar Walk"" (""What is the Omar Walk?/ That's the Omar Walk"") and talks up Coors Light on ""Silver People"". It's as imaginative and scattershot as a high schooler's sketchbook, and about as deep.<br/><br/>Each track finds small variations to keep things from getting too repetitive-- vocal harmonies bolster ""Hunan Province""; a Hammond organ shows up in ""Pony People""-- and there are enough of these moments to show they've digested more strains of music than their <span>otherwise simple</span> songs suggest on first pass. Wounded Lion's offbeat humor might suggest a more honest and unguarded attitude than you'd find among their garage and lo-fi peers, but <span>some more distinct</span> tunes could have carried that perspective further.</p></div>"|14161.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14161-wounded-lion/|5.8|Jason Crock

Setting aside the quality of the material-- there are classics here, along with albums I never listen to anymore-- these albums are notable for me because the first time I heard them, music just seemed <i>bigger</i> than it had before, like it took up more space and hit with more force and went further than once seemed possible. When I was getting into these records, I'd get a specific kind of kick just from putting them on. They felt like rides at an amusement park, and I'd get a feeling in my stomach when the first notes kicked in: <i>Here we go</i>. I'm adding another record to my list.</p>
<p>Demos of songs from Sleigh Bells' <i>Treats</i> first started making their way around the Internet last fall, and they immediately served as conversation starters. The distortion in early track ""Crown on the Ground"" was so intense that every other second the song seemed on the verge of shutting down. But while Derek Miller's overdriven guitar and bass were distressed in the extreme, vocalist Alexis Krauss remained calm as chaos raged around her. Her cadence, somewhere at the intersection of singing, speaking, and chanting, conveyed an easy confidence, like she belonged in the middle of this maelstrom and knew she didn't need to shout to be heard. The contrast between her relaxed bearing-- where she seemed to rule over it all-- and the dangerous splatter of the music was striking to say the least. It was as easy to be taken in as it was to understand why someone else might be repelled. I felt some of both feelings, to be honest, but I also wanted to hear more.</p>
<p><i>Treats</i> delivers completely on the promise of those demos. Sleigh Bells haven't stopped living in the red, but the improved recording quality makes songs including ""Crown on the Ground"" that much heavier, and the duo have managed to extend their uncomplicated formula across 11 tracks without it wearing thin. The combination of the music's essentials-- jackhammer riffs clipped from punk and metal, mid-tempo beats from hip-hop and electro, and supremely catchy sing-song melodies-- is striking on its own, sounding remarkably fresh and unlike anything else right now. But an even greater source of the record's appeal is how it doesn't sound especially referential.</p>
<p>When so much music seems designed to evoke the mood and vibe of a specific era, either through direct imitation or playing with the memories of the music's context, Sleigh Bells deftly avoid any single pigeonhole. There are references, but it never feels like the music is merely pointing. Genre here is something to be twisted around and pulled and braided with something else, a mangled container struggling to hold the energy and ecstasy of the music. They gather up bits from all over and use them to create music that puts you squarely in the present moment.</p>
<p>The music hits so hard, and in such a satisfying way, and it seems designed to bring you back to the totality of the sound. It's hard to say what the songs are about, since so many words are so difficult to make out, but they work. The lyrics of ""A/B Machines"" consist only of, ""Got my A machines on the table/ Got my B machines in the drawer,"" repeated over and over, and who am I to question Krauss on this point? We're talking about ""a-wop bop a-loo bop a-lop bam boom"" and ""Da Doo Ron Ron"" here, which is just right for what the music tries for.</p>
<p>So my ear on ""A/B Machines"" goes to the searing guitar lead, which screeches out a few penetrating notes, and then pauses on the clanging low-end and the interludes and Western-sounding guitar rumble. And on the opening ""Tell 'Em"", the focus goes to the call-and-response drum machine pummel, soaring riff, and finger snaps compressed into sharp little diamonds, as Krauss chirps a short, repetitive melody with the insistence of a pep rally cheer. ""Rill Rill"" takes the immortal acoustic guitar bit from Funkadelic's ""Can You Get to That"", blows it up to Hollywood blockbuster size, and loops it along with clicking percussion as Krauss sings what may prove to be the pop earworm of the year, the kind of tune you'd swear you were singing over and over to yourself years ago. ""Straight A's"" has some of the electro-punk rage of Crystal Castles, the less frantic tracks like ""Rachel"" have a bit of shoegaze, and the pacing of the album is just so, taking you right to edge in one song and then pulling you back a few inches in the next.</p>
<p>Though both Krauss and Miller have been making music for a while-- he in the hardcore band Poison the Well, she in some kind of manufactured teen-pop group that never got off the ground-- it's easy to see them as a connected band with the right gimmick at the right time. They live in New York, they've played hip shows for important people, and from the beginning the online chatter has been almost as deafening as the guitar tones. But what works in their favor is that they've taken advantage of these breaks and marshaled their talent to make something that oozes joy. There's <i>spirit</i> to this music, and the sonic assault is celebratory, asking only that you come along with it and join in. All of which, for me, anyway, makes the hype melt away. And if it's true that records this intense and exhilarating don't always sustain themselves over the long haul, that's not a worry either. The visceral thrill of <i>Treats</i> may not last forever, but neither does life; right now, this feels like living it.</p></div>"|14251.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14251-treats/|8.7|Mark Richardson

Over the last few years, though, a consistent lineup has solidified, with bassist Matt McQuaid and drummer Matt Schulz holding down the rhythm section. And as one might expect, the consistency has affected the band's sound, making <i>Latin</i>, the band's third album, leaner and funkier than its predecessors.</p>
<p>Borcherdt and Walsh have refined some of their more aggressive noise, and here they use their arsenal of tone generators, guitars, and keyboards to create washes of tone that wrap around the rhythm section like a scratchy blanket. The occasional stab of melody flashes out from the maelstrom, before following the band on its next rhythmic turn. In fact, the album opens with a long ambient wash that builds in volume and intensity before peeling back to reveal the skeletal dance groove of ""Red Lights"", a highlight that makes the most of the strange interplay between untethered ambient sound and insistent rhythm.</p>
<p>Even in its new, tighter state, the band can still bring the noise, as on the crunching closer ""P.I.G.S."", whose melodic synth patterns culminate in a vicious stop-time coda that ends the album on its roughest, most brutal note. Holy Fuck's original mission was essentially to use a live band to create electronic, techno-informed music, and it's a goal they remain wedded to here. Single ""Latin America"" in particular seems to pattern its rhythmic breakdowns and buildups on modern dance music.</p>
<p>Holy Fuck have carved out a unique and identifiable sound of their own, and as the band itself has solidified, it's made their identity even stronger. If the record loses some of the sense that things could fall apart at any moment-- part what made their sound so gripping-- they largely compensate with solid compositions and strong instrumental interplay.</p></div>"|14207.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14207-latin/|7.8|Joe Tangari

In particular, both tend to be torn over innovation: There are those who believe that no art form can survive without pushing its boundaries outward and upward, and those who believe that straying too far from those boundaries turns the music into something else, something undesirable and ugly. Into this morass of dreary arguments over authenticity wade Jørgen Munkeby and his colleagues in Shining, and they handily illustrate how the whole issue can be mooted by just not caring that much about pleasing either side.</p>
<p>It's not as if <i>Blackjazz</i>, with its electrifying fusion of jazz structures and punishing metal instrumentation, is unprecedented: The first buzzy guitar chords of ""The Madness and the Damage Done"", which quickly settle into unpredictable jazz patterns, call back to Borbetomagus or Peter Brötzmann. The appearance of a spastic saxophone owes more than a bit to American jazz-punk, and Shining's extreme metal elements recall Enslaved, with whom they've collaborated in the past. Even the band's past as an acoustic jazz ensemble, and its use of distinctive rhythm patterns and odd instrumentation, are reminders of other forward-looking Scandinavians like Jaga Jazzist.</p>
<p>But Shining manage to transcend their influences, numerous as they may be, by simply throwing themselves into the sum of their parts with such gusto. From beginning to end-- and including a predictable but enjoyable cover of King Crimson's ""21st Century Schizoid Man"" that tips their prog influences-- Shining never fail to convince themselves, or listeners, they're presenting something new. That conviction, combined with their undeniable chops-- Munkeby's unhinged sax work and the extremely adept drumming of Torstein Lofthus deserve special attention-- carries <i>Blackjazz</i> into somewhere worth exploring.</p>
<p>It's when <i>Blackjazz</i> fails to go whole hog, in fact, that they're at their least convincing. The world certainly doesn't need another Opeth, and Shining still gets a bit carried away with the synth noodling with which symphonic metal has cursed an unlucky world. Even Helte Hermansen's guitars are hooky, powerful, and wound up in exciting progressions, but they could stand to get a little dirt on them; Munkeby's vocals also benefit from grit, and a less clinical guitar sound would definitely benefit Shining's overall attack. Still, Shining are combining jazz and metal in original ways, from the filling up of jazz's precious empty spaces with ticking nervous energy to the replacement of metal's vocal aggression with creepy and disconnected noise. And if that's not the same as true originality, it's close enough.</p></div>"|14215.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14215-blackjazz/|7.7|Leonard Pierce

Yet Zs' under-the-radar status suits the trio just fine, not least because the group's noise from the underground has increasingly begun to sound like, well, noise from the underground. As in literally-- Zs music can sound like something menacing you might hear blasting out from beneath a manhole one night, a noise that may make you walk just that much faster, looking nervously over your shoulder for a glimpse of who or what is emerging from the dank and dark.</p>
<p><i>New Slaves</i> begins with a looping exploration of dreamy percussion that sounds like a cross between bicycle spokes being hit, a street excavation project, and an orchestra tuning up-- backwards. And as that opening track, ""Concert Black"", seamlessly shifts into the second, ""Acres of Skin"", it's clear that the Zs haven't suddenly become any more interested in sonic handholding. The rhythm and racket are unrelenting, the composition dense and disorienting, and when Sam Hillmer's tea-kettle sax finally kicks in, all you can do is give up and go with it.</p>
<p>And, boy, does the disc take you places, equally evocative and off-putting, challenging and intriguing. ""Gentleman Amateur"" starts off with not just a particularly tactile drone but what comes across as several strangely distinct drones all at once. Its digital beehive of intense buzzing is supported by an almost invisible industrial beat that doesn't make its presence really known until moments before the track ends. The distorted shouting of ""Don't Touch Me"" leads to what may be the first clear use of electric guitar, which is itself quickly subsumed by the group's studio-sculpted cacophony. The track's three or so minutes feel like an eternity, and in turn the relative peace and quiet of the following ""Masonry"", an ambience mining epiphany.</p>
<p>The sheer skronk and clank of the 20-minute title track is more unforgiving, a coruscating blast that falls somewhere between a busy phone bank and a construction site. Which leaves the two parts of ""Black Crown Ceremony"" to conclude the album on a slightly easier to take-- though by no means easy-- note. Indeed, right up to its abrupt conclusion, <i>New Slaves</i> pretty much epitomizes uneasiness, like your worst post-millennial urban nightmare come to life in musical form, let loose to terrorize the world, at least for the disc's epic duration. And then all goes blissfully, nervously quiet once again.</p></div>"|14230.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14230-new-slaves/|7.0|Joshua Klein

I'll unscientifically submit that this is Keane's most quoted lyric, and rightfully so, since one of the prevalent themes of their catalog is trying to find a semblance of comfort and truth in a world evolving at a frightening pace. Likewise, even as critical tastes seem to shift on the fly, Keane remain something of a constant: Even if you've never heard a note of their music, you've almost certainly heard they're lame-- the third-tier Coldplay that will never end up on a Jay-Z album.</p>
<p>All of this comes full circle on <i>Night Train</i>, a ""forget everything you know about Keane!"" EP that's seeking to impress Beyoncé but will probably just generate a chuckle from Solange. On 2008's <i>Perfect Symmetry</i>, Keane already went lengths to distance themselves from their image as ivory-tinkling sissies by finally adding guitars and drum machines, but this time, they're more intent on proving they're hip and <i>fun</i>. It's tough to doubt their commitment, considering for all its updated software, <i>Symmetry</i> tanked at the box office. At any given point, they're taking things further, either sanding off the sharp edges of nu-rave (""Back in Time""), approaching Club Med (""Clear Skies""), or pushing toward the overtly synthetic side of 1980s radio pop (neary everything else).</p>
<p>No matter what their exteriors, Keane still seem incapable of anything other than the most heavy-handed gestures, peddling the same populist mock uplift that leaves you feeling pushed when it's meant to move. A cover of Yellow Magic Orchestra's ""I-Shin Den-Shin"" featuring Japanese pop singer Tigarah aims to be a meta-commentary on cross-cultural outreach but instead comes awfully close to the maddening chirp of ""It's a Small World (After All)"".</p>
<p>But nothing will prepare you for two tracks with feel-good rap cause K'naan, a guy who's often championed by the sort of people who still use the word ""bling"" when talking about What's Wrong With Rap. Here, you're just left to wonder where the mutual admiration lies, as this scans an awful lot like the token song on pre-2k boy band albums geared towards ""urban"" formats. Credit Keane for laying down some pretty undeniable, high-stepping piano pomp, but I sorta hope that they were never in the studio together, lest they be high-fiving over lyrics like, ""I guess I'm just a fiend/ Consumed by the scene/ The stage and the screens where it's just me and Keane.""</p>
<p>K'naan fits in better on ""Looking Back"", and that's a huge problem considering that the sum of their artistry is a motivational rap built on the theme to ""Rocky"". Unlike Pat Boone's <i>In a Metal Mood: No More Mr. Nice Guy </i>or M.O.P. guesting on an LFO track, these guys are so earnest about what they think is some culmination of genre alchemy that you can't even find humor in it. Instead, you just ride out the embarrassment like you did any time one of your ""hip"" teachers tried to incorporate rap into their lesson plans.</p>
<p>Look, it helps to believe that Keane had a chance here-- as with their past albums, there's often a strong melody or machine-like songwriting efficiency dying to strap itself to something other than platitudes and awkward genre exercises. And in less clumsy hands, such a shift might sound like a band being themselves, but even as they turn their music into rebranding strategy, Keane are just getting worse at being what they think you want them to be.</p></div>"|14246.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14246-night-train-ep/|3.0|Ian Cohen

Like a lot of those acts-- and like their contemporaries in No Age and Abe Vigoda-- Male Bonding started out making more abrasive music. Two of the three members used to be in the noise-pop band PRE, and the rich London scene they're coming out of-- a loose collective of bands with more of a common spirit than a common sound-- is full of scratchy post-punk, lo-fi fuzz, and hints of classic labels like Teenbeat, K, and Flying Nun. These are the kinds of foundational sounds that indie rock often turns back to when it needs to clear its head. But with Male Bonding, part of the treat is hearing them jump out of that and find room in the wide-open field where amped-up, rangy punk stuff collides with tuneful slacker pop. (Early on, they covered both Black Flag and Blur.) No surprise that they've wound up signed to Sub Pop, a label that built part of its reputation on that sound.</p>
<p>""That sound"" isn't new, of course. It helps that Male Bonding are shockingly good at it, and remarkably efficient. The songs on <i>Nothing Hurts</i> are short, direct, pared down to essentials, and tightly packed-- with hooks, with changes, with instrumental fireworks. They move rapidly from zoomy rock to more atmospheric breaks (""Franklin""), and from a terrific run of loose, spiky gems in the middle (""Crooked Scene"", ""Weird Feelings"") to some surprises toward the end. (The closer, a scratchy acoustic number, features guest vocals by Vivian Girls.) Frontman John Arthur Webb's vocals and lyrics can be a little hazy and non-committal-- often that's part of the charm-- but they're not really in the spotlight. Listening to tracks like ""T.U.F.F."" and ""Pumpkin"", you get the sense that this band's songwriting starts from the way their instruments lock together when they're playing in a room-- cymbal-bashing drum parts, chunky bass lines, and Webb's shattered-sounding guitar leads-- leaving this record as a fuzzy, no-nonsense, half-hour document of what they do.</p>
<p>And then there are the hooks. The hustle, the energy, and the sheer number of them make this an easy album to love-- especially if you're in the mood for some feedback, Nirvana moves, and punk-rock energy along with your melodies. One of the best comes during the killer chorus of a slack pop song called ""Nothing Remains"", which runs back and forth between a punk-rock build and a burst of high, cooing backing vocals; it's loose, noisy, and wonderfully graceful. <i>Nothing Hurts</i> is full of that kind of excitement: the sound of a fast, fuzzy rock band racing from hook to hook, plowing happily through breakdowns and guitar blasts, springing through scrappy melodies with style. It's one of the happiest surprises of the year so far.</p></div>"|14241.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14241-nothing-hurts/|8.5|Nitsuh Abebe

Maybe Brian King and David Prowse still worry about dying and being away from home, but now they're facing something more mundane and knowable: following a record that catapulted them to indie fame. This year, the duo will continue to release 7"" singles culled from material written during the <i>Post-Nothing </i>sessions in addition to <i>No Singles, </i>a collection of two out-of-print EPs (2007's <i>All Lies </i>and 2008's <i>Lullaby Death Jams</i>). And while it's a fun peek into Japandroids' developmental process, don't expect anything more from this release.</p>
<p>Granted, Japandroids sound like the same band that made <i>Post-Nothing</i>, if occasionally less<i> </i>reliant on fuzz tones. Prowse often forgoes time-keeping for drum-on-your-dashboard fills while King bashes away in Drop-D tuning, which allows you to power chord with one finger. And <i>No Singles </i>engages new fans with its best stuff up front.  Even for Japandroids, ""Darkness on the Edge of Gastown"" is bluntly composed, little more than one chord alternately bludgeoned and left to dissonantly ring before a coda that stresses tension where later songs would lean on catharsis.</p>
<p>It probably wasn't their intention to cast <i>Post-Nothing </i>in an even better light, but <i>No Singles </i>does show that it featured real craftsmanship instead of just reckless abandon. On the waltz-timed ""Sexual Aerosol"", you hear a likable band as much indebted to late-90s, post-Sunny Day emo as punk; decent, but not playing with any real urgency. The vocals are in place-- for the most part King and Prowse do their back and forth, buddy-buddy thing with repeated, clipped phrases. ""No Allegiance to the Queen"" and ""Coma Complacency"" come close to locating the sort of anthem qualities of the band's best songs, but spirited ""whoas!"" and ""heys!"" are the best sing-along moments there.</p>
<p>In many places, songs seem much looser than the band's later material. Tracks that retain an off-the-cuff, jam-like composition (""Lucifer's Symphony"", ""Couture Suicide"") lack a monster riff or sense of drama to justify their length. It's no surprise that of these songs, only ""Gastown"" and their over-the-top take on Mclusky's ""To Hell With Good Intentions"" regularly make their live shows these days. Despite the hit and miss content, Japandroids come off as so genuine it would be cynical to view this release with suspicion. Hell, if anything, it's proof positive that they're improving-- and a cautionary tale against the dangers of hyping bands in their infancy and not giving them chances to develop.</p></div>"|14228.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14228-no-singles/|6.7|Ian Cohen

""They say that I'm changing/ Cuz I'm gettin famous,"" went the chorus to 2008's ""Fuck You"", a bluesy lope of acoustic guitar and twangy harmonica that recalled vintage Dungeon Family.  The logic was counterintuitive, even a little ridiculous, but the song itself was warm, fluid, and surprising.  It was B.o.B in a nutshell: arrogant, self-aware, undeniably promising. The long road from that to <i>The Adventures of Bobby Ray</i> seems dominated by record execs who manicured, man-handled, and placated the rapper. They catered to all his worst instincts, and he gladly surrendered himself to theirs. The result should serve as a cautionary tale to all involved, except for one small detail: <i>The Adventures of Bobby Ray</i> was the No. 1 album in the country last week.</p>
<p>To put that in perspective: <i>Bobby Ray</i> sold 84,000 copies. In 2003, when people still bought CDs, these numbers would have been embarrassing for a high-profile hip-hop debut, but in 2010, they are, apparently, victory-lap worthy. Atlantic invested time and effort into ""grooming"" B.o.B, and since record companies tend only to take notice when their pre-planned strategies pan out (ground-level phenomena like Gucci Mane tend to get dismissed as flukes), we can expect to see a lot more records patterned explicitly on <i>The Adventures of Bobby Ray</i>. And that's a truly depressing prospect. As a primer on what major label execs think they need to do to sell a rap record to a mass audience in 2010, <i>Bobby Ray</i> is a queasily fascinating document. As an actual album, it is wretched-- a dishearteningly generic and hollow product with no soul or demographic or viewpoint that arguably bottoms out three separate times.</p>
<p>It turns out that the answer to the above question-- ""What do major labels think it takes to sell rap albums in 2010?"" -- is simple: hide the rapping. Bury it under dewy pianos and sensitive cooing; sugar-coat it with emo-pop choruses; tuck it behind compressed guitars. Basically put it anywhere listeners are least likely to notice it. This is a disturbing strategy to pursue, but it's particularly galling here; B.o.B is a fantastically gifted rapper, with an astonishing rhythmic command and a tricky, limber way with phrasing.  On <i>Bobby Ray</i> he's reduced to a guest rapper on his own songs.  Only three tracks feel even remotely connected to a rap aesthetic, and they are the best things here by a mile: ""Bet I"" finds him somersaulting joyfully around a juddering 808 kick, backed by an equally on-fire T.I. and Playboy Tre. ""Fame"" flips a sample of Canadian cheese rockers April Wine into a surprisingly funky horn loop, and ""5th Dimension"", despite a ludicrous yowled hook from Lenny Kravitz stand-in Rico Barrino that bites ""Inner City Blues"" and regrettable space-rock guitars, features some of B.o.B's most vivid rapping.</p>
<p>The bulk of the record, though, is a undifferentiated mass of sticky-sweet modern-rock radio in which it's difficult to single out the lowest moment. Is it the air-conditioned sub-Coldplay crooning of Bruno Mars on ""Nothin On You""? Bobby Ray's inexplicable decision to turn Vampire Weekend's ""The Kids Don't Stand a Chance"" into a Sublime song? Or the appearance by Weezer's Rivers Cuomo, whose creepily blank vocals on ""Magic"" sound like the engineer has a gun to his head?  B.o.B himself struggles to inject personality into the proceedings. In the lyrics to ""Airplanes"", a moody teen-pop melodrama with a chorus by Paramore's Hayley Williams, Bobby Ray pines, just like he did on ""Fuck You"", for simpler times. ""Somebody take me back to the days/ Before this was a job, before I got paid,"" he asks, remembering, ""back before I tried to cover up my slang."" It's a brief acknowledgment of what he has had to give up to get here.  <i>The Adventures of Bobby Ray</i> is a curiously lonely affair, the sound of a singular talent being drowned in a tidal wave of cheerful banality.</p></div>"|14242.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14242-the-adventures-of-bobby-ray/|4.2|Jayson Greene

In the last three years alone, they've released six full-lengths and a hailstorm of EPs, all of it under a maddening, search-engine confounding array of name spellings.  From the OCS to the OhSees to Thee Oh Sees, John Dwyer-- the madman behind this unreasonably prolific project-- has molted band names like some rare endangered bird determined to shake off pursuers. This is catch-me-if-you-can behavior, the maneuvering of someone determined to keep things small and weird.</p>
<p>It is also a very San Francisco-psych-band thing to do. Fellow Frisco garage-rock nerds Fresh &amp; Onlys and Sic Alps operate at a similarly blinding pace, churning out a blizzard of new music that hits the same sweet spot over and over with single-minded fervor. For their followers, of course, there can never be enough; retro garage rock is a joyful hobbit hole unto itself, a cult that attracts new followers every year. For the unconverted, though, trying to pick through the pile of releases to determine what separates one from the next can be taxing. The result is a tight-knit community of musicians and fans hiding in plain sight, and one has to presume they like it that way.</p>
<p>On the surface, the latest Oh Sees dispatch is only minutely distinguishable from 2009's <i>Help--</i> or, for that matter, 2009's <i>Dog Poison</i>. But, like all musical niches, spend enough time there and the shades of gray start to separate into a color spectrum. Thee Oh Sees have always been a little weirder than most of their peers; one gets the sense, from their warped production and high, childlike vocals, that both the recording equipment and the members have spent a little too much time in the sun. The title track, which opens the record, bursts out of the gate with three minutes of straightforward garage before downshifting into an extended, one-note bass vamp that throbs in place for seven straight minutes. It's an appropriate way into the record: if you can hang with us through this, they seem to say, you're cool for the rest of the ride.</p>
<p>The rest of <i>Warm Slime</i> immediately opens up into the bite-size garage-pop they're more known for. ""I Was Denied"" and ""Castiatic Tackle"", in particular, are wild-eyed, hard-driving rockers. But that thick, muddy soup of sound surfaces repeatedly: first in the flat-horizon stomp of ""Everything Went Black"" and again in ""Flash Bats"", which is mired in so much goop that the song buried miles beneath it feels implied. Even for a committedly lo-fi aesthetic, <i>Warm Slime</i> is rough going at times; listening to it back-to-back with the relatively cleaner <i>Help</i> is startling, like blasting a bug-spattered windshield with a jet of wiper fluid. If <i>Warm Slime</i> is one of their least ingratiating records this far, Dwyer and his cohorts surely don't care overmuch; besides, there is almost certainly another Oh Sees full-length being wrapped up as I finish typing this sentence.</p></div>"|14226.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14226-warm-slime/|6.9|Jayson Greene

During this later period, T. (real name Thomas Koch) seemed like the mainstay producer with the shortest shelf life, clinging on through the minimal era, but never quite recovering from the passing of Metro Area-style electro-disco fetishism and Chicago House revivalism, from which his earliest and finest records cribbed so heavily.</p>
<p>But if DJ T.'s contribution to the gargantuan Fabric series is a bit (well, a lot) tardy, it also suggests that even a stopped clock will eventually be on time again. Now that so few people know or care what's next in European house, Koch finds himself on a relatively even playing field, and he capitalizes in part by returning to his roots and in part by venturing further afield. Most of <i>Fabric 51</i> rides the sort of loose, low-slung disco grooves that typified seven-year-old Koch tracks like ""Philly"" and ""Freemind"". But where once there was a serious, good-drugs air of lush expansiveness, Koch's new mix is dominated by quirky, weird-drugs arrangements with quirkier vocals. The record's idiosyncratic lurch from idea to discombobulated idea recalls contemporary German house's canon of perverse iconoclasts-- DJ Koze, Matias Aguayo, dOP.</p>
<p>In truth, Koch has always leant harder to the left in his official mixes than his own productions or typical DJ sets would suggest; <i>Fabric 51</i> mostly builds on the oddball muse he chased on 2006's <i>Body Language Vol. 2</i> and 2007's <i>Monza.Club.Ibiza Compilation.Vol.2.</i>, both of which included woozy Koze productions. And it's Koze in particular, with his unfussy, even messily disorienting layered grooves, who looms large over this mix, though Koch unleashes him only at the end with the airsick drones, stutters, and eerie harmonized vocals of his remix of WhoMadeWho's ""Keep Me in My Plane"". It's a predictable highlight, but otherwise most of the time all those slightly unhinged percussion assemblages and ostentatiously disruptive vocals serve only to underscore the power of the more straight-ahead moments: the sly, jazz-inflected African house of Madioko 'N' Rafika's ""Ellelli (Kalabrese Remix)"" or the classic U.S. deep house of DJ Le Roi's ""I Get Deep"" with its hypnotic preacher man monologue from Roland Clark.</p>
<p>Which is not to say that T. missed a trick by going so quirky so hard and so often. More precisely, the issue is that ultimately Koch's got a crowdpleaser's ear, and his selections yearn toward a gregarious tunefulness even when playing at being difficult. Even Aguayo's grimly rigorous mixture of South African percussion and stripped-down tuff DJ Rush-style house on ""Pata Pata"" is at root a story of two big hooks. I could wish Koch would let his obvious tendencies run free a bit more often, but when they arrive the pay-offs are big enough to compensate for their brevity, as the delirious, bittersweet bleepy disco of Crazy P's remix of DJ Mujava's ""Township Funk"" demonstrates. It does sound an awful lot like an old DJ T. classic in fact, but even with all the cosmopolitan hijinks crammed onto <i>Fabric 51</i>, it's hard to imagine why you'd want it otherwise.</p></div>"|14238.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14238-fabric-51/|7.0|Tim Finney

One of the world's biggest cult acts remains one of its most divisive. Whether it's their absurd cover art, affected vocals, one-time affiliations with too-ironic parties, or their many famous friends, something about CocoRosie causes grudges to be held. To be honest, I wish I could let that baggage get me worked up about <i>Grey Oceans</i>-- music is most fun when it inspires strong feelings.<i> </i>Instead,<i> </i>CocoRosie's least abrasive record to date merely  disappoints softly.</p>
<p>From the moment you enter <i>Grey Oceans</i>, CocoRosie make clear that you're on their<i> </i>time and in their universe. But while song titles like ""R.I.P. Burn Face"" and ""Fairy Paradise"" suggest they still have a sense of humor about what they're bringing to the party, the Casady sisters seem more grounded here. This record sands off some of their pricklier affectations-- the half-raps and genre exercises are gone, and so is most of their provocative lyricism.</p>
<p>Some highlights: Opener ""Trinity's Crying"" patiently works through warped synth and harp to create a sort of Matrix-y new age tenor. There's a nice contrast between the vaudeville hook of ""Hopscotch"" and its jungle-esque rhythm, and once ""Lemonade"" stops dragging ass, it builds to a satisfying horn section. But in spite of these sounds, too much of <i>Grey Oceans</i> is as murky and impenetrable as its title. Eventually, it becomes bogged down in the same kind of downtempo, piano-and-effects balladry as all those old Poe and Dot Allison CDs littering discount used bins.</p>
<p>But when you get down to brass tacks, it's the vocals (particularly Bianca's) that will probably end up being the dealbreaker as long as CocoRosie make records. It's not that her voice is too alien-- Björk channeling Billie Holiday is pretty much the ballpark-- but its unorthodoxy never feels like it's in the service of expressiveness. Instead, the affectations become both the means and the end, and whatever beauty could be wrangled from the plodding piano pieces or resonance you might get out of lyrics like, ""I'm afraid of sharks but not of the dark,"" are ruined by the fact that they sound like they're curdling in her mouth.</p>
<p>I understand why CocoRosie have engendered the admiration of their peers: Even with their success, they're still operating on the fringe, and while <i>Grey</i><i> Oceans</i><i> </i>is less caustic than their other work, it still has that lay-it-all-on-the-line quality that's worked for Antony Hegarty, Devendra Banhart, and Joanna Newsom. The difference is that the album never feels like anything's at stake, whereas past records embraced experimentation at any cost. If anything, the Casadys invert the purpose of folk music by coming at it from a place of indulgence rather than sharing. Then again, the majority of CocoRosie's praise stems from them ""being themselves,"" so it's no surprise that even at their most user-friendly, they don't sound like an act that has much use for an audience.</p></div>"|14217.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14217-grey-oceans/|5.1|Ian Cohen

At the time it seemed like a stylistic sidetrack-- not only did Phosphorescent mastermind Matthew Houck dig more deeply into traditional country music than ever before, a few of his interpretations also evinced far more playfulness and fun than any of his original offerings. Surely, the next proper Phosphorescent effort would find Houck returning to the forlorn wilderness folk he'd howled out on his first three albums though, right?</p>
<p>Not so fast: <i>To Willie</i> turned out to be more harbinger than lark. Phosphorescent's latest record, <i>Here's to Taking It Easy</i>-- with a full recording band in tow-- is by far the most conventional music he's ever made. Luckily, Houck and his cohorts compensate for a dip in idiosyncrasy by inhabiting the tropes of beer-soaked, sun-baked country-rock with fullness, commitment, and chops, all while finding enough room for Phosphorescent's trademark ragged lonesomeness.</p>
<p>The opening ""It's Hard to Be Humble (When You're From Alabama)"" announces its shit-kicking intentions with hot guitar licks and blaring horn charts; it may be the first Phosphorescent song more impressive for what the music's doing than for what Houck's singing or how he's singing it, but it ain't the last. ""I Don't Care If There's Cursing"" is lyrically monotonous but boasts a vibrant bassline and sterling pedal steel while ""We'll Be Here Soon"" expertly recreates the feel of a late-night Mexican cantina (proving Houck's internalized Nelson exceedingly well). Then there's the closing ""Los Angeles"", which offers up a faithful facsimile (maybe a little too faithful) of Neil Young's bruised guitar heroics.</p>
<p>Speaking of L.A., it plays a substantial role in the album's lyrics, which chiefly concern the strain placed on relationships by life on the road. Perhaps the touring-man blues of ""Tell Me Baby (Have You Had Enough)"" feel a bit shopworn, but Houck proves himself capable of redeeming the tropes with a line like, ""I wish those nights of pleasure and days of pain weren't so tightly bound,"" (from ""Heaven, Sittin' Down""). And that's nothing next to the staggering, heart-crushing ""The Mermaid Parade"", the record's runaway best song, which finds Houck's narrator wandering around Coney Island to shake his mind off of a broken marriage, finally sputtering out with gut-piercing specificty, ""Goddamn it, Amanda, goddamn it all.""</p>
<p>All that said, there's no need to fret that quavering nature boy Houck's been lost entirely beneath all the musical carousing and Angeleno smog, not when the album also contains the spectral, gospel-haunted ""Nothing Was Stolen (Love Me Foolishly)"" and the evanescent, elliptical ""Hej, Me I'm Light"". <i>Here's to Taking It Easy</i> is a great record, but I feel like Houck's best is still in him-- the one where the deep roots of tradition will finally be inextricably fused with his own weird, shambling soul.</p></div>"|14220.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14220-heres-to-taking-it-easy/|8.2|Joshua Love

It's at once a serious endeavor and a musical lark: Avoiding practice spaces and loud clubs, the group existed mainly in the members' Portland homes, rehearsing in kitchens and living rooms. They eventually signed with North Carolina-based indie Sugar Hill, which makes them labelmates with likeminded artists Nickel Creek and the Duhks. The liners for their debut, <i>Feast of the Hunter's Moon</i>, create a comic mythology about the fictional town of Black Prairie and its annual Music Festival, where the legend goes that each of the band members have fared spectacularly poorly. And yet, despite their humor and the hominess of the band's origins, Black Prairie practices a particularly expansive Americana, synthesizing a range of styles and sounds into an erudite whole.</p>
<p>This is not the first Decemberists splinter group. In 2007, guitar player Chris Funk and friends released an album of frontporch jam sessions as Flash Hawk Parlor Ensemble, a cheery group that grafted idyllic folk to spacey Moog synths. Full of oddball melodic curlicues and android blips and beeps, that band's lone album, <i>Plastic Bag in a Tree,</i> sounded like a fan-made <i>Firefly </i>soundtrack. By contrast, Black Prairie is grounded and earthy, confined to terrestrial flatlands instead of unmoored in the cosmos. Doc Watson, John Fahey, and old Rounder Records comps are all influences here, but so are Yo-Yo Ma, the Klezmatics, and Argentine tango composer Astor Piazzolla, who is referenced in the lively runs of ""Ostinato del Caminito"". And yet, it all sounds like Americana, which is, <i>Feast </i>suggests, the sum of its immigrant parts.</p>
<p>Although these songs are well composed and proficiently performed, ultimately their pleasures prove mostly academic, as if each song bears its own thesis and argument. Especially compared to Flash Hawk Parlor Ensemble, the music is studiously sober, with the painted-on prairie ambience of a T-Bone Burnett soundtrack. ""Across the Black Prairie"" and ""Atrocity at Celilo Falls"" sound ominous but lack grit and immediacy; ""Back Alley"" and ""Tango Oscuro"" are spry but lack spirit. Oddly, the best moments on the album come with vocals: Annalisa Tornfelt's gravely lovely performance lends the traditional ballad ""Red Rocking Chair"" its understated threat, while her echoing vocals on closer ""The Blackest Crow"" sounds both shoegazer and barefoot. That song is actually the most intriguing synthesis on <i>Feast</i>, but Black Prairie never build on it. They may have some intriguing ideas about what constitutes Americana, but this album seems both overthought and underdeveloped-- the product of living rooms rather than real prairies.</p></div>"|14232.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14232-feast-of-the-hunters-moon/|5.4|Stephen M.

So far, most of their recorded energy has been focused on keeping things off-center, psych-driven, and plenty heady. So it was surprising to hear ""Oceans"", the first track off their latest full-length <i>Totaled</i>, get a lift from an ample dose of groove. The song hinted that, instead of another hour of deranged séances, we might be in store for an hour of deranged séances with song-oriented post-punk interpretations thrown in. And it's partly true true: Indian Jewelry have updated their patented weirdness to embrace a more approachable look, one that even borders on catchy.</p>
<p><i>Totaled</i>, much as its title suggests, works best when the band takes abstracted elements from other genres, burn them to the ground, and try to summon something from the ashes. The genre destruction is a neat technique that marks most of the album's first half, though usually expressed in subtle ways. Early tracks ""Look Alive"" and ""Lapis Lazuli"" contain the same draggy, drugged-out elements that popped up on the band's previous LP <i>Free Gold!</i> and reinforce the sound with bleak doses of darkwave and an obvious appreciation for Bauhaus. But the tracks that wade into new territory are the ones that work the best. ""Excessive Moonlight"" has an uncomfortably dark R&amp;B feel, ""Tono Bungay"" is a dry psych slow-burner, and ""Vison"" boasts new wavey synths. Here Indian Jewelry draw energy from song forms instead of simply reveling in their strangeness for the sake of the freak-out.</p>
<p>But <i>Totaled</i>'s second act negates the progress made on the material that precedes it. Though they have a way with haunting soundscapes and spiky textures, the heavily processed drone and wandering noise cycles become tedious, rendered even flatter with the same collapsed, burnt-out vocal intonations, as the tracks just sit there, woefully light on contrast. The back half feels short on ideas and long on time, even if it's easy enough to get lost in gauzy layers. On the whole, though, <i>Totaled</i>'s pace and moods even out well enough, even if a full-blown left turn from the band's familiar sound would have really hit the spot.</p></div>"|14193.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14193-totaled/|5.8|Zach Kelly

His songs tend to be concise, and intimately arranged for single instruments or small chamber ensembles. He favors cerebral repetitions, sentimental motifs, light electronics. And there's a good chance he releases music on London's Erased Tapes imprint, home to Peter Broderick, Ólafur Arnalds, and Nils Frahm, a Berlin-based composer in his late-twenties, whose new album, <i>The Bells</i>, was improvised on piano in a cavernous Berlin church.</p>
<p>It's no wonder that the language of 20th century art music still speaks to young composers. Its blend of austerity and immediacy positions it for crossover success between classical and pop. And it feels modern: Its hypnotic patterns resonate with electronic music, as its use of common materials to express personal verities does with indie rock. Technique is a prerequisite, but style is paramount. Frahm answers Broderick's playfulness and Arnalds' solemnity with a rather astringent point of view. Whether meandering like Satie or needling like Glass, his impressive playing can't save <i>The Bells </i>from feeling stuffy and vague, outside a few standout pieces. It is often pretty, but for minimal piano music, this is low-hanging fruit.</p>
<p><i>The Bells</i> was originally released on Kning Disk, as part of the Broderick-curated Piano Solo series. Broderick gave Frahm cues to guide his playing. ""Make a song that you could imagine me rapping over the top of"" produced ""My Things"", a stubborn vamp with loud, spiky smash-ups evocative of John Adams' ""Hallelujah Junction"". It's one of the more rewarding songs here, although it can be a bit much. The same is true of ""Said and Done"", which would be great if Frahm's stinging one-note figure didn't run roughshod over the fluid melody. He avoids the fatal flaw of overstated understatement on the lovely ""Over There, It's Raining"", a lulling tune along the lines of Eluvium's ""Radio Ballet"". But often, Frahm could use a little more <i>mezzo </i>in his <i>forte</i>.</p>
<p>Some of Broderick's help was less productive: It's neat that he was actually prone on the strings for ""Peter Is Dead in the Piano"", but the music is muffled and lugubrious. The icy twinkles of ""Dedication, Loyalty"" evoke a million similiar songs, and the snowy noodling of ""It Was Really, Really Grey"" has a nastily biting climax that seems almost spiteful. The bottom line is that <i>The Bells</i> tends to be either tedious and pretty or interesting and caustic; it often feels unpleasantly satisfied with itself.</p></div>"|14227.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14227-the-bells/|4.8|Brian Howe

It's fantastical tough-guy gibberish worthy of Bo Diddley, and it's the sort of line that only an extremely confident singer would ever attempt, let alone pull off. It reveals the Dead Weather to be just another White vehicle-- the one that plays host to his most deranged impulses.</p>
<p>On last year's Dead Weather debut <i>Horehound</i>, White largely ceded frontperson duties to Kills singer Alison Mosshart. But on <i>Sea of Cowards</i>, the two split lead-vocal duties almost completely down the middle, with White unleashing his full range of vocal tics: yelps, mumbles, arch sneers, growls, screeches, groans. Mosshart mirrors every one of those inflections, to the point where it's not always immediately apparent which one is singing. When Mosshart's howling full-bore, her bottomless blues wail could pass for PJ Harvey's. But even more than on <i>Horehound</i>, Mosshart stays within White's freaked-out range, each singer firing off one outrageous non sequitur after another. Together, they sound like two feral cats circling each other outside a dumpster, trying to figure out whether to fuck or fight.</p>
<p>For two people capable of writing gloriously catchy rock choruses in their sleep, White and Mosshart sure stay away from them here. There are barely any choruses on <i>Sea of Cowards</i>, but that's not to say there are no hooks: the catchiness is all in the thud and flail of the band. This is some serious locked-in rock-dude shit: discordant guitar leads, fuzzed-out organ blurts, clattering falling-down-stairs drum fills. It's unhinged classic-rock explosiveness that sounds like it could be the result of a few vicious jam sessions-- the rumblings of scuzz-rock lifers given a chance to air out all their purest expressions of fuck-you-up ire. And when a chorus does emerge from the swampy ether, as on the ferocious first single ""Die By the Drop"", it cuts deep.</p>
<p>Little details jump out. The backfiring keyboard on ""The Difference Between Us"" sounds like nothing so much as the Faint, circa <i>Blank-Wave Arcade</i>-- electro-rocking harder than most actual rock. The two guitar leads on ""I Can't Hear You"" sound like they're in the middle of a fiery lovers' argument, one staying maddeningly calm and steady while the other bleats and rages. White and Mosshart are old-style rock stars, the types who don't feel like they have to explain everything to you, or share it with you. And even if <i>Sea of Cowards </i>sounds more bashed-out than labored-over, it works. It's a heavy, snarly, physical rock album, and it feels like the work of people so secure in their ass-kicking abilities that they don't have to sweat the details.</p></div>"|14237.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14237-sea-of-cowards/|7.8|Tom Breihan

I once watched the burly, verbose indie-rapper end a show by kneeling and touching his DJ's turntables while the DJ chopped up Martin Luther King's ""I have a dream"" speech with the Hendrix version of ""The Star-Spangled Banner"". And he brings that same tendency toward ridiculously broad gestures in his lyrics, which bounce back and forth between leftist fervor and self-lacerating slam-poetry. So it's something of a pleasant shock to hear Sage begin <i>Li(f)e</i> with ""Little Houdini"" a straightforward story-song about a (real-life) car thief who keeps breaking out of prison to visit dying relatives. It'd be easy to lean hard on any sweeping truths about the human condition in that story, but Sage keeps things simple and straightforward, sticking to the narrative and showing an eye for detail and a sense of empathy. ""This ain't no country-western song,"" he snarls a few times, and it's to his credit that he's sort of wrong.</p>
<p>The big news about <i>Li(f)e</i> is that it's Sage's indie rock move. Rather than sticking with old collaborators like Jel and Alias, he's recruited a backing band that consists largely of members of the post-roots-rock crew Califone. Various indie-rock big dogs write the music for a song or two: Chris Walla, Jason Lytle, the late Mark Linkous. The inevitable Califone/Calexico crossover finally happens here, with the latter's Joey Burns and John Convertino supplying the music for ""Slow Man"". These guys fortunately don't attempt to come up with some sort of warped dustbowl take on rap; instead, they just vamp away, confident that Sage will catch whatever groove they work up. And Sage sounds pretty good on this stuff, his husky, authoritative growl taking on the sort of gravelly weariness that suggests he's got a few Tom Waits CDs scattered around his tour-van floor.</p>
<p>It's not a seamless move (the choruses tend toward all-consuming clumsiness), but it's a sincere one-- and it underscores how l
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
ittle Sage has to do with rap these days. In the past, Sage has taken time out to blast any and all forms of mainstream rap he can find, even shoehorning an anti-Jay-Z fusillade (over ""99 Problems"", no less) into that same live show. Here, he seems past that, barely even referencing rap and straying away from traditional rap cadence and even further toward the spoken-word stuff that he also does. If there's any precedent for this sort of musical move-- rap as impressionist Americana-- it's Sage's sometime Anticon-affiliate buddy Buck 65, a man Sage once publicly bashed for the crime of distancing himself from rap. Times done changed.</p>
<p>If every track on the album had the unforced lyrical clarity of ""Little Houdini"", Sage could have the album of his life on his hands here. But Sage is still the type of guy to name an album <i>Li(f)e</i> and a song ""Polterzeitgeist"", and the album comes packed with <i>yeesh</i>-inducing lines. (""I heard God is coming and she's a screamer"", ""That Wall of China ain't so great; I built a bridge over a hymen."") Like that hands-on-a-turntable scene, it's all a bit <i>much</i>. If Sage has a unifying concept here, it's organized religion and the difficulty of breaking away from it. But for rather than simply stating his case, his arguments too often devolve into word soup.</p>
<p>Sage breaks away from those riddles once more on the album, and the result might just be the best song he's ever written. The album ends with ""The Best of Times"", a pained memoir, Sage talking calmly and revealingly about his history as a loser kid, reeling off embarrassing anecdotes with tough candor. The music, from the French composer Yann Tiersen, is a gorgeous vibraphone-based twinkle that builds slowly and confidently, no guitars showing up for nearly three minutes. Over a track as gorgeous as that, Sage lets loose with some deeply cringey thoughts: ""Considered doing something that would cripple me/ I wanted a wheelchair, I wanted the sympathy."" It's the sort of song that forces you to root for the guy, no matter how much grim hectoring you've seen him do.</p></div>"|14225.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14225-life/|6.3|Tom Breihan

But as former Beta Band frontman Steve Mason would tell you, the weight of critical scrutiny has been crippling young bands' careers long before the mp3 blog was invented. Few artists have been as forthcoming about their failure to meet expectations as Mason, whether contemplating commercial suicide (see: his infamous designation of the Beta Band's 1999 self-titled debut as ""fucking awful"") or actual suicide (stemming from a bout of depression that saw him mysteriously disappear for two weeks in 2006). But his first album under his own name-- following a series of releases under the King Biscuit Time alias-- hardly sounds like the work of a publicity-shy contrarian. In both its lyrical candour and soft-rock accessibility, <i>Boys Outside</i> sees Mason ready to meet the public again, and in some cases, actually cater to it.</p>
<p>Despite production from Richard X, the electronic accents on <i>Boys Outside</i> are no more pronounced than they were on previous Beta Band flirtations like ""Squares""; rather, <i>Boys Outside</i> sounds like the sort of mechanized folk-rock the Beta Band might've produced in 1999 had they reined in the sound-collage sprawl and more actively courted the maturing Britpop fanbase that was gravitating toward the likes of Travis and Coldplay. Which is not to suggest <i>Boys Outside</i> is some calculated commercial cop-out; Mason's unwaveringly dazed and confused voice naturally distinguishes him from the Chris Martinized chest-beaters of the world. And where the acoustic groover ""Am I Just a Man"" at first sounds like the most conventionally styled pop song Mason has penned, the existential crises expressed within aren't the stuff of stadium-crowd sing-alongs.</p>
<p>But then, as ""The Letter"" illustrates, shooting for the back rows isn't Mason's strong suit anyway, as his voice is easily overwhelmed by the song's melodramatic orchestration. Mason finds greater success in more spartan settings, where he can better define the songs' emotional cues, be it dizzying disorientation (the Beta-worthy ""Lost &amp; Found"") or morning-after redemption (""All Come Down""). And on the title track-- a gently ascendant, piano-ballad dispatch from Mason's darkest hour-- his beautifully dignified performance provides just the right amount of therapeutic release without tipping the song into over-sentimentalism. The Steve Mason of 1999 might've been horrified to imagine his future self as a sensitive, soft-pop crooner, but the Steve Mason of today can throw a familiar line right back at him: This is the definition of my life.</p></div>"|14231.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14231-boys-outside/|7.0|Stuart Berman

And Marcel Dettmann is to Berghain as Larry Levan was to the Garage: its most dynamic, talented, and idiosyncratic star.  As a DJ, Dettmann is known for lengthy sets of lean, muscular techno, spanning the genre's entire history. Tapping into all of techno's permutations-- whether it is minimal or Detroit or dub-- his mixes may at first appear too mechanical and impenetrable. But his ability to blend nearly identical tracks with subtle variations provides a distinct arc, one that exhibits tremendous technical skill and an impressive knowledge of techno's history.</p>
<p><i>Dettmann</i>, his first full-length, works in similar ways. Though the album is bookended by ""Quasi"" and ""Taris""-- interchangeable, nearly beatless ambient tracks-- the transition between the introduction and ""Argon"", the album's second track, is jarring. The latter is an aggressively percussive and discordant piece of experimental techno-- three quickly sequenced low-frequency drum kicks are followed by a succession of brisk metallic clicks and jumbled claps with almost zero variation. The only noticeable shift occurs when the overall sound expands in a brief interval, working from its claustrophobic template into an airier, echo-conducive setting. Just as the track itself suggests spatial growth, the album follows suit: With each subsequent piece, Dettmann adds a little flourish-- an extra rhythm or synth-- to make the album progressively fleshier, moister, and wider.</p>
<p>Fans of more buzzed-about techno artists like Ricardo Villalobos and Omar-S will find less to clasp onto here-- even in its dubbier second half, Dettmann has neither Villalobos' sweltering polyrhythmic arrangements nor Omar's feminine house fripperies. But what it does have is a slowly revealing depth: Despite its ostensible rigidity, each track blossoms in unexpected ways. Concordantly, the album materializes in much the same way the individual songs do. A skeletal template of kick drum, hi-hat, and laser pings in the beginning of early track ""Screen"" is gradually bathed in the burbling clangs of what sounds like a steel marimba. By the time penultimate track ""Viscous"" rolls around, a muffled tuba oompa loompas over a hard, pounding bass drum while hiss and static fizzle all around it. Once the outro plays, the album's circularity is clearer.</p>
<p>Though <i>Dettmann</i>'s menacing and industrial first half doesn't quite strike as immediately as its spacious and immersive second, an argument could be made that its richness lies in the payoff received by patiently sitting with it over time. But I sit here wondering if, were any of these tracks playing in a club, would I actually get up and dance to it? Would I sit on the sides looking on? Just asking these questions indicates the album's slight shortcoming: That in trying to grab both mind and body, it manages to just barely miss both.</p></div>"|14213.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14213-dettmann/|7.4|Tal Rosenberg

It's even more surprising considering that bassist Mike Yaniro was was hospitalized for injuries from a vicious mugging right before its release. That 12"" sat on the fringe of blown-out hardcore punk where one dropped beat could mean descending into free noise, and is almost more terrifying for being given a steady pulse. <i>Seedbed</i> isn't a clean-up job or a breakthrough, but it's an even more focused version of the band's grim and grimy hardcore, grinding it out at mid-tempo with an almost untenable level of dread.</p>
<p>When they push the boundaries on fidelity, it's not to sound indistinct or distancing or evoke some lost feeling of nostalgia-- it's to sound more dangerous. Yet their sound isn't tough-guy posturing; as one follows the rhythm section, sludgy and distorted as they may be, the album's internal logic starts to dawn on you-- the basslines of tracks like ""Child Republic"" and ""Drainage City"" are as sleek and hypnotic as they are bruising.</p>
<p>The languid low-end and guitar squeals of tracks like ""Business Class"" or ""Pope's Nose"", not to mention the tortured vocals, are probably what have earned the band a few comparisons to Pissed Jeans, though the content on <i>Seedbed</i> seems less winking and more wallowing-- a sample lyric from ""Pope's Nose"" is ""You're not the thing that your mother wanted"" repeated ad infinitum. But while there's not much of a ring of hope in the band's perspective, there's still a clarity: while the bass is muffled and there's a noise like ball-peen hammers on sheet metal pushing the beat on ""Missing Persons"", everything the vocalist is shouting is clear (""You might as well/ Every night/ Feel ashamed/ And waste away... choices made""). Twin Stumps are ringing the same sorts of alarm bells: against complacency, against boredom, against not trying-- and the artful pummeling of ""Missing Persons"" or the claustrophobic buildup of tracks like ""Caged Emily"" prove they belong in that conversation.</p>
<p>Just as striking as those standouts are the very brief moments of respite, like the sound-collage-like ""Pigs at the Trough"", gurgling and ominous like hearing like a city being destroyed while hiding in a basement. Even if it only lasts a moment, comparatively, it shows where there's room for a more dynamic approach. When they get a firmer hold on that, Twin Stumps might get truly terrifying.</p></div>"|14208.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14208-seedbed/|7.4|Jason Crock

They're boilerplate indie, free of hot new genre tags or feature-ready backstories, which is something their detractors derive great joy from pointing out. If the National are important, rather than merely good, it's for writing about the type of lived-in moments that rock bands usually don't write about that well.  The characters in National songs have real jobs, have uninteresting sex, get drunk, and lie to one another.  They do so during the regular course of a workaday week, on Tuesdays and Wednesdays.  The National aren't ""dad-rock"" so much as ""men's magazine rock"": music chiefly interested in the complications of being a stable person expected to own certain things and dress certain ways.</p>
<p>On the National's fifth album, <i>High Violet</i>, those constraints are starting to wear on them, which makes a lot of sense: they wear on most people. In between patches of obtuse imagery, singer Matt Berninger sounds increasingly self-destructive. The record's upbeat numbers don't cheer him up so much as commiserate with him.  All of this makes <i>High Violet</i> a dark affair, even for a band with a reputation for sad-bastard melodrama. The National have never sounded triumphant, but they can still be reassuring, with Berninger's lyrics acting as salves for our own neuroses.  Six drinks in, tired of your coworkers, wishing you could just go home and laugh at sitcoms with someone?  Maybe get laid?  The National's got your back.</p>
<p>With an ever rising profile and plenty of indie-famous friends-- Sufjan Stevens and Bon Iver's Justin Vernon guest here-- the National were afforded the opportunity to obsess over <i>High Violet</i>.  They could've holed up and recorded an idiosyncratic, expectation-defying mess. Instead they produced an ornate, fussed-over record that sounds like no one other than themselves.  Given the amount of flack they take for being a no-frills bore, simply refining their sound was arguably the braver option. They miss, occasionally-- the string-drenched closer, ""Vanderlyle Crybaby Geeks"", is too decadent for its own good-- but mostly, they construct gorgeous, structurally sound vignettes. There are few bands that could craft a song like ""Sorrow""-- in which emotion acts as a character and the band turns Berninger's balladry into a well paced jog-- without stumbling over their own ambitions.  The guitars on ""Afraid of Everyone"" actually sound nervous; ""England"" speaks of cathedrals over properly magisterial drums. These are triumphs of form.</p>
<p>Berninger is still, for the most part, a socially obsessed claustrophobe.  He has upper-class guilt on ""Lemonworld"" (""Cousins and cousins somewhere overseas/ But it'll take a better war to kill a college man like me,"" ""This pricey stuff makes me dizzy"").  ""Bloodbuzz Ohio""'s magnificent chorus (""I still owe money/ To the money/ To the money I owe"") addresses the familiar, harrowing financial burdens of adulthood.  He's best when he tones down the angst in favor of reflection or confusion. <i>High Violet </i>seems less likely to engender the personal connections of <i>Boxer</i>, but it's also bigger and more engaging-- a possibly offputting combination for a band following the footsteps of Echo and the Bunnymen, Wilco, and Arcade Fire. After all, eagerness often trumps execution, and the National aren't immune: For his part, Berninger looks increasingly like Dos Equis' Most Interesting Man in the World, and his  cryptic lyrics seem like an application for the title.</p>
<p>But the National rarely miss; when they aim for powerful or poetic, they get there. <i>High Violet</i> is the sound of a band taking a mandate to be a meaningful rock band seriously, and they play the part so fully that, to some, it may be off-putting. But these aren't mawkish, empty gestures; they're anxious, personal songs projected onto wide screens. Even if you don't consider yourself an upwardly mobile stiff with minor social anxiety, the National make it sound grand, confusing, and relatable.</p></div>"|14203.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14203-high-violet/|8.7|Andrew Gaerig

Thanks to the valiant efforts of folks like Animal Collective and <i>Arthur</i> magazine, your average Brooklynite is starting to wonder why they ever hated the Dead in the first place. Truth be told, there's a lot to be learned from the Dead, and plenty of bands on both coasts seem to be taking notes. There's a re-emphasis on the live experience, on finding the psychedelic space within compositions, on not fearing the improv, on passing around music in cassette form. It's as refreshing as a 1967 Morning Dew.</p>
<p>Woods sound very little like the Dead; few of these bands actually do. But there's something of Garcia and co. in their DNA, most markedly in the free-form excursions of their live set, where the four-piece weaves through compelling improvisational passages. But the Grateful Dead made albums too, and the country-inflected indie pop that fills <i>At Echo Lake</i>, their fifth full-length and possibly their best, is a worthy heir as well. Loose, shuffling, and tuneful, the abridged Woods experience sounds more like <i>Wowee Zowee</i> than <i>Workingman's Dead</i>, but it hits just the right contradictory note of tight arrangements and breathing-room playing to get that back-porch, weird America vibe.</p>
<p>Where previous records got distracted with lo-fi detours or lengthy workouts that didn't translate from the stage to tape, <i>At Echo Lake</i> is far more concise. Made up exclusively from the soft landing points that punctuate their longer live jams, it's a brisk listen, even down to its half-hour runtime. Only the brief near-instrumental ""From the Horn"", which sounds excised from a longer jam session, hints at the group's more exploratory and dangerous side. The rest is a sunset daydream flickering by with songs, often acoustic-based, rarely lasting longer than it takes to plant a melody in your head. The endearing nasality of Jeremy Earl's voice is sloughed off by a distorted effect on all lead and backing vocals, making the record sound like a patchy signal from a distant ham radio.</p>
<p>Successful as <i>At Echo Lake</i> may be, Woods are still more interesting live than on record-- a photo-negative of 99% of indie rock bands these days, who mostly remain content to jukebox their catalog on shuffle night after night. Adding a couple of extended jams might help make a Woods record a more accurate souvenir of the live experience, but is that really necessary? Perhaps the most important lesson to be learned from the Grateful Dead is that the show and the album can be discrete experiences, feeding each other, but not overlapping.</p></div>"|14224.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14224-at-echo-lake/|8.0|Rob Mitchum

But now with <i>Where Did the Night Fall</i> hitting stores in the year 2010, there has been an UNKLE LP released in three consecutive decades-- it's going to be more of a surprise when James Lavelle <i>stops </i>making music.</p>
<p>While the resiliency of the UNKLE project is admirable, it was still a bummer that the artistic adventurousness of Lavelle had previously moved in lockstep with the ever-declining stakes. Granted, DJ Shadow may have taken whatever hip-hop influence/cred the project had with him before the turn of the century, but by 2008's quasi-soundtrack <i>End Titles</i>, Lavelle appeared to resign himself to a mishmash of soupy guitar instrumentals and charmless, cavernous Brit-rock.  <i> </i></p>
<p>But whether it's having their most solidified core in years (Lavelle is joined by Pablo Clements and touring bassist James Griffith of Big in Japan), <i>Night </i>is not only the strongest UNKLE album since <i>Psyence Fiction</i>, but also the first where a premium was placed on cohesion. The cover art is still a good indication of what hues Lavelle likes to work in-- silvery guitar lines, drums cloaked with shadowy reverb-- but UNKLE reinvent themselves as a workmanlike, electronically informed rock band favoring metronomic grooves. At the outset, UNKLE work surprisingly well hooking their jumper cables to psych rockers like Sleepy Sun and Black Angels and churning out major-key, bass-driven vigor. It's the rhythmic streamlining that ends up being the distinguishing sonic addition to <i>Night</i>, to the point where the most UNKLE-y track (""Joy Factory"", featuring L.A. shoegazers Autolux) stands as an anomaly for having something akin to a breakbeat.</p>
<p>But-- perhaps inevitable considering the rotating cast-- <i>Night </i>is ultimately hamstrung by a personality vacuum. It's easy enough to enjoy <i>Night </i>while it's playing, but even after so many listens, it's hard to <i>care </i>about it. After an auspicious beginning, an assembly line of well-manicured but lyrically undistinguished songs about mental stress and relationships fail to make themselves stand out. Celebration's Katrina Ford and Mark Lanegan have enough vocal character to predictably dominate serviceable everydudes like South's Joel Cadbury and Clayhill's Gavin Clark, but by playing entirely to type (the walloping soul number, the dustbowl blues), their contributions feel more like character acting than songs that could be compelling in a vacuum.</p>
<p>So sure, this is UNKLE going ""legit,"" making an album that feels like the word of a woodshedding, touring band that happens to have a revolving cast of talented vocalists (think a waaaaaay lower-risk, lower-reward Broken Social Scene).  But then again, as risible as some parts of <i>Psyence Fiction </i>were, would <i>When Did the Night Fall </i>be on anyone's radar if it simply came from the band responsible for <i>War Stories </i>and not, say, ""Lonely Soul""? They might strive for simple pleasures of yeoman's work, but you know, UNKLE continuing in this vein ultimately brings to mind Damon Dash's pledge to resurrect Roc-A-Fella Records: sketchy legacy or not, striving for an average future under the same banner kinda tarnishes the whole thing.</p></div>"|14223.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14223-where-did-the-night-fall/|5.9|Ian Cohen

It was a gift to himself-- creating something indulgent, sprawling, and guest-heavy. Then again, Weller has never cared what anyone else thinks about him. This is a guy who disbanded the Jam at the peak of its popularity, did the same with the Style Council, then went solo and emerged if anything even more popular than before. Heck, he even dismissed most of his band before recording <i>22 Dreams</i>, preferring a start-from-scratch approach.</p>
<p>One familiar name who returns on <i>Wake Up the Nation</i> is frequent Weller producer and collaborator Simon Dine, who reportedly first delivered several of these songs to Weller in sketchy, abstract form and thus inspired the man to dive back into work. The biggest name enlisted to flesh out this rollicking and free-ranging set, however, is My Bloody Valentine's Kevin Shields, who crops up on ""7&amp;3 Is the Strikers Names"" to help further blur the edges of the wobbly psych-rock confection. Move/ELO drummer Bev Bevan shows up on a couple of tracks-- the deliriously loose title track and opener ""Moonshine"", which finds Weller in ramshackle, rough-around-the-edges VU territory. And then there's the unlikely presence of former Jam cohort Bruce Foxton on bass, recording with Weller for the first time in nearly three decades. In fact, the propulsive low end runs of ""Fast Car/Slow Traffic"" almost seem designed to showcase Foxton and reference Weller's old sound.</p>
<p>Then again, the disc is practically teaming over with Weller's various interests and influences, past and present. ""Two Fat Ladies"" recalls the larger than life riffage of prime Who; Weller's love of soul is reflected in ""No Tears to Cry"" (Northern soul) and ""Aim High"" (blue-eyed funk). Scattered throughout are everything from free jazz flourishes and psych-freakouts like ""Find the Torch, Burn the Plans"" to introspective Dylan ditties like ""Grasp &amp; Still Connect"", and, on ""Up the Dosage"", even a bit of disco.</p>
<p>That the disc doesn't fall apart is a testament to its restless efficiency. Most tracks top off at the mid-two minute mark, and even at 16 songs <i>Wake Up the Nation</i> totals a mere 40 minutes. That's just about a half-hour shorter than <i>22 Dreams</i>, but the disc in turn is twice the fun. Artists Weller's age often falter trying to chase the past. Weller, on the other hand, simply brings his musical baggage along with him wherever he goes, unpacking or picking up new things as necessary. Whether anyone else follows him, well, that's really none of his concern, but with albums like this one it's hard not to at least sit up and take notice of Weller's creative renewal.</p></div>"|14219.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14219-wake-up-the-nation/|7.7|Joshua Klein

The Brooklyn-based psych-rockers' best work-- hypnotic sidelong compositions like ""Sheets of Easter"", or their absurd two-hour-long triple LP <i>Rated O</i>-- helped set the current standard for underground-rock-as-endurance-test, with pulsing keyboard and guitar figures that stretched out to oblivion.</p>
<p>People of the North, a long-running but rarely glimpsed side project founded by drummer Kid Millions and keyboardist Bobby Matador, holds fast to that same philosophy: If something is worth doing once, then it's worth doing a thousand times in a row. But Deep Tissue, the band's debut record, is a little bit easier to digest than Oneida's heady output. For one thing, it's more concise. With four songs running just 36 minutes, Deep Tissue can be enjoyed in its entirety without taking a mid-album bathroom break.</p>
<p>Beyond that, it's pretty much business as usual for the duo. When it comes to incessant robotic pounding, Millions could stare down most drum machines. Matador uses one hand to hold down a static organ pulse and the other to dial in the spacey psychedelic jewelry. People of the North played their first gigs in 2003, right around the time that Oneida shifted its sound from MC5-inspired riff-rock to brainwave-flattening psych. So it's not totally surprising that the two projects would draw from similar inspirations-- the eerie ambience and austerity of pre-punk bands like Suicide and Silver Apples, in particular.</p>
<p>People of the North's take on that kind of minimalism is even more severe than its big brother band's. Instrumental album opener ""Tunnels"" hums along on a single nervously pulsing chord with only the periodic squeal of feedback to break up the music's measured flow. The metered chug that drives ""Summer Leaves"" is more than a little reminiscent of an idling lawnmower. The band takes it easy on ""The Vastest Island"", but the song's B-horror-flick-worthy synths and droning vocals preserve the album's overwhelmingly paranoid mood. Millions and Matador deserve some credit for being able to bottle up that jittery energy again. They've been playing the same thing, literally, for the last seven years. But on Deep Tissue at least, it's a schtick that's worth repeating.</p></div>"|14212.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14212-deep-tissue/|7.1|Aaron Leitko

Fall figurehead Mark E. Smith seems happy to release his music on any ol' label that'll have him, whether it's A-list indies (Beggars Banquet, Rough Trade), under-the-radar imprints (Narnack, Action Records), or companies best known for issuing budget-series classic-rock concert DVDs (Eagle Rock). These shifts are emblematic of the band's own tumble along the mainstream/underground divide, creating those rips in the space-time continuum that allow the Fall to score the occasional Top 40 UK chart entry, Mark E. Smith to get gigs <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBUiPs1PxKo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">reading soccer scores on national sports telecasts</a>, or ""Hip Priest"" to become the key punchline in <a href=""http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xd2rvt_beleaguered-fall-fan_creation"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">yet another Hitler/<i>Downfall</i> video parody</a>.</p>
<p>But in a career that's defied all logic and convention, the Fall's signing to Domino makes perfect sense, given both the label's own over/underground balancing act and the fact that the Fall's influence can be felt in many of Domino's marquee acts (Franz Ferdinand and Arctic Monkeys among them). And while there's rarely been a correlation between the accessibility of a given Fall album and the profile of the label releasing it, the lean, brute-force rockers on <i>Your Future Our Clutter</i> suggest that the Fall might actually be taking this upgrade to Domino seriously.</p>
<p>The new album was recorded with the same lineup that debuted on 2008's <i>Imperial Wax Solvent</i>, but you'd never know it without close inspection of the liners-- in sharp contrast to that album's playful, sloppy sprawl (typified by the hilarious centerpiece ramble ""50 Year Old Man""), <i>Your Future Our Clutter</i> sees Smith assuming the role of military drill sergeant to unleash a more pointed offensive against The Kids. From the opening theme ""O.F.Y.C. Showcase"" onward, Smith outfits his charges with single-chord morse-code riffs and lockstep rhythms before gradually ratcheting up the intensity; by the time we hit the gonzo second act of ""Y.F.O.C./Slippy Floor"", the Fall are thrashing about like a totally wired Led Zeppelin. And whether Smith is shouting, ""Your Future! Our Clutter!"" or ""Our Future! Your Clutter!""-- as he's wont to invert them-- he sounds particularly enthused by the prospect of leaving the next generation to inherit a world of shit.</p>
<p><i>Your Future Our Clutter </i>is noticeably bereft of the call-and-response group chants that defined the Fall's mid-1980s classics as well as its most recent successes (see: ""Theme From Sparta FC"", ""What About Us?""). Instead, Smith's free-ranging rants gain focus as the music accrues momentum and menace: ""Bury Pts. 1 + 3"" takes a verse-by-verse ascension from lo-fi to fierce hi-fi stomper, as if to mock those who intentionally use crude production values-- ""a new way of recording,"" Smith sneers, ""a chain around the neck."" But Smith also invests <i>Your Future Our Clutter</i> with moments of surprising sensitivity (disquieting ballad ""Weather Report 2"") and self-aware reflection: During the late-night prowl of ""Chino"", Smith repeats, ""When do I quit?"" Coming from any other grizzled 53-year-old artist, you might interpret that statement as an admission of mortality and humility. But given the irrepressible vitality heard throughout <i>Your Future Our Clutter</i>, it's a question that, I'm happy to report, still has no answer.</p></div>"|14202.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14202-your-future-our-clutter/|8.0|Stuart Berman

Three Lobed's distinguished roster of alumni includes Tom Carter, Wooden Wand, Heavy Winged, Sunburned Hand of the Man, Six Organs of Admittance, Bardo Pond, and a horde of like minds-- basically, a fantasy camp for the wilder, woollier facets of what's been, for better and worse, dubbed New Weird America.</p>
<p>Since 2008, Three Lobed also released two LPs by Jack Rose, the acoustic guitarist generally accepted as his form's giant. In the 1990s with the band Pelt, Rose made the sort of eternal atmospheres that suggested La Monte Young relocating to the foot of Appalachia. At the turn of the decade, Rose turned his fingers to a series of progressively ambitious solo guitar albums. The early work owed obvious debts to John Fahey, but Rose's parallel explorations of Middle Eastern music and the blues, bluegrass, and string band music pushed him to new shapes and sounds. When he died on December 5, 2009, he was on a serious hot streak. A full-length collaboration with Virginia string band the Black Twig Pickers and its then-forthcoming follow-up-- his ecstatic Thrill Jockey Records debut, <i>Luck in the Valley</i>, recorded with many of the same musicians-- stand as two of his career's best. With a technique and tone that seemed slowly carved from the trunk of an age-old oak, Rose was the well-listened, workmanlike advocate for the future of American primitive music. Down with indie kids, skilled enough to stun anyone, Rose seemed poised at last to have an impact beyond his own sphere of influence.</p>
<p>Turns out, he already had: Not long after Rose died, Rayborn sent a late-night mass e-mail to most of the musicians he'd met as a listener or label head, asking if they'd like to offer a tune for his tribute to Rose. There were no length limits and no style guidelines-- only no covers of Rose tunes because, as Rayborn puts it, ""Jack would not dig that."" By the next morning, he'd secured a contribution commitment from a musician who hadn't even received the original invitation. And so, <i>Honest Strings: A Tribute to the Life and Work of Jack Rose</i> snowballed into a glorious and gargantuan 41-track, seven-hour, online-only ode.</p>
<p>The importance of Rayborn's decision to make the tribute available only through download cannot be understated. Here, it allows for a rare marriage of quantity and quality, since each piece feels as uninhibited as the whole. Among the contributors are the expected-- Byron Coley, the Black Twig Pickers, D. Charles Speer, Steve Gunn, Loren Connors, No Neck Blues Band, and Hush Arbors, just to sample. But the true testament to Rose's legacy and conviviality are those you might not expect-- rock'n'roll bluesman Luther Dickinson of the North Mississippi All-Stars, Mogwai's Stuart Leslie Braithwaite, and 90s improvisational outfit Un. As such, it pays its respects without suffering an overload of reverence. Sure, there are acoustic guitar songs, but they come embedded among brilliant beds of rock'n'roll, country, improvisation, drone, spoken-word, book readings, and complete live explorations. It's less a eulogy for Rose and more a celebration of his-- or, really, anyone's-- obsession with music.</p>
<p>Any concerns about 41 tracks of guitarists swiping Rose's style are void from the start: In just the first five cuts, Chris Forsyth offers a repetitive roadhouse number, while recent Rose collaborator D. Charles Speer twists jokes and memories of Jack around a goofy country trot that recalls Roger Miller's ""King of the Road"". Banjoist Charlie Parr and fiddler Mike Gangloff squeak and squeal through the exultant gospel exit ""This World Is Not My Home"". Six Organs of Admittance and Cian Nugent do reach for acoustics, but Six Organs' ""Drinking with Jack"" is a lithe, tender beauty; Nugent, a young Irishman, bends and breaks his themes. And that's just the <i>first </i>27 minutes of this nearly 400-minute collection, not necessarily the best.</p>
<p>Of these 41 pieces, there are very few blunders. Even the shortest one-- a patient 90-second reflection for acoustic guitar by Jenks Miller, better known for his drone and metal work as Horseback-- feels weighty. It's simple and sweet and, like the best work of the man to whom it's dedicated, is more concerned with expressing a feeling than evidencing high technique. Aside from a 54-minute reading from Joseph Mattson's debut novel, <i>Empty the Sun</i>, the longest track is a 43-minute live set from a Rose-less Pelt. Titled ""Louisville Susurration"", the piece unfolds with patience and grandeur. It alone would be a worthy album.</p>
<p><i>Honest Strings</i> is, at once, an incredibly demanding and non-threatening set. Its variety is either a marathon or a playground, meant as much for listening from one end to the other as it is for bouncing to and fro, picking up new sounds by artists you might not know. The entire set costs $15, too, or less than four cents per minute of music. Thanks to Rayborn's free curation and the free Web hosting of Thrill Jockey Records' digital outpost, Fina, every penny goes to Rose's estate. Much like the parameters Rayborn set for the collection, then, this brilliant mass of music is open to everyone. Now there's a legacy Jack would likely dig.</p></div>"|14221.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14221-honest-strings-a-tribute-to-the-life-and-work-of-jack-rose/|8.6|Grayson Currin

As with both those bands, <i>Noise Won't Stop</i> courted disaster by threatening to ""mean it"" too much: the songs affected knowing jadedness, while sounding disconcertingly earnest in their communication of disaffection, as if archness and distance are only emotions one feels about other things and other people. The result sounded, at its best, awkward, and loving Shy Child meant loving them because of, rather than in spite of, this awkwardness. Their megaphone enthusiasm seemed noble and necessary, in that you wouldn't engage in it yourself.</p>
<p>On <i>Liquid Love</i>, Shy Child undertake the shift from modernism to post-modernism on just about every level. Gone are the jagged rhythms vaguely suggestive of Timbaland and dancehall, replaced by steady, reassuring disco pulses and lush, squelchy synth work reminiscent of late-era French house (think Alan Braxe and Fred Falke). And whereas before singer Pete Cafarella seemed unable to spot the difference between singing and declaiming, here the vocals are all coy harmonized falsetto croons, a deliberately empty evocation of plastic soul, like a photograph of a photograph. The title track opens with a near-exact recreation of the shimmering intro to Fleetwood Mac's ""Everywhere"", which spells out Shy Child's intentions: not to evoke the ""futurism"" of the 80s, but rather the utopian agelessness and placelessness of its synthetic textures.</p>
<p>At first I resented this: What value was there in Shy Child abandoning their singularity in order to make songs that sound like less idiosyncratic versions of MGMT's ""Electric Feel""? A fair amount, as it turns out, mostly because Shy Child are so good at over-egging their songs with hooks-- the obsessively layered synth work in particular can be dazzling. But whereas before their songs seemed always on the verge of collapsing under the weight of their ideas, here the duo sound reined in, subordinating their maximalist tendencies so as not to spoil the illusion that they are now peddling ""perfect"" pop.</p>
<p>But Shy Child's brand of arch pop perfection is a front, falsetto vocals notwithstanding. These songs are, if anything, even more earnest than their predecessors, only now Shy Child are trying to seduce you with their insights rather than flatten you with them. ""If it feels so right how can anybody call it wrong?"" they sigh in ""The Beatles"", disguising a didactic defense of drug-taking behind rhapsodic sweetness. And despite reveling in four-minute disco-pop excursions, Shy Child haven't switched up their style much as they pretend; the sudden prog rock keyboard solo that floods the otherwise straight-ahead ""ESP"" evidences the duo's inability to keep their virtuosic tendencies in check, even if now it sounds more like a Daft Punk quote than it would have before. Still, it's a shame that Shy Child don't bust loose more often. The gloriously overblown electronic body music homage ""Criss Cross"" demonstrates that Shy Child don't need discipline to be engaging, but it's a lonely exception on an album that otherwise sounds rigorously liposculpted.</p>
<p>As with their last album, Shy Child end with an unexpected pinnacle. Then, it was the trance-pop anthem ""Cause and Effect""; on <i>Liquid Love</i>, it's bittersweet ballad ""Dark Destiny"", whose slowly deflating synth pirouettes mirror perfectly the song's depiction of a friendship's persistence through disappointments. ""I'll keep defending choices you're making,"" the duo declares, and if there's a more poignant declaration of fidelity in pop this year, I've yet to hear it. For Shy Child, synth-pop short-circuits the space between unreality and truth, the artificiality of its expanses allowing a sort of wide-eyed honesty that naturalism forecloses. That bittersweet sincerity sticks much harder than <i>Liquid Love</i>'s sleek surfaces would ever suggest.</p></div>"|14211.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14211-liquid-love/|7.0|Tim Finney

Yikes. It's a foul, repulsive picture (fun fact: it was also used by Norwegian black metal band <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orcustus_%28album%29"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Orcustus</a>), but in a way, it kind of makes sense. Because the Bitters do in fact make gross-sounding music. Not cringe-inducing music, or grotesque music, but their sound is primarily about scuzz-- in their formula, garage-rock, art-punk, and even sunny pop are covered in a thick, goopy layer of mud.</p>
<p>This is an increasingly common approach, used by bands like Vivian Girls, Golden Triangle, and Sic Alps, but usually these acts balance out their murk with pop hooks. But the Bitters, who are vocalist Aerin Fogel and Ben Cook (Fucked Up, Young Governor), skew more to the noise side of the equation. Their ramshackle songs mostly resist pop arrangements-- it's more about capturing a feeling within a racket than finding grooves or melody. Guitars screech, drums thud, Fogel shrieks, but amidst this noise there's a sense of forward momentum (albeit a wild, out-of-control kind) that keeps their songs grounded in some form of structure.</p>
<p>On <i>East General</i>, the Bitters marry cacophony with bits of doo-wop and grungy rock, but the album can be a slog for a couple reasons. First, the balance is off-- there's just not enough tunefulness to compensate for all the clamor. The band does offer some sweet moments-- the girl-group harmonizing of ""No Anchor"" and ""Impatient as Can Be""-- but mostly they emphasize harshness so much that songs become muddy and unmemorable. The record's other main issue is length. Bands who do this kind of thing well (No Age or Sic Alps) know brevity is key, and these tracks would work better shorter. There's no reason, for example, that closer ""I'm Feeling Good"" needs to approach seven minutes-- there aren't enough ideas to carry it that long.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly then,<i> East General</i> works best on straightforward, punchier songs like ""Nails in the Coffin"" and ""The New Real Way"". If you've followed the Bitters on their early singles, you know they can crank out good material when they keep things simple-- see blog fave ""Warrior"". A lover's anthem equal parts venom and longing, it was brief and to the point and highlighted both Cook's untamed instrumentation and Fogel's captivating vocals. It seems reasonable to think they could find that spark again and shake off this record with a stronger follow-up.</p></div>"|14210.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14210-east-general/|5.6|Joe Colly

If you're a fan of the complex-but-blunt punk/metal hybrid known as ""brutal prog""-- think Flying Luttenbachers and Orthrelm, Lightning Bolt and Ruins-- every note should be a direct hit. But If you're seeking a genre-transcender-- the kind of album that makes you think, ""this sounds more like stuff I already like than I expected""-- keep searching. There's nothing unexpected about <i>Cut and Run.</i></p>
<p>That's actually one of the best things about it. Throughout these six heavy-duty tracks, numerous pitfalls are avoided with ease. The sound is noisy yet spacious, as the group's burly elements wrestle judiciously rather than overlapping into vaguness. Singer Luke Calzonetti's grind-core growl is much sharper than the cartoonish goof that style often falls into. The math-y riffs and beats could sound clinical, but the sweat and grime it takes to execute them is wisely left intact. Most importantly, the trio rarely lets their bludgeoning repetition drift into autopilot. Instead, <i>Cut and Run</i>'s loops numb your mind in a good way, producing more hypnosis than boredom.</p>
<p>But even good mind-numbing can disengage the brain, and there is a jocky quality to <i>Cut and Run </i>that sometimes obscures the thought behind it. The band <a href=""http://decibelmagazine.com/Content.aspx?ncid=366957"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">cites</a> composers Karlheinz Stockhausen and Charles Ives as influences, and you can hear those strains if you focus deeply. But it's easier to let your pupils dilate and your brain liquefy. There are also some themes that make their scary moniker understandable-- opener ""Hold This"" gets its title from a traumatic incident bassist Tim Dahl experienced at age six, and drummer Oran Canfield (son of <i>Chicken Soup for the Soul </i>creator Jack Canfield) recently wrote a <a href=""http://www.harpercollins.com/books/9780061450754/Long_Past_Stopping/index.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">memoir</a> about his troubled youth. But those kind of ideas are buried under all the bombast. Brutal-prog should crush your skull before it stimulates what's inside, and <i>Cut and Run</i><i> </i>succeeds on that count. But at times it pursues reflexive muscle at the expense of reflective thought.</p>
<p>The final track on <i>Cut and Run</i> hints at ways the band might capture mind and body more equally. Led by Calzonetti's woozy keyboard, ""Froze Toes"" sounds refreshingly open-ended, blurring the line between sharp math and loose impulse. It's not a radical departure-- nothing here is-- but if Child Abuse move more toward such unpredictable edges, their already sturdy music could could become exponentially stronger.</p></div>"|14216.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14216-cut-and-run/|6.7|Marc Masters

""I'm finally getting to the point where I can make the kind of records... that I wanted to make when I was younger, things that I dreamed about making,"" he told us. That sounds modest-- he's been persistently pursuing a singular vision for years now-- but his first two albums did share common traits with his forebears. Even the excellent <i>Los Angeles</i> from 2008 took some of its cues from J Dilla, one of Ellison's idols. But with <i>Cosmogramma</i>, it's not enough anymore to talk about Ellison's sound as ""post-Dilla"" or even ""post hip-hop."" It's his sound now.</p>
<p>Indeed, <i>Cosmogramma</i> is an intricate, challenging record that fuses his loves-- jazz, hip-hop, videogame sounds, IDM-- into something unique. It's an <i>album</i> in the truest sense. Even on <i>Los Angeles</i>, which hung together well as a full-length, there were moments you could pick out as singles or highlights-- the distorted pop of ""Camel"" or the maniacal electro-house of ""Parisian Goldfish"". But <i>Cosmogramma</i> is conceived as a movement-- bits of one song spill into the next, and its individual tracks make the most sense in the context of what surrounds them. In this sense, it feels almost like an avant-garde jazz piece, and so it takes more than a few listens to sink in-- one or two spins and you're still at the tip of the iceberg.</p>
<p>Jazz is a big influence on the record, and it's a good place to start talking about the individual sections that make up the whole. Ellison is, of course, the nephew of jazz great Alice Coltrane and has said in interviews that his albums are in part dedicated to her. That's clear on <i>Cosmogramma</i>, as there are distinct passages that pursue an elaborate kind of digital jazz and the album is constructed to move through different sections, as one of Coltrane's might. There are roughly three of these passages-- the first is an aggressive three-song suite based loosely on videogame sounds. On ""Nose Art"", FlyLo puts raygun squiggles alongside woozy synths, grinding mechanical noises, and about 10 other sonic elements. Like much of the album, it sounds almost frustratingly unstable until you hear it a few times and the pieces begin to interlock and congeal.</p>
<p>True to its title, <i>Cosmogramma</i> then moves through a heady astral stretch and finally a more downtempo jazz-heavy period. The latter partly serves as a necessary breather from the complicated sounds earlier on. FlyLo shows ridiculous talent in each section-- the things he can do with and <i>to</i> beats just aren't common. In ""Zodiac Shit"", he makes a heavy, loping bass thump sputter out on cue, creating a physical rumbling quality. The beat of ""Computer Face // Pure Being"" trips over itself again and again like clothes tumbling in a dryer. These aren't just tricks-- in each case they push the song toward a groove. And it's not just beats: ""Satelllliiiiiiite"" is as dreamy as anything FlyLo's done to date, its distorted vocal samples and steam-building arrangement not unlike something out of Burial's repertoire and frankly just as good.</p>
<p>The song that will likely get the most attention here is ""...And the World Laughs With You"", a collaboration with Thom Yorke. Obviously an electronic-music fan, Yorke has done these guest spots before (for Modeselektor and others) and with such a high-profile contributor it's easy to make the song all about him. But FlyLo doesn't pay Yorke any undue deference, just treats his vocals like another element to manipulate and weave into the mix. It's so subtle, in fact, that if you're not paying close attention you might miss his appearance altogether. It's this level of confidence and commitment to his vision that ultimately makes <i>Cosmogramma</i> so fascinating. FlyLo is working at the height of his creative powers right now, and the scary thing is it's reasonable to think he could get better.</p></div>"|14198.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14198-cosmogramma/|8.8|Joe Colly

There have always been artists who find humor in making certain styles into grotesque caricatures and using them to point out the absurdity, or greatness, in a genre. The punchline works best when the setup's serious enough to work without it. The problem of irony comes when you're dealing with a setup that most people will probably mistake for the punchline itself.</p>
<p>And once you've been tipped to the tone of <i>Relayted</i>, the debut album from the two-dozen-plus-member supergroup Gayngs, well, good luck coming to terms with the slow-jam soft-rock pastiche that's just been dropped on you. Air had a tricky enough sell of it 12 years ago when they tried to convince indie kids that Moog-lounge AM pop was cool. And if the jet-set 1970s <i>fromage </i>of <i>Moon Safari </i>was a tricky kind of chic, imagine it dialed a decade ahead into mid-80s Lite FM fare. If you're not rolling your eyes yet, be patient: You have about 28 seconds before the album's first Skinemax saxophone wail.</p>
<p>But Gayngs take this stuff seriously, and if you concentrate really hard, maybe you could, too. It helps that pretty much everybody involved in the band has bona fides, whether in Minneapolis' electro-pop scene (brainchild Ryan Olson of Digitata; Zack Coulter and Adam Hurlburt of Solid Gold; members of Lookbook) or North Carolina folk-rock (the Rosebuds' Ivan Howard; all three members of Megafaun). That elbow-ribbing saxophone actually comes courtesy of Michael Lewis, from much-lauded Twin Cities jazz trio Happy Apple. And there are a lot of strong voices that fade in and out of this thing, too. P.O.S. absolutely kills it on the tense, Pendergrass-gone-Portishead slow-boil of ""No Sweat"", with fellow Doomtree alumna Dessa providing an almost subliminal background counterpoint. And the distant, breathy vocal that sounds like it's emanating from the sunset-hued beach of some early Michael Mann film makes leadoff track ""The Gaudy Side of Town"" sound disarmingly earnest. That's Justin Vernon of Bon Iver. Dude apparently listens to Bone Thugs, go figure.</p>
<p>So we're looking at a lot of serious-artist personnel for an album that might seem pretty conceptually farcical otherwise. And while some aspects of this album seem at least somewhat detrimentally tongue-in-cheek-- word has it that every track was recorded at 69 BPM, which does leaden the energy levels a bit-- <i>Relayted </i>doesn't stumble strictly because of its soft-rock and indie-soul leanings. Far from it: The original core trio of Olson, Coulter, and Hurlburt envisioned some kind of tribute to the legacy of 10cc, which explains all the ""I'm Not in Love"" vocal reverb and a straightfaced cover of 10cc vets Godley &amp; Creme's 1985 single ""Cry"". And it sounds credible, even when it's transmuted into jittery, guitar-addled new wave (""Faded High"") or <i>Blade Runner</i>ish soul-jazz (""Ride""). It's only when the extended ether-frolic vibe is rattled by some misplaced short-and-sharp pop-length numbers-- the mid-album stretch of ""False Bottom"", ""The Beatdown"", and ""Crystal Rope"" skews a bit too forceful-- that the seams actually start to show.</p>
<p>So <i>Relayted </i>is both better than it had any right to be, given the concept, and about as good as you could expect from the musicians involved. It has all the signs of a gag that got out of hand-- three guys from Minneapolis bantering about soft-rock namedrops who eventually found themselves surrounded by enough smart, likeminded musicians that it somehow wound up destined to sound at least somewhat heartfelt. It's a joke told in reverse, with a potentially cheesy setup that often comes with a surprisingly poignant payoff. Go into this expecting irony, and it might turn your stomach. Take it sincerely, and it'll hit you about a foot higher.</p></div>"|14188.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14188-relayted/|6.5|Nate Patrin

His last album, 2008's <i>The Holy Pictures</i>, was about as introspective as a DJ artist album could get, with his own vocal contributions and explicit references to Holmes' parents and Belfast upbringing. Apparently he's still in a reflective mood, dropping this 29-track career-spanning compilation, split into a best-of collection and a companion disc of remixes and obscurities. But more than just provide a convenient entry point to a man whose work has been enjoyed by millions of filmgoers but whose name is known by relatively few, <i>The Dogs Are Parading</i> lets Holmes do what he does best: weave disparate source material into a cinematic whole. It's just that, instead of pulling from his trusty crates of rare-groove vinyl, he now gets to recontextualize his own records.</p>
<p>Always thinking in filmic terms, Holmes applies a flashback-styled narrative to <i>The Dogs Are Parading</i>, starting with his most recent work-- the unreleased acid-disco theme to Soderbergh's 2009 Sasha Grey vehicle, <i>The Girlfriend Experience</i>-- before reaching back deeper into his catalogue. While Holmes has some fun early on juxtaposing the heady, Stone Roses rush of <i>The Holy Pictures</i>' ""I Heard Wonders"" and title track with the gritty go-go grooves  of ""My Mate Paul"" and ""Rodney Yates"" (from 1997's breakthrough <i>Let's Get Killed</i>), he tellingly groups all four selections from his 2000 tour de force, <i>Bow Down to the Exit Sign</i> together in a mid-disc suite. Though Bobby Gillespie's star turn ""Slip Your Skin"" is noticeably absent, the <i>Exit Sign</i> tracks included are still prime examples of the album's masterful synthesis of inner-city claustrophobia (""Living Room"") and widescreen, psychedelic splendor (""Jackson Johnson"", ""Hey Lisa""), and illustrate just how far Holmes had moved beyond the big-beat party music he was initially associated with.</p>
<p><i>The Dogs Are Parading</i> makes no bones about being comprehensive; save for the Sarah Cracknell trip-hop time capsule ""Gone"", Holmes' 1995 debut <i>This Film's Crap, Let's Slash the Seats</i> is ignored, and the collection also includes none of Holmes' signature soundtrack work. But the accompanying remix/rarities disc is something more substantial than just a grab-bag afterthought, and instead plays like an alternate-universe extension to the first. Where Disc One closes with <i>The Holy Pictur</i>es' mournful instrumental tribute to Holmes' deceased parents, ""The Ballad of Sarah and Jack"", the second disc leads off with a stirring revision by recent Hot Chip/Robert Wyatt collaborators Geese that transforms the track into a string-swept Dirty Three-style weeper. Equally bold are the competing Arab Strap and Mogwai takes on <i>Let's Get Killed</i>'s Gainsbourgian funk workout ""Don't Die Just Yet"", with the former using it as a template for another blue-balled Aidan Moffat monologue, and the latter amplifying the song's underlying menace into murderous noise.</p>
<p>Not all of these reworkings live up to the star power of the names attached-- the previously unreleased Kevin Shields mix of ""Living Room"" doesn't touch his MBV Arkestra dismemberment of Primal Scream's ""If They Move, Kill 'Em"" from the same era-- while studio leftovers like the percussive jam ""Lower Orders"" don't distinguish themselves in the absence of Holmes' usual conceptual frameworks. But when it comes to compiling the soundtrack to David Holmes' life, we should expect nothing less from him than the extended director's cut.</p></div>"|14205.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14205-the-dogs-are-parading/|7.7|Stuart Berman

Neil Halstead and Rachel Goswell formed the now-on-hiatus Mojave 3, and Halstead himself has made a few quiet acoustic albums on his own. Guitarist Christian Savill, when working with friend and former Eternal bandmate Sean Hewson in Monster Movie (a project that pre-dates his involvement in Slowdive), hews more closely to Slowdive's later aesthetic.</p>
<p>Up to this point, however, the duo's albums have been spotty at best, with momentum-draining tempos and a weakness for maudlin melodies. The timid pallor obscured prime slices of buzzy alt-rock like ""1950da"", from 2004's <i>To the Moon</i>, or ""Winter Is Coming"", from 2002's <i>Last Night Something Happened</i>. Both were tacked onto the end of their respective albums, as if not to disrupt the otherwise downcast mood.</p>
<p>On Monster Movie's first album in four years, <i>Everyone Is a Ghost</i>, the obligatory alt-rock cut, ""Bored Beyond Oblivion"", is right in the center of the 10-track collection. The programming change-up comes with a shift in focus. The songs here feel brighter and more energized, at times recalling jagged pop of Brian Eno's early song-oriented records. The sharply melodic guitar lines of opener ""The World Collapsed"" and ""Fall"", for example, recall Robert Fripp's contributions to <i>Here Come the Warm Jets</i>. The bulk of the record is split between moderately fuzzy shoegaze and bleary-eyed folk-pop, and the former fares slightly better, especially during the anthemic burn of ""Silver Knife"" and ""Fall"" and ""Bored Beyond Oblivion""'s sugary distortion. Even midtempo songs like ""How the Dead Live"" and ""In the Morning"" carry a certain shine.</p>
<p>There are a few clunkers here-- the worn-out, blaring beats of the title track and the overproduced ""Help Me Make It Right"", specifically-- but <i>Everyone Is a Ghost</i> is, ironically, more full of life than Monster Movie's previous output. It suggests a revitalization within the duo's songwriting, if not simply a necessary change in outlook. It's as if after two decades together, Savill and Hewson are finally enjoying themselves.</p></div>"|14204.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14204-everyone-is-a-ghost/|6.7|Larry Fitzmaurice

Taking cues from early Devo and New Order and replacing the dance-pop movement with rich characterization and storytelling, they've found themselves at a pleasant distance from most formal genre comparisons. Their music is playful but steeped in subtle detail, with both emotional heft and a pungent sense of theatricality.</p>
<p>Playing together since their college days in North Carolina but not truly finalizing the band until 2006, the trio seems comfortable bouncing ideas off each other while remaining anchored in their individual roles. J. Gerrit Welmers' synth work reinterprets those crystalline new wave textures and enhances them with feedback and buttery depth, sometimes accented with sparse snippets of programmed drums and rusted samples. But Future Islands avoid cluttering their music, allowing bassist William Cashion (a Peter Hook disciple if there ever was one) to direct the ship with his undulating plunks and strums, stringing the rest of these mercurial details along with him.</p>
<p>Any talk of Future Islands is bound to come back to scene-stealing frontman Samuel T. Herring, a dramatic, verbose showman eager to spin each one of these lush but simply-stated orchestrations into something grander. At times wailing like a cross between Tom Waits and the Sea Captain from ""The Simpsons"" (nicely exemplified at the stirring peak of ""An Apology""), occasionally adopting a strange British patois to augment a sort of sing-speak, Herring's presence is over-the-top in just the right way. He often seems overwhelmed by tragedy (usually waxing cryptic about lost love), and brings a great sense of damage and loss-- as well as welcome spots of humor-- to each acrobatic performance. But what he uncovers in the patches of calypso, sci-fi movie noise, and circling synth patterns is often surprisingly heartening. Drawing from a few different traditions while making them their own, Future Islands prove here to be a well-versed group of wild, woolly storytellers.</p></div>"|14177.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14177-in-evening-air/|7.6|Zach Kelly

All of their albums  follow a similar crowd-pleasing blueprint, and the group's four primary  vocalists consistently fall into familiar roles: A.C. Newman is the  everyman protagonist, Neko Case is the sassy dame, Dan Bejar is the  lovable rogue, and Kathryn Calder is the demure ingenue. The logistics of managing so many successful careers makes each  album an event along the lines of a sequel, with all the corresponding  expectations, escalation of stakes, and more recently, diminishing  returns. The first three New Pornographers records stand as an outstanding trilogy of brainy, hyperactive power-pop; <i>Challengers</i>,  their fourth LP, left listeners disappointed and confused, wondering why  the group had largely abandoned up-tempo thrills.</p>
<p>If only because it rocks  slightly more on a superficial level, the New Pornographers' fifth album, <i>Together</i>, will inevitably be labeled a return to form. In  reality, Newman and his partners are still developing a style that began  with <i>Twin Cinema</i> cuts like ""The Bleeding Heart Show"" and ""These  Are the Fables"" and came into full bloom on <i>Challengers</i>. Newman has shifted his focus from urgent, high-velocity  rave-ups to mid-tempo tunes with an ornate, cinematic grandeur. When the  band rock out on <i>Together</i>, as they do on ""Your Hands (Together)""  and ""Up in the Dark"", it's mostly a matter of hitting  rhythmic hooks with a very strong emphasis, like ending a sentence with a  dozen exclamation points.</p>
<p>Compared to <i>Challengers</i>, <i>Together</i> is sunnier and has fewer slow songs. However, whereas <i>Challengers</i>'  gentle moments opened up the group's stylistic range, <i>Together</i>'s  quietest track ""Valkyrie and the Roller Disco"" feels like a speed bump in the middle of an  album that could have used an extra jolt of energy. Newman is more  successful when he merges his taste for symphonic bombast with his skill  for huge choruses (""Moves"", ""We End Up  Together"") or when he holds back from unleashing the band's full force  on the springy, cheerful Calder showcase ""Sweet Talk, Sweet Talk"".</p>
<p>As  Newman continues to explore new ways of writing for his ensemble, Dan  Bejar's contributions find him making better use of the the band's distinct resources. Whereas his songs had sometimes  seemed arbitrarily wedged into New Pornographers albums for the sake of  acting as Newman's foil, Bejar's material on <i>Together</i> is more of a piece  with the record's tone and character. ""Silver Jenny Dollar"" and ""If You  Can't See My Mirrors"" are lush yet breezy, and provide a welcome  contrast with Newman's more overwrought arrangements. ""Daughters of  Sorrow"" takes full advantage of the  band's elaborate harmonies for a majestic vocal crescendo. All three songs contrast  Bejar's voice with that of Neko Case, wisely exploiting a chemistry that had not yet been fully explored.</p>
<p>Case, despite taking the spotlight on the stand-out  tracks ""Crash Years"" and ""My Shepherd"" and being present through  most of the songs, is mostly under-utilized here. Whereas her huge,  brassy voice had been deployed as the vocal equivalent of a fuzz pedal  on classics like ""The Laws Have Changed"" and ""Letter From an Occupant"", she has since been relegated to mid-tempo numbers and ballads. She carries  those songs well, but it's not a far cry from what she does on her solo  albums, and it tosses out the novelty of placing her alt-country  powerhouse voice in the context of hard-charging rock songs. Newman has  done better in servicing Calder, whose delicate, princessy tone is well  suited to his smaller, less assertive compositions.</p>
<p>Aside from  ""Valkyrie"", <i>Together</i> is a solid collection of well-crafted songs.  However, in spite of the quality, the album isn't entirely satisfying.  To some extent, this is simply a case of a band capable of greatness merely turning in a pretty good record. The real problem is more subtle. Though  Newman's songs have become more melodramatic and sentimental in recent  years, his lyrics have remained rather cryptic. It's clear that some of  the songs are addressing something intense and personal, but he keeps  the listener at arm's length, which in turn discourages identification  and emotional connection. Newman's cerebral wordplay and mythic  allusions worked well in zippy power-pop songs, but the grand gestures  of his newer material require more heart and less brain. Bejar, who is  no less arty and obscure in his lyrics, can pull off his more  pretentious moves with raw charisma and self-aware wit, but Newman can't  help but come across as a sincere straight-arrow type. He puts so much  effort into subverting that quality in his voice, but at this point in  his career, it's something he ought to consider embracing.</p></div>"|14195.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14195-together/|7.3|Matthew Perpetua

And in the past few years, the scrutiny hasn't always been positive. The duo's last record, <i>The Sun &amp; Neon Light</i>, found them out in front of the decks aiming to craft a crossover techno-pop album. Depending on who you asked it was either a brave experiment and stab at something new or a frustrating move from a duo responsible for some of techno's best 21st century tracks. Whatever the case, Booka Shade's stock is down after <i>Neon Light</i>, a sometimes brooding affair that delivered an attempt at growing an organic heart in the midst of their robotic gullets. The guys even sang on the thing.</p>
<p><i>More!</i> is a re-donning of their producer/percussionist hats. Bona fide beats dominate the record and the vocals are sparse and handled by guests like Yello and Chelonis R. Jones. But, at the same time, there truly is <i>more</i> on this record-- there are more electro-inspired keyboard lines and mood changes. This record can't be called ""minimal."" That said, the tracks here are missing the melodic weight that lent Booka Shade singles like ""In White Rooms"" or ""Body Language"" their crossover panache. Those synthesizer lines-- once delayed, drunken, and enigmatic-- helped tracks feel spontaneous (a feeling reinforced by Booka Shade playing live percussion on stage).</p>
<p>Synths throughout the record are more punctual, like more like a Berlin train than a gyrating body. This facet seems to be used even to comic effect, as on the opening ""Havanna Sex Dwarf"", whose staccato squelches and robot singing deadpan the unspoken words <i>novelty song.</i> It's certainly a weird cut to begin an album by a group usually constrained to the darkness of the club or a late-night living room. The record really gets going with the brooding ""Regenerate"", but from there it's all pretty standard fare, with four-on-the-floor beats at inconsistent levels of innovation and a few Kraftwerkian synth lines ping-ponging throughout the tracks. Jones turns in an uncharacteristically low-key performance on ""Bad Love"", which might have passed for an early 80s R&amp;B hit. Yello vocalist Dieter Meier grumbles his way through ""Divine"", not requiring a government-issued ID to remind you that he's 65.</p>
<p>But for the most part, the beats and the synths are the stars of the show here. They're not as compelling as in the past-- maybe only four albums into their career, the duo is preferring to color inside the lines. But for all those hits and misses, fans will keep listening, keep scrutinizing. Booka Shade gained that blessing, or the curse, as the result of consistent innovation.</p></div>"|14194.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14194-more/|6.5|Mike Orme

Their album <i>Gun Hill Road</i>, a concept record about a group of b-boy foot soldiers defending their Brooklyn turf against the encroachments of a horde of ""jiggy"" invaders (remember that pejorative?), was a shining example of how accessibly avant-garde indie rap could be at the turn of the millennium, all engaging logorrhea flow and death-jazz beats. Round two of the stated Infesticons trilogy was given over to their enemies/alter egos the Majesticons, whose 2003 <i>Beauty Party</i> was a parody of gentrified hustler culture drenched in curdled Moët. As high-concept three-part genre-deconstruction epics went, this war seemed like it'd build to a cataclysmic conclusion on the final album.</p>
<p>Just one problem: that final album has arrived seven full years after that last Majesticons salvo, and an entire decade after the whole scuffle began. <i>Beauty Party</i> was initially branded as a goof on chart rap. But after all this time, its crass, synthesized club-rap buzz sounds-- whether by design or accident-- like a sharp dissection of so-called hipster rap, pseudo-Diplo rather than mock-Diddy. And that war was waged what seems like ages ago. The outro track of <i>Bedford Park</i> practically admits as much, a dazed Ladd emerging from the rubble to the shell-shocked realization that ""I don't even think they remember... there ain't even underground hip hop or Top 40 hip hop no more, it's just bright rainbow and neon shit everywhere. Electro rap! I'm so fucking lost.""</p>
<p>So with the real-world inspirations of the Infesticons trilogy warped in ways few would have imagined back when <i>Gun Hill Road </i>dropped, <i>Bedford Park</i> has to shift focus a bit. And by ""shift,"" I mean ""lose"": despite the name on the cover and the occasional reminder that there's some kind of conflict going, this album has a lot more thematically in common with Ladd's personal, idiosyncratic work on albums like <i>Nostalgialator</i> and <i>Father Divine</i>. Concerns over hip-hop's tenuous grasp on reality and the commodification of culture crop up occasionally, and ""Give Em Anthem"" does a good job cracking wise about American Apparel fashion, famous-and-broke aspirations, and 1980s cartoon nostalgia. But there's more detailed narratives of relationship issues than anything having to do with the struggle between hip-hop as art and rap as commerce. And Ladd, along with MC collaborators Juice Aleem and Creature, seems to have left his usual tightly-woven language at the door; lyrics here lean heavily on stripped-down, hook-heavy repetition and entry-level metaphors.</p>
<p>But going into this album without much prior knowledge of Ladd's back catalog or the Infesticons mythos might cast it in a better light. If <i>Bedford Park</i> is meant to have an undercurrent of sly meta-commentary on the indie-punk relationship with hip-hop, it does a stand-up job of it, ricocheting from new wave/blog house tweaks to tense TV on the Radio harmonizing to wonky bass spasms, all the way to acoustic guitar-driven antifolk. None of it really coheres into anything in particular, but the songs sound comfortable in their genre-hopping skins. And in the end, maybe it's that loosely rooted yet roughly sincere eclecticism that stands as the real end result of all the fighting that's gone down before. That aforementioned outro track concludes with Ladd surveying the brightly colored debris in front of him and admitting ""I don't mind it. I feel kinda funny…"" before cracking up. Just like the rest of the album, it's hard to tell if the Infesticons are proposing armistice or simply admitting defeat.</p></div>"|14154.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14154-bedford-park/|6.1|Nate Patrin

Blumm has a very particular style. He uses live instrumentation to create understated tunes-- some jazzy, others austere-- that suggest folktronica without any glitch-tracks or other electronics. He seems to prize his independence, and cordons it off with ampersands in his frequent collaborations: Sack &amp; Blumm, with Harald ""Sack"" Ziegler, and Rebresch &amp; Blumm, with Rininat Rebresch. By implication, he disavows the notion that collaboration produces a collective entity. Working together is all good, but the kid stays in the picture.</p>
<p>So naturally, Blumm is instantly recognizable on <i>A Little Big</i>, the second LP of English-language music to issue from his project with the singer Ellinor Blixt. His knack for rococo, effortless-feeling melodies is in his playful guitar work, which, along with light percussion and duet vocals, dominates the album. His flickering arpeggios suit Blixt's airy voice perfectly. The overall effect is more attuned to the indie pop of Blixt's native Sweden, and the careful, coy arrangements are citizens only of Blummland. If you're familiar with his solo work, this is exactly how you'd expect his songwriting project to sound: Dreamy and lackadaisical, like a European version of Luna.</p>
<p>Bobby and Blumm join a long line of sweet dual-gendered crooners-- Sonny &amp; Cher, the Captain &amp; Tennille, Stars, the xx-- who rely on an echo chamber effect to enhance their music's intimacy. Solo devotional songs float off into abstraction; their targets could be anyone or no one. With duets, we can pretend the singers are addressing each other, even if they're not, and the poignancy of the emotion becomes focused and present. Blumm's wonderful line on ""Some Sweets"", ""In your arms, I push repeat,"" would be generally appealing in any case, but trailed with Blixt's whispers, it becomes specific-- not any old arms, not some symbolic arms, but <i>your </i>arms. It feels like stumbling into the middle of a private embrace.</p>
<p>The album's consistency is a potential limitation, though-- little distinguishes one song from the next. Extremely muted horns, keyboards, and chimes color various songs but each time, you're getting essentially the same thing: chiming guitar melodies, mid-tempo vocals, and a feeling of breezy exactitude. As a result, <i>A Little Big</i> isn't the sort of album you swoon hard for and listen to often. Instead, it clings to the back of your mind, slipping into rotation less frequently. Some listeners may find the patient, low-key vibe monotonous. But those who can still make time for a modest, charming little record stuffed with arresting details will be amply rewarded.</p></div>"|14187.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14187-a-little-big/|6.2|Brian Howe

And there are more than a few songs like this on her second album, <i>Victorian America</i>. She doesn't go out of her way to invoke a comparison to Cat Power, but during certain moments it's difficult to not notice the flattering (albeit striking) resemblance. If dour tracks like ""Never Dead"" and ""The Baby"" don't outright mimic Chan Marshall's indomitable style, they're at least more than a little beholden to her.</p>
<p>To White's credit, though, she doesn't let these impressions linger-- even at their most bathetic, her songs are buoyed with helpings of strings, pedal steel, and other instrumental touches that play their part without overstating their presence. The title track, a string-swept ballad that makes references to Hurricane Katrina, is a perfect example. Instead of overselling the drama, White maintains a certain distance from the emotion the song conveys, singing the lyrics in a stately and precise fashion. The musical accompaniment ably mimics this elegant pose, turning the song into something much more affecting. In comparison, an elegiac tear-soaked ballad like ""The Ravens"" opts to fully immerse itself in the tragedy of its broken-hearted subjects. ""And so I walk the line,"" White sings, ""to the beating of this never-ending lie,"" detailing in painstaking poetic fashion a love that was destined to die.</p>
<p>An album full of these sorts of lilting sorrows would be just fine (if a little samey), but thankfully there's more to <i>Victorian America </i>than that. The wry and humorous ""The Country Life"", with White striking the carefree pose of a been-there done-that woman who's still not done living her life, is a pleasant departure from the album's overall weightiness. The same goes for ""Liza"", a track whose talk of warnings and death is belied by a spry gait (and a pretty sly ""Be My Baby"" nod). And even when White bites off more than she can chew (as on the pseudo-song-suite ""Stairs"") or tries on poses that don't quite fit (like the heavy electrified stomp of ""Red Dress""), the adventurous spirit of such detours more than makes up for their shortcomings. It's heartening to see an artist as young as Emily Jane White recognize and exploit her strengths; it's even more heartening to see her try something apart from those strengths, failure be damned.</p></div>"|14209.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14209-victorian-america/|7.1|David Raposa

The song is quintessential Craig Finn, especially when he reveals a twist ending in the final lines: ""We were bored so we started a band,"" he admits. ""We'd like to play for you."" The line comes across like a stinging punchline, sad and self-aware: Kids start bands to tell their stories, yet their stories are often the same. They play music to feel transcendent, to feel larger than their mundane circumstances-- so why isn't the crowd paying attention?</p>
<p> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Coming from a band so rooted in notions of community and classic rock, ""The Sweet Part of the City"" seems to acknowledge that the Hold Steady realize their function as a liaison between the underground and the mainstream. They're trying hard to achieve widespread appeal while remaining embedded in the scenes they've been chronicling for half a decade. <i>Heaven Is Whenever</i> loiters in the same dives, clubs, and party houses as their previous albums and chronicles the sagas of similar hoodrats, townies, gamblers, waitresses, and girlfriends. Meanwhile, the band has graduated to larger venues, festival appearances, and an avid fanbase that shouts along with every word. The distance between subject and band has never been greater than it is on this album, and these new songs just don't hit as hard.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Finn still writes street-level narratives with a large cast of characters all united by their dire circumstances, and on previous albums, he managed to insert himself into their stories as a hapless buyer, a reckless hook-up, an accidental witness, or a reluctant participant. His first-person involvement gave him first-hand access to the kids, and he built songs out of stray phrases and details that explained their lingo and motivations. But on <i>Heaven Is Whenever</i>, he sounds one or two steps removed, less active in their sagas and less concerned with the particulars of the characters. Now he's shooting for the bigger picture instead of collecting the persuasive details and the convincing slang, which leaves these songs sounding largely uninhabited. Finn sings in first person throughout the album, gesturing at character and point of view, but the perspective from which these songs are written is neither entirely convincing nor consistent.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The band tries to punch up these songs as much as possible, adding intrusive synths and backing vocals, but they don't always achieve the fervor necessary to make songs like ""A Slight Discomfort"" uplifting. Tad Kubler gets a few good riffs in on ""The Weekenders"" and ""Rock Problems"", but the lackluster production blunts their impact. Elsewhere, the music is strangely staid and anonymous, lacking the drama that Franz Nicolay-- the mustachioed keyboard player who proved surprisingly divisive among fans-- could add with a simple piano flourish. ""Barely Breathing"" breaks into an out-of-nowhere clarinet solo, but that element of surprise is the most notable thing about it.</p>
<p>Still, there are strong moments here: That languid slide guitar on ""The Sweet Part of the City"", the shout-along hook of ""Rock Problems"", and the hammering chorus of ""Our Whole Lives"". ""The Weekenders"" musters a moody, desperate urgency that makes it sound like the dark sequel to ""Chips Ahoy"", with its hints of clairvoyance. But hearing the band hit this sort of stride is nothing out of the ordinary; hearing them sound so directionless and tired not only sounds new, but suggests that the Hold Steady aren't holding steady. Despite the confidence of that opening track, <i>Heaven Is Whenever</i> sounds like a transitional album, hopefully paving the way for something stronger, more cohesive, more specific. In the meantime, this remains an uncharacteristically weak effort by a good band that may be in danger of running out of stories.</p></div>"|14196.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14196-heaven-is-whenever/|6.2|Stephen M.

While some bands in that realm are capable of carnality and seduction, many would rather let the sonics do the work, and lyrically, it can be tough to reconcile base sensations with music that prides itself on its intelligence. In this context comes <i>Omni</i>, a record of lite-funk trappings and lyrics about the pleasures of the flesh that would be sketchy enough as a debut from a band trying to get that Maroon 5 money. But for a veteran band like Minus the Bear, newly signed to Dangerbird Records and known in the past for knotted, prog-spiked populist indie, it's a move of baffling awkwardness.</p>
<p>You confront that awkwardness from the first second of lead single ""My Time"". It's overproduced as hell, filled with all manner of electro doodads and backmasking effects, but it also boasts an immediacy and pop smarts heretofore unheard from the band. Unfortunately, that directness applies to the lyrics as well, and they simply cannot be ignored. During the verses, Jake Snider cops a parody Greg Dulli pose (""you taste like sweet wine... sweat rolls down your thigh"") while the hook plays out like a straight-faced version of ""puttin' in work"" babymakers like Death From Above 1979's ""Sexy Results"" or Flight of the Conchord's ""Business Time"". As with most of <i>Omni</i>, the issue lies in the incongruity of the delivery. You don't need to be a soul-papa belter in order to talk about the passion, but Snider's vocals never simmer, smolder, or steam. Instead, they just kind of lay there like a rumpled polo shirt, adding a creepy dimension to the keg-hovering come-ons.</p>
<p>At least those fare better than the midsection when Snider changes his focus to chronicles of debauched nightlife. With its thinly-veiled references to cocaine and illicit blowjobs, ""Into the Mirror"" is nothing short of an attempt to write the American Apparel set's ""Life in the Fastlane"", but once again, Snider's fugue-like state makes him sound like a disinterested outsider instead of someone invested in his story.</p>
<p>Minus the Bear boasted enough technical proficiency in the past to make the ""prog"" tag stick without making chops the foremost priority, but they mostly straighten up and fly right here with only the occasional waka-chika rhythm to throw things for a loop. Seeing as he helmed similar brass-ring grabs from Manchester Orchestra and the Whigs (as well as My Morning Jacket's <i>Evil Urges</i>), you figure the band knew what they were getting into when they tapped Joe Chiccarelli to produce. <i>Omni</i> does in fact have the pop and sheen that would make the most anonymous of 1980s corporate rockers proud. But for the most part, the combination of drop-D riffs and antiseptic production conjures a grunge band covering the Police.</p>
<p>And yet, in a weird way <i>Omni</i> is actually kind of admirable. Jessica Suarez expressed disappointment here that 2007's <i>Planet of Ice</i> was neither mission statement or monstrosity, that the time had come for Minus The Bear to dare to be great, even if it meant risking disaster. And credit Minus the Bear for aiming to be something than just another competent indie band. So, yeah-- I'd prefer <i>Omni</i> to be a good record, but there are good records everywhere. This is the sort of rare and spectacular clusterfuck that makes our music-consuming lives more interesting.</p></div>"|14138.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14138-omni/|3.5|Ian Cohen

Baby Dee is also the transgender singer that is not her longtime collaborator, Antony Hegarty, though both write with a wonderfully transcendental trust in the way love can reshape our world. And, lastly, Baby Dee is not her mentor and collaborator David Tibet, though her contributions to his Current 93 have been profound and, as she puts it, Tibet was the ""patient and forgiving surrogate father"" to these dozen <i>Songs</i>.</p>
<p>Dee has long been saddled by these and other obvious comparisons-- Andrew W.K., Will Oldham, Marc Almond, the Dresden Dolls. She's made that observation in interviewers, and critics continue to confirm it in new reviews. Above the lovely breeze of her harp and a string arrangement, she finally protests it on ""Black But Comely"", explaining that she's more than an assemblage of associations. Indeed, Dee's story is one of the most fascinating you'll ever hear in indie rock. Dee's sex change and her instrumental selection aren't the only hooks: She's worked as a tree pruner, a Coney Island sideshow, a church organist, a street performer, a dance club entertainer, and an arranger for the first incarnation of Antony's the Johnsons. She now lives alone in Cleveland in her parents' quaint house, surrounded by a few cats, her harp, and Andrew W.K.'s grand piano. Her personality is warm and frantic, like that of a grandmother who revels in explaining the brightest and darkest corners of existence. How could you not want to hear this person?</p>
<p><i>Songs</i> arrives more than six years in the making, and it's the sort of record that-- both for its enchanting arrangements and its presiding theme of using love to fend off evil, sadness, or, at the very least, darkness and cold-- should finally help Dee earn notice equal to that of her contemporaries. The title was originally given to a batch of seven quickly recorded tunes released in 2004 on Tibet's Durtro label. All of those numbers survive here, but they're reinvented by a six-member chamber ensemble that includes producer and arranger Maxim Moston. His violin playing-- a perfect mix of frailty and humor-- is a delicate foil for Dee's vocals, while the band's horns and strings web around her harp to form its perfect bed. A French horn, for instance, peeks from behind the harp's bass note on ""Endless Night"", adding a spotlight to each of Dee's epiphanies. In her hopefulness, broken words find usefulness, and bastard children earn redemption. ""Love is stronger than death/ More jealous than the tomb,"" she vows one track later, sending the words ahead of her stop-and-start harp, a shield taking the lead into the world's battles.</p>
<p>Dee, now 57, has seen that world from perspectives most couldn't imagine. Her voice, a knotty beauty drunk on personality, shows signs of those experiences. <i>Songs</i> highlights its most interesting aspects in turns. On ""Lilacs"", where Dee sings of ""lovers found"" to signify the approach of eternal spring, her robust tone moves in tumbles, slipping in front of and behind the meter like a smiling child skipping through a field on a sunny day. During ""As Morning Holds a Star"", her voice is at first impossibly sad, choking on its own nervous laughter as Dee notices that nature seems out of order. ""When robins wake a winter day/ There must be some mistake,"" she trembles. At the song's other end, though, her voice lifts-- as faint at first as a ray of light passing through a storm cloud, but then grand and resplendent. ""No more night skies/ I've got a sunrise,"" she boasts, repeating that last word four times. Good for her-- after all, it's time this sometimes obtuse, always evocative work finds a wider light.</p></div>"|14192.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14192-a-book-of-songs-for-anne-marie/|7.9|Grayson Currin

Dean Whitmore (who also played drums for the Intelligence) is the brains and the beat behind this operation, as well as being the group's only constant.  Unnatural Helpers membership is fluid, taking whomever it can from other Seattle-area groups to fill out its ranks.  They like to play garage rock, though some might call it punk rock.  At any rate, the music of Unnatural Helpers definitely rocks, and it does so with efficiency-- the 15 tracks that comprise <i>Cracked</i> say their peace in only 25 minutes.</p>
<p>Being from the Pacific Northwest, it shouldn't come as a surprise that Unnatural Helpers' music recalls like-minded Seattle groups past and present.  Of course, any group banging out tunes like these folks do (regardless of geography) are liable to earn themselves ill-fitting comparisons to <i>Nuggets</i> stalwarts the Sonics, though the Helpers do bring to mind that group's dirty R&amp;B swagger at times.  They can also approximate the Wipers' rip-roaring guitar sound (see ""Brave Dumb Face""), as well as A-Frames' brittle brutality (on ""Vox Humana"").  And with Kurt Bloch recording the album, it'd be remiss to not mention the powerful punk-pop of the Fastbacks.  But while <i>Cracked Love</i> brings hooks aplenty-- hell, ""Useful Things"" is all hook-- having Whitmore's gruff and grimy voice out in front doesn't really bring the sweetness the way Kim Warnick did for Bloch's bunch.</p>
<p>If there is a vocalist Whitmore's taking his cues from, it's without a doubt Mudhoney's Mark Arm.  The words to these songs beg to be sung with the same smirk and bemused disgust that Arm perfected-- ""My looks are killing me/ But I'm never gonna give it up""-- and Whitmore doesn't disappoint.  Whether he's making like the world's most jaded wallflower (in the lyric quoted previously, from ""Sunshine / Pretty Girls""), claiming he didn't know ""She Was Your Girlfriend"" (""It would take a real cool sleuth to blow her
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
cover""), or displaying an abnormal amount of pride in taking his licks in ""Claim It Mine"", Whitmore comes off like the coolest loser in the room.  <i>Cracked Love</i> might sound too clean and sharp to comfortably fit in with their modern-day hot-shit garagey counterparts like Thee Oh Sees or Times New Viking (""blame"" Bloch's unfussy production for that blessing), but when it comes to talking about who's got the goods in this particular arena, this album shows that Unnatural Helpers deserve to be part of that conversation.</p></div>"|14199.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14199-cracked-love-other-drugs/|7.8|David Raposa

Anger, despair, infatuation, sure. But forgiveness is more complicated, and tougher to fit into a four-minute song. Broken Social Scene know all about heartbreak-- they've spent most of the last decade crafting songs about it with almost unparalleled zeal. Their story is filled with <span><span class=""theColor"">scurrilous</span><span id=""hotword""> encounters</span></span>, backstabbings, and break-ups on par with most 70s arena-rockers, and they've crashed and rebuilt so many times that it's nearly impossible to keep track of who was where at any given moment. But they've also used that flexibility to their advantage: Their epochal 2002 breakout <i>You Forgot It In People</i> was the joyous sound of friends banding together to boost each other up, while 2005's <i>Broken Social Scene</i> was the dizzying sound of friends fizzing out into solo endeavors and outside pursuits.</p>
<p>Now they're back, and they're forgiving. Who, exactly? Each other, loves, bad decisions, humanity at large, worse decisions, the past, the future, culture, corporations, art, you, me, maybe even George W. Bush. (Well, maybe not him.) And while a 59-minute absolution session sounds excessive for even the most devout fans, Broken Social Scene aren't just throwing out hail marys here. Because forgiveness <i>is</i> hard, especially for a group this grand and this intertwined for this long. The album lets bygones go while acknowledging the pain and discipline involved, and does so while keeping with the band's indie-mixtape rep. There's a song that sounds like Pavement, one that sounds like the Sea and Cake (featuring Sea and Cake singer Sam Prekop), another like a Broadway adaptation of <i>Children of Men</i>, a weightless ballad that may double as an ode to masturbation, and a song that's basically five minutes of atmospheric pop perfection. Their ambition is intact.</p>
<p><i>Forgiveness Rock Record</i>'s thematic bent is mature, and that sense of gravity is embedded into the music, too. Working with band hero, Tortoise/Sea and Cake drummer, and post-rock mastermind John McEntire for the first time, Broken Social Scene made sure to have their shit together. Considering the co-producer's experimental bona fides, it's surprising that this is the most song-based album the band has ever made-- every track but one contains vocals, and a couple seem to be filled with more words than the entirety of <i>You Forgot It In People</i>. Unlike their last album's sometimes indulgent cut-and-paste sonic collages, <i>Forgiveness</i> has distinct targets and leaves little room for wayward meanders.</p>
<p>The band's newfound tightness results in a few of the most chart-friendly songs in BSS history, although as usual, each seems to come with a built-in caveat to prevent the potential of radio play: the sweat-soaked ""World Sick"", with its massive crescendos building to one visceral, heart-pounding release after another, is nearly seven minutes long with extended instrumental intros and outros. ""Texico Bitches"", despite its misleading breezy accompaniment, is an <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2010/US/05/01/louisiana.oil.spill/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">increasingly topical</a> indictment of big oil that repeats the word  ""bitches"" 12 times. And the vocals on the beautiful, synth-laden ""All to All"" are serviceably performed by relative newcomer Lisa Lobsinger, where Leslie Feist's stronger, more possessed delivery may have pushed it into another weight class entirely. (Feist does show up on  <i>Forgiveness</i>, but only for background  vocals.)</p>
<p>As  an alt-hippie with obsessions for Dinosaur Jr., Jeff Buckley, and Ennio  Morricone, BSS main face Kevin Drew led the burgeoning band to  somewhere completely fresh with <i>You Forgot It In People</i>, an album that  read like a non-ironic, indie-rock <i>Odelay</i> for the early 2000s.  For the most part, Drew and company are referencing the same beloved  bands on <i>Forgiveness</i>, with one key addition: Broken Social Scene  themselves. There are now marks that listeners expect them to hit, and  they're nailed with focus and precision: the peppy, horn-laden track from  Apostle of Hustle's Andrew Whiteman (""Art House Director""), the  back-of-the-bus acoustic session (""Highway Slipper Jam""), the immense  instrumental to end all immense instrumentals (""Meet Me in the  Basement""). All of those tracks excellently fill their respective  niches, but the fact that there are niches at all adds a bittersweet  tinge to a band that once sounded like everything else and nothing else.</p>
<p>Which leads us to the indiscretion summary  ""Sentimental X's"". It checks off another BSS box-- the subtly  devastating Emily Haines-sung heart-tugger.  ""Off and on is what we want,"" sings Haines, narrating the band's  gift-and-curse plight, ""A friend of a friend you used to call/ Or a  friend of a friend you used/ You used to call."" Which is what Broken  Social Scene is: a mess of friends using friends, loving friends,  calling friends, wanting to call friends, and then not calling friends anymore.  The connections are transitory but also indestructible. Ultimately,  ""Sentimental X's"" is a love song; there's lots of forgiveness, but  nobody feels sorry.</p></div>"|14200.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14200-forgiveness-rock-record/|8.3|Ryan Dombal

One's fixated on a maniacal instrumental proficiency; the other strips rock down to a core of primitive blare. Dillinger Escape Plan's 1999 debut, <i>Calculating Infinity</i>, was a game-changing (and copycat-spawning) album because DEP excelled at <i>both</i> halves of the equation. Not the easiest thing to manage. DEP spun arrangements to shame metal's biggest control freaks, but executed them with a raw energy that suggested the whole thing might splutter into instrument-flinging chaos at any second.</p>
<p>So it goes on the typically overwhelming (in many senses) <i>Option Paralysis</i>, but as with the band's previous two albums, the new one's not <i>entirely</i> successful. Unlike the frighteningly focused <i>Infinity</i>, DEP's 21st century records pull in too many stylistic directions, sometimes to the detriment of what the band does best. <i>Infinity</i> was unrepeatable. Radical lineup shifts-- and the restlessness common to genre-mixers-- meant a change in direction was inevitable. 2004's <i>Miss Machine</i> and 2007's <i>Ire Works</i> offered an ever-broadening sound that kinda-sorta skirted crossover-friendliness, a sometimes awkward mash of traditional, melodic rock and hideous shrieking and bashing. <i>Option Paralysis</i> continues in that vein for better or worse.</p>
<p>When DEP stick to the sound they perfected on <i>Infinity</i>, they're the only mathcore band left standing that still matters, and there are plenty of blinding moments on <i>Option Paralysis</i>. For instance the way ""Good Neighbor"" shifts unexpectedly and almost imperceptibly mid-song, from jagged spasms of ultra-tricky death metal drumming to thundering, straight-ahead, old-school hardcore. You're left fumbling to figure out how the hell the band pulled it off <i>and</i> too jacked-up on adrenaline to really care. That's the draw of DEP at their best. They certainly provide enough brain-scrambling fodder for the count-the-time-changes crowd. In two and a half minutes, ""Endless Endings"" cuts from power metal histrionics to funk-metal groove to grindcore splatter with a fluidity that sounds like DEP's playing with samples rather than playing in real time.</p>
<p>But sudden eruptions of emotive crooning feel out of place. The icky mix of cocktail piano and emo melodrama on ""Widower"" is a major offender. It's not <i>just</i> that the inevitable math-y freakout derails the song's sense of momentum. It's also that DEP's notion of what constitutes ""pop"" is so damn corny. Forget Faith No More, the most frequent point of comparison. Without Mike Patton's sense of the absurd to undercut the pomp, this shit sounds like Foreigner with an affinity for blast beats. DEP don't need to worry about ""softening up"" or (gack) ""selling out."" They need to worry about the fact that 3/4ths of <i>Option Paralysis</i> is astounding and 1/4th is plain cringeworthy. They might be better off sticking to the devil they know, rather than trying to become the first tech-math-metal-core-whatever band to land on <i>Now That's What I Call Music</i>.</p></div>"|14201.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14201-option-paralysis/|7.2|Jess Harvell

Suffice it to say that their pretensions aren't only musical-- and in this case, that's a good thing.  It takes a certain conviction and character to make instrumental post-rock, and the group's got both with plenty to spare.</p>
<p>However, considering they feature guys who've played with screamo progenitors Angel Hair, synthcore enthusiasts the VSS, and Isis, one would hope that Red Sparowes weren't so typically post-rocky. After all, at this point, eight-minute, loud/soft tunes that pay homage to the apocryphal grandeur of Mogwai and Godspeed You! Black Emperor need to be pretty special to make hearts swell. <i>The Fear</i>, unfortunately, falls short of that mark-- no amount of conviction can elevate these tracks above sounding like superb mimicry.</p>
<p>If you hear one song from <i>The Fear</i>, you've heard them all-- a quiet, ominous opening gives way to a gradual build-up and, eventually, the bombastic climax.  The album's opening track fittingly serves as a two-minute teaser of what the LP's lengthier tracks accomplish, as well as a example of what those tracks might have been better off avoiding.  ""Truths Arise"" starts with a solitary guitar offering its lament one reverbed note at a time; but after the first minute, the group brings in the drums and the bass and the loudness to send off the song in an entirely unnecessary flourish of fanfare.  It's a twist that listeners can see coming from miles away-- it pushes the same button that's always pushed in these situations.</p>
<p>Without fail, <i>The Fear</i> rides that button down to a nub, going so far as to circle back on longer tracks to give the button another unnecessary push.  There are some nice touches to be found here-- some tracks foreground what sounds like a little Allman-esque slide guitar, and the softer and slipperier sections of ""A Mutiny"" (aka the parts that don't sound like interstitial music from <i>28 Days Later</i>) is refreshingly reminiscent of early Tortoise.  These brief moments of clarity and contemplation, however, are capably subsumed by the group's unwavering need to kick out the jams, ""Like Herod"" style.  They do well enough with those sections, but those fleeting moments on <i>The Fear</i> when Red Sparowes avoid that impulse makes those all-too-frequent moments of big-bang-boom all the more disappointing.</p></div>"|14197.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14197-the-fear-is-excruciating-but-therein-lies-the-answer/|5.2|David Raposa

The London-by-way-of-Wales outfit makes music that feels bred for the arena, packing each driving track with huge washes of guitar and giant swarms of buzzing bass. This despite the fact that half the band's debut mini-LP, <i>A Balloon Called Moaning</i>, was recorded in a bedroom. If nothing else, the album is proof that you don't need a ton of production gloss to create a sound that's this anthemic and emotive.</p>
<p>On almost every track here, you get that moment of boisterous clarity-- usually in the form of some skyward-shooting chorus-- that feels affirming and perfectly in-line with UK arena rock. But these fist-pumping jolts are mixed in with prickly goth textures and doses of melodic post-punk, which serve as a welcome contrast. And most of these big moments get over without the benefit of being outwardly catchy, which is both impressive and occasionally worrying. Opener ""The Greatest Light Is the Greatest Shade"" and stunning highlight ""The Last Drop"" are two exceptions, but elsewhere the band's emphasis is on making emotional contact rather than trying to wiggle a hook into your head.</p>
<p>And it's all good, just as long as the band cranks it. Guitarist and lead vocalist Ritzy Bryan's sprightly voice soars when hoisted up by the rousing buzz of the band, even in instances when they seem like they should drown her out. Bryan's energy delicately enhances and ekes feeling out of draggier numbers, especially relatively to occasional vocal contributor and bassist Rhydian Dafydd. On material that offers more of an edge, like the harder-charging ""Whirring"", Bryan stands out as more than just a sing-along leader, injecting a little bit of snarl into the proceedings.</p>
<p><i>A Balloon Called Moaning</i> could actually stand for a bit more of that edge, and sometimes the material's boisterousness can seem a little hokey. But if enveloping and cleanly-stated material like ""The Last Drop"" or recent single ""Popinjay"" are any indication, there's real potential for the band's big songs to be as much about pop as they are about payoff.</p></div>"|14170.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14170-a-balloon-called-moaning/|6.7|Zach Kelly

That's not surprising from a band whose mission statement reads, in part: ""to present a multi-colored, polyphonic surf of sound and vision, set to the ritual nocturnal vibrations of its arsenal."" And yet, despite some occasionally worrying signs, Lazer Crystal successfully keep <i>MCMLXXX</i> from descending into academic navel-gazing.</p>
<p>Though they are keen to keep the entities separate, two of three Lazer Crystal members are also part of weirdo collective Mahjongg. The connection is a useful starting point since Lazer Crystal employ many of the same elements-- skulking synths, skittering beats, and warped vocals-- to create uniquely disorienting music. But where Mahjongg's albums can feel organic, thanks to occasional dashes of afro pop and dance-punk, <i>MCMLXXX</i> floats in outer orbit, broadcasting a glimpse of a bizarre, imagined future in which a 1980s corporate training video soundtrack is as legitimate a musical influence as Neu! or Can. The approach sometimes leads them astray-- such as on the space oddity jazzercise workout ""Catch the Wave""-- but the wide net they cast can also pay off. Standout ""Love Rhombus"" nicely offsets its lethargic thump with a cavalcade of arcade game-like effects, while the acid-house meltdown of ""Bad Indian"" recalls some nightmarish road trip.</p>
<p>For all its unusual, seemingly desultory instrumentation, at its core, <i>MCMLXXX</i> is a pop album. Though Lazer Crystal are more than willing to stick their necks out to see their vision through (see the sprawling nine-minute closer ""2029""), they rarely do so at the expense of structure. If <i>MCMLXXX</i> is less audacious than the band's mission statement would suggest, the ideas are more engaging and palatable. The album may fall short of its creators' lofty goals, but this is one failure that ought to be congratulated. It's a rare conceptual piece that's actively more enamored of the audience than itself.</p></div>"|14182.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14182-mcmlxxx/|6.7|Jonathan Garrett

Acts like the Tough Alliance, Blank Dogs, and Burial have made being unknowable desirable in the Internet era. That there's so little information on Worcester, Mass. five-piece Dom may be partly due to the fact that they've only been a band for a few months, but then again, the group's endlessly quotable <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/38496-rising-dom/"">Rising interview</a> with Pitchfork earlier this month had no shortage of willful obscurity: Lead singer Dom declined to share his last name, and blurred the line between fact and fiction so nonchalantly that it became hard to know if anything he said could be believed at all.</p>
<p>Dom's incorrigible swagger carries over to their debut EP, <i>Sun Bronzed Greek Gods</i>, already sold out on cassette, and available on 10"" vinyl early next month. Their demo-level production, surf-rock licks, cavernous reverb, and ""psychedelic sampling elements""-- as the singer described it in a Craigslist ad recruiting band members last December-- might lead some people to align the group with chillwave. But their arena-size choruses, actual drummer, and overall don't-give-a-fuck spirit put Dom in a category of their own. In truth, the majority of their tracks are closer in tone to the female-fronted college-rock bands that hailed from their home state in the 90s, relying less on consumer synths than fuzzed-out guitars, revving bass, and lockstep drums.</p>
<p>The phrase ""do it yourself"" gets thrown around a lot, but ""do your own thing"" is a better goal, and Dom both embody and challenge that ideal. They sing about ecstasy and basement parties, yet their mini-anthem ""Burn Bridges"" could cross over as easily as Passion Pit, a band who tried, to no avail, to sign Dom to their own Black Bell label earlier this year. The electro fuzz on ""Living in America"" comes straight from French house, but it's subverted by an intentionally vapid chorus (""It's so sexy/ To be living in America""), which Dom himself acknowledges as ""a 'YMCA'-type track that I would be best known for but forever hate myself  for writing."" What else would you expect from a 22-year-old who dismisses the troubled upbringing of Girls frontman Christopher Owens as ""probably just his publicist's idea"" right after discussing his own childhood experiences in foster homes?</p>
<p>Maybe Dom lie so they can get away with telling the truth. Their song ""Jesus"" is laced with drug references and movie-theater make-outs, but longs for the kind of substance that can't be abused: ""Gimme gimme/ Something to believe in."" That brand of subtle, detached malaise is present throughout the record, from the wistful noise-pop number ""Hunny"" to minor-key closer ""I Wonder"". But ultimately, what makes <i>Sun Bronzed Greek Gods</i> work is the band's innate understanding of the power of a killer hook, and their ability to turn them out  effortlessly on each of the EP's seven tracks. Sincere, sharp, catchy, funny-- maybe these songs are all you need to know about Dom after all.</p></div>"|14176.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14176-sun-bronzed-greek-gods-ep/|8.0|Marc Hogan

Certain artists-- the Dirty Projectors, Joanna Newsom-- stretch the limits of the seven-note scale, crafting melodies that take longer to resolve than sentences in a German philosophy text. Others go for extremity of tone: the glass-shattering falsetto of Passion Pit, or the chest-rumbling baritone of the National. Frog Eyes' Carey Mercer grafts a combination of these approaches into his own voice, a slippery beast that sounds like it gargles with wax in the morning. And while some bands might settle for those vocal contortions as their only exotic feature, Frog Eyes' arrangements are every bit as unpredictable as Mercer's catalog of shouts, groans, and other odd emphases. At full flight, the band's lengthy epics trace impossibly complex patterns that can be briefly stunning in the rare cases where they improbably collide.</p>
<p>When we last heard from Frog Eyes-- before the weird-vocal derby really got fired up-- they left us with their best example of that spectacle: the serpentine, cathartic ""Bushels"". That song appears, at first, to have passed its baton to <i>Paul's Tomb: A Triumph</i>, which opens with the sprawling ""A Flower in a Glove"" and then winds its way through three more six-minute-plus journeys. But a disappointing pattern begins to take shape in each of these long chapters, as the band begins on a promising note during the first three minutes, but exhausts itself over the last nine.</p>
<p>That lack of endurance doesn't hurt the shorter songs on <i>Paul's Tomb</i>, which are powered by a claustrophobic energy of guitar screech, stop/start rhythms, and Mercer's strange, over-enunciated vocabulary. ""Rebel Horns"" packs several minutes' worth of multi-stage composition into an economical four-minute package. The similarly brief ""Odetta's War"" and ""Lear's in Love"" (in which Mercer tries to set the world record for most syllables in the stock lyric ""I kissed a girl"") both possess the kind of compressed, ferocious intensity that so often becomes diluted during the noodly excursions of the lengthier tunes.</p>
<p>All the same, it's clear that Frog Eyes like long songs. I like long songs, too. But the less focused, super-sized tracks on <i>Paul's Tomb: A Triumph</i>, especially compared to 2007's outstanding <i>Tears of the Valedictorian</i>, can't help but look like a hole shaped suspiciously like Wolf Parade/Sunset Rubdown's Spencer Krug, a former roommate and bandmate of Mercer's who doesn't appear here. Even in Krug's absence, cues could have been taken from him, or from Frog Eyes' other famous BFF, Destroyer's Dan Bejar, both of whom have recently charted long songs that stray far from their starting point, but nevertheless reach satisfying conclusions. As both of those artists understand well, even the flashiest skating requires a graceful finish.</p></div>"|14172.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14172-pauls-tomb-a-triumph/|6.4|Rob Mitchum

His sound was highly approachable; familiar yet fresh. His songs often recalled the sleek architecture of Boards of Canada and the slithering pulses of Four Tet, with a hint of the Traum label's distinctive sparkle. But at their best, they packed a sultry wallop that felt like an emerging voice of Applescal's own. Compared to the mean rhythmic slant and melodic punch of highlights like ""In the Mirror"", linear vamps like ""I Can't Stand"" felt indistinct. He sometimes got caught up in showing off what he could do, rather than what he could envision. But his vigor and ability made even the lesser tracks worthwhile.</p>
<p>It looks like we have to keep waiting for Applescal to get past his impulsive streak. Little has changed on <i>A Mishmash of Changing Moods</i>, and why should it have? It's only been eight months. The album is more focused than its inauspicious title suggests, but as on <i>Commitment</i>, Applescal has produced about an EP's worth of dazzling material padded with the kind of competently stimulating tech fantasias you feel like he can crank out all day. His skill as a sonic architect is always at the forefront, and he's great at taking a handful of thematic elements and making them dance with graceful complexity. In the tension between nested rhythms and overarching melodies, beleaguered drum machines struggle to keep time before snapping back into place. Synths are filtered every which way. The sounds are so finely tailored you can feel the unique shape of each snare.</p>
<p>But at his best, Applescal gets past minutiae and dreams up modular, interlocking universes of sound, with multiple motifs. <i>Mishmash</i>'s first two tracks feel like warm-ups, though the ghostly vibes of the first make for a nice introduction. It really gets going with ""Dialeague"", his best and most unique work to date. The contrast between warm static and icy-clear melody is instantly immersive. It feels visionary and spacious. All of the bull's-eyes have something special that makes them stand out from the album proper: The curving, radiant spray of ""The Key of Genes""; the ominous bass flicker of ""MC Iron""; the thick, juicy groove of ""In Theory"". This high bar makes what would otherwise be totally solid spitting-drum and shrilling-synth workouts sound rote, a little pointless. Applescal seems limited only by a youthful urge to use everything, right now, as emphasized by the long, weird, unfinished-feeling closing track of <i>Mishmash</i>. Once he gets past it, look out.</p></div>"|14163.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14163-a-mishmash-of-changing-moods/|6.8|Brian Howe

An original member of the latter alongside Anthony Gonzalez, Fromageau left M83 after the creation of what is arguably their best release, 2003's <i>Dead Cities, Red Seas &amp; Lost Ghosts</i>. Not to diminish the charming, vibrant, John Hughes-inspired poignancy of <i>Saturdays=Youth</i>, but Gonzalez has taken M83 in a much brighter direction without his former partner, embracing pop buoyancy and accessible, sentimental melodies. It is, therefore, up to Fromageau (backed by multi-instrumentalist Christophe Guérin and producer/manager Jean-Philippe Talaga) to pick up the gothier, dream-pop mantle of his former project.</p>
<p><i>You Never Did Anything Wrong to Me</i> plays like a less volatile sequel to <i>Dead Cities</i>. All the things that make that album great are present here-- waves of synths, sunburst crescendos, harsh shoegaze drones, and tickly electronic effects-- but it also features a newfound emphasis on song structure and prominent rhythms that occasionally border on motorik. But the EP, despite its brief run-time, is ambitious in its scope, spanning the outer-reaches of Fromageau's wall-of-sound and making forays into everything from chilly synth-pop to bruised, echo-laden post-punk. Standout ""A Glorious Time"" crashes like a Ride track, but, despite its celebratory build and suffusion of fuzzy guitars, it is rooted in bittersweet nostalgia, as its yearning ""leave it all behind you"" refrain stresses. And ""Sur Nous Les Étincelles Du Soleil"" (translation: ""On Us, the Sparks of the Sun"") sustains a mood with its atmospheric girlish whispers delivered in French and washes of reverberating synths.</p>
<p>The EP makes a strong argument for its form, offering seven essential songs (there are only six on the vinyl version) with no filler. In an iTunes era that has ushered in a renaissance for the singles format, <i>You Never Did Anything Wrong to Me</i> is an argument that sometimes a band should forsake the pressures of writing 10-plus great songs for a padded full-length debut and concentrate more on making a vital, necessary-sounding EP that best illustrates its capabilities. Which is exactly what Team Ghost have done here, marking a triumphant (yet wistfully subdued) return for its creator.</p></div>"|14180.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14180-you-never-did-anything-wrong-to-me/|7.4|Rebecca Raber

Jahcoozi, a collaboration between German producers Robot Koch and Oren Gerlitz and Sri Lankan vocalist Sasha Perera, take this global approach. In their tracks, dancehall riddims, glitch-hop, and experimental techno rub up against each other like long-lost pals.</p>
<p>Jahcoozi's first two records, <i>Pure Breed Mongrel</i> and the awesomely titled <i>Blitz 'n' Ass</i>, took an aggressive line to the dancefloor. Rapid-fire beats and grime mixed with Perera's in-your-face political emceeing for a visceral, gritty sound. It was danceable, but ultimately disruptive music. But with <i>Barefoot Wanderer</i>, their first release for Berlin's BPitch Control, Jahcoozi appear a good deal more subdued with a style that leans heavily on dub-- both the classic Jamaican variety and its modern-day digital equivalent, dubstep.</p>
<p>Mostly the shift works. There's a variety of song types and distinctive collaborators who bring tempo swings, but the prevailing mood is sort of a downtempo saunter, made even more spacious by Perera's milky vocals. (Massive Attack's <i>Mezzanine</i> is a good reference point in this sense.) Tracks like ""Barefoot Dub"" and ""Lost in the Bass"" set echo-chamber reverb alongside glitch-y techno, creating an interesting tension between traditional King Tubby-style dub and more progressive current electronic sounds. Most of these songs are good, but occasionally there's a dip in the dynamism of the production-- ""Zoom in Fantasize"" and ""Barricaded"" just sort of drift by without making much of an impact.</p>
<p>Dub and techno are the album's core elements, but there are plenty of other styles stirred in. Some of <i>Barefoot Wanderer</i>'s best material comes when the group invites guest vocalists to mix it up with Perera. On ""Powerdown Blackout"", she trades raps with Anti-Pop Consortium's M. Sayyid over a futuristic, Neptunes-ian hip-hop track. Kenyan dancehall toasters Ukoo Flani guest on ""Msoto Millions"", and percussionist and singer Guillermo E. Brown duets with Perera on the skittering ""Speckles Shine"". The album's much better off for these collaborations. Without them, it could get lost in its own fog and become just an interesting weed soundtrack, but instead they add more international intrigue to Jahcoozi's already inclusive formula.</p></div>"|14189.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14189-barefoot-wanderer/|6.8|Joe Colly

Sorry, haters: 2010's <i>Crystal Castles </i>improves on their (also self-titled) debut in nearly every way. The latest from the Toronto-based electro duo is reminiscent of the jump forward taken by Deerhunter between <i>Cryptograms</i> and <i>Microcastle</i>, or Fuck Buttons from <i>Street Horrrsing </i>to <i>Tarot Sport.</i> Like those acts, Crystal Castles have reconciled with their detractors instead of running from them. By staying true to themselves, they've created a more focused, propulsive, and satisfying follow-up.</p>
<p>Some listeners might miss the sonic shock that came from hearing the sub-zero Italo chill of ""Magic Spells"" sequenced next to the 8-bit electrocution of ""Xxzxcuzx Me"", but clashes like those wore out their welcome over the span of 16 tracks. Here, Crystal Castles embrace continuity and broaden their dynamic range beyond the primitive loops that once constituted the foundations of their songs. The core elements of first single ""Celestica"", for example, are pure shoegaze, but the waves of distortion that scrape across its chorus squash any concerns that the duo has gone soft. For a band known for its harsh midrange, this record  reveals a surprising amount of depth in headphones.</p>
<p>Crystal Castles are far more pop than before, too, which was probably an inevitable move, but hardly a bad one. Like ""Celestica"", ""Suffocation"" and ""Empathy"" mix fanged distortion and sparkly synths, while tracks like ""Vietnam"", ""Not in Love"", ""Intimate"", and the rave-tinged ""Baptism"" arm the record with loads of could-be singles. But despite this shift toward beauty and clarity, Crystal Castles still rip into some punishing, epileptic moments, like the distorted bass riff on ""Birds"" and the shredded brutality of ""Doe Deer"". The fluidity of the music is matched by Alice Glass' frequently manipulated vocals, a showcase for someone too often pigeonholed as a bratty screamer. She sounds at times like everything from a Leslie guitar (""Empathy"") to a <i>Cloverfield-</i>style monster (""I Am Made of Chalk""). The obvious comparison is the Knife's <i>Silent Shout</i>, but where Karin Dreijer-Andersson often manipulates her voice to play characters, Glass is just as disturbing for her dehumanization.</p>
<p>As rewarding as this new album is, it's even more impressive when you consider its context: Crystal Castles may have come on at the tail-end of the blog-house/nu-rave/French-touch mini-rage, but they've now transcended it, moving from scene linchpin to indie stars. The reason is simple: Crystal Castles are a singular act who rarely sound like anyone other than themselves. So just as Ladytron's <i>The Witching Hour </i>did for electroclash in 2005, <i>Crystal Castles</i> seems destined to close the door on a fleeting, once-fashionable genre in the best way possible: by making an artistic leap beyond its boundaries.</p></div>"|14190.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14190-crystal-castles/|8.5|Ian Cohen

That was Kate Nash at a gig in England last month, rejecting requests to play her biggest hit, ""Foundations"". Following in the virtual footsteps of similarly saucy Londoner Lily Allen, Nash first gained fans via another Web 2.0 site-- MySpace-- then graduated to the high-pressure world of UK #1 albums (2007 debut <i>Made of Bricks</i>), Brit awards (Best Female Artist 2008), and tabloid bullshit. Oh yeah, and she's only 22.</p>
<p>Nash hasn't cracked up yet, but her sophomore album is thrillingly schizophrenic. There's the brash riot grrrl who shrieks expletive-strewn girl-power polemic-- clearly, a new addition. But there's also the warts'n'all diarist whose keenly observed romantic vignettes made Nash an Internet sensation in the first place. And, of course, there's still plenty of piano-pop approachability to reassure the 600,000 fans who bought that glossily uneven first album; Bernard Butler's occasional touches of 1960s girl-group production nicely serve Nash's bursting mini-narratives about insecurities, sexual politics, and-- what else?-- L-U-V.</p>
<p>No one is going to mistake Nash for Karen O, let alone Ari Up. That's part of her appeal. Whether she's squawking on ""I Just Love You More"", hypnotically repeating a coming-out dilemma on ""I've Got a Secret"", or veering off into a foul-mouthed critique of groupie culture on ""Mansion Song"", Nash's leftfield moves resonate all the more here because she resembles someone you might actually know, a person with flaws-- not some impossibly cool rock goddess. On ""Do You Want to Share the Guilt?"", she declares, ""Not being able to articulate what I want to say drives me crazy."" This pivotal track's plainspoken anxiety, mallet percussion, and breathless coda are happily reminiscent of another wordy UK outfit recently undergoing a transition from politely employable to barely housebroken: Los Campesinos!. It's you, it's me, and we're emoting.</p>
<p>A couple of shows after Nash's defiant YouTube endorsement, ""Foundations"" started cropping up on setlists again. Sure enough, <i>My Best Friend Is You </i>hedges its edginess, too; first single ""Do-Wah-Doo"" cushions Nash's blunt charm with billowy arrangements. Only now, Nash is no longer struggling to establish romance-- she's deep in it. From breezily pessimistic opener ""Paris"" to sublimely mundane finale ""I Hate Seagulls"" (and on through a hidden title track), the album moves from infatuation and jealousy to lust and betrayal to real, young love. And it does so with not just the best of intentions-- feminism, anti-homophobia, artistic experimentation-- but also, in the storytelling style of the Streets or Sweden's Hello Saferide, a set of distinctive, well-crafted songs that should strike a chord with self-deprecating teens and twentysomethings. Anyone can add a friend these days. Finding-- and keeping-- a <i>best</i> friend remains as awkward, embarrassing, and exquisite as ever.</p></div>"|14136.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14136-my-best-friend-is-you/|7.8|Marc Hogan

The spindly Frenchman has been a member of a half-dozen bands, from the brittle Peste Noire to the wildly and willfully diverse coed quartet Amesoeurs. Since 2005, Neige has been releasing music as Alcest that ranges from the black metal of 2005 EP <i>Le Secret</i> to the Red House Painters-via-Justin Broadrick 2007 LP, <i>Souvenirs d'un Autre Monde</i>. Now, he's finally fit all of his component parts-- arching atmospherics, celestial melodies, suffocating roars-- into one record. At last, Neige has made an album that plays like one.</p>
<p>At a time when both legitimately heavy bands like Wolves in the Throne Room and Liturgy and electronic acts like Ben Frost and Fuck Buttons are using black metal ideas to build something bigger, Neige lands one of the most cohesive, well-considered experiments yet. He peels apart the layers of black metal-- lacerated vocals, relentless rhythms, overtone-rich guitars-- and applies them to disparate structures and sounds.</p>
<p>On ""Percées de Lumière"", the rhythm supplies a pace that's nearly krautrock, while the guitars revolve around a minor riff that suggests Slint. So, of course, the metal shifts to the vocals. Neige generally sings gracefully and carefully, but here he screams in black-metal horror. ""Écailles de Lune [Part I]"", on the other hand, even sounds like a toughened mix of M83 and Sigur Rós, with guitars saturating every space and Neige's voice floating like Jónsi Birgisson's once did. Beneath the surface, however, the militant pacing of drummer Winterhalter and the increasingly sinister note selections of Neige presage something heavier. For the final two minutes, they rage like Scandinavian lords in a high-dollar studio. Thanks to the methodical if subtle way that song develops, moving from staggering rock to twinkling atmospherics to something altogether more intense, it doesn't seem out of place. The same holds for ""Part II"", which erupts quickly into a brutal rush only to burn itself out, dissolving into a ghastly drone that builds and collapses twice more. The line between the tormented and the gorgeous blurs into an imagined boundary-- tedious to find, delightful to miss.</p>
<p>Several reviews of <i>Écailles de Lune</i> have criticized the album's brevity, noting that, though its six tracks clock in just shy of 42 minutes, ""Percées de Lumière"" appeared on a limited-edition split last year, while the 108-second instrumental, ""Abysses"", doesn't warrant mention as a ""song."" That's an unfortunate dismissal, especially because ""Abysses"" is as vital as anything else here. Like the best of Alcest's output, it's a ghastly but beautiful hum. Neither an admonition nor an invitation, neither noise nor new age, it confirms the newfound patience and purpose of Neige, who's made an album that's more enchanting than even these last few years of promise have suggested.</p></div>"|14164.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14164-ecailles-de-lune/|8.4|Grayson Currin

After the Columbus, Ohio, band finished recording its second album <i>Change!</i>, violinist Noel Sayre died suddenly in a swimming pool accident in July 2008. He left a laptop full of recordings-- some incidental music, some snippets of melody-- which singer-songwriter Jerry DeCicca incorporated into the Black Swans' follow-up,<i> Words Are Stupid</i>. That's Sayre setting the scene on opener ""Blurk"", adding dramatic eddies of violin to ""Open Sky"", and kazooing on ""Kazood"". He remains only a glimmer at the edges of the music-- present and pointedly not present-- but it's not the tragedy of his death that makes this strange, smart, soulful album resonate so darkly. His playing has always been crucial to the band's sound, adding a dusky ambience to DeCicca's world-weary croak and bluesy, brainy lyrics. Why wouldn't these found sounds do the same?</p>
<p><i>Words Are Stupid</i> has an unusual life of its own. The album was commissioned by St. Ives as a meditation on the fallibility and malleability of language. It will be released exclusively on vinyl and limited to only 200 copies, each with a slightly different photo on the cover. The Black Swans' undertake this assignment with the same mix of gusto and gravity they've applied to all their releases, generating a dark country backdrop for DeCicca's playful lyrics. It's an album with a thesis, but it never becomes weighted down with semantics. Ultimately, it argues that words are not stupid so much as tragically insufficient to express the enormity of even everyday emotions, much less overwhelming feelings of loss like the one this band has suffered. On this alternately humorous and heartbreaking album, the Black Swans realize that music can do what words cannot.</p>
<p>With a blurt that sounds not unlike an Americanized Stuart Staples, DeCicca's lyrics tread a fine line between ridiculous and revelatory as he slips in and out of a variety of roles and guises. Despite doing everything from building a joke around a rooster's crow or singing about comic strips like ""Marmaduke"" or ""The Wizard of Id"", DeCicca makes his words mean a lot. His work as a producer-- for the Black Swans as well as for Moviola and Larry Jon Wilson-- gives him a nuanced grasp of mood and depth, sketching out intricate settings with only a few instruments and notes. The closely mic'ed guitar on ""Day at the Park of Roses"" swells with the intensity of Low and the purposefulness of Tindersticks, but the ebb and flow of that industrial buzz in the background lends the song a menace that belies the pleasantries implied by its title. ""Black Swans Tango"" is a mostly spoken-word account of going deaf in Buenos Aires and reading Borges, set to a rustic South American rhythm that's not quite a tango, but a memory of one. The tale culminates in one of the album's most thematically and emotionally satisfying moments, as DeCicca plays a solo on a comb and wax paper-- an improvised instrument intent on ""moving you without words.""</p></div>"|14174.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14174-words-are-stupid/|7.6|Stephen M.

That claim is a bit of a red herring: Though Krueger originally hails from Wisconsin and operates mostly solo out of his Brooklyn home, he's no lone wolf or Justin Vernon-style sob story. In recent years, Krueger's popped up on records by My Brightest Diamond and DM Stith; on <i>Inter Arbiter </i>he shares time with guests Zach Condon (Beirut) and Angel Deradoorian (Dirty Projectors).</p>
<p>No surprise then that much of the Inlets record orbits around Brooklyn's baroque sounds. ""Canteen"", modeled like an Archer Prewitt cut-- crisp and close-miced, open-tuned guitars-- is somewhat of an outlier. For the most part, Krueger splits the difference between frilly instrumentation and an acoustic-led inner monologue. His compositions don't move forward so much as they revolve in place, each filigree of strings and vocal harmony rounded off in waltz time. And while acoustic instruments are prominent enough to suggest solo composition, there are, as a song title here slyly jokes, plenty of ""Bells and Whistles"" and decorative orchestration.</p>
<p>Even when Inlets get relatively spare, such as on ""In Which I, Robert"", the song stlll boasts staccato piano thumbs and barbershop harmonies. But for all its external prettiness, <i>Inter Arbiter </i>too often honors its name by getting lost in itself. Though Krueger's poetic bent is admirable in a genre that can be too straightforward or impressionistic, Krueger's lyrics can get a little too ripe-- see lines like, ""I can smell your underbelly, softened and sweet/ And it gets me going like I've nothing to eat.""</p>
<p>""Bright Orange Air"", the keeper cut, demonstrates <i>Inter Arbiter </i>could've been a knockout with stricter boundaries. Boasting the record's most intriguing lyrics-- a bemused recollection of the strange beauty of metropolitan ambient light-- and a sturdy song structure that supports tart harmonies, it demonstrates that Krueger's adept at painting around the edges. Hopefully, next time around he'll become more comfortable aiming for bullseyes.</p></div>"|14191.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14191-inter-arbiter/|6.1|Ian Cohen

Which is understandable: He's a straight dude who came to house via indie and noise and he seems bugged out that others are doing the same. So he tells interviewers about how hipster kids dance wrong out of discomfort, how the heavy electro/Ed Banger side of house is just a way of maintaining segregated sexuality on the dancefloor, how journalists only pretend to like certain token artists so they can hide their intrinsic homophobia. It's strident stuff, borne out of years of discovery and elation and frustration, and whether or not any of it goes deeper than setting up and assaulting strawmen, it at least comes across as the worldview of a man who still feels compelled to defend his own house music cred.</p>
<p>But none of those statements speak as loudly as his actual mixing does. MacLean's installation into the long-running <i>DJ-Kicks</i> series is all the proof you really need of his breadth of knowledge and ability to craft a good set-- all-vinyl, one take, no computers. Condensing 18 tracks (including a couple of well-timed reprises and callbacks) into a 72-minute stream of constantly shifting grooves without losing the fundamental euphoria of the original tracks' momentum isn't something that comes easy to bandwagoneers. And MacLean goes past tastemaker collection-flaunting into something deeper, a mix that sounds like its heart's been beating for 20 years.</p>
<p>That's no small feat considering how many of the tracks here are less than five years old. There's always been a pocket of house that skews classicist-- MacLean and some of his fellow DFA pals amongst them. And it says something about the grip that label holds on the imaginations of the indie-dance set that the mix opens with the Ian Breno dub of ""Happy House"" (retitled ""Feliz Casa"" here), then segues into Still Going's bass-reverb monster ""Spaghetti Circus"" and makes both tracks sound like they've been a part of the house continuum for a few decades rather than a few years. Even across regions and scenes-- Giom's deep house cut ""I Know You Were Right"", the Paradise Garage-evoking ""Planets (The Revenge Lost Groove)"" from 6th Borough Project, the progressive house bliss of Danny Howells' ""Laid Out (Fully Horizontal Mix)""--  there's a vintage commonality. And when a ringer like Theo Parrish's dub of Rick Wilhite's 96 anthem ""Get on Up!!"" actually does show up, it fits perfectly.</p>
<p>Sweetening the deal is the amount of unreleased material in the mix, much of it contributed by friends and like-minded artists. ""Take Me"" by Australian DJ A+O, re-molds the rubbery pulse and elastic bassline that Detroit techno classic ""Nude Photo"" popularized, yet it transcends superficial nostalgia with a stunning vocal hook. At the other end of the spectrum is ""Like a Child"", recorded by Juan MacLean keyboard player Dennis McNany under the assumed name ""Jee Day"", which layers shimmering, reverbed vocals onto a pseudo-acid bassline to immense effect. And then there's the final peak, ""Feel So Good"", a new Juan MacLean track that builds off a supple drum loop from the late Jerry Fuchs and a coolly detached vocal from LCD Soundsystem's Nancy Whang. All this is the kind of stuff indie-dance fans have good reason to go crazy over, and no cultural anxiety should keep them away from it. A truncated, looped refrain from Florian Meindl's ""Here Today Gone Tomorrow"" comes at an early peak in the mix--  ""house sees no race, creed or--""... fill in the blank with whatever you want after that, because MacLean's set sounds truly universal.</p></div>"|14165.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14165-dj-kicks/|8.1|Nate Patrin

After making a serious blog dent over the past year with a few well-regarded singles and remixes for Cut Copy and Peter Bjorn and John, the duo finally make the leap from web to wax with their debut full-length, <i>Voluspa</i>. While the singles make an impact (borderline bangers ""Solid Gold"" and ""Thunderbird"" both appear here), much of <i>Voluspa</i> indicates the Golden Filter sound best in smaller doses. Clearly most interested in establishing atmosphere, most of the material here is moody and fragile, a bit restrained for the dancefloor and a little too flat and repetitive to be taken anywhere else.</p>
<p>When <i>Voluspa</i> works, it is at best pleasant listening: Stephen Hindman's squelched-out synths and string injections are often both fitting and appealing, and his blasts of big tribal drums and the occasional bass hook help flesh it out. Australian vocalist Penelope Trappes' lithe, comely vocals suggest that no matter how uninformed, you too can become the Dancing Queen with a little luck. But over the span of an hour with this little variation, most of these details begin to feel like stuffing.</p>
<p>Wary to appear bold, the Golden Filter obviously feel most comfortable using understatement, and that's perfectly fine. But when coming off the high of something like ""Solid Gold"", it's hard to get into (or even sit through) the slight, underheated-M83 vibe of something like ""The Underdogs"". It leads you to believe that maybe their early remixes were so warmly received because the band actually had a template to work with. When left to their own devices, they have difficulty providing their songs with an actual structure, and the details lose their punch when echoed on nearly every song. Soon Trappes' vocals begin to sound snoozier, and the most appealing (or at least the most inventive) pieces of Hindman's constructions seem loosely tethered together, leaving little to sink your teeth into.</p></div>"|14143.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14143-voluspa/|5.8|Zach Kelly

That's not terribly indicative of what her new band sounds like, however. Georgie James' polite, unmemorable brand of aughts-era indie pop has very little to do with the full-blown country and soul style of the Mynabirds' debut. Nevertheless, that bit of context highlights a major creative leap for Burhenn. After hearing <i>What We Lose in the Fire We Gain in the Flood</i>, it's difficult to revisit her previous material-- including solo work released prior to Georgie James-- without sensing that she had not yet found her voice. Here, she emerges fully formed with a set of bold, assured songs so elegantly composed that many could pass for old standards.</p>
<p>For many musicians, working within a vintage aesthetic would lapse into pastiche, but Burhenn's blue-eyed soul sounds entirely natural and well-suited to her gifts. The songs stay within the bounds of tradition but give her voice room to establish a nuanced character and presence, where she was once hemmed in by bland tunes and airless production. Since she is hardly alone in going for this sort of sound, her success is largely a matter of achieving the right balances. Burhenn sings with soul and conviction, but also taste and restraint, which keep her from sounding too much like a contestant on ""American Idol"" or an over-sweetened throwback like Duffy. The production, by Richard Swift along with Burhenn, aims for a timeless sound, but allows for just enough modern touches to keep the album from coming across as overly retro.</p>
<p>The material recalls artists such as Dusty Springfield, Laura Nyro, and Linda Rondstadt, but the sound and style come closer to more recent touchstones-- Jenny Lewis' best moments on her own and with Rilo Kiley; Cat Power circa <i>The Greatest</i> and <i>Jukebox</i>; Fiona Apple's collaborations with Jon Brion. At her best, as on the churchy climax of ""What We Gained in the Fire"" and the showstopping ""We Made a Mountain"", Burhenn is as heartbreaking and tuneful as her finest inspirations while investing her songs with a calm fatalism that sets her apart. Although assertive, up-tempo cuts such as the single ""Numbers Don't Lie"" and the stomping ""Let the Record Go"" command the most immediate attention, her pretty yet weary voice is most impressive on slow-burning mid-tempo tracks like ""LA Rain"" and the languid, Velvet Underground-ish ""Ways of Looking"".</p>
<p><i>What We Lose in the Fire</i> is over and out in just over a half hour, which is about the right length of time for this type of album. The songs are tight and consistent; the mood is evocative but doesn't outlast its welcome before completing the emotional arc of the sequencing. The charm of the record isn't a matter of reinventing familiar sounds so much as working within them with comfort and grace. Nothing sounds overworked. If anything, Burhenn and Swift present the songs in an understated manner, confident in the quality of the material and the strength of her voice. They weren't wrong to make that call.</p></div>"|14179.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14179-what-we-lose-in-the-fire-we-gain-in-the-flood/|8.0|Matthew Perpetua

A teenage Hutz immigrated to the United States as a political refugee in the early 1990s at the conclusion of an arduous journey begun in his native Ukraine. Assembling his band in New York City in 1999, he's spent over two decades pouring passion and sweat into establishing Gogol Bordello as one of America's most chaotically enthralling live acts and relentlessly ebullient recording artists.</p>
<p>Hutz's odyssey has been so dogged and so deeply felt that it has become the great subject of his art itself. Much like its predecessors, Gogol Bordello's fifth studio album, the aptly titled <i>Trans-Continental Hustle</i>, is largely about the experience of being Gogol Bordello, about overcoming stigmas against immigrants and America's tacit favoring of bland one-world homogenization in order to carve out a vibrant, warts-and-all space where life can be celebrated and differences cherished. In songs like ""Break the Spell"", ""Raise the Knowledge"", and ""Rebellious Love"" Hutz seems more polemical street philosopher and positivist guru (no wonder Madonna's a fan) than conventional rock frontman, refusing to put any distance or irony between himself and his artistic creations.</p>
<p>In the past, Hutz has rarely allowed songcraft to get in the way of his manic exultations of joy and frenzied bouts of soul-searching. That changes somewhat with <i>Trans-Continental Hustle</i>, as Gogol Bordello work with famed producer Rick Rubin, who ostensibly is largely responsible for a newfound emphasis on nuance and dynamics, in contrast to the always-in-fifth-gear MO that has defined the band. Results are mixed-- ""Sun Is on My Side"" offers lovely accordion and a weary, haunting refrain, but the midtempo ""Uma Menina Uma Cigana"" feels flat and perfunctory, while the lugubriousness of ""When Universes Collide"" actually undermines Hutz's harrowing, poverty-tinged lyrics.</p>
<p>Hutz's emboldening exhortations and the band's sweatily democratic live show make it clear that Gogol Bordello wish to foster a massive brotherhood of open-hearted partiers. Such non-stop full-throttling might work for punk-rock true believers, but the band's inviting uniqueness ensures that its admirers will be more far-flung than that, and most of us don't want to spend our entire lives in the red. In that context it makes sense for Hutz and the group to try taking a more multifarious approach, but honestly it just doesn't play to their strengths. I may only want to join his raucous shindig every now and again, but its nice knowing he's always somewhere tearing the roof off.</p></div>"|14185.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14185-trans-continental-hustle/|6.4|Joshua Love

To listen to the band's records, though, they may as well have never moved. You can still hear Athens in their stuffed, Technicolor indie rock, and their time spent around members of the old Elephant 6 collective is the primary shaper of their sound even today. It's an interesting exercise to go through their five albums in order, ending with this one, and consider where the indie rock mainstream was in relation to this band for each of them. When they were first starting out, they were on the fringe, but their style of emotionally straightforward, heavily arranged music has become one of the defining sounds of indie rock.</p>
<p>And oddly, as things have shifted further their way, they've started to take their sound in a less ornate direction. <i>Little More Lived In </i>has songs as elaborate as any on the band's past albums, but it also brings in more overt classic rock and country influences. In one sense it's the band's most Southern album, with its copious use of banjo, splashes of harmonica, and occasionally twangy vocals. The unfortunate thing about this shift is that the band winds up with a record that's half modern psych, half classic rock-inflected indie, and the disconnect is pretty audible. The contrast is especially sharp on the transition from ""Dad"" to ""Tim's Piano"", where the band ends one of the most humble, unpretentious songs I've heard all year-- a dryly recorded acoustic guitar-and-harmonica tribute to a father that ends with the line ""I love you, Dad""-- and proceeds immediately to an instrumental soaked in reverb and choral backing vocals. Both are decent pieces of music, but they sound worlds apart.</p>
<p>The band bridges its opposing impulses in places-- the psychedelic backing vocals that balance the buzzing guitar solo and bouncing banjo of ""Teenage Queen"", for instance-- but the one place where they attempt an outright merger, on closer ""Land Brains"", is a bit messy, roughing up a long build with a sudden outburst of hoedown banjo and steel guitar that feels forced. Snowglobe seem to be a band in transition on <i>Little More Lived In</i>, trying to find a way to grow beyond the orch-pop niche they've occupied for so long. They're mostly successful in the endeavor here, but it might take one more record to get the balance of elements exactly right.</p></div>"|14184.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14184-little-more-lived-in/|6.7|Joe Tangari

In 1994, <i>Live Through This</i>, Hole's second LP-- released, famously, in the wake of Kurt Cobain's suicide, after Love spent the weekend tottering through a vigil in a Seattle Center park-- was transformative, instructive, and beloved. That harsh, throaty gasp at the end of ""Violet"" was so authentically exhausted it felt like a promise: I'm giving you all I've got. We took it.</p>
<p>In the years since, Love has become less a savior than a punchline, an egomaniacal eccentric who seems to invite tabloid bullshit: the incoherent twittering, the inexplicable brawls (squabbling with Lily Allen about who gets to wear a dress?), the bizarre Facebook apology to Billy Corgan. Sadly, Love's public persona has colored her music for just about everyone-- especially since her celebrity has been so pivotal (and purposeful) in the promotion of her work. Part of Love's appeal is her bravado, and she does her savvy best to substantiate it for us. That she fails, that we cringe, or that any of us still care are all valid lenses; they were provided by Love herself.</p>
<p>The turmoil of the past few years gave fans a reason to hope that <i>Nobody's Daughter</i> might match the vulnerability of <i>Live Through This</i>, reviving the inside-out mania that energized Love's best tracks. What we've gotten instead is a forgettable collection of fairly generic, overproduced rock songs that feel, oddly, like a put-on-- despite her public meltdowns, Love remains preoccupied with posture and pose. She's buried, hiding behind a deliberate holler and dopey choruses, compulsively over-singing without ever saying much. Is it greedy to want Love's wildness-- all that vanity and fury and humor and trauma-- to animate her music? What are we allowed to demand from Courtney Love? More than this. <i>Nobody's Daughter</i> is heartbreakingly banal.</p>
<p>This is Hole's fourth record, but that designation feels like a technicality-- there's not much to distinguish it from Love's solo work. Of course, Hole has always been something of a rotating ensemble, but it was anchored by a partnership between Love and guitarist Eric Erlandson, who is notably absent. There are a few oddball credits (Martha Wainwright, pianist Thomas Bartlett aka Doveman, and John Zorn-collaborating cellist Erik Friedlander all appear), and an employed cabal of co-writers, including Linda Perry, guitarist Pete Thorn, and Corgan.</p>
<p>Some tracks, like the Hole/Corgan/Perry collaboration ""Pacific Coast Highway"" (which nods to <i>Celebrity Skin</i>'s ""Malibu"", in both content and style), show hints of earnestness: ""I'm overwrought and so disgraced/ I'm too ashamed to show my face,"" Love sings, her voice cracking over pristine guitar. Later, things get mucked up by an unnecessary solo (by Hole's new lead guitarist, 24-year old Micko Larkin), but it's enough of a window to make listeners question what these songs might have done had they not been filtered through years of overwrites and third-party input. Same goes for ""Letter to God"", which suffers from a silly conceit, but offers moments of genuine humility (""I never wanted to be/ Some kind of comic relief/ Please show me who I am."")</p>
<p>Love's voice is garbled and withering, and there are times, as on ""Someone Else's Bed"", where her voice sounds uncomfortably like Bob Dylan's. But the guitars are so dated, raunchy, and overstated that every track starts to feel like cartoon-rock-- more a Sunset Strip-rehash than grunge nostalgia, even-- and Love's lyrics (""I'm a lost soooooul!"") are plastic and artless. Despite its few fleeting moments of honesty, <i>Nobody's Daughter</i> ultimately feels like a badly missed opportunity.</p></div>"|14178.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14178-nobodys-daughter/|2.9|Amanda Petrusich

As his band saunters around him, frontlad Avigdor Zahner-Isenberg finds himself ""lost in your summer cum"" and puzzles over mortality: ""Too much time to die,"" he and bandmate Rebecca Coleman sing in unison, ""and I don't wanna die."" His voice, never too far from a crack, lends that riff on impermanence the same weight as his takes on young lust.</p>
<p>For all their age-appropriate fumbling, Avi Buffalo seem graceful beyond their years as songwriters. As many starkly intimate moments as they muster, a few of their tunes unfurl into near-epic lengths, gallantly breezing through moods and motifs. Snatches of Wilco's easy early-2000s amble, Built to Spill's curly fretwork, and Shins-y shuffle turn up everywhere here, occasionally all at once. The sound is tangled-- they take the scenic route to their best ideas-- but each move feels carefully considered. Spend enough time unspooling the tunes, and little pockets in these compositions start to open up, revealing an uncommon regard for detail and-- in the case of Zahner-Isenberg's guitar flittering-- a rather deft musicianship.</p>
<p>All that helps pass off their sweet, redolent, and pretty damn twee lyrical outlook; ""I've never written a love song,"" Zahner-Isenberg sings several love songs deep into the album, later noting, ""but I will for you,"" and that-- plus a good bit of dirty talk, literal and otherwise-- constitutes their worldview at the moment. But what might come across as merely cutesy from another writer feels deeply felt and finely tuned here; lots of lovesick teenager wannabes dumb it down, but he smarts it up, throwing lots of rich images and headstrong proclamations into his not-always-sweet nothings. It's not so much diaristic as it is the kind of too-forward-in-hindsight shit you say to someone you're trying to get with at that age; it can be awkward, but it's an awkwardness he seems oddly comfortable with.</p>
<p>And Avi Buffalo have every reason to be sure of themselves; this sneakily complex, unsappily sentimental, thoughtfully naïve debut is a very early success. There might be some moments that wander a bit off course, a few solos that could've wound down a minute early, or a couple of lyrics a tad too ribald for their starlit surroundings. But to be young is to be a bit clumsy sometimes, after all. And Avi Buffalo are, as they'll remind you, young yet.</p></div>"|14175.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14175-avi-buffalo/|7.9|Paul Thompson

In a February 2010 interview with <a href=""http://www.noisecreep.com/2010/02/04/daughters-frontman-has-mixed-feelings-about-new-lp/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Noisecreep.com</a>, Marshall all but says so while discussing the new album: ""[Former guitarist] Nick [Sadler] wrote a lot of the stuff on there, and he was really looking to make it accessible, and see how it fared... There are definitely parts of the record that were written to see how people will respond, which is kind of disappointing.""</p>
<p>If Sadler's name sounds familiar, it's probably from the decidedly non-Daughters-like charms of his other group, Fang Island.  While he's not officially credited as a songwriter-- the songs on <i>Daughters</i> are attributed to the entire group-- Sadler is listed as a co-producer, which might explain the album's relatively less abrasive sound.  Relative to other Daughters records, at least: Those hoping for the abrupt spasms from the group's 11-minute debut, or the slightly less abstract  math essayed on <i>Hell Songs</i>, are going to be sorely disappointed when they drop the needle on ""The Virgin"". Most of the song's elements-- the frantic double-timed drumming, the insect-like chatter of the guitars-- are familiar from older Daughters' tracks. Its verse-chorus structure, on the other hand, isn't. And neither is Marshall's vocal transformation into a smooth and confident David Yow impersonator.  Even the song titles are streamlined.  While these moves might seem like capitulations of some sort, the band doesn't pull any punches because of them.</p>
<p>In fact, this refinement actually serves to focus Daughters' energies.  There's still room for flashes of the manic fretwork and double-bass drum damage of old in tracks like the thick and brutal ""The Dead Singer"", or ""Our Queens"", a song that's equal parts fractured mathcore and fist-pumping punk anthem.  That said, pummeling hook-filled songs like the ""The Hit"" or ""Sweet Georgia Brown"" are the new norm.  The moves made here are no different than the recent ""pop"" moves made by equally uncompromising bands like the Dillinger Escape Plan, Converge, and Torche-- each of those bands still sound like themselves, but they're also open to change and wholly willing to evolve into something else, fan backlash be damned.  It's just a shame Daughters couldn't survive this transformation. As I said earlier, hardcore Daughters lovers will probably have plenty of bones to pick with this album.  For everyone else, <i>Daughters</i> is a feast to be savored.</p></div>"|14186.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14186-daughters/|8.2|David Raposa

Sometimes, the flow of inspiration works in the other direction. How else to explain the prevalence of tiny indie artists trying to sound like Justin Timberlake, replete with stuttering beats, synthesizer squelches, and processed vocals? This is the approach of Rafter Roberts on <i>Animal Feelings</i>. Previous records by the San Diego-based producer contained messy, disjointed, and often stunning spazz-pop that combined his channel-flipping aesthetic with an ear for sweet melodies. Here, he's decided to gloss it up, take it to the dancefloor, and get dirty.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Rafter seems to be missing the point of the artists that he's aping. His use of Auto-Tune on songs like ""No Fucking Around"" feels like an egghead's experiment. Amongst handclaps and a repetitive cowbell, he tries to urge the song forward with a Timberlake-like whispered come-on of ""take it the chorus."" But without blossoming into an actual memorable chorus, the words are just an impotent instruction. Elsewhere, like a little kid, Rafter uses profanity gleefully, as if he can't believe he has gotten away with repeating ""you motherfuckers"" over and over again on ""Paper"". It's like he's hoping to bait censors and trying for a ""clean-version"" whitewash, but since these songs are never going to be heard on commercial radio, who really cares? These songs are too clinical to be sexy, too affected to feel real.</p>
<p>There's only one out-and-out dud here, the embarrassingly bad ""Love Makes You Happy"", complete with spoken-word breakdowns and cheesy power chords. And there are a few brief glimpses of success, such as ""Timeless Form, Formless Time (When It's Not Making You Sad)"", which sounds like a breezy Islands track as played by a stomping marching band. Not coincidentally, the best moments happen to be when Rafter gives up on the heavy-breathing, R&amp;B-influenced electro-pop theme.</p>
<p>It's a good thing that indie rock has an interest in erotic dancefloor come-ons and aggressively sensual R&amp;B, and bands like Of Montreal have made careers of bringing sexy back to a certain type of audience. But while <i>Animal Feelings</i> has good instincts, it is still too cerebral and impressed with its own production flourishes to actually be fun. You can't make big-sounding pop if you can't write a killer hook or sing-along chorus. And Rafter, for all his production savvy, hasn't quite mastered those skills yet.</p></div>"|14151.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14151-animal-feelings/|5.0|Rebecca Raber

As the leader of Portland, Ore., folk outfit Horse Feathers, he's trawled in dark subject matter that recalls Southern gothic authors William Faulkner and Flannery O'Connor. Words like ""regret"" and ""shame"" make regular appearances in his lyrics-- alongside references to hard church pews, blood-stained snow, and sinners who take human and animal forms. All this misery may come across as disingenuous considering the band's PacNW roots, but somehow Horse Feathers have managed to rise above being consigned as cultural backseat drivers, weaving hushed, ornate arrangements that ably serve Ringle's uneasy imagery.</p>
<p>2008's <i>House With No Name</i> was slightly more sprightly than Horse Feathers' 2006 debut, the dourly titled <i>Words Are Dead</i>, but there was still an undercurrent of depression, owed both to the droning hum provided by cellist/vocalist Catherine Odell and Ringle's voice. However, on their third effort, <i>Thistled Spring</i>, there's a definite change of sonic mood. On previous albums, melodies remained unshaped beyond anything but their own emotional cores, but there's real movement here, as the many parts that make up the arrangements push and pull with one another instead of simply congealing. Album standout ""Belly of June"" swoops and dives in a major key, while the thrushing yawns of ""The Drought"" and the urgency of ""Veronia Blues"" render a drummer's presence (something Horse Feathers don't have) irrelevant.</p>
<p>Clearly, the band has found a new level of confidence. Ringle, in particular, sounds more full-throated, exuding a physicality on ""As a Ghost"" and ""Belly of June"" that adds color to his still-bleak subject matter. Speaking of, there's plenty of talk about ill-fitting nooses, abusive frost, disastrous floods, and whatnot-- but it's Ringle's descriptions of nature's temperate splendor that stick with you this time around, as he muses on lark's looks or faith-stealing heat with equal passion as he does on the futility of living. So ignore the melodrama and enjoy the littler pleasures that are provided on <i>Thistled Spring</i>-- and there are quite a few. You can hear them in the space between Ringle's voice and the band's interplay, the zithering strings in ""Starving Robins"", the build and burst midway through ""Belly of June"". Complex, yes, but complexity that's expressed in a rather straightforward manner, while embracing a newfound sense of bright coherence. Spring's finally arrived, and hopefully for Horse Feathers, it'll stick around.</p></div>"|14181.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14181-thistled-spring/|7.5|Larry Fitzmaurice

They've admirably honored their genre's history every step of the way, incorporating elements of vintage Slumberland noise-pop, sadder 80s UK indie sounds, and the kind of romantic, low-key dance-pop typically associated with Saint Etienne, or more recently, the Tough Alliance. The band's relatively low profile is partly due to the infrequency of their output: Up to now, they've released only two LPs throughout their 13-year  career, along with a handful of EPs and singles.</p>
<p>As with their last two albums, <i>Clinging to a Scheme</i> stands to further expand the Radio Dept.'s cult. Economy has never been an issue for the band, but here, things are further tightened up: Clocking in at just 34 minutes, this album is their shortest and most finely-tuned yet, moving at a rapid clip while maintaining a sense of balance and even pacing-- a pretty remarkable show of restraint and dedication for a record that has ostensibly been in the works for four years. (Their last full-length, <i>Pet Grief</i>, was released way back in 2006.) The improved fidelity helps, too: These songs sparkle with striking  clarity in contrast to past works, while retaining all the glowing, sun-soaked ambiance that's become a signature.</p>
<p><i>Clinging to a Scheme</i> shows the Radio Dept. working with an extended range of sounds. While the core elements of these songs will be plenty familiar to longtime fans, the band manages to tweak the formula slightly for each track. The sparkly, Balearic ""Heaven's on Fire"" and the downbeat dub of  ""Never Follow Suit"" are clear highlights, particularly on first spin. But repeat plays reveal this record's almost bottomless depth, as different tracks and subtle elements gradually reveal themselves with each listen: The sugar-rushed urgency of ""This Time Around"" or the complex ""David"", which is sunny and bright musically but lyrically wistful, are just two of eight other reasons this album rewards every ounce of attention you give it.</p>
<p>Great songs, higher fidelity: It should be a recipe for contentment, yet frontman Johan Duncanson remains discouraged by life's challenges. ""Seemed like a good idea at one time/ But now it's all wrong,"" he sings on opener ""Domestic Scene"", and it doesn't get any cheerier from there. Although the Radio Dept. weren't regularly active until 1998, the project was concieved by Duncanson three years earlier along with a few schoolmates; in other words, his lyrics have been rooted in boyhood melancholia since day one. Duncanson doesn't show any signs of leaving that behind on <i>Clinging to a Scheme</i>, uttering lines in ""A Token of Gratitude"" that evoke pure melodrama: ""Do I love you?/ Yes, I love you/ But easy come, easy go.""</p>
<p>But that's part of The Radio Dept.'s charm and identity, and the music itself is generally brighter, which makes for an engaging contrast while preventing the tone of the songs from becoming maudlin. The strongest moments on <i>Clinging to a Scheme</i>, such as the aforementioned ""Heaven's on Fire"" and ""Never Follow Suit"", are effortlessly catchy and upbeat. Album closer ""You Stopped Making Sense"" is especially cloud-clearing, as Duncanson hits his upper register among deliciously bent guitar strings, moaning about another love lost. It's a bittersweet ending for <i>Clinging to a Scheme</i>, but for the Radio Dept.'s already decade-plus career, it may be a whole new beginning.</p></div>"|14146.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14146-clinging-to-a-scheme/|8.3|Larry Fitzmaurice

Never begrudging his role as a right-hand man, he's always seemed pleased just to be in the fold. One of the more recognizable characters in the past 20 years of West Coast hip-hop, Kurupt earned his stripes as a snarling, smoked-out, dangerously funny guy who bears a cross that the best character actors do: Often responsible for his projects' juiciest moments (nearly all of his tracks on Dre's <i>2001</i>), he's soon resigned to the background.</p>
<p>After last year's lauded <i>BlaQKout</i>, a team-up with underground legend DJ Quik, Kurupt seemed primed for a late-career renaissance, so long as he made the right alliances. Unfortunately, partnering with producer Terrace Martin wasn't a good choice. On paper it should have worked-- up-and-comer Martin is best-known for his work with Kurupt's friend and contemporary Snoop Dogg. But Martin, who produced all but one cut here (the terrific Pete Rock-helmed ""Yessir), is <i>Streetlights</i>' biggest weakness; he offers a selection of flat songs that ultimately come across as stale. Kurupt is left to make the most of what he has to work with, often trying uncomfortably to force a strong club-banger or aggressively spun street tale with little to fill out the weaker parts.</p>
<p>Martin has a few strong shots in the mix-- ""I'm Drunk"" feels like an updated Compton house-party jam, evoking another of Kurupt's scene-stealing moments from<i> 2001 </i>(""Let's Get High""), and ""I'm the Man"" reins things in a little and gives Kurupt the space he needs to ruminate. But the missteps overshadow the positive notes in ways that are too obvious to ignore. Martin plunders the most pallid moments of the hyphy movement on single ""I'm Burnt"" (which pops up again in remix form later even though hearing it once was more than enough) and later on ""Face Down"", its murderous theme rendered borderline comical in light of its thin, cheesy bounce. Despite the album's title (Kurupt has described it as a depiction of
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
street life from the point-of-view of a streetlight), Martin pushes the club appeal, but with material that feels previously discarded or simply phoned-in.</p>
<p>While there are bits of great humor and wordplay scattered throughout (occasionally spat out in dizzying double time), the fogged-over choruses, tough-guy posturing (""In Gotti We Trust""), and spurts of disquieting misogyny (""Scrape"") feel like too much padding. On ""Questions"", reminiscent of Dre's dirty laundry-airing ""What's the Difference"", Kurupt addresses a series of inquiries-- his involvement with Suge Knight and, of course, ""Is he gonna be on Detox?""-- and answers not a single one of them, leaving the whole thing hanging. It's a shame because it would be interesting to hear Kurupt's take on these issues, but it's a good way to describe<i> Streetlights</i> on the whole: promising, sometimes intriguing, but ultimately unavailable for comment.</p></div>"|14158.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14158-streetlights/|4.8|Zach Kelly

Devin Ocampo and Chad Molter formed the band from the ashes of Faraquet, and on the group's debut EP and first LP, there was a clear tension between the knotty, agile post-punk of their former group and a more pop-informed tendency. Five years later, drummer Andrew Becker has moved on, and that more melodic side of the band has won out. Perhaps having to cover the drums as well as the guitar and bass put the remaining duo in a more studio-oriented frame of mind, but whatever the reason, there's more layering here, and a much greater focus on tunes, resulting in the band's best album.</p>
<p>One of the keys to the album's success is that Ocampo and Molter haven't abandoned the tricky meter changes, angular riffs, and sharp musicianship that have always been their trademark. They've merely subjugated those elements of their style to catchy songs that move the band further toward the indie rock mainstream. When a wild flurry of guitar lurches out from behind the vocals on ""Home Is Where We Are"", the tangle of notes is no longer an end in itself-- it's an exclamation point that punches home a key turn of phrase in the melody. ""Seasons"" rivals their last album opener ""Surprise!"" for the best thing the band's ever done, as Ocampo and Molter trade off vocals as the guitars slash and chime. In short, it's a rush, and the surprising ""doot doot"" backing harmonies are a welcome dash of sugar to complement the spice of the guitars.</p>
<p>For an album recorded as dry and straight as this one, it can be oddly psychedelic. Instrumental ""Kilometers and Smiles"" gives the band a chance to scratch its prog itch, and the way the heavy fuzz guitar interacts with the wordless vocal harmonies creates a trippy atmosphere. Parts sound like Black Sabbath or King Crimson, parts sound like George Harrison or Roy Harper.</p>
<p>In other places, dabs of sax and clarinet accomplish a similar effect, helping to bring the gentle, partly acoustic arrangement of the album's quiet centerpiece, ""Brasil '07"", to life. The song bears hallmarks of its namesake country, expanding the band's musical vocabulary a great deal. Between the expanded palette and the consistently punchy songs, <i>Completely Removed</i> is an impressive return for Medications. The band's sound has evolved into one that should appeal to those who never went for the tangle of Faraquet or the band's earlier tendency to split the difference between songcraft and instrumental fireworks.</p></div>"|14159.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14159-completely-removed/|7.8|Joe Tangari

Al Atrache was Syrian, the rest were Egyptian, and all four are genuine legends in the Arab-speaking world, their music still widely played and loved. Omar Khorshid played guitar in the orchestras of two of them. He made his first foray into professional music in the mid-60s, playing in one of the Arab world's first beat groups, Les Petit Chats, and in 1968, Hafez saw them perform in Alexandria, Egypt, and asked Khorshid to join his group. Hafez worked at the time with innovative composer Baligh Hamdi, and with Khorshid in the band, they made some amazing recordings that broadened the scope of Egyptian orchestral pop music.</p>
<p>Khorshid eventually found himself playing guitar for Oum Kalthoum, perhaps the most beloved singer the Arab world has ever had-- playing in her orchestra was the height of prestige, and to say she's still loved is a bit like saying people still think the Beatles are pretty okay. Khorshid's guitar became a part of pop landscape in the Arab world, which was centered on Egypt and Lebanon. When he moved to Lebanon in 1973, Beirut was as yet untouched by the wars that would unravel its reputation as one of the world's most cosmopolitan, vibrant cities, and Khorshid was already a true giant. The music he made in Lebanon from 1973 to 1977 is the source for <i>Guitar El Chark</i>, the first official compilation of his work under his own name to be released in the West.</p>
<p>Sublime Frequencies has pulled out all the stops, issuing a gorgeous double vinyl set with a short biography in the gatefold and almost 90 minutes of music. It's a long overdue treatment for an enormously creative and vital talent. Khorshid fused the techniques of traditional Arabic oud players with Western sounds and exposing the eastern Mediterranean roots of American surf guitar music in the process. The recordings here, drawn from soundtracks and albums-- including a few Khorshid records that were marketed in the West under the exotica/bellydance banner-- show a restless desire to experiment with musical technologies just finding their way to Beirut at the time.</p>
<p>The first song I ever heard by Khorshid was his ripping outer space surf rendition of Farid Al Atrache's classic ""Hebbina Hebbina"", which is included here with new remastering-- it's a perfect encapsulation of what made his sound so interesting and has long sent exotica buffs searching for his albums. The twitching traditional rhythms, garage-y organ, and Space Age guitar sound are instantly appealing, and the relative novelty for Western listeners is quickly transcended by the tunefulness and astounding musicianship of the playing. Also included is one of Khorshid's own versions of ""Enta Omri"", a song composed by Mohamed Abdel Wahab that became one of Oum Kalthoum's best-loved hits. Khorshid's take is sinewy and agile, moving boldly through a song that nearly everyone in Khorshid's audience would have known and capturing a piece of it for himself.</p>
<p>The compilation closes with a record company promo spot for one of Khorshid's albums that curiously uses a version of the theme from the James Bond film <i>You Only Live Twice</i> as its backing music, and in many ways, it's an oddly melancholy end to the set. It's a brief, stark glimpse of the cultural bleed that made the rest of this music possible, and in fact there's a ""what might have been"" cloud that hangs over this music today. What if the West and Middle East had given in to our fascination with each other instead of our suspicion of one another?</p>
<p>Khorshid's own life may have ended early because of the conflicts that still plague us today: He left Lebanon in 1976 to escape the war and returned to Egypt after some time in Syria. When Egyptian President Anwar Sadat traveled to Washington to sign a peace treaty with Israel in 1977, Khorshid came along. He and Jewish violinist Yehudi Menuhin performed together to mark the occasion, and many extremists never forgave him. Khorshid was just 36 and had already survived a few assassination attempts when he died in a suspicious car crash, a few months before Sadat himself was murdered. While we never got to hear where Khorshid might have taken his music had he lived, he had already taken it plenty of interesting places before his death.</p></div>"|14171.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14171-guitar-el-chark/|8.1|Joe Tangari

Smith. He's played such a variety of styles-- woodsy atmospheres with Thuja, psych-rock with Mirza, folk experiments as Hala Strana-- that his consistency seems unfair. He's the kind of guy who might wake up one day, thumb drowsily through his record collection and think, ""I'm in the mood for Neil Young, Fushitsusha, and Popol Vuh... maybe I'll start a project that sounds like the way I hear all of them together in my head."" In fact, it sounds like he did-- Ulaan Khol, his latest solo venture, makes lonely, feedback-smeared instrumentals, with a classic aura that feels like an archeological discovery. Now I'm even more jealous.</p>
<p><i>III</i> follows 2008's<i> I</i> and <i>II</i>, concluding a ""maximalist three-part suite"" that Smith calls ""Ceremony"". This may not be the best installment, but it's the most diverse and engaging. That's due to Smith's adding more bass and drums to his guitar journeys, as well as injecting more melody into his noisy haze. There are still lots of plaintive guitar-only pieces, rightly compared in press materials to the desolate reverb of Neil Young's <i>Dead Man </i>soundtrack. But the cuts that hit hardest have a rock thrust, like elongated psych breaks liberated from the shackles of verse-chorus-verse.</p>
<p>Take track two (all the pieces here are untitled), which follows the album's dark opener with a thundering all-out groove. It recalls two great underground psych/noise outfits, Japan's Marble Sheep and Portland's Davis Redford Triad, and the way they make a wandering guitar jam feel as uplifting as a hot-air balloon ride. But the track also has an accessibility that reaches overground into the territory of Jimi Hendrix's woolier explorations. Its song-like structure echoes through the rest of the album, so that even noisier, drumless pieces take on traceable shapes.</p>
<p>Still, the heart of this project is solo guitar journeys, and <i>III</i> ends with Ulaan Khol's longest one-- a 10-minute stretch of strumming that folds slowly into dissonance. It's hypnotic and immersive, but if you prefer clarity to volume, you might find it more disorienting than soothing. An album of only those treks would probably appeal solely to diehards, but the ""Ceremony"" trilogy is wider than that.

But that tricky balance-- between buzzsaw aggression, mathematical complexity, and bubblegum accessibility-- the Sunderland quartet once deftly executed proved difficult to strike on subsequent releases. The result was a more pedestrian, power-pop aesthetic, and, by 2008's <i>This Is Not the World</i>, a band once near the head of the post-millennial post-punk class was threatening to be demoted to one of its also-rans. It's a situation the Futureheads themselves seem all too aware of-- as singer Barry Hyde observes toward the end of their new, fourth album: ""The first 5,000 miles/ Are the hardest steps to take/ But then your autopilot/ Kicks in for the journey's sake."" Fortunately, with <i>The Chaos</i>, the Futureheads kick the robots out of the captain's deck and switch off the cruise control, resulting in a more accelerated journey marked by more sharp left turns than the group attempted on its past two albums.</p>
<p>But if <i>The Chaos</i> is supposed to represent a hit of the reset button, the Futureheads couldn't have selected a more misleading single than ""Heartbeat Song""-- skinny-tied new wave dressed up in modern-rock clothing, landing somewhere between XTC's <i>Drums and Wires</i> and the Warped Tour. Thankfully, it proves to be more an exit point from <i>This Is Not the World</i>'s overdriven anthemery than a continuation of it; the rest of <i>The Chaos</i> mostly captures the Futureheads playing to their strength: channelling everyday miseries into manic energy.</p>
<p>The best Futureheads originals (""Decent Days and Nights"", ""First Day"") left you feeling alternately exhilarated and disoriented, abruptly stopping just as you acclimatized yourself to their delirious logic and rhythm. It's a sensation ably approximated here by ""Stop the Noise"" and ""The Connector"", the latter a song about electricity that, appropriately, is wound tighter than a magnetic coil, its mechanistic drive routinely jolted by shocks of group harmony. And even when the choruses don't quite deliver the promised payoff (see: the repeated titular hollers of ""I Can Do That"" and ""Sun Goes Down""), the tense verse/bridge build-ups are gratifying.</p>
<p>But if <i>The Chaos</i> marks the point where the Futureheads admit to themselves that the past ain't so bad, closing track ""Jupiter""-- clocking in at a career-topping four minutes-- points to an intriguing new direction where the Futureheads apply their eccentricities to lengthier, more conceptual pieces. After all, that first Futureheads album contained so many structural shifts, operatic harmonies, and loopy melodic fragments, it was practically a prog-rock album smashed into two-minute smithereens; ""Jupiter"" suggests the possibility that the sum could be as great as the parts.</p></div>"|14173.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14173-the-chaos/|7.3|Stuart Berman

That's certainly his prerogative, but it's not great for those who love the things he can do with a four-minute tune. Throughout his admirable yet frustrating career, Wainwright's assorted passions (for opera, for theatre, for Judy Garland) have led his music down paths that were often more intriguing in theory than execution. He should be lauded for allowing nothing to dictate his artistic choices, with the understanding that such boldness opens him up for criticism when he bites off more than he can chew.</p>
<p>However, the real danger with an artist who listens solely to his own muse is that he'll cut off the outside world, making music that can't be related to or enjoyed by anyone but himself. Wainwright gets closer than ever to that vanishing point of self-absorption on his latest effort, <i>All Days Are Nights: Songs for Lulu</i>. The only things you hear on the album are Wainwright's voice and his piano, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. The problem is that he wants you to luxuriate in both when it's far more likely you'll feel like you're drowning, given how rarely Wainwright buoys the listener with an actual melody or memorable lyric.</p>
<p>Wainwright's biography is fascinating-- child of famed folk singers Loudon Wainwright III and the recently departed Kate McGarrigle, an openly gay performer who's been an outspoken social activist yet also battled serious addictions. Still, it's a bit much for Wainwright to ask his listeners to follow as he enumerates Big Apple landmarks (""Who Are You New York?"") or sings for six minutes in French (""Les feux d'artifice t'appellent"") or transcribes a phone conversation with his singer-songwriter sister (""Martha""). This is particularly true if our only accompaniment is going to be plodding piano chords and mooning vocals (a symptom that's stretched to almost-hilarious extremes on ""Zebulon"" when Wainwright resorts to sounding the same single piano note several times in succession).</p>
<p>Even when the words are gift-wrapped for him, however, Wainwright struggles. Three of the album's songs find him setting music to Shakespeare sonnets, but only his arrangement of ""Sonnet 20"", often held up as proof of the Bard's homosexuality, manages to avoid being a droning mess that actually saps power from those legendary verses. As for the most salvageable of the songs that are solely Wainwright's own, ""The Dream"" is admittedly movingly sung, but the only genuine keeper is ""True Loves"", a heartbreaking tune about how happy lovers make lonely people feel miserable that's so universal in sentiment it feels like a modern-day standard. Something anyone can enjoy-- imagine that.</p></div>"|14156.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14156-all-days-are-nights-songs-for-lulu/|3.9|Joshua Love

""Perhaps the greatest drummer ever,"" reads a quote from Brian Eno; ""Without Tony Allen, there'd be no Afrobeat,"" reads a quote from the late Fela Kuti. And then there's the cover of the album proper, which features the matter-of-fact sub-tag ""another one from the underground sensation."" Yet despite all the falir, it's that last one-- ""underground sensation"" that stings, and really rings true. Allen has never crossed over and become a name of wide renown, and oddly his Nonesuch debut could give the drummer his widest platform to date. Yet <i>Secret Agent</i> is only the latest step of a creative continuum set in motion over 40 years ago, beginning with Allen's pioneering and prolific work in Fela Kuti's band through his years as a solo act and bandleader and even, a few years back, as a quiet but important component of Damon Albarn's the Good, the Bad &amp; the Queen project.</p>
<p>""Another one from the underground sensation"" both sums up <i>Secret Agent</i> and sells Allen a little short. After all, Allen's particular genius has been his ability to lie just behind the beat, pushing and pulling the song without calling too much attention to himself. But just because he flies below the radar hardly makes him a blip. Even on an Allen solo record, this holds true. <i>Secret </i>frequently directs your attention to the song's component parts-- the backing brass, Cameroonian guitarist Claude Dibongue's jazzy licks, Rody Cereyon's funky bass on tracks like ""Ijo"" or ""Ayenlo"". (Those two feature R&amp;B-like vocals from Orobiyi Adunni, one of several guest singers; Allen himself grumbles lead on the title track and album closer ""Elewon Po"".) In fact, it's so easy to get lost in these elements that Allen almost blends into the background, camouflaged, his cymbal pings, rolls, and ghost strokes like rivets holding the whole construct together.</p>
<p>Granted, <i>Secret Agent</i> doesn't represent Afrobeat at its most fiery, but it does represent Allen (nearing 70) continuing his late career high, mellow in the way he swings songs like ""Busybody"" or ""Pariwo"" (the latter surprisingly strident nonetheless despite its gentle, accordion-laden gait) but never more confident. Leave it to Fela scions Seun and Femi (among other aspirants to the Afrobeat throne) to swagger like they've got something to prove. But Tony Allen? Allen as always lies back and waits for you to come to <i>him</i>.</p></div>"|14168.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14168-secret-agent/|7.4|Joshua Klein

Play to your strengths, focus on what really matters, and you can make your message connect-- whatever the medium. DaVinci's debut record, <i>The Day the Turf Stood Still</i>, has been building an unusual amount of buzz for a Bay Area street rapper, particularly for a record that sounds like a conservative New York rap release. It's full of classicist NYC breakbeat loops and dense raps from an artist with a dry, static demeanor. It contains almost no aesthetic daring. But rap heads are buzzing about it for a reason, and that has a lot to do with not only DaVinci's skills as a rapper but his overarching sense of purposefulness-- he knows how to make you care.</p>
<p>DaVinci grew up in San Francisco's Fillmore district, in the shadow of his Bay Area heroes like San Quinn and Messy Marv. He also arrived at a time when Bay Area rap has been flourishing, thanks to dynamic personalities (The Jacka, Husalah) and a shift in production styles from the classic West Coast Mob Music to the more omnivorous, populist approach of producers like DJ Fresh and the Mecanix. The Bay had begun to reinvent itself by reinventing New York, just as the latter city's national hip-hop profile had dimmed. DaVinci's record does feel like a part of this mutated New York movement, but in a distinct way. <i>Turf </i>is a firmly underground record, with none of the expansive choruses or crisply engineered synthesizer samples that characterize new Bay hip-hop. Additionally, DaVinci's lyrics push towards traditional concrete narratives, a retreat from contemporary Bay rap's more persona-driven styles.</p>
<p>On first listen, to a rap fan unfamiliar with the Bay Area sound, DaVinci's record might sound like yet another rehash, another NY rapper who still can't get over the day Swizz discovered his Casio. But <i>The Day the Turf Stood Still</i> feels like an attempt to do something unique within the Bay's insular world, all while retaining the new Bay's characteristic cannibalizing of different moments in rap history. While his aesthetic isn't ambitious, his wider goals as an artist, his views on the world outside the music, seem like the kind of thing that fans of rap from all corners might find appealing. <i>T</i><span><i>h</i></span><i>e Day the Turf Stood Still</i> is strongly rooted in a sense of place-- specifically, his family's Fillmore origins. ""What You Finna Do""s ambling noir is the most explicitly political, a gangster's ennui in the face of gentrification's corruption of San Francisco's Harlem. But the most fascinating track is ""Idle Mind"", which succeeds despite its embrace of one of underground hip-hop's most regrettable clichés-- the twist-ending story. Despite that, it remains emotionally rending, a testament to DaVinci's ability to get a lot of mileage out of a limited template.</p>
<p>Hang out with some older jazz musicians and you'll hear them describe younger players-- often highly fluent, well-rehearsed ones-- with one dismissive phrase: ""he ain't sayin nothin."" There are some acclaimed rappers today who fall easily into a similar category, relying heavily on street pedigree, class, or cultural signifying, or an overemphasis on tongue-twisting technical expertise. Charisma and creativity, musicality and personality, and particularly the idea of having something worth saying-- all more abstract criteria, admittedly-- can easily be shortchanged by those looking for the next hyphy to change the world. DaVinci's biggest strength is that while he embraces the aesthetic conservatism of 90s New York, a measured, uninterrupted monotone with a clearly-articulated cadence, he doesn't let that be the end itself; it's just a medium to convey a higher cause, to establish a rapper whose personality builds gradually from the content of his lyrics. This approach to music works so well, not in spite of his musical choices, but also not because of them; it works because his personality, as little outward swag as it demonstrates, feels true.</p></div>"|14167.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14167-the-day-the-turf-stood-still/|7.6|David Drake

That's not to say Karin Dreijer Andersson and Olof Dreijer don't have influences, but the music they've created still feels deeply their own. Predictably enough, soundalikes have been slow in surfacing.</p>
<p>Los Angeles-based electro-poppers We Are the World are one of the first groups to gain traction with a sound that invites comparisons to the Knife. At times on WATW's debut, <i>Clay Stones</i>, the similarity is frighteningly mimetic, and the references are almost always at least hovering on the horizon-- the menacing synths, the cold rhythmic precision, the heavily treated vocals. There's even a shared affinity for elaborate costumes, masks, and performance art overtures, taken to its logical extreme by WATW's counting among the group's official ranks a full-time dancer as well as a choreographer.</p>
<p><i>Clay Stones</i> is unfortunately sequenced, front-loading the group's most derivative efforts to the extent that some listeners may be compelled to give up altogether before the album's latter tracks actually show WATW starting to find their own voice. The domineering sonics and dramatic pitch-shifting of opening cut ""Foot Follows Foot"" are ripped straight from Karin and Olof's playbook, as are the doomy vocal gimmicks of the title track, ""Fight Song"", and ""Not in Death"" and the shivering synths of ""Fight Song"" and ""Afire"".</p>
<p>Other minor influences may poke through from time to time, particularly in the vocals of frontwoman Megan Gold, who often evokes strident singers like Annie Lennox and PJ Harvey when her voice isn't being grievously manipulated. Still, not until ""Clover and Dirt"" does <i>Clay Stones</i> really start to point toward a genuinely interesting and individually sustainable artistic direction for WATW. That song's noisy, messy abrasion is a welcome change of pace from the icy over-compartmentalization that comes before, and the group approvingly carries it forward on the bruisingly anthemic album stand-out ""Goya Monster"" and art-damaged instrumental ""Sweet Things Are So Hard"". WATW certainly appear to have enough ideas of their own to carve out a unique identity, so it'd be a shame if they settled for being a glorified tribute act.</p></div>"|14155.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14155-clay-stones/|4.9|Joshua Love

On their new album, <i>Subiza</i>, the Spanish four-piece deploys the build-and-burst tempos of 90s house and techno music, and they do so explicitly, never shying away from arms-in-the-air piano bridges or incandescent raves. This music is proudly informed by the resiliency and vigor of classic club music, and its title (named after the Basque town in which the album was recorded) recalls the famously nightclub-centric Ibiza and the Balearic dance music that originated there.</p>
<p>Delorean's musical growth isn't far removed from the evolution of Primal Scream. Like Delorean, Primal Scream were a dance-rock band with more traditional, rock-leaning origins (Delorean formed as a no-frills indie group) who ended up embracing druggy dance subculture. Over time, <i>Screamadelica</i> became a part of the 1990s pop firmament to the point where it no longer sounds like a blending of much of anything. Depending on which ways the trend-winds blow, observers may one day question why <i>Subiza</i> was ever labeled as anything more than uptempo indie rock.</p>
<p>The band definitely has that pedigree, crafting four- and five-minute verse/chorus pop songs.  Singer/bassist Ekhi Lopetegi has a slightly pinched, accented delivery that lends intrigue and emotional resonance to lines like ""Would you ever make yourself this decision I've made?"" (from ""Grow"").  Sonically, Delorean borrow from chilled trance and piano-heavy Italian house, but like any music fan in 2010, their interests are varied.  The pitch-shifted chipmunk vocals that orbit ""Real Love"" are drawn from hip-hop; the warped female voice that echoes ""Maybe"" during the refrain of ""Grow"" is lifted from dubstep. There's more than a little <i>Merriweather Post Pavilion</i> in the whirring rave of ""Infinite Desert"". The band even runs a <a href=""http://desparrameeeee.blogspot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">club-heavy blog</a>, and when they're not playing live, their massive DJ sets feature faintly familiar house tracks that hit a perfect nostalgic nerve.</p>
<p>Delorean's 2009 EP, <i>Ayrton Senna</i>, was recorded in-studio, but for <i>Subiza</i>, the band made a conscious move toward electronic production, laying down dozens of tracks and building the rhythms on sequencers and drum machines. The overall sound remains similar to <i>Ayrton Senna</i>'s totemic dance-pop, but <i>Subiza</i> feels tighter and more congealed. What the songs lose in clarity (ratchet those vocal levels down a bit, guys), they gain in cohesion: <i>Subiza</i> is uncommonly bound by tempo and mood. While hardly modest, Delorean have toned down their anthems, so that much of <i>Subiza</i> feels like a very tiny, very personal rave.</p>
<p><i>Subiza</i> sounds like a simple and straightforward record.  It's bright and quick and full of easy sentiment.  Its songs bleed in and out of one another effortlessly, but it's also surprisingly varied. It contains few obvious singles, yet its winning moments-- those piano breakdowns, the ""Get up/ Get up/ Get up"" bridge of ""Stay Close"", and the resplendent chorus of ""Warmer Places""-- pile up and leave you dizzy.  Synth-pop, Balearic disco, indie house: Call it what you want. Delorean just make beautiful, modern pop music.</p></div>"|14147.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14147-subiza/|8.4|Andrew Gaerig

Schmath. In early 2007, the Apples in Stereo reemerged from a long hiatus with a fine new album, <i>New Magnetic Wonder</i>, and a bunch of talk of the ""Non-Pythagorean Musical Scale."" It was something only a nerd like Apples frontman Robert Schneider could conjure: a non-traditional tuning system that, once your ears adjusted to its logic, started to make its own oddball sense. That Schneider, a scholar of form, spent his time off sitting around thinking big thoughts about pop music was a comfort, but the record belied any geek speak. The songs were pretty damn good, and that was plenty to wrap one's ears around. Three years later, and the Apples-- while still tinkering with the Non-Pythagorean stuff off and on-- have returned with a collection of tunes mostly hinging on a much much simpler equation: four on the floor.</p>
<p>Much of <i>Travellers in Space and Time</i> finds the sunshine popsters toying with a kind of slippery space-disco. Sure, it's more Leo Sayer than Donna Summer: trebly, a tad technical, still heavy on the pop-rock instrumentation rather than the genuine article. But the fact that you can sorta get down with a sumptuous-sounding, hook-forward Apples in Stereo record is a neat thing, and Schneider's sure not to flub it. His last foray into genre-hopping, the punky-pop of <i>Velocity of Sound</i>, seemed to represent a dearth of ideas, but he seems at home over these slinky grooves, despite a near-complete lack of precedence for this in their mammoth back catalog. ""Dance Floor"" and the sweeping ""Hey Elevator"" match huge hooks with a body-moving throb at once tightly wound and sumptuously breezy. But best of the bunch is ""C.P.U."", a mutant hybrid of T. Rex crunch and ""Baby Elephant Walk"" that wobbles and whirrs to an unlikely groove.</p>
<p><i>Travellers</i> isn't strictly a disco record; this being the Apples in Stereo, there's still plenty of gleaming Beatlesy pop and 70 AM gold to go around. The gooey bubblegum of ""No One in the World"", the sprightly ""Dignified Dignitary"", and the warbly vocodered blip of ""Strange Solar System"" are all sumptuous, a little strange, and seriously hooky. The production is lean, spacious, incandescent; the man knows how to polish a track. And he's got good taste in co-conspirators, too; Schneider's old buddy Bill Doss (Olivia Tremor Control/Sunshine Fix) joins the fold permanently here, and takes the lead on a couple of tracks; his songs, more than Schneider's, further the smooth ELO/Wings vibe of the <i>New Magnetic Wonder</i> tracks to good effect.</p>
<p>As ever, these songs aren't the deepest lyrically: Schneider's more concerned with achieving a classic sound, which results in a lot of universal sentiment that can at times border on the trite. But there's certainly no shortage of well-crafted, playful, memorable tunes here, and that-- matched with Schneider's willingness to try on a few new sounds for size-- adds up to the best Apples in Stereo record in more than a decade.</p></div>"|14148.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14148-travellers-in-space-and-time/|7.3|Paul Thompson

In a <a href=""http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/blogs/artsdesk/music/2010/03/29/review-wiz-khalifa-yelawolf-930-club/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""recent Washington City Paper review"">recent Washington City Paper review</a>, the rap blogger Noz described a sold-out 9:30 Club full of late-teens/early-twenties fans, all singing along with the young Pittsburgh rapper's entire set. A little bit of YouTube research shows similar scenes-- at clubs across the country, not just the ones in the Eastern corridor. And when <i>Kush and Orange Juice</i>, the new Wiz mixtape, hit the internet last week, it was a #1 Twitter trending topic for most of the day. And though it's important not to put too much stock in something as ephemeral as trending topics, it at least means there are a whole lot of people talking about a rapper with no major label deal and no superstar allegiances. It's pretty impressive.</p>
<p>Wiz's appeal isn't too hard to figure out. Though he lost his deal with Warner Bros. a while back, you never hear any of the bitterness usually associated with big-label refugees. Instead, he talks his shit with a blasé assurance; one chorus on the mixtape goes, ""We belong on the top, but we ain't trippin'/ Cuz we'll get there in a minute."" For the most part, he raps about only three things: Weed, girls, and smoking weed with girls (usually <i>your</i> girl). His rap style is easy and conversational, a pinched murmur that never leans too hard on punchlines or narrative. He's got this donkey giggle that he lets loose often, and it might beat out Lil Wayne's guffaw as rap's most irritating laugh, no mean feat. He sounds like the kid two dorm rooms down, bragging about whatever insane party he was at last night while he munches Froot Loops out of the box and watches cartoons on the common-room TV. He's charismatic in a completely relatable way.</p>
<p>He's also got a great ear for beats. The tracks are airy, diffuse things, full of smooth 1980s-funk synths and drums that amble along slowly and quietly. His choices in samples suggest a lot of time watching TV while stoned: Frou Frou's <i>Garden State</i> end-credits song ""Let Go"" on ""In the Cut"", Disney princess Demi Lovato's <i>Camp Rock</i> soundtrack single ""Our Time Is Here"" on ""We're Done"". ""Good Dank"" is all warm, rippling psych-funk-- its guitars and organs woozy as all hell, its drums completely nonexistent. And rather than bulldozing through these beats, Wiz just dances around them, never letting his delivery settle into a consistent cadence. Often, he sings his choruses in a calm, casual quaver. Sometimes, he skips rapping altogether. On ""Up"", he spends four minutes just singing the praises of weed over spaced-out Rhodes plinks, ending by repeating, ""Everything's better when you're high,"" over and over.</p>
<p>When a more conventional rapper like Killa Kyleon or Big K.R.I.T. shows up, the contrast speaks volumes. Those guys are both very good at what they do, but they sound almost old-fashioned in this context, nicely breaking up the half-committed shit-talk. Wiz never sounds like he has a lot at stake; he talks like life is a long, unchanging progression of joints and hotel rooms and girls, which, for him, maybe it is. Among his most characteristic lines is this: ""While you at home on Twitter, trying to hack her page and shit/ We smoking and cracking jokes on how lame you is."" That kind of indolent wit can lead to some truly dubious ideas, like when Wiz sang Beyoncé's ""If I Were a Boy"" as ""If I Were a Lame"" on 2009's <i>Burn After Rolling</i> mixtape, or when he tries his hand at reggae on ""Still Blazin"" here. But for the most part, <i>Kush and Orange Juice</i> is a surprisingly relaxed and easy listen, a great soundtrack for a barbecue or a spring-weather drive. And that's all it wants to be, so mission accomplished.</p></div>"|14160.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14160-kush-and-orange-juice/|7.2|Tom Breihan
