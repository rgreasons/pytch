    It's the Catch-22 of an artform built on both evolution and revolt: Each new artist is eventually put
    in the crosshairs by his or her followers.  Toronto-based hip-hop spiritualist K-Os is no different, and
    on opener ""Emcee Murdah"" he reminds us that from the start.  Unraveling slow spitfire rhymes against a
    doomsday guitar loop, K-Os complains, ""Emcees keep faking/ Hoping to make the bacon,"" insisting that ""they
    want the cash flow/ They steady schemin' for the #1 spot.""  Age-old complaints, indeed, and with each
    passing year and every half-hearted attempt to reform pop music's greatest cash cow, such grievances have
    become one of the genre's most absurd ironies.  The vanity in these pedantic holier-than-thou-isms turns
    what is meant to be an expression of individuality into a cheap boast.  In short, it's the sort of
    plea for attention that's being attacked in the first place.  We all know that it's easy to be the
    hater-- the question is whether K-Os has the chops and vision to back his boasts.  As usual, the answer
    is no.</p><p>
    
    Instead, the musical tapestry beneath K-Os' rhymes is <i>Joyful Rebellion</i>'s greatest strength.  Tracking
    the spiritual crossroads of hip-hop, reggae, soul, and flamenco, <i>Joyful Rebellion</i> stirs each of
    those ingredients into an album that, at the very least, deserves acclaim for blending classic and often
    forgotten Afro-sounds into 04's hip-hop scene.</p><p>
    
    ""Man I Used to Be"" brings the lock-step beat of ""Billie Jean"" and an MJ falsetto to a Prince-figured soul
    jam that comes complete with velvety string loops.  K-Os speeds his rhymes in time to the track's heated
    bursts and-- unlike on the opener, where his pace seems willfully slow-- he's steady enough to keep up
    with the sharp beat.  Although the song's late-70s acoustic-disco strut walks a fine line between parody
    and ode, it's hypnotic enough to make you not bother trying to guess its intent.</p><p>
    
    ""Crabbuckit"" is a New Orleans front-stoop jam bursting at the seams with stomping bass and hand claps.
    Against the song's heat-faded piano, K-Os' flow is as steady as the Mississippi flooding St. Louis
    Cathedral-- he rolls out crisp, sharp rhymes against the track's grotto rhythms.  The sound of Tom Waits
    left to wrinkle in the shouted gales of a hurricane, the song gives the album's first third a sweltering
    momentum that takes a while to dissolve.</p><p>
    
    Yet, dissolve it does, as what at first seems like multifaceted musicianship fades into fractured genre-hopping.
    ""Crucial"" never escapes its watery reggae-tinged rhythms or matches its anthemic aspirations, and ""One Blood""
    is yet another song protesting the state of hip-hop.  At these moments, it would be easy to write K-Os off
    as little more than a preachy peace troubadour.</p><p>
    
    Fortunately, K-Os lulls you into allowing him the space to preach and convert on ""Hallelujah"".  Working a
    greasy porch-front entreaty that's part culture and part Rainbow Coalition, the song is a simple paean to
    peace and ease.  Adrift on a steady acoustic guitar and ascending strings, K-Os sings more than he rhymes,
    slowing himself to the leather-voiced husk of Bunny Wailer's more world-weary moments.  While confronting
    fatigue, K-Os remolds the possibilities of the genre he's railing against.  He strains himself inside the
    closure of a dying fire, and finally proves capable of shaping towers out of dust-black cinders.</p></div>"|4585.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4585-joyful-rebellion/|7.4|Derek Miller

    unmoored and adrift both professionally and musically.  They had always presented R.E.M. as a cohesive,
    democratic whole, with all four members receiving equal songwriting credit.  Despite their one-time vow
    not to move forward as anything but a quartet, Peter Buck, Mike Mills, and Michael Stipe stuck it out
    after Berry left.  Some fans considered this to be an unfortunate decision, but the remaining members
    seemed to view it as an opportunity to redefine their sound.  R.E.M.'s first post-Berry album, 1998's
    <i>Up</i>, picked up not where its predecessor, <i>New Adventures in Hi-Fi</i>, left off, but where
    Radiohead's <i>OK Computer</i> did, with the trio taking a touristic trip into synths, programmed beats,
    and sound effects, and quoting <i>Pet Sounds</i> almost verbatim on ""At My Most Beautiful"".  It sounded
    like a transitional record, but then so did the follow-up, <i>Reveal</i>.</p><p>
    
    On their third post-Berry album, <i>Around the Sun</i>, Buck, Mills, and Stipe have settled on an uneasy
    mixture of textureless production and tentative stabs at past glory.  On lead track and first single,
    ""Leaving New York"", Stipe harmonizes with himself in a low voice that could have been sampled from
    <i>Reckoning</i>.  ""Final Straw"" borrows its whirling organ from <i>Out of Time</i>'s ""Low"", and Q-Tip's
    cameo on ""The Outsider"" recalls KRS-One's appearance on ""Radio Song"".  <i>Around the Sun</i> sounds more
    straightforward than its two predecessors, however none of the instruments-- including Stipe's voice--
    sound live or organic.  Instead, they have a sparkling sheen, which has never been the best trait for
    either Stipe's vocals or Buck's usually piercing guitar.</p><p>
    
    Concurrent with the band's move away from its rootsy jangle was a trend in Stipe's songwriting toward the
    blandly declarative, which began with ""Everybody Hurts"".  Each subsequent album has contained more and more
    full-sentence song titles-- ""You're in the Air"", ""I've Been High"", ""She Just Wants to Be"", ""I'll Take the
    Rain"", etc.  This tendency seems foreign and unexpected coming from a songwriter who in the past sounded
    unwilling to settle for easy answers, and who even parsed the difference between asking and telling on
    ""Fall on Me"".</p><p>
    
    Perhaps it's impending middle age, perhaps it's the empty drum stool, or perhaps it's Stipe's
    role as the pop culture attache for the American political left, but his lyrics have become lazily explanatory:
    No longer content to question the world, Stipe seems intent on simply describing it, often in the most anodyne
    terms.  ""It's harder to leave than to be left behind,"" he sings on ""Leaving New York"".  Elsewhere, he says,
    ""Open up your eyes/ You're so alive"" (""Aftermath""), ""There's love at the end of the line"" (""High Speed Train""),
    and, ""Some things don't hold up over the course of a lifetime"" (""Worst Joke Ever"").  Too often Stipe sounds
    like a parent passing on received wisdom to children.  At worst, this tendency is grossly arrogant; at best,
    it's merely complacent, as if success has excused R.E.M. from searching beyond platitudes.</p><p>
    
    But <i>Around the Sun</i> manages to overcome at least some of its shortcomings thanks to Stipe's new role
    as shunned lover.  Having once promised he would never write a love song-- or lip-sync in a video, or carry
    on past 1999, or play as a trio-- he sounds very new to the form, and songs like ""Make It All OK"" and ""High
    Speed Train"" even sound endearingly awkward and vulnerable.</p><p>
    
    Elsewhere, Stipe's love songs are more cryptic.  On ""The Outsiders"", he sings about meeting someone for
    dinner and getting life-changing news, but he never reveals the terrible secret.  ""Make It All OK""-- about
    recriminations between lovers-- gives Stipe his best line: He answers rejection with the taunt, ""Jesus
    loves me fine.""  His tone is so self-serious that the song sounds bled of its humor, pathos approaching
    bathos.  But Stipe's romantic confusion-- and the unprecedented hints at what may or may not be his
    personal life-- gives ""Make It All OK"" and ""Aftermath"" a prismatically emotional quality, their flaws so
    naked that they become strengths.</p><p>
    
    It's too bad the same can't be said of <i>Around the Sun</i> in its entirety.  Its chief problem is that
    every word, every note, and every instrument sounds dry, sapped of most of their personality.  Whereas
    R.E.M. were once Southern eccentrics trying to figure things out, and making lasting music in the process,
    lately they sound neither Southern nor eccentric and, more to the point, their music is far from memorable.</p></div>"|6752.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6752-around-the-sun/|5.2|Stephen M. Deusner

First, bassist Matt
    Borlik petered out shortly after 2000's debut <i>No Kill No Beep Beep</i>, forcing D.C.'s great new punk
    band into an infinitely more limited guitar/guitar/drum configuration.  As it happens, the Chinese character
    for ""crisis"" means both ""danger"" and ""opportunity,"" and Q &amp; Not U strong-armed this potential setback into
    a chance for growth.  Guitarist/frontmen Chris Richards and Harris Klahr re-centered the band's dynamics,
    keeping the strings high and shooting the vocals up into the falsetto range, drummer John Davis traded
    brute Dischord energy for smaller, cleaner fills, and by 2002's sophomore follow-up <i>Different Damage</i>,
    Q &amp; Not U relied more noticeably on melody to foot the bill for their high-octane rock numbers.</p><p>
    
    In Spring 2003, Davis hurt his right foot-- his kickdrum foot-- playing hockey.  So Q &amp; Not U essentially
    lost what remained of their rhythm section, and were forced to cancel the remainder of their tour while
    Davis recovered.  Fortunately, drummers tend to tough it out when shit goes horribly wrong (e.g. Rick Allen's
    missing arm or Keith Moon's broken body), and Davis took up the task of adapting his playing style to
    sidestep his critical injury.  He healed enough to command the pointedly drum-heavy <i>X-Polynation</i>
    EP in late 2003, but a year later, something stuck from his days with his kick in a cast.</p><p>
    
    On <i>Power</i>, Davis lays way back in the cut, keeping the math-rock runs to single digits and on some
    tracks sitting out entirely.  So the ""new"" Q &amp; Not U hardly sounds like a baby Fugazi-- they've different-damaged
    <i>Different Damage</i>, trading up its last few yelps for some supremely delicate melodies and dangerously
    nude a cappella falsetto.  <i>Power</i> is, to say the least, hardly the collection of hard rockers that
    <i>No Kill</i> and <i>Different Damage</i> were.  But with its lilt melodies, Davis' downplayed role, and
    the band's admission that, hey, a bassline here or there couldn't hurt, <i>Power</i> boasts a cohesion and
    distinct identity missing from Q &amp; Not U's two previous albums.</p><p>
    
    Like ""Soft Pyramids"" does for <i>Different Damage</i>, ""Wonderful People"" lays out the extent of Q &amp; Not
    U's new musical agenda.  Melodies will keep their color, drums will switch the TI-83 herky-jerks with
    sliderule austere, and fat synthesized basslines will slink under chicken-scratch guitars and brilliant
    hooks (""Water softly running, running"" is an early highlight).  Richards and Klahr's pasty-funk falsetto
    keeps the song fun and buoyant, and the extra room in the mix lets the band's straight-ahead thump blight
    the bright lights.</p><p>
    
    Perhaps Q &amp; Not U rely on the falsetto a little too heavily on <i>Power</i> but the squeaks are never
    purely decorative.  The band has written some vocal lines here that sound straight out of church hymnals
    and medieval palace song books-- they're uncompromisingly childlike at times-- and the tension birthed
    from grown men singing beyond their range grants the tunes a new and compelling lease.  ""Collect the
    Diamonds"" struggles at first (the line, ""This could be serious/ It could be so deadly, deadly serious,""
    makes me vomit), but then settles into the album's best call-and-response chorus.  ""Throw Back Your Head""
    is wholly successful, with wood flutes and an octaved melody filling out the song's space, while ""District
    Night Prayer"" opts for three parts and packs a kitschy spookout similar to Vince Guaraldi's ""Christmas
    Time Is Here"".</p><p>
    
    Which is not to say that <i>Power</i> is a strictly regal affair; Q &amp; Not U manages to nice up the dance
    here, too.  ""Beautiful Beats"" morphs into a drum machine romp with huge synths, catcalls, and guitar clicks
    pinched from Archie Bell &amp; The Drells' ""Tighten Up"".  ""Wet Work"" fronts an edgy guitar lead that's undermined
    by Davis' snare clicks and a silly synthbass squelch.  At its end, the song breaks down with a soulful
    snare-on-one homage to Sly &amp; The Family Stone's ""Dance to the Music"", skipping the dance-punk tropes and
    heading straight into cold-blooded funk.</p><p>
<i>Power</i> proves Q &amp; Not U's malleability, but perhaps just as importantly, assures they're still capable
    of that Dischord rock energy that defined their debut: No crowd would ever let Q &amp; Not U finish a show without
    playing ""A Line in the Sand"".  The album's closing suite (the rabid ""X-Polynation"", the tattered space-laser
    funk on ""Book Of Flags"", and the mercilessly monochrome ""Tag-Tag"") stands as a monument to the band's homegrown
    post-punk predisposition.  Q &amp; Not U is increasingly supple on <i>Power</i>, but hardly nomadic.</p></div>"|6628.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6628-power/|7.5|Nick Sylvester

    a classmate of Mos Def at La Guardia School of the Arts, and is a diehard fan of both Big Audio Dynamite
    and The Clash.  And not only is she truly unique, she exudes a paranoiac attachment to iconoclasm that
    pushes her individuality on each dynamite verse.  On ""A-Alike"", Grae boasts her dexterity: ""A poet two
    steps ahead like Noah just left/ Mo' and sex?  Holdin' Techs/ No, I'm not what you expect/ Golden pen
    exposing men false like a fallen disciple/ All in the Bible/ The cause is the calling haiku.""  <i>This
    Week</i> brims with such crafty phrases while at the same time capitalizing on Grae's flair for merging
    commentary and rhythm.</p><p>
    
    On <i>This Week</i>, Grae enters the booth with both pistols loaded: ""Critically acclaimed and shot down
    since attack/ I took all the criticism, loaded it up and shot back,"" she tells her detractors in the album's
    intro.  From there on out, Grae's marks are timely.  With the number of hip-hop-kitten-cum-R&amp;B-sidekicks;
    on the rise, Grae's critique of their oversexed role in hip-hop is scathing without seeming Puritanical.
    ""Baby, bet you know they not like/ And anyway you know it's know easy/ To come across a girl like me,""
    Grae purrs on ""Not Like Me"" as she lays out a plan for romantic fruition that doesn't involve Lil' Jon
    spraying her with a Super Soaker.  On her skit ""Before the Spot"", Grae paints the hoards of fake-id-toting
    teenage girls with the brush of immaturity, referring to them as juveniles drunkenly extolling some men's
    claims of sexual dominance.</p><p>
    
    But despite her liberating content, Grae doesn't fear the bounce.  She wisely conscripts two of the hottest
    producers in the game-- MIDI Mafia and 9th Wonder-- who, in total, deliver three unbreakable tracks.  ""You
    Don't Want It"" features MIDI Mafia's patented Atari hop, ripe with the clicks and bleeps of a stripped-down
    club banger.  With ""buzz sicker than the hive or the flu,"" Grae laces the drops with a pop rarely found on
    indie releases.  Meanwhile, 9th Wonder delivers two smoky cuts-- most notably, ""Fyre Blazer"", which sways
    with woo's and ahh's while 9th's muddled backbeat and spotty keys add his trademark veneer.</p><p>
    
    Yet, while no track dips below the quality line, the album lacks thematic fluidity and spark.  The excellent
    ""P.S."" seems detached from the rest of the record, as does Jean's schizophrenic rant on ""Going Crazy"".  Nonetheless,
    <i> This Week</i> is an effective sophomore album and would serve as a moving introduction to one of hip-hop's
    most promising rappers.</p></div>"|3540.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3540-this-week/|7.9|Jamin Warren

    sidekick to ambitions such as writing the perfect melody or scoring an <i>NME</i>-abetted college radio
    chart-topper.  Dancepunk tried valiantly to remedy this but, in a way, only made things worse: Musicians
    who seemed to have little or no interest in a groove took a crash course in ESG and sought to control
    rhythm's basic tenets because it was the thing to do.  As a result, the image of the awkward white kid
    sloppily banging out a rigid disco beat on a shitty drumset is now more farcical than endearing, and the
    fun of records like The Rapture's <i>Echoes</i> has been overshadowed by pale imitators.  It's nice, then,
    that <i>Codename: Dustsucker</i>, built from the ground up on ""found drumming"" from ex-band member Mark
    Simnett and new tracks from Talk Talk's Lee Harris, thrives on and reveres rhythm rather than merely
    tinkering with or flat-out ignoring it.</p><p>
<i>Dustsucker</i> arrives a decade after Bark Psychosis' previous album, <i>Hex</i>, and the band's
    subsequent dissolution.  That 10-year hiatus may seem slight in a year in which Brian Wilson fans were
    relieved of their 37-year wait for <i>Smile</i> but, like the former Beach Boy, Bark Psychosis deliver.
    And, like <i>Hex</i>, <i>Dustsucker</i> sounds utterly unique, eschewing even the broadest classification.</p><p>
    
    This album is percussion-centric, and that's to say nothing of the temperance and agility of the drummers'
    playing.  It's also an album smitten with texture, space, and silence, a seamless blend of acoustic
    instrumentation and electronic processing on which its piecemeal compositions generate massive momentum
    within predominantly slothful tempos.  On ""Shapeshifting"", one can hear a constant push-and-pull between
    the acoustic and electronic elements, as plaintive strummed guitar nudges against a stiff drumbeat with
    metallic, Gamelan-like flourishes.</p><p>
    
    The record is also filled with huge, billowing clouds of resonance, which occasionally inundate its tracks
    in a morass of sustained sounds. ""400 Winters"" lingers and lingers, drawn out by massive amounts of reverb,
    plenty of held notes, and an ethereal underpinning of backward-looped vibraphone.  Though melancholic, the
    song is ultimately too hopeful to be dragged down and it's easier to bask in its hazy formlessness than
    moan about its lack of variation.  But while ""400 Winters"" manages to stay afloat, some tracks suffer from
    lethargy.  ""Inqb8tr"" is opulently adorned in multiple layers of effects and textures, but is too congested
    to endure its eight-minute runtime.</p><p>
    
    But even when <i>Dustsucker</i>'s songwriting falters, the percussion is distinct, lending direction to
    the record's stacked orchestration.  ""Reserve Shot Gunman"" emerges from directionless darkness with a
    propulsive, vaguely Latin groove.  A mercurial bassline gradually annexes notes until finding a melody
    that, in lieu of vocals, provides the track both a face and a backbone.  ""From What Is Said to When It's
    Read"" incorporates huge, tympanic tom sounds as a kind of melodic element, while ""Shapeshifting"" rides an
    unflinching vamp through a two-minute coda that features no melody, only noisome sound effects and drums.</p><p>
<i>Dustsucker</i> may be languorous and dense enough to put off those who are on edge, but even when the
    album grinds to a halt under its excessive weight the scenery is beatific.  And what the songs lack in
    structural certainty or melodic eloquence they usually make up for in the remarkable depth and vibrancy
    of their textures.  Considering the band's 10-year layoff, it's a somewhat understated return-- and one
    painted in broad strokes.  But the album's unerring intimacy implores closer looks.  In 2004, the fact
    that this record exists at all is significant, and fans of <i>Hex</i> should find plenty to like under
    its moody lightning.</p></div>"|1132.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1132-codename-dustsucker/|7.7|Sam Ubl

Artists who emulate the standard,
    escape-from-civilization allure of birdsong and then abruptly make an about-face to mimic a scrambling
    flock's ack-ack-acks are mavericks in any man's English.  Whitman's Hrvatski guise sets that example with
    near-bipolar mood swings between Pollackian ""Amen"" breakbeats and guitar balladry that falls asleep at
    the wheel.  Whitman's work under his given name also has an avian nature: Our man's processed-guitar
    masterwork, ""Feedback Zwei"", seems like a conversation between two sparrows bickering over a suburban
    stucco hut village that paved over their habitat and spared a few oaks for decoration.  To truly know
    this man's passion, check out his close-mic recordings of birds gorging at his backyard feeder on
    <i>Birdsightings</i>-- it's edited from six hours of field work.</p><p>
    This aesthetic is the Samson's Hair of Whitman's <i>Schöner Flu\xDFengel</i>, a vinyl-only album that's limited
    to a commercial-damning 1,000 copies.  The record cover's depiction of a medieval cathedral aglow with
    phantasmagoric flames pays homage to the gothic pretensions of 1980s prog-metal.  Yet, the music is more
    introspective and spiritually awake than wanky guitar solos and screaming about good times in the Lake of
    Fire.  <i>Schöner</i>'s skeleton was pieced together with telephone switchboard-like modular synthesizers
    at Harvard, where Whitman guest-lectured on electronic music.  The result generally expands the kraut
    drone 'n' freakout element he explored on <i>Antithesis</i>.</p><p>
    The album is best heard in one sitting-- its fractured tracks don't individually stand on both feet.
    Whitman sticks to a narrow palate of circular acoustic guitar harmonies dueling in stereo, hymnal organ
    timbres, soft-boiled percussion, and laser noises mulched into sawdust.  Most of the seven tracks are
    patterned into birdsong meditation, flock violence disruption, and bewilderment before reprising the
    spiritual calm.  In other words, it's like witnessing the world seemingly falling to pieces but feeling
    assured that everything would turn out okay in the end.</p><p>
    The opener, ""Lixus Analogique"", sets that template by leashing down poltergeist-like bedsprings that echo
    about the house.  A guitar tiptoes in and a snare-roll builds the tension into a climax of a fumigating
    laser-vacuum and roiling improv beats.  The German compound word-abusing ""Bewusstseinserweiternd"" eases
    in a nasal ohm chant that blooms like ink in water with clarinet and organ drones before the squealing
    frequencies.  That image also festers in ""Interlude"", with motorcycled analog synths that loosely recall
    Throbbing Gristle's ""Hamburger Lady"".  ""Gravicembalo"" toys with tapped bass guitar strings that shout
    into the fog before a somber organ lets the twilight in and melts the cathedral down into 0s and 1s.</p><p>
<i>Schöner</i>'s best moments are its few Rubix Cube-rotating, glitch grooves.  That element hypnotizes
    like rooftop rain midway through ""El Seny La Rauxa"", before getting interrupted by... well, you know the
    routine.  ""Weiter"" breathes deeply with that same sense of groove, but does so on a Rhodes and, in contrast,
    the lasers grow rather tiresome after 20 minutes.  At their worst, they bequeath a savage tackiness when
    mixed with God's Country folk guitar tunes.</p><p>
    ""Lixus Numerique"" suffers from this kitsch, recalling the Me Decade's televised prog/new-age performances
    that try to touch viewers with blue-screen graphics of streaming stars.  The sight of John Lennon sighing
    his ""biofeedback"" with David Rosenbloom's scanner strapped to his brain on ""The Mike Douglas Show"" comes
    to mind. But on the whole, I have to hand it to Whitman for concocting a soundscape that grows less alien
    and more serene with each listen: <i>Schöner</i> is a beast that won't leave your bedroom months after you
    stop playing the music.</p></div>"|8662.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8662-schoner-fluengel/|7.6|Cameron Macdonald

    curled small and fetal around the microphone stand.  Waits' mouth is barely open, but his ears are perked
    high, perfectly straight, craning skyward, stretching out: Tom Waits is channeling frequencies that the
    rest of us cannot hear.</p><p>
    
    In a 2002 interview with <i>GQ</i>'s Elizabeth Gilbert, Tom Waits talked forgivingly about his ears,
    mumbling humbly about an innate, almost inhuman sensitivity to sound.  For Waits, the amplification of
    everyday chatter has long functioned as both a service and a liability, feeding his music and completely
    screwing up his life.  <i>Real Gone</i>, like most of Tom Waits' records, is teeming with all kinds of
    mysterious noises: clangs and spits, faceless hollers, squawks, irrational toots, not-quite-human coughs,
    vicious bangs, apologetic whispers.  It lurches along like a junk-heap jalopy, unsteady and unsafe, bits
    flying off in every direction, stopping, starting, and bouncing in pain.</p><p>
    
    It hasn't always been this way.  Sometime in the early 1980s, Waits stumbled past a mirror, caught a quick
    glimpse of his knobby mug, and was slapped with a cosmic, knee-wobbling epiphany: Tom Waits saw Billy
    Joel.  Waits' subsequent work-- especially the raucous, circus-heavy <i>Rain Dogs</i>, or the glorious
    <i>Swordfishtrombones</i>-- established him as a blue-ribbon eccentric, cranking out perfect anti-ballads
    as an antidote to Piano Man temptations.  Wife and longtime collaborator Kathleen Brennan (who co-wrote and
    co-produced <i>Real Gone</i>, along with Waits' last eleven records), has sagely proclaimed that all Tom
    Waits' songs can be easily slapped into one of two categories: Grim Reapers and Grand Weepers.  Happily,
    <i>Real Gone</i> has its share of both-- although devious preference is, of course, purposefully paid to
    the former.</p><p>
    
    For <i>Real Gone</i>, Waits ditched his trademark piano and most of his rhythm section, opting instead to
    cough up man-made beats like hairballs and sputter abrasive scats.  Waits relishes his vocal tics and
    impossibly gnarled pipes, shamelessly savoring his homemade racket, building more and more momentum with
    each new bark.  Unsurprisingly, Waits' sputters can get a bit tiring (they're certainly repetitive), but
    they ultimately lend his work a weird, organic immediacy, freezing it forever in time-- he could never
    make this record again, or at least not in the exact same way.  His bursts are too spontaneous, too
    imperfect-- which makes <i>Real Gone</i> more about Tom Waits than anything or anyone else.  Appropriately,
    Waits' fingerprints are everywhere; his blood drips from every twist and cackle, his spit soars and splatters.
    After a few spins of <i>Real Gone</i>, you almost want to wipe your face off.</p><p>
    
    Lyrically, Waits still excels, beating out his peers in both absurdity and grace.  Nobody howls warnings
    quite like Tom Waits, and the deliciously apocalyptic ""Don't Go into That Barn"" features some of his best
    poetic barbs, cawed as a challenge, confrontational and wicked.  Waits is a storyteller in the best
    campfire tradition, and his cautionary fables are never without the proper exposition (""Bank since Saginaw
    Calinda was born/ It's been cotton, soybeans, tobacco and corn/ Behind the porticoed house/ Of a long dead
    farm/ They found the falling down timbers of a spooky old barn"").  Waits is preoccupied with specifics,
    never once mewing a vague scenario or untied emotion.  His songs may be tremendously bizarre, even ominous--
    but they're always exceptionally real; every character has a pair of trousers to wear, a meal to chew, a
    task to complete.  And there is always a place that Tom Waits thinks it would be best for them to avoid.</p><p>
<i>Real Gone</i> does stumble a bit, with Waits occasionally overindulging his quirks.  ""Circus"", a tedious
    spoken word manifesto layered over muted, lazy horn wails, feels uncommonly stagnant; ""Sins of My Father"",
    which clocks in at 11 minutes, is unforgivably long.  And opener ""Top of the Hill"" remains, somehow, both
    the best and worst thing you'll hear all year: Waits' grimaced beats, tangled up in themselves, shudder
    alongside a simple electric guitar melody and a repeated, shrugging request (""Come and get me on the ride
    up/ I'm only goin' to the top of the hill"").  The song heaves on even when you think it should stop,
    growing increasingly breathless by the second, as if Waits really was lumbering uphill, begging you for
    a lift.  And when you finally stop wincing, when you finally pull over and open the door-- you grin and
    you dance.</p></div>"|8565.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8565-real-gone/|8.0|Amanda Petrusich

When the turbaned one isn't disinterring
    forgotten gems from the lightless mines of classic punk, to reissue them with bonus tracks and modern
    production values, he's seeking out new bands that replicate the glory of '77 with striking fidelity and
    a rigid perma-sneer.  Thus has it come to pass that Swami has reissued infamous San Fran garage-punks
    Crime <em>twice</em> in 2004-- first, the Crime CD <em>San Francisco's Still Doomed</em>, and again, in the
    guise of the third Hot Snakes LP of heat-seeking proto-punk, <em>Audit in Progress</em>.</p><p>
    
    Hot Snakes is the latest chapter in a long-running partnership between John Reis and Rick Froberg, who
    began grinding out antic, gasoline-doused rock together in the band Pitchfork, then attained indie
    immortality with their math-punk band Drive Like Jehu.  The duo parted ways for a while in the mid-to-late-90s,
    as Reis attempted to capitalize upon the temporary commercial viability of his other band, Rocket from the
    Crypt, and Froberg pursued his visual art, the distinctive, stylized line work that now adorns Hot Snakes
    CDs.</p><p>
    
    Reis and Froberg reunited around the turn of the millennium, with Delta 72 drummer Jason Kourkounis providing
    the robust rhythmic chassis.  Unexpectedly, the spirit of Jehu was revived, to the enduring elation of fans
    still lamenting their break-up after their seminal swan song, <em>Yank Crime</em>.  There are numerous,
    comparative ways of understanding Hot Snakes-- a more concise, streamlined version of Jehu, or RFTC without
    the greaser sensibility and wailing saxes.  But they're best discerned on their own terms: a desire to
    carry on the legacy of classic punk bands like Crime (roiling, distressed rock riffs) and Suicide (menacing,
    propulsive rhythms) with a minimum of modern revision.</p><p>
    
    Reviews of familiar bands often deal predominantly with progressions, a tactic that fails to find purchase
    in music that seems resistant to change and intent on holding its ground.  Hot Snakes have staked out their
    sonic territory like a lion guarding the carcass of a slain gazelle, snarling in an unassailable splay-legged
    stance.  As such, we'll examine their scanty alterations straightaway.  The most glaring is the replacement
    of Kourkounis by RFTC/Black Heart Procession drummer Mario Rubalcaba, and if <em>Audit in Progress</em> evinces
    a slight decline in raw power, this embryonic dynamic is the likely cause.  While Rubalcaba is a proficient
    percussionist possessed of a distinct style, his crisper, more rigid drumming simply doesn't mesh as well
    with Hot Snakes' metallic doom-rock guitars and monotone shout-alongs as Kourkounis's rumbling, primal
    pounding did.  <em>Audit in Progress</em> remains sufficiently fierce, but sounds a little tinny when compared
    to the rippling muscles of 2002's <em>Suicide Invoice</em>.</p><p>
    
    Besides this foundational shift, Hot Snakes pick up right where they left off-- perhaps the songs are a
    little shorter, a bit more compressed, but are still of a piece with anything from <em>Suicide Invoice</em>
    and <em>Automatic Midnight</em>.  The new album opens with ""Braintrust"".  A rapid-fire rhythm guitar recalling
    Black Flag paves the way for a cyclical, trebly lead, frantic drums, and the locked groove of Gar Wood's
    fleet bass.  Froberg takes on the role of misanthropic sloganeer or street-corner proselytizer, belting
    out his apocalyptic aphorisms over furiously oscillating punk rock.  Like many a Hot Snakes song, it's a
    runaway bus that drags the listener in its wake like a loose muffler, bouncing and sparking on asphalt.
    The chorus manifests an immediately recognizable Hot Snakes' tactic: the relentless momentum accordion-wrecks
    into ominous, anthemic chords that are sustained like a held breath before the panting exhalations of the
    verses kick in again. </p><p>
    
    Other standout tracks include ""Hi-Lites"", ""Think About Carbs"", and album closer ""Plenty for All"".  ""Hi-Lites""
    attains a hysterically seesawing balance, pivoting violently on the fulcrum of Froberg's hollered non-sequiturs.
    ""Think About Carbs"" is one of a couple tracks that break the album's hypnotic drive, forfeiting it for a
    starker sound: Sparse, staccato guitars allow the muted bassline to shine, and both collude to create a
    platform for the record's most polychromatic singing.  Froberg's more variegated vocal inflections and
    unusual prolixity border on a hoarse, punk version of rap, and strategic phrase repetitions (""boxes boxes
    boxes boxes"") grace the song with a mounting urgency akin to Richard Hell's ""New Pleasure"" (""automatic
    automatic automatic automatic"").  And ""Plenty for All"", which one would have expected to find sequenced
    earlier in the album for its instant appeal, kicks off with a gleaming lead cribbed from GnR's ""Sweet
    Child o' Mine"", harmonically twinned with chugging power chords.  It's as close as Hot Snakes come to
    fashionable, limpid indie rock, a concession to the power of melody amid a brutal homage to scorched ozone
    and ruinous riffage. </p><p>
    
    For those familiar with Hot Snakes' back-catalog, there are few surprises to be found on <em>Audit in
    Progress</em>, but Jehu is so beloved that fans tend to adore anything Reis and Froberg touch, as long as
    it doesn't stray too far from their established dynamic.  Their third Hot Snakes album finds them hunkering
    down inside it, and should find favor with those who don't understand why such a high premium is placed on
    newness in rock, a genre that once consisted of barre chords and simple fury.  I don't know if Aesop had
    any fables about snakes; if not, Reis and Froberg are writing one for him.  The ostensive moral: Revision
    is for pussies, and reinvention the last refuge of the depleted and uninspired. </p></div>"|3932.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3932-audit-in-progress/|7.7|Brian Howe

I once had a friend who became addicted to
    downloading cracked music software.  After a few months, he had literally tens of thousands of dollars
    worth of programs on his computer, allowing him to realize any possible musical whim.  The problem was,
    the more options that each new program afforded him, the more difficult the thought of creating any music
    at all became.  When surrounded by infinite possibilities, he actually produced the least musical output
    of his life.  Here, he discovered the basic reason that musicians will almost always impose restrictions
    upon themselves, be it in form, genre, instrumentation, or software: Total artistic freedom is paralyzing.</p><p>
    
    Tight parameters-- limitations stemming from the physical nature of an instrument, or a conscious decision
    of what to allow oneself-- can force a musician to focus on aspects of music usually taken for granted.
    61 year-old Richard Crandell has spent his life playing with some of the world's great instrumentalists,
    from Leo Kottke to Taj Mahal to John Fahey; his first Tzadik release, <i>Mbira Magic</i>, is a testament
    to the ideal of liberation through restriction.  The album is made entirely from a multitracked mbira
    (thumb piano) and occasional rhythmic accompaniment.  With only a few keys, scales and tones available,
    Crandell's attention is turned toward rhythmic interaction, counterpoint, and impact through the addition
    and subtraction of melodic elements.</p><p>
<i>Mbira Magic</i> is entirely acoustic, but the album inhabits the same world of atmospherics as ambient
    music.  Crandell's phrases swell and ebb, as though pausing to breathe.  There are no effects added to his
    sound, but he'll often phase melodies upon each other so as to create a layer of delayed response.  The
    first piece, ""Eleven"", is the longest on the album, as he improvises over an 11-note phrase treated in
    such a way for a little over 11 minutes.  The following track, ""Steelhead"", is a more concise statement.
    Here, and elsewhere, he's accompanied by Cyro Baptista, a renowned experimental percussionist who has
    played with artists such as David Byrne, John Zorn, and Herbie Hancock.  Baptista keeps his sounds as
    humble as Crandell's tones, and together they create propulsive miniatures.</p><p>
    
    The mbira is naturally suited to playing the traditional circular melodies of African music, which obscure
    any recognizable beginning or end, and many of Crandell's tracks are built upon similarly repetitive themes.
    Yet while he works within scales commonly associated with other cultures, his sound defies any overt
    connection to world music.  His shimmering patterns are more reminiscent of minimalists such as Reich, or
    Glass, and he applies methods and chords learned from studying fingerpicked guitar.  Like lo-fi recordings
    from pared-down artists such as Mountain Goats or Devendra Banhart, Crandell's pieces give a palpable sense
    of their creation.  Several tracks contain improvised sections, and the overall effect is one of sitting
    with him as he weaves quiet lines that float on air.</p><p>
    
    Crandell achieves a wide range of impressions and moods-- the echoes from a church on ""Bells"", or the folk
    melody on ""Bolivian Lullaby""-- but they're all tempered by the unimposing nature of his instrument.  <i>Mbira
    Magic</i> doesn't strive to be virtuosic or gripping, but allows its hypnotic melodies to quietly alter the
    environment around them.  It's a beautiful piece of genre-less work, and a statement of maturity from an
    artist whose music is interesting enough to be content with but a handful of notes.</p></div>"|1782.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1782-mbira-magic/|7.9|Liam Singer

For the pair, it marked
    the first year since 1980 that their Legendary Pink Dots project hadn't released an album-- and they were
    coming off a year in which they'd released three.  After 21 years of grinding out studio albums at a clip
    of nearly two a year, along with touring and all of the other things that go along with residing on the
    margins of popular music, I suppose they just needed a bit of a break.  On the evidence provided by <i>The
    Whispering Wall</i>, that break served them well: <i>The Whispering Wall</i> is one of the most accessible
    records of their career.</p><p>
    Of course, that just proves that everything's relative.  There's more than enough Dots weirdness here to
    satiate fans and send just about everyone else running for the hills.  The curious few remaining and wondering
    where to dip their toes into the band's massive catalog could certainly do worse than this-- if you like
    the idea of a whimsical British Einstürzende Neubauten, this is your band, and <i>The Whispering Wall</i>
    makes a suitably disconcerting companion to Neubauten's own 2004 album, <i>Perpetuum Mobile</i>.</p><p>
    The arc of this album is a fair bit more minimalist than most past Dots efforts, with Edward Ka-Spel's
    ""r""-less invocations tiptoeing through Rorschach blots of keyboard, sputtering, pitch-black electronics
    and the occasional mausoleum cabaret breakdown.  And yet, it all begins very aggressively with ""Soft Toy"",
    a pulsing nod to Van Der Graaf Generator and original-edition King Crimson beset by Niels Van Hornblower's
    sax outbursts and guided by Erik Drost's grit-teethed rhythm guitar.  The album doesn't return to this kind
    of aggressive dark prog again, but it does feature a great deal more variety and consistency than the
    average Dots platter.</p><p>
    ""A Distant Summer"" is a pensive, tense hymn with self-harmonized Ka-Spels (almost too) quietly intoning
    over an unchanging programmed beat as static washes, subcutaneous guitar and skin-tickling electronic
    clouds of electronic debris float by underneath.  The song is a perfect example of how uncomfortable the
    Dots can make a song, as the tension builds and builds and builds, never to release-- it's a sort of
    musical adaptation of water torture, but it's intensely seductive as well.  ""For Sale"" bobs on bright
    synths that recall a less coldly calculated Kraftwerk, while ""King of a Small World"" is quietly ferocious
    death jazz featuring mostly Ka-Spel backed by nothing but a walking bass and staccato organ.  ""And when
    they least expect it, we shall take them in a blaze of glory/ See the future/ See the chalk lines,"" he
    deadpans, raising his voice ever so slightly in a way that underscores its chilling menace.</p><p>
    And that reflects a lot of what's great about the Dots-- they traffic in horror and gothic darkness, but
    they do it with elegance, more slowly crescendoing George Romero dread than Wes Craven splatterfest.  They
    even end the album with a moment of genuine, placid beauty in ""No Wall, No Strings"", which is nothing but
    a few minutes of soft drone with a slowly shifting melodic tone playing over it.  In a way, that little
    piece of beauty and light at the album's end relieves the tension and terror of the hour that precedes it,
    and even if it doesn't take the band completely out of the black forest they call home, it makes <i>The
    Whispering Wall</i> one of the band's most satisfying albums.</p></div>"|4723.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4723-the-whispering-wall/|7.6|Joe Tangari

    confound expectations.  It's a creed that has served her well both within the group and without it, leading
    to successes like the Mekons' pioneering alt-country album <i>Fear and Whiskey</i> and her well-received
    1999 Bloodshot release <i>Cowboy Sally's Twilight Laments for Lost Buckaroos</i>.  But it also means she's
    been involved in her fair share of frustrating, undigested head-scratchers, and unfortunately, <i>In the
    World of Him</i> seems destined to join their ranks.</p><p>
    
    The gimmick this time around is that almost all of these nine songs are covers written by male songwriters
    and sung from a man's perspective.  (The sole exception is the Timms original ""Little Tommy Tucker"", which
    is sung from the perspective of the now-grown nursery rhyme character.)  Although gender-bending by now can
    no longer be considered a groundbreaking device, this approach on paper would nevertheless appear to be at
    least somewhat ripe with possibility.</p><p>
    
    Even from within these masculine parameters, however, Timms has made some perplexing choices in song selection.
    For one, she maintains the Mekons' regrettable tradition of endlessly re-recording songs from their own
    back catalog.  The most baffling example is yet another version of the Mekons' ""Corporal Chalkie"", a fine,
    ironic anti-war dirge to be sure, but one that just appeared in a virtually identical arrangement on the
    group's <i>Punk Rock</i> album earlier this year.  Timms takes on Jon Langford's ""Sentimental Marching
    Song"" and the Mekons' ""Bomb"" also risk sounding overly familiar to her attentive fanbase, and their
    inclusion can't help but make <i>In the World of Him</i> feel rather uninventive and skimpy.</p><p>
    
    Elsewhere on the album, Timms covers a tasteful but eccentric collection of songwriters that includes Mark
    Eitzel, Johnny Dowd, and Kevin Coyne.  In the process, she abandons virtually all traces of either the
    Mekons' pub-punk or her previous C&amp;W; leanings in favor of an icy minimalism rather reminiscent of Nico's
    <i>The Marble Index</i> (although Timms' crystalline vocal timbre couldn't be more different from Nico's
    guttural delivery).  On Eitzel's ""God's Eternal Love"", Timms' angelic pipes are supported by little more
    than a smeary haze of electronic drone, while funhouse keyboards give Dowd's ""139 Hernalser Gurtel"" a
    woozy cabaret tilt.  Perhaps her most effective performance, and the one where she most obviously improves
    upon the original, is a version of Ryan Adams' ""Fools We Are as Men"", which she sings in a beautiful,
    urgent hush accompanied only by acoustic guitar and accordion.</p><p>
    
    The adventurous cast of songwriters Timms has selected provide the album a wide depth of lyrical flavor.
    It's worth noting that none of these tracks specifically address love or sex, concentrating instead on
    spiritual self-doubt, vulnerability, and skewering lunkheaded militaristic machismo.  Though several tracks
    here-- particularly her rendition of Coyne's ""I'm Just a Man""-- do give the listener compelling, timely
    interpretations of the male psyche, one is unlikely to get a very broad or accurate view of contemporary
    manhood by studying the work of such iconoclastic lyricists.  If <i>In the World of Him</i> is intended to
    be Timms' comprehensive portrait of modern men or what it's like to live among them, one can't help but
    wish she had taken a few more adventurous risks within the extensive male songbook.</p></div>"|8064.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8064-in-the-world-of-him/|6.7|Matthew Murphy

In my estimation, their curled-lip punk-blues shtick is sharp and virile enough that, despite     the mascara and wet-dog haircuts, it can't be a put-on.  Spencer, like a reformed criminal rueful of his     sin-soaked days with Pussy Galore, once said, ""We love music way too much to be doing it as a joke.""  And     the love shows up in the band's track record: moonshine ranting with R.L. Burnside, homage paid to James     Brown on <i>Orange</i>, eight window-rattling albums.  It all adds up to a band so in love with the blues     they had to kill them.</p>
<p>I guess my question is this: Are we so mired in po-mo irony that on witnessing such artistic devotion we     conclude it must be a joke?  Can't a guy just rock out with his cock out and mean it?  I know it's not     popular opinion, but after seeing the band destroy several concert stages I'm convinced they're on the     level.  They've consistently, diligently mined rock 'n' roll for the primal power and backdoor mojo it     had when it was still the devil's music.  And like the man says, they've done it with love.</p>
<p>""Ladies and gentlemen, this is not the devil's music!"" Spencer informs midway through <i>Damage</i>.  Well,     fuck.  Maybe I <i>have</i> been wrong all this time.  In its grab bag of styles, inflated instrumentation,     and rogues gallery of production credits (Dan Nakamura and DJ Shadow take the boards along longtime BX     cohort Steve Jordan), <i>Damage</i> is a far cry from the stripped-down screech that made these guys famous.     In its contrast, it calls out everything the Blues Explosion once was and now isn't.  Kind of like the     weak-ass rhymes all over <i>To the 5 Boroughs</i> that made me realize how infantile the Beastie Boys'     lyrics have been throughout their career (which somehow also made me love them even more), the inevitable     clichés on <i>Damage</i> reveal the shortcomings-- and the potential-- of the entire Blues Explosion     concept.</p>
<p>Basically, that concept is a one-trick pony still kicking thanks to impetuous experimentation and an endless     supply of attitude.  There's a fair amount of musical talent thrown in, too, mostly in the form of demolition     man Russell Simins.  But <i>Damage</i>'s heavy-handed production so overcrowds those core elements that the     album ends up feeling more like a collection of Blues Explosion remixes than a regular release.  Which isn't     entirely bad, because some of these tunes are raging classics begging to be added to your ""Saturday Night     Kickstart"" playlist.  Others are pure filler.  Let the downloading commence.</p>
<p>By far the most memorable number here, ""Crunchy"" is a swaggering, midtempo boogie that actually finds     Spencer singing the chorus straight.  The Automator's production is flawless, nestling Judah Bauer's     guitar, funhouse Wurlitzer, and a deliberately sluggish bassline next to (not on top of) each other for     a polished, almost pop-rock effect.  It's a sprawling surprise-- one thing the Explosion's never been is     pop-- and it works better than you'd likely expect.</p>
<p>""Burn It Off"", the album's first single, is one of     the only two songs featuring just the three-pronged Blues Explosion lineup.  Like a <i>Now I Got Worry</i> outtake beefed up through Pro Tools (like most songs on the record are), their original fire is at full     crank as Simins and Bauer shout Stooge-like backup chants behind Spencer's vocals and scuzzy guitar.  Its     B-side is the DJ Shadow collaboration ""Fed Up and Low Down"", a buck-wild electro-blues mashup that pivots     between vintage soul and hardcore with some vinyl scratched in for color.  It's another experiment that     hits the mark, but sounds like it was meant for another album.</p>
<p>As does ""Rivals"", a jazzy, horn-laced instrumental that winds through some intriguing ideas before sadly     fading out after less than two minutes.  But the biggest disappointment here is ""Hot Gossip"", a half-baked     pseudo-protest song with Chuck D phoning in a few poorly placed come-ons.  With no real rap to spit, Chuck's     talents go to waste repeating Spencer's trite slogans.  This one's particularly bad, but the rest of the     songs (with the exception of the filtered bass drum bombast of the title track and the weird dub blues of     ""Spoiled"" with Martina Topley-Bird) aren't worth mentioning because you've heard them before on previous     albums.</p>
<p>I assume Spencer meant to galvanize and revitalize his Blues Explosion by shortening the name.  Seems like     the Blues Explosion is trying to hold on for the long haul, and moments of <i>Damage</i> prove there's still     some passion left seething under the leather and denim.  But if they're going to keep things fresh, newfangled     production will only carry them so far.  Their conviction-- feigned or not-- has always been what's fueled     them, and that can only come from inside.</p></div>"|4295.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4295-damage-as-blues-explosion/|6.8|Jonathan Zwickel

If a record ever successfully achieved such an effect, my sincere
    hope is that it would be summarily taken off the market and marked for burial at a nuclear waste site.  But
    while few bands are truly capable of inducing such crisis, an unprepared listener's response to abstract,
    texture-based noise music, like that of Wolf Eyes, will often run something like this:</p><p>
    ""This makes me want to kill myself.""</p><p>
    With songs like ""Burn Your House Down"" and ""Let the Smoke Rise"", Wolf Eyes have doubtless left many craving
    a fistful of aspirin and a glass of water, but these Michigan noisters' brazen electro-industrial soundscapes
    have yet to provoke any suicides.  Dauntingly abrasive, yes; spiritually violating, no: Wolf Eyes are
    hyperbole-inducing provocateurs whose scalding compositions never fail to get a rise out of unsuspecting
    bystanders.  And that's part of what makes them so appealing/appalling.</p><p>
    Which raises the inevitable cynical question: Do Wolf Eyes have any actual fans, or just the ever-fickle
    appreciators, grazers, and gimmick seekers?</p><p>
    This collection has been likened to an art project, and that's an unjust charge.  <i>Burned Mind</i> doesn't
    belong in a museum (where it may well garner glowing reviews), though it does answer to the trove of
    obnoxious descriptors typically foisted upon music of its stripe: dense, abstract, challenging, and
    confrontational.  But more often than not, Wolf Eyes are on your side: Enlist them to kick your meek ass,
    and they're happy to oblige.  The mesmeric, chainsaw guitar rips of ""Reaper's Gong"" are nothing if not
    galvanizing, while the plodding saw-synth tsunami of ""Stabbed in the Face"" is downright debilitating.</p><p>
    Songs like this might make some want to harm themselves, but can for others offer a quick syringe of
    adrenaline, or provoke a meditative look inward at a dark stratum of emotions, chief among them frustration,
    anger, and an overwhelming sense of imminent peril.  In fact, much of <i>Burned Mind</i> sounds as if it
    were scored for a late-21st century update of <i>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</i>, where the villain is
    <em>actually</em> an indefatigable android gone haywire.</p><p>
    The opening 45 seconds of ""Dead in a Boat"" may suggest a quieter, less volatile beast than was present on
    previous records like <i>Dead Hills</i> and <i>Slicer</i>, but those notions are quickly dispelled as the
    silence is broken by a wave of electronic squall.  The introduction grows more misleading with the next
    track, ""Stabbed in the Face"", which features a looped female scream over a heady milieu of feedback and
    grating pitch-bends.  One of the most uncompromisingly and mesmerically abrasive tracks in recent memory,
    it's easily <i>Burned Mind</i>'s crown jewel, and a serviceable mission statement for a band who explore
    noise not for gimmickry or shock-value, but because that's the mode in which they express themselves best.</p><p>
    This is by far Wolf Eyes' most visceral release to date.  The masochistic appeal of stertorous noise and
    the comely allure of pop music are one in the same: <i>Burned Mind</i>, like any pop album worth its salt,
    conjures a deeper realm of images and moods beyond its surface qualities.  Beneath the shock value of
    these overwhelming sonic miasmas are unambiguous aural parables about a world gone awry, and technology
    is held as the main culprit.  Song titles like ""Dead in a Boat"", ""Urine Burn"", and ""Black Vomit"" are just
    façades (if not entirely inaccurate ones), indicative of the arid landscapes of human squalor and
    degradation stretching open behind.  The rusty swingset shrieks of the interminable title track evoke
    images of spiritless machinery at work, as the band pummel with an admirable dearth of humanity.</p><p>
    Superficially, there's only so much that can be said about <i>Burned Mind</i> that hasn't already been
    belabored into irrelevance and bought Wolf Eyes curt dismissals.  Of course, their style is, to a degree,
    old news; there are manifold precedents for this breed of unrelenting stridency, dating back to Lou Reed's
    infamous <i>Metal Music Machine</i>.  Throbbing Gristle took a similar stance against technology and
    industry in the 1970s, and their influence is certainly echoed here.  If Wolf Eyes stand out from the
    legacy of doomsayers that includes Throbbing Gristle, Suicide, Whitehouse, and more recently Yellow
    Swans, it's because they're impressively, expertly abrasive.  The shear inertia of these songs is
    sufficient to make most self-styled hardcore kids recoil in terror.  <i>Burned Mind</i>, better than
    any recent album I can think of, betrays music's implied purpose of providing an enjoyable aural
    experience, while at the same time being psychologically compelling and richly imagistic enough to
    invite repeat listens.</p></div>"|8730.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8730-burned-mind/|8.0|Sam Ubl

    officially retired by the members of the collective and their respective bands once they decided that the
    concept had run its course.  Looking back, it's clear that the collective only really produced a handful
    of truly great works, albums that managed to balance their pop sense and ambitious experimentalism perfectly,
    but I still miss it for that very mixture.  Even when those bands failed to get everything in equilibrium,
    they frequently produced something of interest, and restless creativity is a sorely lacking quality in a
    lot of bands.  Still, I think that spirit colors a lot of what litters today's indie pop landscape, from
    crazy pop bands like The Unicorns and oddball history rockers like The Decemberists to lone mavericks like
    Brandon Wiard.</p><p>
    
    That's pronounced ""Wired,"" as in ""totally Wiard,"" ""Wiard for sound,"" and any number of other awful puns
    that will no doubt dog him until the day he dies or hangs up his guitar and keyboards.  He's already got
    two albums under his belt, albeit albums that very few people heard.  2001's <i>To Someone I Know</i> and
    2003's demo compendium <i>Super Secret Double Awesome Japanese Import B-Side Collection</i> established
    him as a guy who could turn a hook and craft a decent song, and <i>Painting a Burning Building</i> initially
    sounds like he's content to simply realize the potential heard on those records and make a solid indie-pop
    record-- opener ""Already in Amazement"" spills over with rambunctious energy, building in catchiness as the
    chorus approaches on rubber rhythms, plinking piano and whirring MiniMoog.  The chorus itself clubs you
    with prime power-pop as Wiard blurts and babbled geekily about how totally enthralled he is with his
    latest crush.</p><p>
    
    At this point, you're basically poised to take in a fairly standard power-pop record, albeit a very good
    one, but when you've listened to as many of these discs as I have, you sometimes find yourself hoping for
    a bit more than just that.  The two slower songs that follow, piled as they are with harmonies, fuzzy
    guitars and electronics store keyboards, don't really give much of an indication that we're going anywhere
    different, but as the album wears on, little things creep in.  A violin here, a cello there, a surprisingly
    complex stacked harmony, tempo changes, and pretty soon you're wondering what exactly is going on here.</p><p>
    
    The album's final third answers that question by completely wiping aside any kind of basic approach in
    favor of a trio of epic suites stuffed with sea-shanty interludes, sound collages, ornate orchestration
    and slick beats.  And while on the surface there's a chasm of difference between the simple, straightahead
    pop of ""I'll Write These Songs"", with its refrain of, ""I'll write these songs for her/ Just to see the way
    she moves when I sing,"" and the huge collection of voices, trumpets and strings that give way to Wiard's
    solo a cappella musings on shipwrecks in ""Old Heartless Sun"", it's actually set up nicely by songs like
    ""Permanent Smile"", which morphs from blued-eyed soul to pretty, string-laden autumnal pop and back again.</p><p>
    
    But, yeah, these suites are really something-- the liners divide them into sections with separate instrumental
    credits, and Wiard transfers songs from earlier in the album into a sort of church choir setting.  ""KMS"",
    by far the hardest rocking and roughest song on the album, is transformed into a maritime hymn in the
    middle of ""Second Story"" and a track later ""Since You've Gone Away"" comes back as a ghostly, <i>Smile</i>-ish
    thing featuring members of The Original Brothers and Sisters of Love in the choir and copious digital audio
    manipulation.  In fact, <i>Smile</i> is probably the most apt comparison for these songs, as they similarly
    string together disparate sections into a whole that's far, far more than the sum of its parts, and massively
    entertaining at that.</p><p>
    
    The net result is an album that similarly defies mathematical logic, offering infectious, propulsive should-be
    singles like ""KMS"" and the Kara Dupuy-sung ""Moving On"", churning power ballads like ""Miss Michigan"" and
    more than 20 minutes of total mindfuckery to cap it all off.  Needless to say, this is difficult to pull
    off, and even skilled practitioners like those in the Elephant Six stable only manage a success like this
    every so often, so give Wiard his due.  He could have continued to grow slowly and safely, but instead he
    dove in head first, and came out with a fantastic album that ought to put him on the map.</p></div>"|8782.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8782-painting-a-burning-building/|8.1|Joe Tangari

It's to the credit of Fred Thomas and his army of
    collaborators in Saturday Looks Good to Me that they so consistently connect with a weirdly instinctual
    recognition of the generalized 60s music from which their own music is drawn.  For the most part, their
    audience's perception of that music is purely indexical, informed only by second-hand documents of the
    era.  For the same reason, my parents would never spin <i>Every Night</i> or <i>All Your Summer Songs</i>
    when they could flip on an oldies station or mine their LP collection instead: SLGTM are catering to a
    perception of the 1960s that never actually existed; they channel their own experiences into decades
    they've never lived, and speak to an audience who can appreciate Phil Spector references, bombastic <i>Pet
    Sounds</i> percussion, garage organ, and the kind of tambourine that once grounded a rhythm rather than
    embellished it, but necessarily can't experience these components with the same kind of time-warp authenticity
    that the music exudes.</p><p>
    If SLGTM didn't recognize the fundamental conflict of recontextualizing a style of music for which most
    of their listeners have only an abstract historical context, their music would fall apart.  The success
    of <i>Every Night</i>, much like <i>All Your Summer Songs</i> before it, is entirely dependent on its
    contemporary relevance in the guise of almost fetishistic devotion to 60s pop nostalgia.  ""Since You Stole
    My Heart"", a mono-friendly girl-group love letter that smacks of the sickly sweetest trip down a boardwalk
    you've never been on, represents the far extreme of SLGTM's direct emulative powers.  But gradually, a
    darker world of thrift stores, cheap cigarettes, and rum &amp; Cokes pierces through the band's façade of
    straight-faced homage, hinting at something more compelling and contemporary beneath.</p><p>
    The divide between the band's affected 90s lo-fi feel and genuine 60s recording fidelity is a delicate
    one, and pushing too far to either side damages the band's inspired but fragile aesthetic.  <i>Summer
    Songs</i> achieved this balance nearly flawlessly, but <i>Every Night</i> occasionally loses its footing.
    A few largely acoustic tracks (particularly the heavy and oddly polished ""Dialtone"" and ""We Can't Work It
    Out"") fail to adequately veil Thomas' narcissistic pretense as a lyricist.  Where the pop-mysticism of
    ""If You Ask""'s psych-lite production effectively hides the song's weighty lyrical undercurrent, the
    relatively hi-fi demo quality of ""Dialtone"" brings Thomas' brooding relationship with an ex-love to the
    forefront of the song, relegating the blithe piano and tambourine arrangement to mere set dressing.  The
    resulting song feels overproduced and too distinctly current, and temporarily hinders the album's retro
    charm.</p><p>
    Many songs, however, achieve the same heights of <i>Summer Songs</i>; the reverb-drenched, Spector
    string-heavy ""Until the World Stops Spinning"", <i>Nuggets</i> outtake ""Keep Walking"", and effervescent
    sunshine vibe of penultimate ""Lift Me Up"" are frozen in an ambiguous moment that reasonably could have
    been culled from any point in time between 1960-1967, with just enough contemporary lyrical context and
    modern vocal affectation to connect the band's musical conceits to more current influences.</p><p>
    If the band's established sound wasn't such a direct homage, replication of a former release might be
    considered a major fault.  However, SLGTM construct their songs from such a deceptively diverse palette
    that their reserve of material, though all vaguely familiar, is potentially endless.  Their scope may
    be limited, but their wealth of source material is as broad as the subconscious vinyl fantasies of their
    audience.</p></div>"|7003.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7003-every-night/|7.5|David Moore

After spending their debut kicking out lengthy Daft Punk-style house jams, Louisville's
    VHS or BETA have moved on, like so many bands this year, to pillaging the dance-friendly template of late-80s
    Cure-- <i>Night on Fire</i>, their second outing, finds them window-dressing themselves in shades of black
    and purple.  While the band's past is well-researched, but it smacks of microfiched headlines and yellowed
    <i>Newsweek</i>s.  Their very name is a calculated allusion to the Reagan era, in the way it whimsically
    cites trends that those alive at the time understand as useless fads or outmoded technology that we're
    grateful to be rid of.  Sadly, their music is everything the name implies-- a fuzzy fourth-generation
    bootleg of a bygone decade's pop culture trash.</p><p>
    
    The title track opens with a summary of what's to come.  Limp guitar lines bounce against a studio-stiffened
    dance beat that'll become painfully familiar by album's end (hint: there's only one.)  Jerky, lock-kneed
    basslines bottom out beneath faux-Anglo vocals, and merge with production-added noise-squalls.  As the
    song builds toward a unifying chorus that pleads, ""Put your hands together/ And we'll light this night/
    Light this night on fire,"" the image conveyed is more of trash-can weenie roasts than the inter-city
    conflagration the album attempts to incite.  These faceless angst-jams constitute the album's entire
    runtime, from the flame-out angularity of ""The Melting Moon"" to the watery dance-punk of ""No Cabaret"".</p><p>
    
    When not tracking 80s legends through the velveteen eve, VHS or BETA find time to retrace their own
    electro-disco roots.  ""Nightwaves"" adds jagged, kinetic guitar striking to their frothy beats, but it's
    the clean, Joe Satriani-inspired soloing that really stands out, wiping away the song's advancing tensions
    amidst cheesy guitar pyrotechnics.  ""Forever"" is an inert, vocoded club track that adds eons to its
    namesake, bleating the title-phrase for almost six stale minutes atop a pungent mechanical beat.  Like so
    much of the album, ideas are borrowed second-hand and regurgitated with a lifeless will to sustain the
    band, but never inspire others.  <i>Night on Fire</i> may be enough to sustain their Astralwerks contract
    for one more album, but by then we'll likely be too preoccupied with more pressing dilemmas to notice.</p></div>"|8458.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8458-night-on-fire/|4.2|Derek Miller

    newly whetted taste for the liquor single-handedly saved France's dying brandy industry, and forged the
    oddest transatlantic bond since <i>Joe Millionaire</i>'s European tryst.  This year, in a repeat show of
    efficacy, icons like Puffy and Andre 3000 have made public appeals to fight political apathy, sparking
    surged interest in politics amongst the hip-hop masses, and narrowing the gap between hip-hop's cultural
    and political influence as the country shifts into election mode.</p><p>
<i>The Beautiful Struggle</i> revels in hip-hop's recent emergence as an iconic powerhouse while
    reintroducing Brooklyn native and ""three time Nobel prize winner"" Talib Kweli as one of the genre's
    most vocal supporters and sharpest antagonists.  This duality has always been present in Kweli's catalog:
    His music embraces the binding value of truth as much as it documents his divergence from the methods
    traditionally used to uphold it.  But that's one reason why <i>The Beautiful Struggle</i> makes such a
    curious addition to his oeuvre: It again challenges his unquestioned integrity in its choice of producers
    while re-evaluating his political poignancy for the new audiences they open him up to.</p><p>
    
    For purists, anything commercial is death, and though 2002's <i>Quality</i> hinted that a move toward a more
    mainstream team of producers might not be out of the question on a future release, the sight of producers
    like The Neptunes, Just Blaze, and Kanye West (who appeared once on <i>Quality</i> before he was an unstoppable
    force on Top 40 radio) here could be a point of contention for Kweli's more uptight contingency.  However, the
    fact that <i>The Beautiful Struggle</i> marks the return of original collaborator Hi-Tek is good news for any
    Kweli fan-- even if he only appears on three of the album's tracks.</p><p>
    
    Meanwhile, up against harder hitting beats, Kweli plays his cards expertly: His adaptive, veteran flow serves
    as an unusually smart counterpoint to the glossy proclivities of his beatmakers, safeguarding him against a
    disaster like The Roots' Scott Storch collaboration ""Don't Say Nuthin'"".  On ""Never Been in Love"", Talib's
    romanticism draws out a less fiery side of the typically aggressive Just Blaze.  Here, behind cracking snares
    and wafting female intonations, Kweli lowers his political guard to wax lovely: ""Jewel of the Nile so I'm
    romancing the stone/ The rhythm is in the words and I watched her dance to my poems.""</p><p>
    
    But even while Kweli's navigation of Big Hip-Hop's tricky terrain is impressive, he predictably doesn't
    make it out completely unscathed.  <i>The Beautiful Struggle</i>'s weakest cuts utilize the industry's
    most banal and lucrative tactic: relentless repetition.  ""I Try"" shamelessly rehashes Kweli's hit ""Get
    By"".  (Note the re-rhyme.)  For this one, Kanye drags out another set of syncopated hi-hats and John
    Legend piano licks while Mary J's guest vocal wears thin in contrast to Simone's moans.  Later, MIDI
    Mafia intervenes with the confusing ""We Got the Beat"", a clumsy mix of vintage Afrika Bambaataa electro
    and Fefe Dobson soul-pop.  I can overlook the occasional embarrassing line (""You just a clone like KFC"")
    and even the questionable Go-Go's allusion, but the Kravitz-esque guitar solo that closes the track out
    is one too many strikes for this unsalvageable album low.</p><p>
    
    What frustrates about <i>The Beautiful Struggle</i> is that its flaws are purely musical: Kweli remains
    the fist-raising visionary who burned ""The Manifesto"" at the Lyricist Lounge with the same fiery pen
    that blazed ""African Lounge"".  And whether he's indicting Sierra Leone's child-mining practices on ""Going
    Hard"" or lamenting the lost innocence of star-struck females on ""Broken Glass"", Kweli continually re-proves
    his aggressive conviction and reaffirms his title as hip-hop's cerebral emcee.  Even his patented Afrocentrism
    finds a home here: ""Black Girl Pain"" intimately details his daughter's joys and pains as she suffers her
    parents' separation and the trials of a black childhood.</p><p>
    
    Talib's greatest challenge as a 21st century emcee, then, will be to reconcile his spiny message with the
    eminence of commercial slickness.  Though <i>The Beautiful Struggle</i> falters at times, and never quite
    reaches the heights of Reflection Eternal, his decision to re-open doors to Hi-Tek for this record was
    a wise one: On the Tek-produced closing title track, Kweli's incisive commentary still captures the listener
    as it did on <i>Train of Thought</i>-- particularly as he closes out the record with the battle cry, ""The
    struggle is too beautiful/ I'm too strong for your slavery.""  The music may be easily swallowed but the
    message is not.</p></div>"|4550.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4550-the-beautiful-struggle/|7.6|Jamin Warren

He's quoted in their online bio: ""Collective
    fear stimulates the herd instinct, and tends to produce ferocity toward those who are not regarded as
    members of the herd.""  The text proper unfolds in the utilitarian language of a socialist pamphlet.
    References to writers like J.G. Ballard and Richard Brautigan accrue like patches on an emo kid's hoodie.
    These guys have read some books, and aren't afraid to say so.</p><p>
    
    That said, it's surprising how little of their intellectual fodder has found its way into their discourse.
    If they've read Russell, they've probably read his pupil, Ludwig Wittgenstein, who would strongly disapprove
    of their dogmatic imprecision: In one illuminating incident, the ever-crotchety philosopher responded to a
    comment about the beauty of a particular tree by asking with irritation, ""What do you <em>mean</em> by that?""</p><p>
    
    Bloc Party thinks that the trees are beautiful and society is screwed, but it's a bit unclear what they
    actually mean.  The dominant paradigm hardly seems subverted by lines like, ""We don't read the papers, we
    don't read the news/ Heaven's never enough, we will never be fooled.""  It's a little galling when namedrops
    outweigh insight in ostensibly political music, but hardly shocking.  In an era when many think Che Guevara
    sang for Rage Against the Machine, you only have to mention the names of great thinkers to blow minds.
    Luckily, Bloc Party fare much better musically than they do rhetorically-- there's nothing ambiguous about
    their rollicking, poppy post-punk. </p><p>
    
    In terms of influences, one wants to say-- you're going to groan-- Gang of Four, The Fall, and Wire.  I
    know, you're thinking: Do we really need any more post-punk fetishists?  When they're this on point, yes.
    The best post-punk stems from the construction of a perfectly balanced machine, where manic energy,
    peristaltic rhythm, crisp shifts in intensity and tempo, and heartfelt sloganeering achieve a thrumming
    equilibrium.  Bloc Party just fucking <em>nail</em> these precarious dynamics on what's shaping up to be
    the new-wave anthem of the year, ""Banquet"", which opens and closes this EP.  The rigid, crashing drums,
    the dueling staccato guitars, the standard-bearing vocal volleys and strategically deployed ""ah-ooh's""
    add up to a textbook Gang of Four fist-pumper.  The ""Banquet"" remix boils the song down to drums, bass,
    squirrelly embellishments and ephemeral guitar gestures, creating an expansive echo chamber for the
    powerful vocal track.  Hell of a set of pipes on that guy. </p><p>
    
    The nervy guitar spirals and call-and-response verses of ""Staying Fat"" are punctuated by Bloc Party's
    ace-in-the-hole: the soaring chorus, where the syncopated voices merge into towering, horizon-breaking
    harmonies.  The cyclical, droning ""She's Hearing Voices"" was the British single, and it's a curious
    choice, since its churning atmosphere is the least poppy effort on the EP-- would it be asking you to
    swallow too much if I said it sounds like Isaac Brock jamming with TV on the Radio?  Mark E. Smith might
    consider a plagiarism suit upon hearing ""The Marshals are Dead"", but would hopefully be too charmed by
    the strangely beautiful indie-prog of ""The Answer"" to follow through. </p><p>
    
    Bloc Party's politics may be a bit inchoate, but in this sort of music, shouting about a ""new world order""
    is a familiar trope that's ultimately more palatable than the millionth pledge of apathy in an indie-rock
    song.  If intellectual constructs must be reduced to genre signifiers, I suppose that calls for revolution
    are at least more invigorating than celebrations of indifference.  In an era of moral relativism and
    political ambivalence, you have to give it to Bloc Party for singing like they mean it, even if they
    don't make explicitly clear what ""it"" is. </p></div>"|1129.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1129-bloc-party-ep/|8.0|Brian Howe

When they get noisy and decide to experiment, they're more Bryn Jones than Brian Wilson, but both this year's exceptional <i>Sung Tongs</i> and the less-heard 2003 live-in-the-woods document <i>Campfire Songs</i> had those familiar high-pitched and intertwined harmonies. Animal Collective's relationship to the Beach Boys is unusual, though, as they don't seem particularly inspired by Wilson's compositional sense. More than anything, Animal Collective taps directly into the thing that made the Beach Boys a 20th Century American version of sacred music. It's an approach in which voices say more with music than they ever could with words, and it's why the Beach Boys transcended their dorky lyrics as easily as Animal Collective transcend unintelligibility.</p>
<p>Key Collective member Panda Bear (Noah Lennox) conceived <i>Young Prayer</i>, his first widely available solo album, in response to the death of his father, in the very house where the man passed away. Though it's Panda solo, <i>Young Prayer</i> is easily identifiable as an Animal Collective release in the <i>Campfire Songs</i> and <i>Sung Tongs</i> mode, and other Collective members contribute here and there. I asked Lennox once if any particular Animal Collective member was the ""pop guy,"" prone to push the band to a more tuneful and accessible direction, and he denied the existence of such a creature. Comparing <i>Young Prayer</i> side-by-side with the Avey Tare split EP on Leaf, however, Panda fits the profile.</p>
<p>There are no song titles on <i>Young Prayer</i>, but it seems destined to be the kind of cult record, like Aphex Twin's <i>Selected Ambient Works Vol. II</i>, for which listeners will make up their own. Actually, everything about it suggests cult; it's the kind of record that will have a profound impact on a small number of people, be ridiculed by a few more, and never be heard at all by almost everybody. <i>Young Prayer</i> is incredibly personal and naked, but it's also unique, and it will doubtless disappear and be rediscovered periodically as years pass.</p>
<p>Though <i>Young Prayer</i> is extremely accessible and consists mostly of voice, guitar, and piano, the ""tunes"" are hard to source. No folk or pop music I can name is structured quite like this. In an odd way, <i>Young Prayer</i> seems inspired by Gregorian chant, as notes seem bent in accordance to a mysterious logic recorded in some dusty scroll. The inspiration of the mass is most prevalent on Track 7, where the deep, aquatic echo seems as if it were achieved by having Lennox sing on one end of the Sistine Chapel into a microphone posted at the other. The final track, in which Lennox sings at the bottom end of his range, sounds even more like a monk channeling a biblical precept in Latin, and augmented by two overlapping piano lines inspired by classical minimalism (the Reich homage is reminiscent of the piano line from Stereolab's ""Blue Milk""). It's hard to imagine a more lovely or appropriate closer.</p>
<p>The arrangements are simple as can be, with the majority of the nine tracks (it's a perfectly short album at just under 30 minutes) consisting of acoustic guitar and voice, and the sequencing is superb. As the second track ends at an emotional peak with the word ""rejoice,"" the minute-long guitar and piano interlude lightly carried the listener to the next, more emotionally exhausting song. And after the fourth track, which is the most evocative of <i>Campfire Songs</i> of anything here, with its unsteady acoustic banging and singing that seems design to disappear quietly into the night sky, a summer camp chant-and-clap canon follows to bring us back down to earth.</p>
<p>Where <i>Campfire Songs</i> was filled with odd overlapping harmonies, <i>Young Prayer</i> finds Lennox typically using a single track for vocals, alternating between a quavering tenor and an even more unsteady falsetto. The fearlessness of his singing here, as Lennox navigates odd runs and subjects his melodies to unusual effects, is the heart of <i>Young Prayer</i>. He's a <i>good</i> singer, no question, but fortunately, he refuses to compose within his limitations. Moments such as the tail end of the first track, when he jumps up an octave to finish the phrase ""how you will know me"" (my best guess-- the diction makes precise lyric decoding exceedingly difficult) at a point a note above his falsetto range, lends a layer of incredible poignancy.</p>
<p>If Brian Wilson's ultimate goal was to create a ""teenage symphony to god,"" Panda Bear and the rest of Animal Collective realize that the liturgical part of that equation was most important. Lyrics may be hard to make out and budgets are far too low for symphonies, but the god part they have down, and those moments in life we get close to but can never quite explain inspire every note of <i>Young Prayer</i>.</p></div>"|6141.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6141-young-prayer/|8.5|Mark Richardson

    Without Some Touch of Madness</i> finds Thalia Zedek once again fearlessly sifting through past mistakes and
    old regrets in an attempt to find some guidance for the future.  In her previous work with bands like Uzi,
    Live Skull, and Come, and now as a solo artist, Zedek has never shied away from mining some seriously
    desperate emotional terrain, which may be one reason why her formidable but inhospitable body of work
    remains so under-appreciated.</p><p>
    
    Unwary newcomers will find little to comfort them here, as Zedek returns to the same spare instrumental
    line-up she used on 2002's <i>You're a Big Girl Now</i>.  Her voice has matured to a fine saw-toothed rasp,
    and carries with it the echoes of every hard minute through which she's lived.  Violist David Curry has
    replaced Come's brilliant Chris Brokaw as Zedek's chief musical foil, and his spirited, evocative playing
    encircles these songs like a cloud of devilish smoke.  (Cello, piano and pedal steel also make brief but
    crucial appearances in accompaniment to Zedek's voice and guitar.)  Though the musicians occasionally
    make overt references to traditional blues, C&amp;W;, or Appalachian folk, the proceedings here generally
    breathe in the same nebulous, turbulent atmosphere that has fueled groups like the Bad Seeds or The
    Dirty Three.</p><p>
    
    Zedek has never been drawn to simple verse/chorus/verse structures, and at first glance her melodies can
    seem sprawling and unwieldy.  After a couple careful listens, though, the ingenious latticework of songs
    like ""Ship"" or ""Evil Hand"" slowly unfold themselves to leave a powerful and lasting impression.  Nearly
    every track features a series of fitful crescendos that emerge from the raging dialogues between Curry's
    viola, the restless drumming of Daniel Curry, and Zedek's guitar. (On top of everything else she's become
    quite a unique and underrated guitar stylist.)</p><p>
    
    ""I don't know what memories are for/ We just go back and forth,"" Zedek sings on ""Bone"", one of several
    harrowing portraits of relationships caught in a repetitive cycle of destruction.  Throughout the album
    she continues to question the value of memory, particularly if we persistently fail to heed the lessons of
    the past. In the song ""Virginia"" she advises, ""Don't ever look back... you'll lose everything if you do,""
    and on ""Sailor"" she displays little sympathy for those who brazenly ignore the warnings they've been given:
    ""Do not weep for the sailor who won't prostrate before the storm/ We all knew it had been foretold there
    was red sky in the morn.""</p><p>
    
    But still she returns again and again to explore occasions of past guilt or remorse like worrying about a
    loose tooth, and in so doing she draws some pretty bleak conclusions: ""It's all over now/ Whatever you've
    found is what you will die with.""  It's not exactly uplifting stuff, and as with melancholic peers like
    Vic Chesnutt or Richard Buckner the relentless darkness of her material is likely to keep her relegated to
    the status of cult favorite.  Thankfully, here she allows her guitar and Curry's viola to get the final
    word, sending the closing ""Hell Is in Hello"" sailing in a cathartic maelstrom of noise and feedback,
    hopefully purging away the demons of memory once and for all.</p></div>"|8946.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8946-trust-not-those-in-whom-without-some-touch-of-madness/|7.8|Matthew Murphy

Songs such as the delicate, dirge-like     ""Banjo #2"" and the gently wistful ""Hotel"" are redolent with both leaf-covered Celtic soil and voices that     echo over the moors: Anne Briggs, Nick Drake, Fairport Convention.  ""The peat catches light,"" Yorkston     observes, softly as ever, on the jig-like ""Shipwreckers"".  Yorkston even came to prominence thanks to     English folkie John Martyn, who played <i>Moving Up Country</i> on radio and brought the youngster on     tour.</p>
<p>Yet Yorkston isn't a traditionalist merely for tradition's sake.  Like Sufjan Stevens' <i>Seven Swans</i>,     <i>Just Beyond the River</i> is an artful, slow-building work-- with banjos!  Whereas Stevens' latest makes     Christianity safe for hipsterdom, Yorkston's record creates a bucolic, timeless world where magic remains     a recent memory.  What lies behind the river?  For Yorkston, it's the terrifying present with its ever-shrinking     family units and a lack of emotional solace casting a fraught shadow over even the most idyllic melody.</p>
<p>Four Tet's Kieran Hebden produced the records and makes near-perfect use of Yorkston's deep voice, which     sounds like sad-folkie Beck with a touch of Ray Davies lilt.  The vocals lie just low enough beneath the     John Fahey guitars, traditional bouzoukis, and occasional strings that it takes several listens for lyrics     like, ""Look beyond my need for clamor/ My clumsy touch and Catholic roving eye,"" to unwrap themselves like     the gift they are.  Honest, understated songwriting makes ""Hermitage"" one of this year's most poignant breakup     songs: ""Take your chances on the wide and open shores/ Pull together all your dreams and make them yours,""     Yorkston tells a lover who criticizes his coldness.</p>
<p>The album winds to a close with ""The Snow It Melts the Soonest"", a track on which the tension between     Yorkston's faerie realm and encroaching modernity finally explodes.  Yorkston heroine Briggs recorded this     traditional folk song a cappella, filling it with her delightfully unaffected melisma.  In Yorkston's     version, the tune drones, pounds, and jabbers in a language that somehow bridges the rest of the album to     Hebden's work.  It also leaves Yorkston's options tantalizingly open for his next album.</p></div>"|8913.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8913-just-beyond-the-river/|7.6|Marc Hogan

    some kind of redemption through music: She's dedicated her latest project-- the debut album from RTX, a
    new trio she's formed with guitarist Jaimo Welch and drummer Nadav Eisenman-- to her recently deceased
    father.  For an alum of 90s sludge-rockers Royal Trux to connect to feelings this humanistic on a record
    is a departure in itself; Herrema and her former bandmate/husband Neil Hagerty always seemed more concerned
    with what came out of the body-- blood, shit, sweat, cries of pain-- than with its intangible insides.
    And yet, this album's title suggests transition and transformation, insanity and death... without ever
    clarifying exactly what's going on.</p><p>
    
    Despite this, Trux aficionados and fans of Hagerty's solo work will find that <i>Transmaniacon</i> retains
    lots of the gritty, disgusting promise that attracted them to the duo in the first place.  Though it seems
    to make a point of avoiding the stoned, lingering distortion of Trux LPs, <i>Transmaniacon</i> is a churning
    guitar album that revels in the super 70s, with brief stretches of disjointed, conceptual blare.  However,
    it can be difficult to find a point to the record's mutton chops and bash-art stylistics.  ""Joint Chief""
    simply reworks Royal Trux's ""Shockwave Rider"" while simultaneously giving Monster Magnet a run for their
    money.  ""Limozine"", too, is all riff and swagger, and no depth, with Herrema's sneering rasp filtered
    through piercing static as Welch unleashes a torrent of blistering fretboard solos.</p><p>
    
    RTX fill this self-produced outing with filters and warbles that, while sometimes intriguing, are more often
    trying.  On ""Heavy Gator"", Herrema's vocal is unnecessarily layered multiple times over faraway guitar and
    simplistic percussion, while the song's real meat-- her ""whoah-whoa's"" and muscular guitar chug-- is left
    to fight against the squelch.  ""PB+J"" takes the effects even further, detaching into a jigsaw of digitized
    pitch-shifts.  Somewhere amongst all these disjointed piece is a hard-rock power-ballad (of some kind), but
    since the song ends so quickly, we're left to wonder whether it's intended as anything more than a lazy
    study in rock 'n' roll regeneration.</p><p>
    
    So maybe <i>Transmaniacon</i> is just a big eardrum buster.  Its guitars are often Mountain-sized, after
    all, and a tour featuring people in bearskin cloaks wouldn't be out of the realm of the expected.
    But then, in come tracks to suggest that Herrema's album dedication does indeed point to a cathartic
    musical agenda: A pained wail that could be woman-made is generated from the chaos of ""Psychic Self
    Defense"", while closer ""Resurrect"" showcases a less-distorted Sonic Youth-meets-Aerosmith pace (and
    elegiac soloing) seems specifically directed towards a watcher from above.  As a series of samples takes
    over its melody, Herrema repeats the song's plaintive vocal phrase, indicating healing or closure wrapped
    in throaty delivery.</p><p>
<i>Transmaniacon</i> could certainly be the start of something good.  There's true songcraft in songs like
    the crashing, ragged ""Pulling Out Now"" or the fuzzed-out Sabbath/Fu Manchu stomp of ""Low Ass Mountain Song"",
    and the album's art direction-- a high-concept version of trad-metal imagery-- is truly awesome.  But
    for now, RTX seem to be having some difficulty deciding whether to focus on boozy rock 'n' roll or noisy
    art projects, and this album's middle ground isn't making much headway toward a lasting impression.</p></div>"|6932.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6932-transmaniacon/|5.8|Johnny Loftus

It was a two-record compilation
    from the mid-70s with all their hits, and for many years, was the only thing I knew about them.  My sister
    also had a copy, so I could listen anytime I wanted.   The artwork for <i>Endless Summer</i> featured a
    painted mural of big Beach Boys heads positioned in wavy jungle grass, and I spent hours looking at their
    grinning, bearded faces, imagining what kind of magic strangeness they were really up to behind ""I Get
    Around"" and ""Catch a Wave"".  Later, I found a book about them, and again saw aged, beaten faces, with lots
    of hair, tacky, yellow pants and inappropriately overweight grown men.  I hadn't even heard <i>Pet Sounds</i>
    yet, but was convinced these people were sad and interesting.  And they usually smiled.</p><p>
    
    Brian Wilson was the son of a songwriter.  He was a naturally creative boy, though also prone to the same
    sunny interests and obsessions as his friends and cousins.  He came of age just as thousands of other kids
    did at the time, learning that this place really could be the land of the free, home of love, peace,
    self-discovery and where everyone he cared about lived.  He loved music.  He still does, though at 61,
    despite the full mane of hair, he doesn't quite sound or write like the same boy who once scored the perfect
    soundtrack for an American summer.  He was obsessed with George Gershwin and vanilla white harmony groups
    like The Four Freshman; he gave the world ""In My Room"" and <i>Pet Sounds</i> in return.  Brian Wilson is
    touring <i>Smile</i> right now, with, they say, an unplugged keyboard and the same stiff onstage demeanor
    he showed during the ""Brian is back"" days.  But then, performance has never been his bag.</p><p>
    
    Wilson abandoned <i>Smile</i>, his painstakingly planned follow-up to <i>Pet Sounds</i>, in 1967 because he
    had a nervous breakdown.  He was emotionally unfit to continue.  He was 24, only a few years older than I
    was when I bought my first bootleg copy of the music.  If you want to know the precise details about how he
    broke down, there are dozens of accounts available (including mine here at <i>Pitchfork</i>).  The short
    end of it has to do with drugs, growing pains, a new cast of friends, and a dysfunctional family.  Brian
    had too much of all those things in the mid-60s; working on what was supposed to be the greatest record
    ever made might not have been the most realistic endeavor.  Or maybe it would have been, had he surrounded
    himself with more understanding people.  Or fewer drugs.  Or better drugs.  Or been able to keep his
    overbearing dad out of the picture.  And on and on and on, until being a fan of the guy is more exhausting
    than it is rewarding.  I really don't blame him for staying in bed for the 70s.</p><p>
    
    I first heard <i>Smile</i> when I compiled my own version of it.  The Beach Boys' <i>Good Vibrations</i> box
    had just come out, containing the first ""officially"" sanctioned missing pieces of the album.  I, like many
    amateur Beach Boys historians, used them, along with the best songs from the boots to make ad-hoc masterpieces.
    I'd read how ""Our Prayer"" was supposed to go first, and it seemed naturally to segue right into ""Heroes &amp;
    Villains"".  Then I had to decide which versions to use.  I strung together the single mix with the ""Cantina""
    version with ""Do You Like Worms"" (its cousin), using a complex system of cassette deck editing techniques--
    that is, I got really good at using the ""pause"" button.  I put Wilson's solo vocal and piano performance of
    ""Surf's Up"" last.  It ended my tape on a bittersweet note, which I guessed was in the spirit of what <i>Smile</i>
    would have been.  I was wrong.  Sigh.  A lot of us were.</p><p>
    
    Darian Sahanaja was right.  Wilson's wife Melinda suggested that Brian take <i>Smile</i> on the road, and
    Sahanaja, keyboardist and backing vocalist in Wilson's touring band (aka The Wondermints) took up the
    sizable task of organizing the project.  He dumped every <i>Smile</i> song and song-fragment he could find
    onto his laptop, took them to Wilson's house and watched as Wilson proceeded to phone no less an authority
    than original lyricist Van Dyke Parks when he needed help remembering lyrics.  They hadn't really kept in
    touch for a few years, but Parks was at Wilson's place within 24 hours-- and would stay for five days-- to
    settle past scores and finish the lost record.</p><p>
    
    The trio made subtle changes to the music when necessary, and in the spring, Wilson headed to Studio One at
    Sunset Sound in Los Angeles to make his record.  Just as he'd made the original ""Good Vibrations"" and ""Heroes
    &amp; Villains"" there, Wilson gathered his band, strings and brass to record the tracks, cutting the basic
    arrangements live while doing the vocals on the same tube consoles his old Beach Boys had.</p><p>
    
    The end result is a great album, albeit one more lighthearted than its myth would suggest.  The music I hear
    is like round pegs in square holes; it's just as insular and manic-compassionate as ""In My Room"" or ""God
    Only Knows"", but filtered through an amiable resolve.  It sounds pleasant and assured, lacking the vulnerable,
    shy wave of hope drenching the old Beach Boys records.  Yet, Wilson's voice sounds great.  It's a bit lower,
    and his inflections have lost some subtlety over the years, but it still carries the weight of those angelic
    melodies (and when it can't, his band helps him out).</p><p>
    
    And what of his band?  The eight musicians who contributed to recording <i>Smile</i> with Wilson not only
    live up to the material, but also make possible what could not have been all those years ago.  They are not
    the Beach Boys.  There is no Carl Wilson.  For better or worse, there is no Mike Love.  But there is the
    music, and all concerned parties should be given some kind of musical amnesty award for managing to avoid
    the pitfalls of posthumous reworking and re-recording.  This is no ghost record or bout of nostalgia.
    Rather than study the lonely, bittersweet passions of Wilson's youth, it celebrates the return of his muse
    and his gift to the world in the form of a ""teenage symphony to God.""</p><p>
<i>Smile</i> begins, as had been expected since Wilson first discussed the album in 1966, with ""Our Prayer"",
    combined with a short piece called ""Gee"", which is, in actuality, an overture to ""Heroes &amp; Villains"".  The
    choir-like group harmonies of ""Our Prayer"" are as beautiful as they had been, originally tacked onto the
    end of 1969's <i>20/20</i>, but in this case, reveal only the tip of an incredible iceberg.  ""Heroes &amp;
    Villains"" begins identically to the 1967 single version, and Wilson's band tackles it with gusto.  Wilson's
    lead vocal sounds markedly gruffer in places, though more telling is his complete lack of hesitation in the
    phrases.  He isn't as sensitive as he used to be, but he makes up for it by nailing every complicated
    counterpoint line and inner harmony voice.</p><p>
    
    After moving through the song's ""cantina"" section, the band segues into ""Roll Plymouth Rock"", which <i>Smile</i>
    historians will recognize under its former title, ""Do You Like Worms?"".  The galloping tympani is no less a
    disorienting force here than it had been originally, but Parks' never-before-tracked lyrics (they are said
    to have been written during the sessions) suggest a clearer narrative rooted in manifest destiny:
    ""Once upon the Sandwich Isles, the social structure steamed upon Hawaii/ Rock, rock, roll Plymouth Rock roll
    over.""  This leads to ""Barnyard"", replete with animal sounds and more new lyrics about chickens and pigpens.
    The short, sad take on ""You Are My Sunshine"" (coupled with ""Old Master Painter"") precedes the climax of
    <i>Smile</i>'s first third, ""Cabin Essence"".  This is the same version as appeared on <i>20/20</i>, though
    in this context is euphoric where it had been unexpected before.</p><p>
    
    The next section begins with ""Wonderful"", performed with harpsichord and understated orchestration (the
    brass, unfortunately, sounds synthesized) and Wilson's original arrangement of vocal harmonies.  ""Song for
    Children"" emerges straight out of that, though fans will recognize it as the first section of a larger piece,
    ""Child Is Father of the Man"".  That piece follows, and is more famous as the coda to the title track of 1971's
    <i>Surf's Up</i> album.  Here, it wallows in ominous piano arpeggios and strings before introducing ""Surf's
    Up"", performed almost identically to Carl Wilson's 1971 production for the Beach Boys.  Brian doesn't take
    the high harmonies on ""brother John"" anymore, but his voice is surprisingly nimble.  Furthermore, Parks'
    lyrics, once considered too abstract by Love, now seem perfectly in accord with the surreal Americana of
    <i>Smile</i>.  ""Canvas the town and brush the backdrop.""  ""Carriage across the fog-two-step to lamplight
    cellar tune.""  ""The laughs come hard in Auld Lang Syne.""</p><p>
    
    The album ends with a suite of Wilson's most idiosyncratic music.  ""I'm In Great Shape/I Wanna Be Around/Workshop""
    form a kind of bizarre interlude for <i>Smile</i>, wherein Wilson pumps up the virtues of ""eggs and grits""
    and wanting to be around when ""someone breaks your heart,"" over the strains of saws and drills.  Things get
    odder as it flows in to ""Vegetables"", performed as a combination of the song from 1967's maligned <i>Smiley
    Smile</i> and the one heard on the <i>Good Vibrations</i> box.  Wilson pulls out the ""Mama Says"" refrain
    (""Sleep a lot, eat a lot, brush 'em like crazy"") before moving into ""On a Holiday"".  Fans will recognize
    this from various boots as just ""Holiday"", but Parks' lyrics (check the sea-chantey rap (?) of, ""Not the
    rum of Carib scum/ It's Port tonight, drink up and come/ Un-weigh the anchor yank and we will party!"") are
    new.</p><p>
    
    ""Wind Chimes"" is the same version as first officially appeared on the <i>Good Vibrations</i> box, but like
    so many others on the album, seems perfectly suited to this context.  When the band rips in during the
    wordless (but for ""do-do-do"" and ""ba-ba-ba"") chorus, I strain to hold back cries of glee.  I haven't
    actually succeeded yet.  This leads to the infamous ""Mrs. O'Leary's Cow"" (also known as ""Fire""), the
    instrumental Wilson once thought so powerful as to cause fires around his city.  It still burns with
    lysergic intensity, albeit refined and featuring none other than backing harmony vocals cribbed from
    <i>Smiley Smile</i>'s ""Fall Breaks and Back to Winter"".</p><p>
<i>Smile</i> ends with ""Good Vibrations"", suggesting in no uncertain terms that Wilson aims to leave
    listeners grinning.  I'll grin.  I'll congratulate him.  I won't wonder too much what might have happened
    had this been released way back when.  And I'll let this record fall into the my still-churning impressions
    of Brian Wilson.  Better late than never?  Yes.</p></div>"|8781.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8781-smile/|9.0|Dominique Leone

    moniker for a Fucking Champs/Trans Am collaboration than the trucking company-esque handle ""Trans Champs""
    that graced the cover of their <i>Double Exposure</i>.  Ever the quirky appeasers, the gentlemen of The
    Fucking Champs and Trans Am have united once again, this time under this improved banner.  The name is
    not only a boon to the asterisk industry, but also tunes in to just what the new group's doing.  The Champs
    have always been enamored of chunkheaded metal and mono 70s handlebar-rock, while Trans Am have recast
    decades past mostly through an ironic/robotic tonic of tape backup drives and synthesizers-- and when
    combined, the two groups find an unusually evenly proportioned middle ground.</p><p>
    
    In other words, everyone can relax a little and stop trying to recharge intellectualism via the instrumental
    form.  <i>Gold</i> gives Trans Am a chance to veer away from the shrillness of their recent work, while the
    Champs don't ride as high on the harmonized guitar hog.  And both groups contribute to a wash of accompanying
    atmospherics that suggests their respective allegiances to electronically created music.</p><p>
    
    Opener ""Bad Leg""'s lurching, stopping, and starting percussion feels like the doing of the Am, while its
    soaring guitar line is all Champs.  And how about that mid-song break into buzzing Pink Floyd keyboard
    fluff?  With two bands' worth of personnel, it's easy for The Fucking Am to fill out the metallic/melodic
    collagism that typifies types like Death From Above 1979 or the louder parts of Eagles of Death Metal, and
    ""Leg"" is a great example of this.  The subsequent ""Gauntlet"" isn't as strong-- particularly its heavily
    treated, heavy-handed vocals make for an awfully weak pun.  That said, a loop of its phase-shifting drum
    fill intro and strutting main riff would still keep a loft of 80s fetishists partying at right angles for
    an entire week.</p><p>
<i>Gold</i>'s midsection again points to its casual amiability.  Starting with a melody inspired by the
    soft-rock saccharine croon of Orleans' ""Still the One"", ""Doing Research for an Autobiography"" shambles
    into a series of descending ""Foreplay/Long Time"" organ solos, and has an endearingly live-recorded quality.
    And ""Taking Liberties"" chucks the instrumental format for a boozy, dangling cigarette backup to the
    chest-beating guest vocal of Jillian Iva.</p><p>
    
    The Fucking Am
    then heightens the micro-prog arc of <i>Double Exposure</i>'s ""First Comes Sunday Morning"" and ""Then Comes
    Saturday Night"", offering a three-way album-closing tribute to hazy seventies sunlight in ""Acoustico Gomez"",
    ""Elastico Gomez"", and ""Electrico Gomez"".  The first is led by its gently plucked lead into a fog glimmering
    keyboards and evocative Vangelis soft focus, while ""Elastico"" is the album's drug rock cocktail, a mess of
    backwards guitar solos and desert heat drones.  The subsequent ""Electrico"" skyrockets <i>Gold</i>'s Me Decade
    muse to a feelgood pinnacle with two guitars dueling and a consistent build.  It's like an ode to the art
    of Boris Vallejo.</p><p>
    
    Subtlety can prove elusive for instrumental rockers, just as identifying them as such gets pretty redundant.
    Their lack of vocals somehow seems to qualify them for press that expects something very serious, or at
    least intellectual.  From F-bombed monikers to loose-limbed referential jams, <i>Gold</i> lets The Fucking
    Champs and Trans Am get conjunctional, and focus on making music instead of upholding a concept.</p></div>"|3323.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3323-gold/|7.0|Johnny Loftus

    from tradition and embracing the avant-garde.  Elaborate collectives such as the Sun Ra Arkestra, the Art
    Ensemble of Chicago, and Miles Davis' hard-fusion trailblazers arrived at a wholly modern big band sound
    through exotic song structures and the use of electric instruments.  With their aggressively lyrical and
    non-linear soloing, John Coltrane, Albert Ayler, and Pharaoh Sanders eradicated the time-honored tenets of
    melody, harmony, and time signature, searching instead for spiritual truth within the music itself.  Free
    jazz, ""the new thing,"" experimental-- whatever it was called, the work of these artists was impassioned,
    unprecedented, and divisive, pushing music into unexpected realms.</p><p>
    
    Around that time-- and at the other end of the spectrum-- funk-jazz was more concerned with keeping a groove
    than breaking new ground.  But it was far from static: Eddie Harris and Herbie Hancock used the on-the-one
    downbeat of James Brown and Sly Stone as the foundation for their sophisticated compositions, while Jimmy
    McGriff and Grant Green's warm, buttery solos dipped blues and R&amp;B; into jazz's jelly jar.  Not as challenging
    to the ear as free jazz, funk-jazz still hit harder than some of the fusionary misfires that followed and,
    20 years later, spawned acid-jazz.</p><p>
    
    Recently reissued on Soul Jazz, Steve Reid's <i>Rhythmatism</i> steps expertly between funky and free. ""Soul
    jazz"" is the perfect moniker for the album, which both reflects the exploratory soloing and marathon track
    lengths of the free jazz school and digs intently into hard-swinging grooves.  Recorded in 1975, <i>Rhythmatism</i>
    is exactly what its title implies: an examination into the power and pliability of the beat.</p><p>
    
    Reid takes the helm on drums, and the rest of his acoustic quintet-- bass, piano, sax, and trombone-- exudes
    a warm, earthy sound, diving into the rhythmic core of their instruments rather than taking them on unfettered
    flights.  Reid's drums propel these tunes against their tempo, building tension through repetition and slight
    nuance.  There are no flashy fills-- instead, he's content to add subtle color with variations in volume and
    pace.</p><p>
    
    Album opener ""Kai"" is a masterpiece, a luscious, essential listen for anyone looking to discern the sanguine,
    pulsing heart of jazz music.  Composer Les Walker's piano spars with Reid's hypnotic stick-and-brush work,
    but the drummer never flinches as the pianist hopscotches across the keys.  Arthur Blythe alternates between
    flow and fire on alto sax while David Wertman's slippery upright bass provides a round, hearty bottom end.
    This 12-minute epic isn't a casual listen, but it's so fulfilling that you'll want to grant it your complete
    attention.</p><p>
    
    ""Rocks (For Cannonball)"" is the album's most explosively abstract tune thanks to Walker's meandering keyboard
    hysterics.  Throughout it all, however, Reid stays locked on course.  His technique comes to the fore as he
    pounds his kit against polyrhythmic percussion-- tambourine, shakers, bells-- plied by other band members.
    Once again, the rhythm section of Reid and Wertman is formidable and unshakable, and throughout this track--
    as well as ""C You Around""-- Blythe's minor-key sorties on alto are reminiscent of late-era Coltrane.  The
    effect is transporting.</p><p>
    
    Beginning <i>in medias res</i>, the criminally short ""Center of the Earth"" is the album's emotional centerpiece.
    It sounds as if a studio tech pressed ""record"" at the teary-eyed peak of a climactic jam.  With a sudden
    explosion of baritone sax, trumpet, and guitar-- plus a boxful of percussion toys-- the whole song is one
    ecstatic, extended crescendo.  Music doesn't get any more joyful than this without putting its tongue in
    its cheek, and that's something a soul master like Reid simply had no reason to do.</p></div>"|6930.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6930-rhythmatism/|9.0|Jonathan Zwickel

    bad guys in movies.  The men of Silkworm, I'm guessing, ignore both the good guys and the bad guys and
    instead root for the extras.  And if you've ever watched a movie and concentrated on the potentially
    complex inner lives of the nameless inhabitants who mill about behind the central action, <i>It'll Be
    Cool</i> might become your soundtrack of choice.</p><p>
    
    Silkworm are like the character actors who deliver flawless supporting performances in film after film, the
    ones who everybody recognizes but whose faces you always have trouble placing and whose names you never
    remember.  <i>It'll Be Cool</i>, produced with typical brawniness by Steve Albini, is the band's ninth
    album, and it's as sturdy, dependable, and wholly unconcerned with fashion as ever.  But reliability only
    takes a band so far, and once again, Silkworm have crafted a splendid album that risks being forgotten
    as soon as the end credits roll.</p><p>
    
    Throughout <i>It'll Be Cool</i>, Silkworm are able to drudge up all the emotional drama they require for
    their miniature narratives by investigating what would usually be considered the margins of the action.
    Songs are set in places like hockey penalty boxes, funeral parlors, and sinking yachts.  On ""Insomnia"",
    they sing about Julius Caesar but it's to discuss the emperor's sleeping disorder rather than any of his
    more glorious or photogenic exploits.  ""You are always looking past the facts/ You put your faith in the
    Christian undertaker/ Like he can repay your debts,"" bassist/vocalist Tim Midgett accuses on ""Xian Undertaker"",
    with audible disdain for those who wish to overlook the seemingly minor events that comprise the bulk of
    our lives.</p><p>
    
    This lyrical attention to quirky detail stands in marked contrast to the broad, blunt strokes of Silkworm's
    instrumental attack.  More than ever before, they're musically centered on Midgett's burly, economic bass
    and the locomotive drumming of Michael Dahlquist.  The near-motorik chug of opener ""Don't Look Back"" sounds
    as though it could have extended for miles in any direction had the band kept the tape running.  (Although
    they would've benefited from repeating the song title about 25 fewer times.)  Riff-centric tracks like ""The
    Operative"" and ""Insomnia"" make judicious use of Amphetamine Reptile's back catalog-- a satisfyingly untrendy
    decision.  Elsewhere, they incorporate luxury items such as mandolins or Matt Kadane's keyboards into the
    blend, although on the electronically grating ""Penalty Box"" you'll likely wish they hadn't bothered.</p><p>
    
    Ultimately, <i>It'll Be Cool</i> succumbs to the general lack of ambition that has always been Silkworm's
    Achilles' heel.  (""If sleeping were a battle we would meet for drills at 3:00 am,"" Midgett sings at one
    point.)  Diehards may quietly argue about which of the band's many albums might eventually stand as their
    masterpiece, but it's tough to ignore the fact that since 1996's <i>Firewater</i> all of their movement
    has been lateral.</p></div>"|7160.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7160-itll-be-cool/|7.1|Matthew Murphy

He tells the whole story here, about the random beatdown he suffered
    in front of a Gap, a humiliation so surprising he couldn't fight back.  Even cracking jokes about it to
    friends doesn't disguise his embarrassment, or hide the hollow in his mouth where his teeth went missing.
    And that's not the only crisis in Morrison's life: After nearly a decade of leading The Dismemberment Plan
    to indie stardom, he's watched the band slowly dissolve, and now been thrust into a solo career by default.
    The D-Plan's XTC- and Talking Heads-derived spaz-rock had propelled the band to rarely met heights of
    underground glory, but it was Morrison's bug-eyed eloquence that sealed the deal.  Their strongest album,
    1999's <i>Emergency &amp; I</i>, brilliantly nailed the post-collegiate urban anxieties of the young, frustrated
    and smartassed, fluent in ironic prime-time catchphrases and all too familiar with the sensation of finding
    adult freedom at last, only to waste weekends in a crappy apartment because they're never invited to the
    good parties.  Did I mention he also turned 30?</p><p>
    
    You might expect Morrison's solo debut to build upon the mellower sound he cultivated with The Dismemberment
    Plan on 2001's <i>Change</i>, and <i>Travistan</i> does occasionally flirt with it.  But mostly, Morrison
    takes the record in a completely unexpected direction-- and when he does, he leaves the listener far behind.
    <i>Travistan</i> fails so bizarrely that it's hard to guess what Morrison wanted to accomplish in the first
    place; the guy who led sing-alongs to sold-out crowds can't find the words on his own album.  I've never
    heard a record more angry, frustrated, and even defensive about its own weaknesses, or more determined to
    slug those flaws right down your throat.</p><p>
    
    Morrison went into the studio with Chris Walla and Don Zientara behind the boards; John Vanderslice guests,
    and Death Cab for Cutie's Jason McGerr attempts to recreate Joe Easley's polyrhythmic drumming.  The music
    Morrison's written for the project, however, is mostly undistinguished.  Once again, his monotone winds
    through modulating melodies while synthlines unravel like ribbon candy or squeal to meet the harshness of
    his screams.  On this familiar ground, <i>Travistan</i> starts with a relative bang: The first of the
    album's four (!) ""Get Me Off This Coin"" interludes can nearly be forgiven when Morrison kicks off ""Change"",
    whose rhythmic anxiety-attack, twisting hooks, and (of course) title cleanly evoke his previous work.</p><p>
    
    But, following ""My Two Front Teeth, Parts 2 and 3""-- in which he relays that story about getting his face
    pounded-- we discover where <i>Travistan</i> fails: its lyrics.  Throughout the record, Morrison seems dead
    set on sabotaging the music's few positive attributes with fatal dorkisms and a surprisingly dad-like sense
    of humor.  Here, he reflects on his post-brawl aftermath in a mirror wondering, ""Why me?/ Why now?/ I look
    like Gordie Howe!""-- before breaking into the keening, repeated climax, ""All I want for Christmas is my two
    front teeth/ My two front teeth/ My two front teeth.""</p><p>
    
    It worsens.  ""People Die"" finds Morrison trying his hand at Shel Silverstein's dark-tinted child-poems:
    ""People Die/ It's the facts/ So there, I said it/ Now you can relax.../ People die/ La de da/ It gives the
    day a certain <i>je ne sais quoi</i>.""  ""Change"" opens, ""Moses comes down from the mountain and he's pissed.../
    He says, 'Y'all coulda built a boat/ If anybody had the guts/ While I was up there talking to trees and
    growing my beard to my nuts.""  But those aforementioned ""Get Me Off This Coin"" bits seem to house the
    highest per capita stinkers.  Each presents a former U.S. president protesting his likeness on American
    currency, and features a line like, ""I like my nations in constant revolution/ And my booty wide.""</p><p>
    
    At times, Morrison's matter-of-fact lyrics and fascination with history actually recall <i>Schoolhouse Rock</i>.
    Can you identify each president in the ""Coin"" tracks?  Which one smoked dope with black girls at Monticello?
    Which one had a town named after them in which no one is able to vote?  Can you draw all of the animals he
    names on ""Song for the Orca""?</p><p>
    
    A bigger problem with <i>Travistan</i> is Morrison's tendency to leave themes unresolved.  In ""Che Guevara
    Poster"", he nearly seems ready to offer some sort of criticism or approval of the revolutionary figure's
    recent ubiquity, but then loses focus.  The brutality from ""My Two Front Teeth, Parts 2 and 3"" returns on
    ""Song for the Orca"", in which he sings about zoo animals who dream of retaliating against masters who
    abuse them, but never makes it past the gruesome panorama.  After years of turning hyper-detailed imagery
    into terrific stories, Morrison now seems to lack the sustenance or patience to provide closure on the
    books he opens.</p><p>
    
    Along with the album's hidden track (a pretty blur of indietronica), the second half of ""Che Guevera Poster""
    stands out as a rare exception.  Here, Morrison relates his grandfather's tribulations as a union-employed
    immigrant in early 20th century St. Paul, detailing his hardships and personal flaws in a tone that's
    simple and sincere.  Even his voice sounds different as he lets down his guard and begins to communicate,
    and maybe because the lyrics sound so genuine, the song takes on a more affecting air than his other two
    ballads.  On the sub-Eels ""Any Open Door"", he tries to make lines like, ""Alone with my thoughts/ Yeah,
    alone with my cell phone,"" sound soul-searching.  And the big finale-- piano ballad ""Angry Angel""-- never
    even gets off the ground: Morrison's thin, reedy throat was never at its best outside his signature
    sing/speak, and his decision to aim for soaring Disney ascension is grossly misguided, to put it kindly.</p><p>
    
    ""I don't want to fight,"" sings Morrison at the end; ""I don't want revenge.""  But as <i>Travistan</i> winds
    down into one final ""Get Me Off This Coin"", it doesn't appear to be quite that simple.  By claiming to make
    peace with the corporeal blows he suffered in that Gap-front melee, he reveals not just the kernel of potential
    that's buried in this record, but also the very problem with it: <i>Travistan</i> only allows us to briefly
    glimpse a series of images and storylines, but makes no effort to help us understand them, or to see them
    through his eyes.  Morrison makes a spectacle of his almost physical reaction to stress, as he faces a new
    crowd and a new phase of his career.  We watch him take shelter behind the familiar, then launch into one
    bad idea after another with the faith that at least one of them might work.  We all get there someday--
    turning 30, feeling doubts, taking chances that might get us knocked down.  But someone with Morrison's
    talent should communicate these insecurities, dissect them, and ultimately make them melt away.  Listening
    to <i>Travistan</i>, it seems doubtful he can even do that for himself.</p></div>"|5607.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5607-travistan/|0.0|Chris Dahlen

    flourished under the 70s-lite grandeur of producer Dave Fridmann, who positioned lead singers Alun Woodward
    and Emma Pollock as a modern-day Carpenters. The Delgados and Fridmann had dabbled with big set pieces in
    the past, but those were just diversions compared to their work on <i>Hate</i>, on which coursing melodies
    are buoyed by orchestration and every bold gesture has an even bolder swell to carry it.</p><p>
    
    In a smaller way, <i>Universal Audio</i> sounds just as dramatic.  On the face of it, The Delgados have
    recorded a stripped-down pop record, all guitar singles and piano ballads.  But the album isn't ""raw"" so
    much as ""just right.""  And although the record's generic and misleading first single, ""Everybody Come Down"",
    promises an album of buzzing guitar pop, The Delgados are actually more troubled and complex than ever.</p><p>
    
    With fewer instruments to fight against, Pollock all but steals the show.  Where <i>Hate</i> projected her
    into a 50s hologram, this time her voice is powerfully bare and introspective.  Pollock opens the album with
    the defiant stand and unblinking guitars of ""I Fought the Angels"", but from there she's rocked and challenged,
    nearly surrendering on ""Come Undone"", then recovering with the gentle lilt of ""Sink or Swim"".  The songs on
    which she takes lead vocals serve as a touching slideshow of the doubts that underlie her sweet, haunted
    voice.</p><p>
    
    By contrast, Woodward's turns on the mic are bold and unflappable, and as such, his approach seems at odds
    with Pollock's.  While the late-era XTC knock-off ""Bits of Bone"" sets up the gloom of ""The City Consumes
    Us"", there's an uneasy jolt to the Olympic fanfare of ""Girls of Valour"".  Pollock follows that track with
    ""Keep on Breathing"" like a nagging mother.  The sequencing of happy-to-sad isn't as disconcerting as the
    way each voice takes a side: Pollock sees the grim possibilities that Woodward refuses to acknowledge.
    ""Let's go out and fight forever!"" he declares; ""Watch how this city destroys us,"" she moans. ""This is how
    it feels to drown,"" Pollock gasps; Woodward suggests, ""Bang a gong!""</p><p>
    
    That disconnect confirms the suspicion that this is an album of singles.  But even if <i>Hate</i> stands as
    their most visionary statement, <i>Universal Audio</i> has a subtler strength.  As a result, its few moments
    of resolution-- such as when, on ""Girls of Valour"", Woodward unleashes Beach Boys harmonies on the chorus
    only to have Pollock slip in beside him-- hit that much harder.  Her interjection simultaneously pulls him
    down to earth and tosses him back in the air, feeding him the poignancy that makes his confidence believable.</p></div>"|2269.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2269-universal-audio/|7.6|Chris Dahlen

It allowed a group of mostly black and
    gay Chicagoans who grew up in the home of the Disco Demolition Night to both construct a unique, singular
    canvas and paint on that blank cloth a sensual and often sexual portrait of the struggle to assert and
    celebrate their uniqueness and individuality.  That sense of community was found at a trio of influential
    clubs-- Frankie Knuckles' Warehouse and Power Plant, and Ron Hardy's Music Box.  Knuckles and Hardy ruled
    over Chicago's early 1980s clubland environment, filling the post-disco dancefloor void with a mix of European
    synth-pop, Philly Soul, funk, and Italian disco, often splicing and extending sequences, mixing live with a
    reel-to-reel, and experimenting with rhythm tracks.  Their devotees were so enthralled that, like the fabled
    reactions to The Sex Pistols' early UK performances, they maxed out their credit cards on musical equipment
    and led a DIY revolution.</p><p>
    
    In the hands of these admitted amateurs, the typical laws of music-making and song structure weren't applicable.
    Instead, they fumbled about and created an alien sound; a few years later-- misusing the TB-303 drum machine--
    some of these same artists created the then-eye-bulging but now-familiar squelches and burps that characterize
    acid house.  Just as New Yorkers had abused the turntable and transformed the breakbeat into a musical
    science, these enthusiastic and mostly untrained kids smashed the rulebook and democratized the music-making
    process.</p><p>
    
    When most of these new creations were finally put on vinyl, they were usually released on Trax Records, an
    infamous label typically known almost as much for its corner-cutting as its groundshifting output.  Thankfully,
    that's being redressed with the revitalization of the label and the release of a series of compilations
    celebrating its role in the radical alteration of dance music.  The best of these releases (which also
    includes <i>Acid Classics</i> and <i>Queer Trax</i>) is <i>Trax Records: 20th Anniversary Edition</i>, a
    three-disc collection of the label's best 1980s work.  The first two discs are a pair of continuous mixes
    by Maurice Joshua and Paul Johnson; the third is a potentially superfluous unmixed collection of 12 of the
    label's best-loved tracks, each of which is also featured elsewhere in the collection.  The discs boast
    both the minimal, lurching sound of track-oriented house and more soulful, disco-rooted, gospel-tinged,
    and usually female-vocaled song-oriented house, all grounded by the steady four-to-the-floor beat that
    still characterizes the genre today.  The first disc hogs most of the big names and anthems (including
    Adonis' ""No Way Back"", Phuture's ""Acid Tracks"", Master C&amp;J;'s ""Dub Love"", and co-mixer Maurice's ""This Is
    Acid""), while the second unearths some less-known but equally compelling gems.</p><p>
    
    A uniquely Chicago sound, house was able to become a local sensation-- it elbowed its way onto nighttime
    radio playlists, and some singles sold upwards of 10,000 copies in the city alone-- without the meddling
    influences of either industry or celebrity culture.  As a result, Knuckles' and Hardy's clubs weren't as
    quickly given over to the cult of exclusivity that had helped expedite the last days of disco a few years
    earlier.  However, almost everything else that disco's detractors disliked about that late-70s sound was
    magnified by house: It's mechanical and sexual, and the early ""jack"" tracks-- house's version of dance-craze
    tunes-- could be seen as utilitarian.  Were house lovers confronted with such accusations, they'd likely
    shrug or smile: Otherworldly sounds that mix the funky hedonism of Prince and the primal mechanics of
    Giorgio Moroder?  Yes, please.</p><p>
    
    The Second City has long celebrated its role in the creation and nurturing of jazz and blues, but until this
    summer's Frankie Knuckles Day has heretofore neglected to recognize its role in the birth of house music.  It's
    a shame because, in many ways, house is a more purely Chicago sound than any of those others.  Even in the
    days before the current Mayor Daley's beautification initiatives, Chicago's gorgeous skyline dwarfed cracked
    concrete and cold steel, serving as a reminder that, in the hands of architectural visionaries from Daniel
    Burnham to Mies van der Rohe, aesthetics and utilitarianism aren't opposing ideas and that elegance needn't
    be sacrificed to modernity.  So just as Detroit-- Chicago's sister city in the 1980s electronic dance music
    revolution-- seemed a natural setting for techno's dystopian nightmares, Europhile escapist fantasies, and
    almost post-human (even post-apocalyptic) sound, house perfectly captures the beauty and beast qualities of
    Chicago's urban landscape. It freely embraces both crisp, modern sci-fi sounds and raw, unchecked sexuality
    and lurching beats, and, in some ways, is therefore perhaps the exception to the idea that ""dancing about
    architecture"" is perverse and/or impossible.</p><p>
    
    In one sense, this collection is first and foremost a historical document, the first Trax-sanctioned
    compilation in the label's history.  As a document of the development of one the world's best-loved musical
    genres, it demonstrates that groundbreaking music-- even when it's fairly minimal, almost basic-- is not
    necessarily rudimentary.  The more song-based tracks-- the ones which carry the old remnants of diva
    disco-- are perhaps the most surprisingly appealing, especially because I've always preferred the track-y
    end of house and still do (and prefer it on this collection, too).  Yet, as wonderful as the more raw,
    bare-bones sonics of tracks such as Mr. Fingers' ""Can You Feel It"" are, the version included here adds
    deep, rich vocals which turn it into a clarion call for togetherness and unity without spilling into
    melodramatics or empty bombast.  As a result, claims that ""this song is all about life"" and ""I can see
    all my brothers/ Seated around a table of fellowship"" are wistful and urgent, hopeful but yet mindful of
    the improbability of the song's prophecy.</p><p>
    
    Similarly, on one of the set's most muscular tracks, Marshall Jefferson's ""Bird in a Gilded Cage"" doesn't
    soar across an empty blue sky; instead it negotiates ambient jungle-and-animal sounds.  Jefferson faces
    reality as he dreams of utopia.  On this set, that tension blends into the release of Hercules' ""7 Ways to
    Jack"", again highlighting that when it comes to race and sexuality, the politics of dancing isn't just a
    catchy chorus.  Racial and sexual dynamics are so linked in some elements of house that ""South Africa/Let
    My People Go"" and the Prince-like incantation, ""She brought me to my knees/ For love/ Made me beg and plead/
    For love,"" share space on Knuckles' and Jamie Principle's ""Baby Wants to Ride"".</p><p>
    
    Even the reality of life in Chicago (and New York, Munich, Berlin, Tokyo, Rotterdam, London, etc.) was harsh,
    a sort of utopia was within reach on the dancefloor, with the uniformity of that familiar 4/4 beat serving as
    a great leveler and the shared foundation of what became a worldwide community. Above all, then, this is a
    document of a sonic revolution, one that destroyed the notions of authorship, the empty claims of authenticity,
    and music crit's now-bizarre preference for linear histories instead of paradigm shifts. More importantly,
    it unleashed the world of possibility of electronic music onto the dancefloor, demonstrating that machine
    music isn't merely chin-stroking science-- it's also the body-shifting humanity.</p></div>"|2054.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2054-trax-records-20th-anniversary-collection/|9.1|Scott Plagenhoef

Trends seem to become passé overnight,
    and in 2004, few sounds have been more cold-shouldered than electroclash.  Sadly, Caroline Herve (aka Miss
    Kittin) has had to bear that burden.  Much of the credit for her previous work went to production partners
    such as Goldenboy, Felix da Housecat, and The Hacker, the latter of which provided the beats on the 2001
    collaboration, <i>The First Album</i>.  Despite often working as a co-producer, Miss Kittin has been
    inadvertently written off as the electroclash gal with the heathen voice, the vixen who rasped atop oily
    dance jams.  Miss Kittin, however, is not only a deft producer in her own right, but through her
    cover-mounted <i>Muzik</i> mix, <i>On the Road</i>, and <i>Radio Caroline, Vol. 1</i> she has also
    repositioned herself as an innovative dancefloor helmswoman.</p><p>
    For her first solo studio album, <i>I Com</i>, Miss Kittin roped in The Hacker and another set of guest
    co-producers: Tobi Neumann of Peaches' fame and Thies Mynthier of the German poptronic duo Phantom Ghost.
    The record mixes bed-sweat techno, glaciered electronic wirescapes, and sang-froid sing/speak into a
    throbbing blend that saunter from desolate love hymns to heaving jams.</p><p>
    ""Happy Violentine"" is a love song pulled inside out, a track that seems pleased to display its visceral
    heartbreak.  Atop oriental strings and subtle electro-plinks, Kittin juxtaposes ethereal disconnect with
    cutting, ironic heartbreak, particularly when her detached voice lulls itself into the lines, ""Switch me
    in a stand-by mode/ Until someone presses play.""</p><p>
    Retracing that duality, ""Allergic"" rides pacemaker beats and subtle, revolving synths underneath Kittin's
    whispered vocals.  Gangrenous and toxic, the song straddles the line between tongue-in-cheek irony and
    outright stupidity, as Miss Kittin tracks the self-adoration behind self-loathing and declares she's
    ""allergic to [my]self.""  The soft backdrop gives her room to reshape her strange secondhand-English
    wording, and it results in a glorious confusion that's as intoxicating as it is bewildering.</p><p>
    Perhaps the album's highlight is the spunky ode to computerized pleasure, ""Icome.com"".  Over dense synthlines
    and quiet, woodblock-beats, Kittin slithers through her pleasures and her foils in a cheap, dirty carol to
    technological solitude.  Creative despondency and inter-wired frenzy collapse upon themselves in a testimonial
    to self-love, a world where the frameworks of release are flickering blue-screens and spent friction.</p><p>
    Unfortunately, some of Kittin's lyrical deficits undercut her production.  ""Requiem for a Hit"" stumbles
    out of the gate with the ironic plea, ""Show me your tits and let's make a hit,"" and the phrase doesn't get
    any funnier when it's repeated <i>ad nauseam</i>.  One of the great failures of postmodernism is an
    inability to restrain our own sense of irony, but here's one shining example of why we must hold tight
    to that sense of proportion.</p><p>
    ""Clone Me"" shoulders similar dead weight, as it's forced to carry leaden lines like, ""Look at me, myself,
    and I/ My world is mine so multiply,"" and, ""If my minds you can connect/ With myself I will debate.""  In
    a moment of keen synthesis, the album's most banal production mirrors its lyrical void.  Of course, for
    many who admire this French kitty's metronomic beats and elephantine sound, <i>ca n'importe pas</i>-- as
    the beats throb, the words seal into shape.</p></div>"|5608.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5608-i-com/|7.0|Derek Miller

In an interview, singer/songwriter Aaron
    Riches recently compared 2001's demon-haunted <em>Alone at the Microphone</em> to Dante's ""Inferno"", and the
    new record to ""Paradisio"".  Although <em>Little Heart's Ease</em> faithfully follows country-rock strictures--
    from <em>Sweetheart of the Rodeo</em> to <em>Magnolia Electric Co.</em>-- even Dante couldn't skip Purgatory.</p><p>
    
    Neil Hannon aside, my memory of <em>The Divine Comedy</em> isn't as sharp as it should be.  Suffice it to say
    that Purgatory is a boring place to spend a thousand years, although the seven terraces for the seven deadly
    sins gives me an idea for a cool Kevin Spacey movie.  Purgatory isn't terribly exciting over a 43-minute
    record, either.  Royal City's latest has its charms, but Riches' songwriting seems to have lost a certain
    spark since emerging from his previous outing's acoustic fire-and-brimstone.</p><p>
    
    Ostensibly taking its name from an Emily Dickinson poem, <em>Little Heart's Ease</em> follows the poet's
    example.  ""Heaven does not change her blue,"" Dickinson wrote, ""Nor will I, the little Heart's Ease-- Ever
    be induced to do!""  In that spirit, the band sticks to a formula of ragged indie folk that could almost be
    mistaken for Palace or Smog.  ""My Body Is Numbered"" is a slow waltz fit for a Gram Parsons B-side; ""Enemy""
    busts out stoned harmonica and <i>On the Beach</i> guitar solos.  But appropriate alt-country reference
    points can only make a band pleasant, not remarkable.</p><p>
    
    Too often, the new record substitutes weighty, Biblical language for true heft.  ""He will come,"" Riches says
    repeatedly on opener ""Bring My Father a Gift"".  With a bassline that owes back royalties to Paul Revere &amp;
    The Raiders, the song reminds me instead of someone else who ""will return"": Cherokee people, Cherokee
    triii-hiiibe.  Ahem.  ""That My Head Were a Spring"" folds over itself like a not-so-famous blue raincoat.
    ""Weep for me, O ye, O thee,"" goes ""Jerusalem"", a jangly midtempo number.</p><p>
    
    Of course, Dante met Beatrice at the end of ""Purgatorio"".  <em>Little Heart's Ease</em> occasionally foreshadows
    a bright future: the waltz of saloon love song ""Cabbage Rolls"", the harmonies of ""Ain't That the Way"", the
    plaintive descending chords of ""Can't You"".  The poppiest song on the album is ""She Will Come"", which echoes
    the lyrics of the opener.  Here, Royal City break from tradition for an ebullient, handclap-filled breakdown.
    They could be onto something.</p><p>
    
    Alas, ""She Will Come"" also provides the moment when I first began to doubt the record.  It's silly, but when
    Riches sings about dust hanging around ""every nape"" of a girl's neck (a neck has only one nape), I wonder if
    he just scribbled down words that sounded nice rather than writing proper lyrics.  It's like when I realized
    that TV on the Radio were mispronouncing ""prescience"" and started to worry that <em>Desperate Youth, Blood
    Thirsty Babes</em> wouldn't be as brilliant as I hoped.  (It wasn't.)  These may be little things but they
    make such a difference, to paraphrase old Mozzer.  Using words you don't understand isn't just the antithesis
    of rock 'n' roll, it's a move reserved for poseurs and music critics-- and, yes that's a pleonasm.</p><p>
    
    But enough wailing and teeth-gnashing.  <em>Little Heart's Ease</em>, like Purgatory itself, is just transitory.
    Royal City have always seemed on the verge of a truly great album; this is the first time they've just plain
    struck out.  For a follow-up, Royal City could do worse than study band member Jim Guthrie's <em>Now, More
    Than Ever</em>, a 2003 indie-pop masterpiece that puts Royal City's latest to shame.  Or they could look to
    their own non-album cover of ""Is This It"" to see what's really missing: strong melodies and distinctive
    lyrics.  Amen.</p></div>"|6853.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6853-little-hearts-ease/|5.8|Marc Hogan

Often these pairings are one-album stands, as with The Brodsky     Quartet (<em>The Juliet Letters</em>), Anne Sofie Von Otter (<em>For the Stars</em>), or smoky barroom jazz     (<em>North</em>).  Only occasionally has Costello allowed a collaboration to blossom into a creative     relationship.  He's recorded two records with Burt Bacharach (<em>Painted from Memory</em> and <em>The Sweetest     Punch</em>, with Bill Frisell), and laid a foundation for continued collaborative songwriting with his wife,     Diana Krall.</p><p>There is, admittedly, an integrity to this ambitious quest: After more than 25 years, Costello's still     trying to rouse some rabble, albeit through different means and towards different ends than on early albums     like <em>My Aim Is True</em> and <em>This Year's Model</em>.  On one hand, he's obviously following his own muse     as he avoids the inevitable standards album that always seems to signals the creative death of aging stars     like Rod Stewart and Cyndi Lauper (though he did cover Cole Porter earlier this year on the <em>DeLovely</em> soundtrack), and aside from a few missteps, he's succeeded in crafting a very diverse catalog.  On the other,     there's a hint of insecurity in Costello's ramblin' ways-- what, in relationship-speak, might be called a     fear of commitment.</p><p><em>The Delivery Man</em> presents itself as a proper follow-up to 2002's <em>When I Was Cruel</em> (and its     odds-and-ends companion <em>Cruel Smile</em>), as an album in the vein of <em>Almost Blue</em> or <em>King of     America</em>.  Regardless of its rock sound and the presence of his band, The Imposters, <em>The Delivery     Man</em> is more or less just another collaboration-- the particulars of its creation are emphasized over     its music.  This time, however, Costello's collaborator is a place rather than a person.  For <em>The Delivery     Man</em>, he and The Imposters traveled to Sweet Tea Studios in Oxford, Mississippi-- not just the middle of     the Delta but also directly between the birthplace and deathplace of Costello's namesake: Tupelo and Memphis.     And though the disc began life as a concept album about a Southern delivery man seducing his female customers,     Costello willfully worked away from that idea as the project progressed, and little of those origins remain in     the final product, save the album title and the dilapidated truck on the album cover.</p>
<p>Not that Costello has made an album of Delta blues or Sun Studio rockabilly: <em>The Delivery Man</em> is his     idea of Southern music, a blend of pedal steel-drenched country and <em>Dusty in Memphis</em> professionalism.     But it sounds best when it's at its most casual.  The Imposters flex their muscles on barnburners like ""Bedlam""     and ""Needle Time"", proving themselves a dynamic band-- fierce but always controlled, musically inventive but     never slick.  While bassist Davey Faragher and drummer Pete Thomas kick up dust on the opener, ""Button My     Lip"", Steve Nieve sneaks in a piano line from <em>West Side Story</em>, offsetting the rock rhythms with a     self-consciously referential melody.  Likewise, Costello's guest musicians add a distinctly Southern flair     to the proceedings.  Emmylou Harris sings on ""Nothing Clings Like Ivy"" and ""Heart-Shaped Bruise"", but     Costello's best foil is Lucinda Williams, whose throaty, punkish snarl on ""There's a Story in Your Voice""     is a dynamic match for The Imposters' barroom ruckus, which only underscores how smooth and rehearsed     Costello's own vocals sound.</p>
<p>It's clear what The Imposters got out of this sojourn down South-- they sound like they're truly enjoying     themselves-- but less so what Costello did.  For starters, it sounds like he overpacked for the trip,     toting along the polished lyrics and pristine melodies that sound so much more at home in New York.  This     can make for some dramatic juxtapositions of traditions, as on ""Country Darkness"", but often, Costello just     sounds prissy and uptight in these more relaxed environs.  Even his stuttering delivery on ""Button My Lip""     feels rehearsed and academic, as though he hasn't fully committed himself to the spirit of the endeavor.</p>
<p>If <em>The Delivery Man</em> isn't enough of a departure for Costello, the classical <em>Il Sogno</em>, released     simultaneously, at first sounds like perhaps <em>too much</em> of one: It's the score to a ballet adaptation of     Shakespeare's <em>A Midsummer Night's Dream</em>, commissioned by the Italian troupe Aterballetto and performed     by the London Symphony Orchestra under the direction of Michael Tilson Thomas.  With such a highfalutin'     pedigree, it could be a parody of rock-star respectability, right down to the self-serious, auratic Deutsche     Grammophon album cover and the ""Mystery Dance"" joke that's hidden in there somewhere.  While there's something     potentially zany about someone like Costello scoring a ballet, it seems too easy to decry a rock musician's     pretensions to serious art.  On some level, it makes sense to allow seasoned, adventurous rockers this kind     of opportunity.</p>
<p>So maybe it's Costello who's having the last laugh at rock critics who find themselves suddenly out of     their element reviewing a ""classical"" album and who must struggle to form some sort of opinion that reads     as more informed than ""it sounds like the hunchbacked love child of Copeland and Bernstein robbing Puccini's     grave for leftover libretti,"" or, ""It put me to sleep.""  However, Costello is still Costello (or at least     still Declan MacManus), so there are passages that sound more rock- and jazz-informed, like ""Oberon and Titania""     and ""Puck 2"".  The saxophones and drum sets create a jazzy, <em>North</em>-ern tone that sits comfortably     among the more traditional orchestration.  While this approach does break the score's airiness with some     earthier sounds, it's still a risky decision that doesn't entirely pay off, and sometimes carries a whiff     of novelty.  Ultimately, on <em>Il Sogno</em>-- as on <em>The Delivery Man</em>-- Costello seems like a musical     tourist, sending out snapshot postcards from exotic locales but never making his home there.</p>

However, Costello is still Costello (or at least     still Declan MacManus), so there are passages that sound more rock- and jazz-informed, like ""Oberon and Titania""     and ""Puck 2"".  The saxophones and drum sets create a jazzy, <em>North</em>-ern tone that sits comfortably     among the more traditional orchestration.  While this approach does break the score's airiness with some     earthier sounds, it's still a risky decision that doesn't entirely pay off, and sometimes carries a whiff     of novelty.  Ultimately, on <em>Il Sogno</em>-- as on <em>The Delivery Man</em>-- Costello seems like a musical     tourist, sending out snapshot postcards from exotic locales but never making his home there.</p>

    in retrospect, sounds like a popular band reacting to massive overexposure; its masterful statement of
    bruised withdrawal begged to divide a large fanbase, not create one.  There was nothing about Interpol's
    self-contained, visionary debut that might have suggested their subsequent eyebrow-raising catapult to
    fame, particularly given their aversion to the traditional single format. Perhaps Paul Banks' lucid
    expression of discontent and impending dread spoke to an increasingly frustrated audience inundated by a
    generalized threat.  Or maybe Interpol's popularity is simply a case of viscerally powerful music confounding
    formulas of public taste, breaking through purely on the basis of songwriting merit.  Either way, <i>Bright
    Lights</i> set an immeasurably high mark to follow, and its popularity has ensured equally high stakes: If the
    band stumbles, their humiliation will be very public.</p><p>
    
    Fortunately, the members of Interpol understand what other bands take for granted: Careers aren't necessarily
    made or broken by second albums alone, and an ideal follow-up needn't engage the perceived potential of a
    defining debut or consciously redefine a pre-established sound in order to be effective.  Redefinition, in
    particular, is a non-issue for Interpol, because one of the most enduring pleasures of their first album
    is its timeless singularity.  Accordingly, it has been well understood that <i>Antics</i> wasn't going to
    be, nor <i>could</i> it be, <i>Bright Lights 2</i>.  Bootleg versions of new material-- notably the live
    recordings of ""Narc"" and ""Length of Love"" that leaked last summer-- didn't suggest a radically altered
    aesthetic or faceless repetition, nor does <i>Antics</i> deliver either.  Interpol avoid common sophomore
    pitfalls because they refuse to engage the immense weight that surrounds this release, and their tenuous
    position between shrewd self-consciousness and diversionary costume changing informs this album's openness
    and plasticity.</p><p>
<i>Antics</i> exudes a preceding aura of heaviness-- even the packaging is heavy; the album's cryptic liner
    notes consist of little more than stark grayscale photos and epigrammatic Morse code spelling out bits of
    song titles (""Length"", ""Narc"", ""Cruise"", ""Exit"", respectively).  An image from the band's debut appears on
    the first single, ""Slow Hands"", and becomes a representative metaphor for the album as a whole: After
    reflecting on the aftermath of a soured relationship, Banks takes the ""weights"" described in <i>Bright
    Lights</i>' ""Obstacle 1"" from his ""little heart"" and projects them onto the woman who presumably put them
    there to begin with.  Musically, however, the song is far removed from the layered density of Interpol's
    former material, exhibiting pristine, unmuddied production and a chorus (""We spies/ We slow hands/ You put
    the weights all around yourself"") that slithers and stomps with post-punk dance-floor swagger.  Similarly,
    <i>Antics</i> casts off the weight of advance hype, stewing anticipation, and unreasonable expectations,
    and wisely distinguises itself as a strong collection of singles rather than as an immaculately cohesive
    album.  And, where Interpol were once synonymous with emotive desolation, they here opt for an atmosphere
    of poignant resignation.</p><p>
    
    Opener ""Next Exit"" is immediately jarring; a tranquilized doo-wop organ progression and spare percussion
    announce a very different band.  It is explicitly clear that Interpol have changed, from the band's more
    casual tone (""We ain't going to the town/ We're going to the city/ Gonna track this shit around"") to new
    mixing techniques: Carlos D's bass and Daniel Kessler's guitar are relatively hushed in the mix to make
    room for Banks' underscored vocals, allowing him a range of expression previously unexplored and buoying
    the band's newfound pop leanings with lyrical eloquence.  His vocals on tracks like ""Narc"" soar where they
    were once buried in the impermeable fog of their surroundings, and many who found his delivery in the past
    to be occasionally monotonous (company that includes Banks himself) will find his melodic range here to be
    a welcome change of pace.</p><p>
    
    Although most songs evince a clear shift to singles territory, a natural progression of the band's sound
    is evident.  ""Evil"" employs a Pixies-esque bassline and upbeat rhythm section to counterbalance its
    ambiguously bleak lyrical themes.  The band demonstrates judicious restraint on ""Narc"", relegating a
    potentially overbearing blanket of synth strings and organ to a peripheral role while punching up Kessler's
    crisp guitar lines and Carlos D's almost imperceptibly fluid bass work.  The syncopated funk bassline and
    disco-pop rhythm of ""Length of Love"" initially seem to be at odds with the song's lush orchestration, but
    these counter-intuitive touches add a dynamic element to the limited confines of the song's composition.
    The band hasn't lost its knack for exploration and epic construction, though; ""Take You on a Cruise"", ""Not
    Even Jail"", and ""Public Pervert"" steep the album's middle section in the kind of dark theatricality that
    distinguished their debut, while the expansive ""A Time to Be So Small"", with its deliberate pacing and
    depiction of ""cadaverous mobs,"" concludes <i>Antics</i> with unsettling macabre.</p><p>
    
    Though Interpol couldn't be expected to surpass their previous heights, it's difficult to imagine a savvier
    or more satisfying second step.  But the real revelation is that the band has wisely ignored a shortsighted
    perception of their career which dictates that where <i>Bright Lights</i> was an audacious plunge from a
    great height, <i>Antics</i> is the crucial landing.  Even on those terms the band has succeeded.  However,
    their liberation of form emphasizes the fact that, in the grand scheme of Interpol's career, this is only
    one in a series of great, if not Great, albums.  <i>Antics</i> shows Interpol shedding the weight of their
    accumulated baggage and (hopefully) staying a while.</p></div>"|4116.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4116-antics/|8.5|David Moore

    eventually hits that point where they feel compelled to revisit their roots or return to the basics.  Frequently,
    it's simply a chance for the band to try on something more comfortable after exhausting themselves with an
    especially prolific period or particularly ambitious record.  The Hurricane Lamps fall under the latter
    distinction-- their fifth album, <i>More, More, More</i>, is an extremely basic and pared-down rock 'n'
    roll record, while their last, 2003's excellent <i>Sing Me a Song</i>, was a bright, ambitious pop record
    that lied a cut above any of their previous output in terms of sophistication and complexity.</p><p>
<i>More, More, More</i>, on the other hand, announces itself as a different animal even before the shrinkwrap
    is off.  The orange squares featuring close-ups of guitars and drums on the album cover's austere silver
    background imply a lack of adornment and pretense, and the recording backs that up with exceedingly simple
    guitar/bass/drums arrangements played and recorded with the offhandedness of a band with nothing to prove.
    Singer/guitarist Eric Tischler announces the Who-ish opener ""Tell Me You Miss Me"" with a mid-fi guitar riff,
    and drops frequent but economical solos into the mix-- he's always given a little time to playing lead, but
    here he's an axe-wielding maniac, eager to strut and let bassist Greg Bennett and drummer Jason Merriman
    whisk him along on their bare-bones current.</p><p>
    
    Part of what really distances this album from the two that preceded it (and unites it with their first two
    records, 1999's <i>Tales from the Sink</i> and 2000's <i>You Deserve What You Want</i>) is the raw, no-frills-whatsoever
    production treatment they've given it.  Merriman's drums sound like they've got maybe two or three microphones
    on them and Tischler doesn't give his voice any protective armor like reverb or double-tracking, leaving it
    exposed in all its nasal, egg-headed glory.  Every time I think his pinched tenor is perhaps a less than
    optimal vehicle for one of his sticky melodies, I try to imagine anything else working in this context, and
    it seems perfect again.  On ""Everything Must Change"", he lays a strangely melancholy verse over a warp-speed
    arrangement, and it sounds like it could be your brother or your neighbor in the basement firm in the
    conviction that it somehow matters in the grand scheme of things.</p><p>
    
    But <i>does</i> it matter in that grand scheme?  That's impossible to say, but when Tischler sings, ""Sometimes
    you feel like you're drowning/ You're just dying for a breath of air/ Sometimes you feel you need some shelter/
    And it's out there but you don't know where,"" it sure feels like it does, if only for a moment.  And I guess
    that's part of the enduring value and appeal of simple rock 'n' roll like this-- it doesn't matter if it's
    heard by 20 people or 20,000 people, as long as it gets them all to forget their problems for a bit (even
    if they're singing along to someone else's problems).  <i>More, More, More</i> hits on exactly that level,
    and while it's not my favorite Lamps record (that's still <i>Sing Me a Song</i>), it's still a strong reminder
    of the simple joys of a great song pared to the bare essentials and played with bucketloads of enthusiasm.</p></div>"|3969.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3969-more-more-more/|7.3|Joe Tangari

    work.  Some critics were turned off by Williams' bombastic, proclamatory emceeing, which often made no
    pretense of rhythmic consistency or tonal variety.  Yet despite a few bland passages, it was one of my
    favorite albums of '01.  Williams' lyrical turns as a wise punster, revealing the subliminal messages and
    connections embedded in our language, approached the transcendent.  A style that struck some as sterile fed
    others a powerful rhetorical fire, backed by violins and breakbeats.  At the album's climax, on the DJ Krush
    collaboration ""Coded Language"", Williams fervently delivered an indictment of modern consciousness in an
    engineer's technical jargon, culminating in a rapid-fire postmodern jumble of historical figures.  It remains
    an overpowering moment, delivered with the manic energy of a preacher.</p><p>
    
    Williams often exalts the power of metaphor, and the cover of his new self-titled release-- a photograph of
    him driving in a truck, ready to shout through a bullhorn-- indeed allegorizes the music within.  The messages
    of Saul Williams are still delivered with fervency, but the album is musically and lyrically aimed at a wider
    audience than his debut.  Unfortunately, anything shouted through a bullhorn becomes distorted, and in a
    fast-moving vehicle, one's words must be kept simple and easy to digest.  The music here moves away from
    <i>Rock Star</i>'s adventurousness, to attempt a hybridization of his honed social/metaphysical perspective
    with a more populist sound.  As he says on intro ""Talk to Strangers"": ""The earth is not a flat screen/ I
    ain't trying to fit in/ But this ain't for the underground/ This here is for the sun.""  The recurring theme
    of Saul Williams is a resistance to egoistic obstinacy, through messages such as ""vulnerability is power,""
    and ""God is change""-- a sentiment reverberating through his shifting musical style.</p><p>
    
    Here, Williams often adopts the lineage built by socially conscious rappers Public Enemy and Rage Against
    the Machine-- rap backed by a hardcore outfit.  It's clear that he's after an atmosphere of turgid energy
    to match his calls to consciousness.  There's little downtime, and the first half of the album maintains a
    consistently urgent feel.  The dramatic piano and choir of his intro (written by System of a Down's Serj
    Tankian) gives way to ""Grippo""'s dissonant guitar, and a song that contains some of the album's best lines:
    ""I gave hip-hop to white boys when nobody was looking/ They found it locked in a basement when they gentrified
    Brooklyn.../ So substitute the anger and oppression/ With guilt and depression/ And it's yours.""  ""Act III
    Scene 2 (Shakespeare)"", which features guest vocals by Zack de la Rocha, connects America's involvement in
    Iraq to Shakespeare's Julius Caesar: ""This one goes out to my man/ Taking cover in the trenches with a gun
    in his hand/ Then gets home and no one flinches when he can't feed his fam/ But Brutus is an honorable man.""</p><p>
    
    The album's second half is spottier, containing more forgettable material.  Williams' singing voice is too
    thin to carry his sometimes soulful melodies, and songs like ""Surrender (A Second to Think)"" can be difficult
    to listen to.  But ""Control Freak"" is a catchy, concise track, and ""Seaweed"" recalls his more musically
    adventurous journeys of fantastical imagery, with a marimba sample and ethereal female vocals.  Though most
    hip-hop albums strain at the temporal boundaries of a CD, Williams' is over at the 45-minute mark.</p><p>
    
    Saul Williams' recent book of poetry, <i>Said the Shotgun to the Head</i>, is astounding in its use of type
    and font to imply vocal cadence and overall movement, but his recorded voice is sometimes less expressive.
    His efforts here to fit his spoken word into consistent old-school measures dilutes the power in his lyrics,
    where webs of internal rhyme are abandoned for A/B/A/B schemes.  The best tracks hearken back to his original
    style.  Sections of ""Telegram"" are reminiscent of <i>Rock Star</i> single ""Penny for a Thought"" in their
    rhetorical conceits and thematic focus on the enlightenment of hip-hop: ""We are discontinuing our current
    line of braggadocio/ In light of the current trend in realness/ Stop/ As an alternative we will be confiscating
    weed supplies/ And replacing them with magic mushrooms/ In hopes of helping niggas see beyond their reality/
    Stop.""  While the confines of form can help some artists with expressionistic originality, it's freedom that
    allows Williams' full impact to be made.  Similarly, it's a welcome return to his trademark invocations made
    on closer ""Notice of Eviction"": ""Author of wind and change/ Phantom of the opera/ Tenor of the octave range/
    Spews volcanic lava.""</p><p>
    
    It's probably a frustration to artists like Saul Williams to feel as though they're preaching to the converted,
    when their message is one of widespread mental enlightenment.  While the experimentalism of slam poetry is aimed
    at making complex or subtle emotions digestible to large audiences, musical experimentation tends to immediately
    alienate large portions of listeners.  Still, Saul Williams is stuck between two conceits.  To fulfill the
    huge potential inherent in his style, he's either going to have to find more abstract sonics and freer forms
    to compliment his equally liquid verse, or fully give himself over to writing some radio-friendly, MTV-ready
    material.  Either would be a good move from a poet with the potential to fully embody the fiercely potent
    voice of right now.</p></div>"|8692.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8692-saul-williams/|7.2|Liam Singer

    their shit together.  They softened up their heart-on-sleeve politico-art-rock shtick (or at the least drowned
    it in a miasma of guitar distortion), realized they were better mega-riffers than melody-makers, and most
    importantly, told drummer Jeff Salane that Panthers wasn't Orchid, the post-hardcore band he also drummed
    for.  These minor adjustments alone made quite a winner out of <i>Let's Get Serious</i>, a record that
    openly exploited that tender garage-rock loophole that allows bands like this to succeed-- despite asinine
    lyrics, pisspoor melodies, the works-- simply because they rock so fucking hard.  ""Thank Me with Your Hands""
    alone rendered every other misstep they'd taken forgivable.</p><p>
    
    That EP got them off the Dim Mak label and onto the starry-eyed Vice roster, but as <i>Things Are Strange</i>
    suggests, Vice's vote of confidence may have tricked the band into overextending itself-- to do more than
    just rock.  The album's track-to-length density-- 9 songs, 50 minutes-- is the clearest indicator of Panthers'
    aspirations beyond their MC5'd total energy stooginess.  It's a mistake, though: During the half of <i>Things
    Are Strange</i> in which the band keeps the riffs aplenty, there's another half that Panthers spend deep in
    the asscrack of uninspired post-rock snooze.</p><p>
    
    Leadoff rockers ""Legally Tender"" and ""Theory Is Famous"" follow the band's anticipated trajectory: Guitar
    and basslines gel into one indistinguishable monolith, further compressing the drums and inning an out door
    for only the best of frontman Jayson Greene's horkheimered lyrics.  ""Give me a book and I'll read the shit
    out of it,"" will be everyone's favorite quote on Facebook.com any day now.  Both songs reach way past the
    three-minute mark with no problem, a testament mostly to drummer Salane's appropriate and on-the-dime
    switch-ups.  The fat but jerky unison breakdown midway through ""Stroke My Genius"" captures Panthers' live
    energy most vividly, the band then riding out the movement's distorted Brancan overtones into a killer
    snare-on-one stomp.</p><p>
    
    But 7-minute monsters demand more planning and better melodies for sustenance.  All four of <i>Things Are
    Strange</i>'s epic hopefuls-- from the death-by-napalm spaz-out that opens the otherwise limpid ""We Are
    Louder"", to the trick-or-treat, <i>Murder She Wrote</i>-esque ditty ""If You Were Once Young, Rage"", to the
    less pitiful but still predictable meandering of ""Weird Birds""-- fail from destitute melodies lost in a
    haze of so-called art and supposedly introspective passages.  ""What's a riff"" and ""what's a melody""-- and
    even then, ""what's a <i>good</i> melody""-- are inevitably personal distinctions, but regardless: the melodies
    (or whatever) Panthers subjected to their slow broods simply aren't engaging enough on their own to make up
    for the band's rock-out time-out.</p><p>
    
    Perhaps this is telling, but the two best tracks on <i>Things Are Strange</i> are re-recorded cuts from
    their previous releases.  ""Thank Me With Your Hands"" wisely appears again here: Though a smaller aperture
    of production teases out more detail in the lead guitar line, Greene adds a whimsical falsetto to double
    the guitar at the end, and for the most part, Panthers play through the song transitions more confidently.
    ""Walk of Shame"", too, originally released on a late-2003 tongue-in-cheek split with fellow Brooklynites
    Japanther, plays host to the band's most virulent guitar hooks and the album's best preamble-- Panthers
    barely hold onto the song's reins, and the effect is just brutal and awesome.  But there's a catch: The
    magic's over in two minutes, and for the next five, Panthers force a build that teases but never fully
    materializes.  The track's lesson suits <i>Things Are Strange</i> as well: Panthers are best rocking us,
    not impressing us.</p></div>"|6152.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6152-things-are-strange/|6.2|Nick Sylvester

THC and apathy themed their 1994 single ""Longview""; their
    breakthrough album, <i>Dookie</i>, was a precocious jumble of power chords and smart aleck prurience, a
    blend of The Descendents and flinty Buzzcockian spark.  They didn't have any answers-- they just wanted
    weed and entitlement.  That cul de sac selfishness and bratty pose carried through to the sugar-pap
    mallpunks Green Day spawned on the backslide of the 90s; unfortunately, the trio's undeniable early flair
    for songcraft did not.</p><p>
    
    In 1999, pop-punk exploded with the arrival of Blink-182's <i>Enema of the State</i>, and the brand gleefully
    deteriorated from there, bottoming out in the young and hopeless days of a dollar-store post-millennium,
    where the suburban trash culture that Billie Joe Armstrong once dismissively skewered has blended dangerously
    with a shifty political climate, causing volatile upheavals in blue collar comedy and bicameral nimrods.
    Now Green Day are back to pull the pin on the grenade.</p><p>
    
    2000's <i>Warning</i> only scored the band two modern rock hits, and in contrast to the million-selling
    marks of previous records, was something of a commercial flop.  By this point, their hit-making,
    image-cultivating offspring had bid them good riddance, and those disillusioned by Green Day's populist
    stature were no longer listening.  If they <i>had</i> been, they'd have heard some of the grit and dynamics
    that gave birth to a much wider sonic palette on <i>American Idiot</i>, the band's first album since, and
    unquestionably their most ambitious to date.</p><p>
    
    As a songwriter, Armstrong's penchant for economy is still present-- he'll never be a wordsmith or a magic
    melody maker.  But <i>Idiot</i>'s slicing power chordage reaches to Green Day's old English and Cali punk
    influences with tingling fingers, adds acoustic instruments without sounding forced or contrived, and
    lyrically grapples with the cultural predicaments and awkward shittiness of ""subliminal mind-fuck America,""
    circa 2004: ""Now everybody do the propaganda/ And sing along in the age of paranoia.""  Armstrong delivers
    the title track couplet like a command at the revolution day sock-hop, and its instrumental viciousness is
    enough to shatter punchbowl glass.</p><p>
    
    Like Bad Religion, whose recent <i>The Empire Strikes First</i> was not only a reaction to U.S. politics
    and culture post-9/11, but a powerful return to cynical form, Green Day's dissent and frustration has
    inspired a new strength of craft in them as well.  Armstrong's frustration comes out in seething anger:
    The ragged, rousing ""Letterbomb"" is both a melodic powder keg and a blaring bullhorn promoting the
    destruction of complacency, while the album's title track is energizing and provoking in the way effective
    punk revivalism should be.</p><p>
    
    ""Nobody cares,"" Armstrong screams shrilly in ""Homecoming"", one of the album's two extended set pieces, and
    the line gets at <i>American Idiot</i>'s greatest feat, besides its revitalization of Green Day's songwriting.
    Rather than preach, it digs out the fuse buried under mountains of 7-Eleven styrofoam trash, the cultural
    livewire that's grown cold in the shadow of strip-mall economics.  Armstrong's characters are just misunderstood
    and disaffected individuals, told to get lost by a nation of fair and balanced sitcom watchers.  They're
    apathetic suburbanite kids, grown up to find that life in the longview sucks.</p><p>
    
    ""Jesus of Suburbia"" and the accompanying epic ""Homecoming"" are <i>American Idiot</i>'s summarizing ideological
    and musical statements.  Bookends, they respectively establish and bitterly conclude the record's storyline.
    Musically, they roll rapid-fire through vignettes of enormous drum fill rock, plaintive piano, Johnny Rotten
    impressions, and surprisingly strong harmonies.  ""Suburbia"" references the melodies of ""All the Young Dudes""
    and ""Ring of Fire""; ""Homecoming"" surveys both the Ramones and the Police's ""Born in the 50s""; and both songs
    owe their form and pacing to The Who.  The album does drag on occasion-- the labored pacing of ""Wake Me Up
    When September Ends"" is a little too much, the price of ambition.  But then there's ""She's a Rebel"", a
    simplistically perfect anthem of the sort the band's vapid followers (or their handlers) would likely muck
    up with string sections.</p><p>
    
    For all its grandiosity, <i>American Idiot</i> keeps its mood and method deliberately, tenaciously, and
    angrily on point.  Music in 2004 is full of well-meaning but pan-flashing sloganeers whose tirades against
    the government-- whether right or wrong-- are ultimately flat, with an overarching sense that what they're
    saying comes packaged with a spoil date of November '04.  Though they do fling their share of surface insults,
    Green Day frequently look deeper here, not just railing against the political climate, but also striving

It's ironic that a man     often described as ""the most unpretentious artist of our generation"" has, in displaying no discernible artifice     in his music, inspired a type of deep-felt admiration amongst his devotees that approaches exclusive worship.</p>
<p>Johnston never wanted to be mythologized; he only wanted others to share and experience the music that he     created so honestly and prolifically.  His earliest career success resulted from handing out free cassettes     of his home recordings (including the recently re-released <i>Songs of Pain</i> and <i>More Songs of Pain</i>)     to anyone who wanted them, and whisperings of his mental instability, childish fetishes, and mysterious home     life aided his rapid rise to local, and subsequently national, celebrity.  But if a certain percentage of     his following initially consisted of scenester rubberneckers intrigued by the possibility of an ""outsider""     peepshow, such sentiment has been gradually stamped out by the sheer quality and magnitude of Johnston's     career output.  It's no surprise that many contributors fervently praise his work in the album's liners,     and comparably safe interpretations of Johnston's material would be a reasonable defense mechanism for most     artists to embrace.</p>
<p>There is, of course, a nagging suspicion that, given uninhibited freedom of expression and access to high     fidelity recording equipment, many popular artists might actually improve on some of Johnston's originals,     which were often recorded in embryonic stages of the songwriting process, and were sometimes melodically     hindered by the same lo-fi recording techniques that simultaneously made the songs so endearing.  It turns     out, though, that most artists meet Johnston somewhere in the middle, extending and expanding his raw     musical ideas while supplanting his inimitable delivery with their own established voices.  The resulting     covers, combined with a second disc of the originals, form a kaleidoscopic portrait of a challenging and     beloved songwriter, constructed earnestly by the many artists touched and influenced by his music.</p>
<p>Teenage Fanclub &amp; Jad Fair's opener ""My Life Is Starting Over Again"" is a dead ringer for Johnston's weary     assertion of renewal, and establishes a pattern of tactful mimicry employed frequently on the album--     particularly by low-profile artists.  Prominent artists are inherently more recognizable, but are usually     tasteful in their choices.  Beck's ""True Love Will Find You in the End"" translates the underlying sadness     of Johnston's naked optimism into home-fried <i>Sea Change</i>-style country.  Guster racks up a few needed     points of indie cred with a sunny cover of ""The Sun Shines Down on Me"", and The Flaming Lips &amp; Sparklehorse     predictably cut straight to the charming naivete of  ""Go"", one of Johnston's most endearing ballads.</p>
<p>The only tracks that substantially falter are either overly ambitious or fail to adequately recognize     Johnston's music on its own terms.  In the former category, Death Cab for Cutie stumbles with an overlong     version of ""Dream Scream""-- Ben Gibbard is situated too far to the ""adorable"" side of Johnston's     naive/disturbed dichotomy, and his sweet vocal interpretation unwisely eschews Johnston's creepy heavy     breathing for genuine boyish charm.  Calvin Johnson simply approaches ""Sorry Entertainer"" from the wrong     angle: His decision to remove the song's crucial hook-- a demonic jack-in-the-box ""Peter Gunn"" riff-- robs     it of its propulsive nervous energy.  TV on the Radio take a major risk tackling the immortal ""Walking the     Cow"", and unfortunately, fall flat.  Tunde Adebimpe's multi-tracked vocals and tepid falsetto interpretation     of the song's climax (""Really don't know how I came here/ Really don't know why I'm staying here""), along     with a plodding piano approximation of Johnston's furiously ham-fisted chord organ arrangement, pale in     comparison to the original's vivid starkness.</p>
<p>Several tracks, however, come close to surpassing the limited scope of their progenitors.  Clem Snide turns     ""Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Your Grievience"" into a breezy pop number without sacrificing the song's     complex fusion of Christian guilt and spiritual affirmation.  Bright Eyes' ""Devil Town"" captures the central     despondency of Johnston's paranoid vampire fantasy, while fleshing out the original a cappella arrangement     with spacious alt-country flourishes.  And Tom Waits adds his own blown-out ape shrieks and guttural blues     delivery to Johnston's sprawling film synopsis/personal analysis ""King Kong"", striking the perfect balance     between the two artists' distinctly separate but comparably mythological personas.</p>
<p>The album concludes with the previously unreleased ""Rock This Town"", from Johnston's upcoming <i>Lost &amp;     Found</i>.  The track is Johnston's own telling assessment of his general worth as an artist: In the song,     Johnston takes his guitar to the ""heavy metal store,"" preaches the Golden Rule, and is promptly dubbed the     ""laugh of the human race.""  However, <i>Discovered, Covered</i> squarely refutes his emblematic self-deprecation.     That Daniel Johnston's music has sincerely moved so many notable artists is a stunning testament to the     undeniable power of his life's work, which, contrary to the compilation's sardonic title, continues to     inspire new generations of followers.</p></div>"|4283.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4283-discovered-covered-the-late-great-daniel-johnston-compilation-and-tribute/|8.3|David Moore

    and of the spiritual relevance surrounding their experience of simultaneous individual expression and total
    absorption within a crowd.  Unfortunately, what often leaves these people ultimately disillusioned or feeling
    empty is the lack of ideological substance behind the power of the party.  Modern American and European musicians
    have rarely figured out how to steer the positive, beat-driven galvanization that occurs on the dancefloor
    toward a larger purpose, such as political action.  Our music of protest and revolution instead tends to be
    vague, preachy, or angry, musically stemming from folk or punk/hardcore influences.  This trend originates
    in an inherent cultural bias that form should reflect content-- that music should sound as serious, sad,
    volatile, or important as its topic.</p><p>
    
    Fela Kuti, the wildly successful Nigerian trumpeter, saxophonist, keyboardist and bandleader who passed away
    in 1997, grew from a different tradition.  He pioneered the genre of Afrobeat, a mix of jazz and funk with
    traditional African themes.  Much of Kuti's music was a call to action, criticizing his government for its
    injustices and corruption, and urging the poor of Nigeria and larger Africa to think and act independently.
    His popularity and effectiveness was such that he was jailed several times by the government, and his
    elderly mother killed by the army during a raid on his compound.  Yet throughout his career, the most vital
    element in his work remained a constant affirmation of individual power through partying and dancing--
    resistance through aesthetic opposition.  The name of the political party he founded in 1979 was ""Movement
    of the People"", and one suspects he was referring to ""movement"" both in the broad and specific senses.</p><p>
<i>The Underground Spiritual Game</i> is an unbroken set of Kuti's music taken from throughout his career,
    meticulously compiled and mixed by Chief Xcel.  Xcel is one half of Blackalicious, a hip-hop act that have
    themselves begun realizing the full potential of discourse inherent in their genre, and Xcel hopes to
    continue making his way through Fela Kuti's enormous output.  Though touted as a ""remix"" of Kuti's work,
    <i>The Underground Spiritual Game</i> leaves the original sounds relatively untouched.  Instead, Chief Xcel
    seamlessly melds selections from 11 of Kuti's tracks, occasionally adding effects, and inserting spoken
    snippets of Fela speaking.  It's put together in a manner that stands as a testament to Kuti's political
    views, but pays equal homage to his musical impact.</p><p>
    
    Fela's songs are built on repeated midtempo grooves, and structured around call-and-response sections
    between Kuti and his band.  The jazz influence is readily apparent in the solos, as well as the hooks of
    his horn section.  But the music centers on Kuti's espoused ideology of ""Pan-Africanism.""  His songs are
    highly polyrhythmic, with several simultaneous meters often being kept by the percussion, bass, and guitar.
    Solos catch themselves in loops recalling those of traditional Mbira music-- circular melodies without
    beginning or end.  The songs are sung mostly in Pidgin English, Kuti's voice howling and jumping, stressing
    unexpected syllables, and leaping over beats or extending phrases.  <i>The Underground Spiritual Game</i>
    captures this nicely, making its way through several of his best-loved pieces, and closing with the popular
    17-minute ""Africa Centre of the World"", inspired by Kuti's burgeoning interest in Afrocentric philosophy.</p><p>
    
    Not even Kuti was safe from the cynicism that seems to befall most activists as they age, but even so, his
    took on a positive tone.  As explained by friend Mabinuori Idowu in this disc's liner notes, the song ""Look
    and Laugh"" is Kuti saying, ""I've sung songs to confront the system.  They burnt my house.  I've sung songs
    to open your eyes.  They put me in jail.  I've done all these things to enlighten you.  And what do you give
    me in return?  You complacently do nothing, so I might as well sit back, look and laugh.""  The seeming
    immutability of the world leads many toward nihilism.  Kuti, however, accepted it with transcendence through
    absurdity, reflected in the song itself by ending with a deadpan ""ha ha ha ha/ hee hee hee hee"" refrain and
    ascending chromatic scale in the bass.  The message of Fela Kuti's music was directed toward his countrymen,
    but applies to listeners world wide: Fight for change, but don't forget the joy of the life you're fighting
    for.</p></div>"|4547.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4547-the-underground-spiritual-game/|8.4|Liam Singer

With some scratchy LPs
    and a gorgeously organic lexicon, rappers hocus-pocused street corners into sovereign states, and transfigured
    fusty old soul records into musical artillery for sacking the cusp of the millennium.  It was the culture in
    motion at 78 bpm: a panopticon you could pop and lock to.</p><p>
    
    Rap has come a long way since breakbeats were revolutionary and samples were free. Like any unlegislated
    grassroots movement, hip-hop created its world piece by piece, and its cosmology could be limited to a
    city, a borough, a neighborhood, or an urban block.  But with its irrefutable cultural ascendancy,
    hip-hop's wide-open aperture can now snap aerial photos of the entire world and freeze it in mid-spin.
    It's increasingly feasible that rap-- not rock-- will be the defining music of the American pageant, and
    like De La said: Stakes is high.</p><p>
    
    Hip-hop is necessarily conversant with the genres it plunders for its hodgepodge purview.  No longer content
    to scurry out like a bandit in the night, returning with a pilfered string section or bassline, hip-hop now
    expands its borders from within.  Other genres aren't pillaged; they're utterly subsumed.  That's why hip-hop
    is unstoppable: It can contain multitudes, ingest entire solar systems, until, if it continues to its logical
    conclusion, it will become the mega-genus of which all others are mere sub-categories. </p><p>
    
    Like any popular genre, rap threatens to slip into ossification, but groups like the sextet Subtle (including
    core Them members Doseone and Jel) are diligently keeping its frontiers amorphous and supple.  You probably
    want to know what they sound like.  But how do you draw a picture of a shapeshifter?  After releasing four
    seasonal EPs, Subtle's debut full-length is an chimera cobbled together from live and programmed drums,
    electronic strings, keyboards, samplers, guitars, woodwinds, and Doseone's chameleonic flows.</p><p>
    
    From the throbbing pistons, bursting shards, and diabolical sing-along cadences of ""Song Meat"", to the
    Books-ian soundscape and muttered lullabies of ""I Love L.A."", to the cracked minor-key glitch-track and
    hypnotic incantations of ""Red, White and Blonde"", Subtle remains elusive: It's impossible to draw a bead
    on an erratically moving target.</p><p>
    
    Since Doseone has long trafficked in enigmas, it's apt that subtlety both is and is not his modus operandi.
    On the surface, his bombastic word collages are as subtle as the proverbial bull in the china shop.  But
    upon closer inspection, the rarified air of his understated murmurs, dramatic inflections, crisp enunciation,
    and striated polyrhythms breathe through earbuds with a rich palette of nuance.  On the Doseone continuum,
    Subtle splits the difference between Them's austere, darkly glittering hip-hop, and cLOUDDEAD's densely
    layered, pastoral ambient drones.  Subtle is not Dose's most innovative or complex project, but by the same
    token, it may be his most accessible-- a good point of entry into a dauntingly ambitious body of work.</p><p>
    
    In ""The Book of Sand"", Borges imagined a book with an infinite number of constantly rearranging pages.  The
    old metaphysician always dreamt of impossible libraries containing the sum total of language, or points in
    space that enclosed everything in the universe simultaneously.  If he were alive today, I like to think he'd
    find a musical facsimile of his coveted Aleph in Doseone's bottomless oeuvre.  While Subtle doesn't contain
    the endless depths of, say, the first Them album (which I've been listening to for years, and still exhume
    new wonders from), it's a far cry from punchlines and looped R&amp;B; breaks, an expression of rap's unbounded
    potential.  This is hip-hop as black hole, devouring everything its ever-expanding circumference touches.</p></div>"|7779.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7779-a-new-white/|7.8|Brian Howe

    that he rarely samples any break off a record released post-1990.  Lucas McFadden belongs to the now-""underground""
    tradition of cutting high-fiber joints anointed with ""Funky Drummer""-era grooves that sound like house
    party highlights.  His oeuvre is nakedly contrary to the MTV-sold, crunk bourgeoisie who downsize their
    music to stick-figured beats and loop <i>Scarface</i>-mused, orchestral arrangements ad nauseam.  And no
    matter how often cynics attempt to bury hip-hop turntablism as a dead form, McFadden-- and a handful of
    worthy contemporaries-- still make the music feel timeless.</p><p>
    
    And that's why <i>The Litmus Test</i> is such a frustrating tease.  The collection is a ""mash-up"" of his
    solo tracks, remixes and collaborations with Jurassic 5, all serving as a public reminder of who Cut Chemist
    is before McFadden drops his new album next year.  <i>Litmus</i> better qualifies as a medley on par with
    those hip-hop performances at the Grammys or BET Awards that are over-focused on dance choreography and
    cramming all the hits into three minutes.  The 28-minute record serves as a decent primer for neophytes,
    but Chemist frequently interrupts some of his best moments before they complete their sentences.</p><p>
<i>The Litmus Test</i> opens not with just one, but <i>three</i> intro tracks.  First comes ""This Is"", a
    massage-oiled, Latin-funk flavored teaser that sets the scene with street hustler chatter that eventually
    morphs into the album's actual ""Intro"" track.  Then, McFadden turns a corner with an octopus-limbed drum
    break that introduces ""Bunky's Pick"", a brilliant survey of Stones Throw's excellent 2001 garage-funk comp
    <i>The Funky 16 Corners</i>.  Jurassic 5's <i>Cosby Kids</i>-esque loitering anthem ""Concrete Schoolyard""
    suddenly intervenes.  Unsurprisingly, tunes from that ""positive rap"" group predominate <i>The Litmus Test</i>
    to the point that the record almost seems more like a J5 outtakes collection than a Cut Chemist statement.
    And while McFadden and fellow J5 DJ Nu-Mark's production on their ""Jayou"" has aged gracefully, Cut Chemist
    has done enough stronger work elsewhere that its inclusion here seems superfluous.</p><p>
    
    Fortunately, there are a handful of worthy non-J5 inclusions here: Blackalicious tracks ""Chemical
    Calisthenics"" exemplifies what a perfect balance Chemist is capable of striking between experimental
    beatmaking and simply providing an emcee with something to spit over.  On the <i>Blazing Arrow</i> version,
    he treated virtually every syllable Gift of Gab spat about the periodic table-- and the <i>Litmus</i> version
    improves that feat with an awesome, spy-flick brass break that wags its finger at the swinger lying in the
    gutter.  Sadly, ""Alphabet Aerobics"", where McFadden tortured Gift of Gab's lyrical rundown of the alphabet
    with a sped-up, treadmill beat, is completely missing from this record.</p><p>
    
    The hospital's burn ward is overwhelmed: J5's ""Swing Set"" is reduced to 46 seconds (halted by a bandleader
    asking, ""Do you want to dance?"", and being answered with a wiseass ""Hell no!""), their ""Lesson 6""s arithmetic
    jingle is almost completely obliterated, and the folksy violin solo performed on Chemist's own ""S.N.T.""
    (possibly the single best moment off Loose Groove's classic <i>Funky Precedent</i> compilation) has its
    plug pulled after one note.  At least McFadden kept most of the levitating beats that enriched his greatest
    remix: Major Force's ""Re-Return of the Original Art-Form"".  Now, some may say Chemist has a right to treat
    his own work like this, and he does.  But while the hip-hop song always remains an unfinished composition,
    that doesn't mean that honorable ideas-- and classic tracks-- should be sacrificed like this.</p></div>"|1781.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1781-the-litmus-test/|6.1|Cameron Macdonald

And a particularly fanciful one at that.  I remember reading about the late
    soprano Maria Callas and Buckley fave Edith Piaf, the fragility of their demeanors, and the notion they
    were more precious, tender than the world around them; that every moment within earshot of their voices
    was like hearing the song of the most rare and beautiful bird in the world.  In fact, Piaf as the ""Little
    Sparrow"" was the most obvious blueprint for Buckley's flighty, unabashedly emotional expression; in both
    cases, whether your reaction was to adore or abhor the often raw (but never adolescent) bouts of melo- and
    other kinds of drama, no one could say they held their hearts in check.  Consequently, they needed lots of
    maintenance.  In Buckley's case, it was a steady stream of collaborators, girls, gigs and an impressive
    reserve of torch songs from way back when.  He really wasn't built for the strand of rock music borne of
    rebellion or release; he was a songbird, like the kind that used to receive roses and blown kisses from
    the debutantes in the balcony after performances.</p><p>
    
    Unlike Callas and Piaf, Buckley grew up in an age when the chanteuse didn't need an orchestra or a symphony
    hall to get their message across.  After having cut his musical teeth in Los Angeles, he came to New York
    in 1991 and soon hooked up with guitarist Gary Lucas, eventually joining his band Gods &amp; Monsters.  Lucas
    and Buckley established a partnership that produced some very good songs (including ""Mojo Pin"" and <i>Grace</i>'s
    title track) in a very short time, but before they had a chance to make it out of the city, Buckley quit the
    band over a disagreement regarding his future loyalty.  Afterwards, he played solo gigs, sometimes incorporating
    friend and bassist Mick Grondhal, and assisted by a growing legion of nighthawk fans, was soon signed by
    Columbia as a solo artist.</p><p>
    
    1993's <i>Live at Sin-e</i> EP gives the best idea of what Columbia's A&amp;R; rep must have seen in Buckley at
    the time.  At shows, he was the picture of a high diva: sprawling, boundless and with more than a pinch of
    self-conscious glitter.  However, as he revealed in <i>The Making of Grace</i>, the behind-the-scenes feature
    that leads off the third disc DVD in Columbia's new ""Legacy"" edition reissue of his debut full-length, he
    needed a band.  He already had Grondhal, met drummer Matt Johnson through <i>Grace</i> executive producer
    Steve Berkowitz, and, midway through recording the album, brought in guitarist Michael Tighe (who eventually
    contributed ""So Real"", to which Buckley added a chorus and put on the record in place of the bluesy ""Forget
    Her"").  Producer Andy Wallace speaks on the documentary about his concerns over how much of the record
    should reflect Buckley's solo performances, but true to form, the singer wanted it all.</p><p>
    
    Somehow, despite an overflow of ideas-- they needed three different band setups available at all times to
    accommodate Buckley's various moods-- the record got done.  And it was released.  And thousands of open-heart
    romantics heard their ship come in.  As it happened, <i>Grace</i> was received with mixed feelings from
    critics who probably thought they were getting the next great alt-rock savior, and instead felt they'd
    received dinner theater for the moody crowd.  They had a point: For all its swells of emotion and midnight
    dynamics, <i>Grace</i> was not a record to rally the post-grunge alternation.  It made a jazz noise where
    a rock one was expected and a classical one where a pop one might have sold more records.  MTV snagged
    ""Last Goodbye"", <i>Grace</i>'s most radio-friendly song by a considerable margin, but Buckley was predestined
    for a cult stardom.</p><p>
<i>Grace</i>'s strengths have been well-documented over the years: The flawless choice of cover songs,
    including the definitive reading of Leonard Cohen's ""Hallelujah"" (that we learn on the documentary was
    actually chosen based on John Cale's 1991 version from the Cohen tribute <i>I'm Your Fan</i>); the mystic,
    blue textures of ""Mojo Pin"", ""So Real"" and ""Dream Brother"" that seemed as related to Led Zeppelin as to
    Scott Walker as to Buckley's father; Wallace's sympathetic, intimate production and the band's equally
    sensitive following of Buckley's lead.  And of course, he sang the hell out of those songs.  His voice
    turned upward songs that naturally leaned inward; his reading of Nina Simone's ""Lilac Wine"" transformed
    from misty cocktail lament into transcendental experience, and the unlikely recasting of English composer
    Benjamin Britten's ""Corpus Christi Carol"" into ambient lullaby.</p><p>
    
    And, as this reissue proves, for every bit of lightning trapped in a jar, Buckley was willing to try his
    hand at many songs with which he held a weaker grasp.  Firstly, he fancied himself a rock star, and the
    second disc of this set includes endearing, but ultimately inessential readings of the MC5's ""Kick Out the
    Jams"", a pretty silly Screamin' Jay Hawkins impersonation on Leiber &amp; Stoller's ""Alligator Wine"", and a
    speed-metal take on ""Eternal Life"".  His version of Big Star's ""Kanga-Roo"" nails its weary grandeur, but
    goes overboard on the ensuing 11-minute jam session, effectively transforming it from intimidating wall of
    drone into a meandering, albeit unfinished and tentative giant.  He sounds best interpreting songs like
    Bukka White's ""Parchman Farm Blues"", Simone's ""The Other Woman"", and Bob Dylan's ""Mama, You Been On My Mind"",
    though his own take on the blues-- the previously unreleased ""Forget Her""-- sounds comparatively pedestrian.</p><p>
    
    So, the question becomes how frustrated you are willing to be with Buckley.  His posthumous releases suggest
    what <i>Grace</i> did: that he was one of the most talented musicians of his generation, while also being one
    of the most impulsive and, often, maddeningly inconsistent.  Is he really being served by the uncovering of
    outtakes, B-sides and live performances?  Fans certainly think so, but I won't cop to listening very beyond
    his lone completed record these days.  And it bears emphasizing that its rewards have lost nothing in 10
    years.  <i>Grace</i> remains one of the most engaging, inspired records ever made, and its 10 original songs
    serve as the best possible portrait of Buckley as a diva, songwriter and artist.</p></div>"|995.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/995-grace-legacy-edition/|9.0|Dominique Leone

    remind American indie-pop audiences of Sufjan Stevens, and the songs' unintrusive electronic embellishments
    recall Nobukazu Takemura and recent Fly Records releases from OMB and Tatsuya Yamada.</p><p>
    
    Beyond that, there's not much of a gimmick to the songs on his debut album, <i>Night Piece</i>.  Shugo
    doesn't seem to fit into the glut of bedroom IDMers and their sound-alike electro-acoustic alchemy, and
    in addition to an obvious geographical contradiction, Shugo is just way too melodic for the stateside
    free-folk scene.  Really, <i>Night Piece</i> is ""just"" a pop album, short but dense and infinitely
    considered: No note seems unnecessary, and everything is in its right place.</p><p>
    
    Fittingly, <i>Night Piece</i> starts at dusk.  A million crickets drown out the night of ""Such a Color""
    with sex-charged bug-buzz, when a sheepish Shugo begins to pluck out an equally fragile melody.  The melody
    bursts.  Shugo strums in resignation, and turns to a distant accordion for last-ditch support.  The song
    congeals unexpectedly but beautifully, and Shugo quickly reclaims the melody for his voice, buttressing
    it with stringed confidence and, by the song's outro, a little bit of bravado.</p><p>
    
    Other songs on <i>Night Piece</i> bear the same high degree of craftsmanship, but as the album presses on,
    we learn that Shugo has aspirations much larger than a string of catchy ditties.  Through his prudent use
    of electronics, he begins to develop a strikingly unified worldview that <i>Night Piece</i> ultimately
    wills upon its listener.  On ""Light Chair"", Shugo's guitar plucking stomps to a contrasting, docile
    woodblock melody before losing itself in winding arpeggios.  ""Lantern on the Water"" shimmers as broad
    cello strokes are fed through a lo-fi sampler and percussive bell sounds try their best to harness the
    spectacle's majesty with an incidental beat.</p><p>
    
    Shugo's sense of humor rears its head midway through <i>Night Piece</i>: The songs, which at times border
    on pastiche, somehow never undermine the album's cohesion.  Taken together, these highly stylized compositions
    form something of a dream sequence: ""Sleet"" throws us into an 8-bit <i>Dragon Warrior</i> village, while
    the goofy ""The Mop"" drags our sudden spurs through the golden dust of the American West.  Then, a chase
    scene: ""Paparazzi"" is Shugo's virtuosic take on the theme from ""The Benny Hill Show"", a cartoonish one-man
    mummer's parade that doesn't strut so much as run for its life, with an unexpected hammock-swaying break
    here and there between the ensuing fretted mischief.</p><p>
    
    After covering so much musical terrain in only 23 minutes, Shugo finishes slowly and quietly with his
    unadorned lullaby, ""A Kite of Night"".  The song doesn't take part in the world of <i>Night Piece</i> so
    much as consider it in retrospect-- it's the least evocative track on the album, but its most tender for
    that very reason.  From its nakedness we realize just how rich a world Shugo has designed with <i>Night
    Piece</i>, and just how subtle his musical gestures are.  So <i>Night Piece</i> is ""just"" pop music, but
    it manages to point well beyond itself, and regardless of who didn't influence it or what scenes it doesn't
    fit into, albums like this are always relevant, and always welcome.</p></div>"|8270.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8270-night-piece/|8.6|Nick Sylvester

It's an
    upright, with a finish that's scuffed and scarred.  A few keys are yellowed and cracked, others are missing
    their ivories, revealing the diagonals of glue beneath.  The lowest G-sharp key is gone.  The pedals are
    loose, the upper registers stick, and the lower registers sound fuzzy, so the best-- or least bad-- sound
    comes from the middle range.  This image is most likely false, a romantic projection of the piano's precarious
    tones.  However it looked and wherever it stood, Johnson must have fallen in love with the instrument, as
    it's the centerpiece of the first three songs of his new solo album, <i>Vultures Await</i>.</p><p>
    
    The piano is his only accompaniment on ""Catherine Dupree"", about a woman who burns down her alma mater, and
    the starkness of the arrangement works well with his bedraggled voice.  ""Just to Know You've Been Dreaming""
    fleshes out that sound with a full band, but that piano maintains its hold on your ear.  But Johnson is a
    fickle artist, and by the fourth song, he's picked up his acoustic guitar again and left the piano alone.
    Next he falls in love with the sound of a violin, whose sweet notes curl around his vocals on ""Just Some
    Silence"" and ""Sleep a While"".  Then he moves on to a drum machine on ""Closing Down My House"", whose coda
    layers programmed drums over real ones.  The short ""On, Caldonia"" is just a simple melody plucked on banjo--
    no voice, no words, just the instrument.  You begin to wonder what he'll pick up next, until that piano
    returns in the penultimate ""Fly, My Sweet Dove"".</p><p>
    
    Perhaps Johnson's fickleness stems from his prolific rate of production.  Over a decade, the Texas-based
    musician has released an alarming number of albums, EPs, and one-off concert-only cassettes not just as a
    solo artist, but with three bands: Centro-Matic, The Foxymorons, and South San Gabriel.  He works at a rate
    of approximately one or two releases a year, which, along with the untold number of songs that never fall
    on any one else's ears, amounts to an almost Pollardian output.  So Johnson obviously finds his inspiration
    where he can and for as long as it lasts, whether in a piano for three songs or a drum machine for one.</p><p>
<i>Vultures Await</i> is the result of Johnson's musical restlessness, and it may be among his best-written
    and best-sounding collections to date.  Gone is the garbled Americana pop of Centro-Matic and the sampled
    strings of his solo debut, <i>Murder of Tides</i>.  In their place is a more fluid, flowing sound that draws
    more on typical alt-country structures and subjects; it may be more accessible, but it nevertheless seems
    sturdier and more disciplined.  It could be Johnson's <i>Heartbreaker</i>, which may make long-term fans
    and anyone with a Ryan Adams phobia a little apprehensive.</p><p>
    
    He still has a penchant for the overly poetic, and <i>Vultures Await</i> at times sounds exceedingly, almost
    obsessively dark.  On ""Sleep a While"", he proclaims, ""The sea will not hold my soul/ The sky will not hold
    the stain.""  He expresses such sentiments most effectively in the more fleshed-out songs, but when he
    attempts to put them across armed only with his guitar, as on ""Your Bulldozer"" and ""As Victims Would"", the
    darkness becomes something closer to dreariness and his normally confident melodies dissolve like ink on
    a rain-soaked letter.  The final track, ""Nothin' but Godzilla"" offers the only moment in which he seems to
    be having a good time alone.</p><p>
    
    Still, songs like ""Just to Know What You've Been Dreaming"" and ""Fly, My Sweet Dove"" are definitely memorable
    enough to anchor <i>Vultures Await</i>, and should attract new fans looking for music that is simultaneously
    sober-eyed and romantic, desert-dry yet saturated with emotion.  And if not, he can always go back, hat in
    hand, to his piano.</p></div>"|4346.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4346-vultures-await/|7.7|Stephen M. Deusner

    and brash, bleating exploration.  Multiple avenues and dusty dirt roads intersect with Tepper's muse, which
    is fitting for a guy who played guitar with Captain Beefheart on <i>Bat Chain Puller</i> and has gone on to
    collaborations with types like Frank Black and Robyn Hitchcock.  <i>Head Off</i> takes its time exploring
    those roads and avenues, guided at all times by Tepper's soulful groan, which itself transforms from
    Waitsian mutter (another past collaborator) to crumpled speaker cone whinny with steady-as-he-goes
    regularity.  The result is a record that threatens to ramble but rarely does, and tempers its moves toward
    mature singer/songwriter territory with a handful of busted, freaky, and lurching howls.</p><p>
    
    Lots of things come to mind during this flickering filmstrip.  ""The Sky Was Grey"" is a few brief frames of
    plaintive, treated guitar and space-age sound effects, reflecting the shadowy new-century gothic of Jim
    White.  Then there's ""Ricochet Man"", which, co-written with Mr. Don Van Vliet himself, offers two minutes
    of scatterbrained six-string, clattering, tumbling rhythms, and homemade vocal reverb.  Here, all of a
    sudden, <i>Head Off</i> approaches the battered downtown sounds of Beefheart descendents Skeleton Key;
    Tepper holds it all together with an evocative vocal, and characters rendered just enough for us to imagine
    the scene.  We might not know exactly what the Ricochet Man's going to do for us, but if his gifts are as
    potent as the song, then an ether bender isn't a far-flung possibility.</p><p>
    
    It's this sharp songcraft that keeps the album's various parts rolling more or less succinctly down the
    pavement.  While tense opener ""Bag of Nails"" seems sheared off the Pacific Northwest's noisier side, the
    resulting title track is a robust psychedelic country rocker led by harmonica and robust acoustic guitars.
    ""Why don't you stop thinking about it and take your head off?"" Tepper says, and it's good advice as the
    album rolls on.  ""Mrs. Bodean"" tells a tale of bad blood and horse's bones; there's some morbid, sordid
    shit happening in its out-of-the-way places, but the tale unfolds on a melody full of both sadness and
    hope.  There are no real facts, only clues left behind, but they're enough for some provisions and gas,
    to get us through <i>Head Off</i>'s at once shuddering and graceful final act.</p><p>
    
    The aptly-named ""Sourpuss"" and its accompanying ""Fast One"" mark the manic, noisier side of Tepper that the
    earlier ""Ricochet Man"" shakily pointed to.  ""There's a banging in my head like there's something loose,"" he
    sings, as the electric guitars make sounds like chiggers and the percussion stomps and crashes.  ""Fast""
    employs loops and layered vocal personas from Tepper to suggest the disjointed thought process inside that
    broken brain.  Still, as with the rest of <i>Head Off</i>, these exploratory pieces are played off gentle,
    evening-fire acoustic tracks.  ""Any Left"" is one of these: Its coals fade to black shortly after it starts,
    but then a scratchy calliope whirs to life, taking <i>Head Off</i> out on a wistful, black and white note.
    It's like finding footage of fair goers dancing on the Midway at World's Columbian Exposition of 1893.
    <i>Head Off</i> might not bring everyone the same sort of imagery, but it will keep you guessing, and
    that trait is pure gold in Frownland.</p></div>"|8272.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8272-head-off/|7.5|Johnny Loftus

The air is buffeted by the malevolent cacophony of
    creepshow organs.  People are wearing vaguely Nordic costumes and medieval weaponry.  There's a lot of
    operatic caterwauling, zombie-porn moaning and general grab-assing about.  Around the time the guy in a
    loincloth and horned helm climbs a Marshall stack and starts vamping with a broadsword, a moment of utter
    clarity descends, and you're struck by one of two revelations.  It's either, ""Wow! I really enjoy art that
    revels in weirdness for its own sake and cuts through the monotony of daily life,"" or, ""Wow!  This is really
    just a low-rent Renaissance Festival.""</p><p>
    
    Listeners' appreciation of Rah Bras's music will hinge on their threshold for aggressively affected,
    recondite art that produces discomfort and uncertainty.  <em>EPS</em> has enough substance to evoke physical
    and emotional responses, but its defiant oddness seems tailored to evoke a cerebral one as well-- the small
    voice of that bespectacled theory-wonk in the back of your head, muttering, ""Is it art?""  Which is a neat
    trick, considering that the impossibility of unraveling that question can prevent us from ever reaching
    the second, more pressing one: ""Do I like it?""</p><p>
<em>EPS</em> collects three Rah Bras releases: two out-of-print EPs (originally released on Lovitt in 1997
    and Vermiform in 1998, respectively), and a 2003 Lungcast Records EP recorded live in Japan.  On their 2001
    Lovitt LP, <em>Ruy Blas!</em>, Boo Rah, Jean Rah and Isabellarah Rubella demonstrably settled into a cohesive
    and discernible style.  Their gibbering hybrid of beer-hall chants, dramatic pseudo-emoting, spooky synths,
    throbbing rhythms, and tortured, swirling arrangements remained multiform and strange, but were internally
    consistent.  This consistency is displayed on the 2003 live recording: The warm, propulsive lines of
    ""Pancheerah"", the industrial-meets-New-Wave pulse of ""Skin = Chronized"", and the surprisingly faithful
    cover of the Isley Brothers' ""Conventions"" (here called ""Tokyo Bus Stop"") are all immediately identifiable
    as songs with inherent musical value.  They're quite good: Imagine The Faint taking themselves a bit less
    seriously, with a rawer edge.</p><p>
    
    But since the first two EPs, which comprise the bulk of this release, represent Rah Bras' formative years,
    it's not surprising that they're wildly inconsistent in terms of quality and style, as the band cast about
    in sundry directions without fully embarking on a single one.  To find the good songs, you've got to wade
    through a bit of filler.  Many of the pieces seem more like ideas for songs than completed compositions,
    and they veer erratically between being intriguing and completely uncalled for.  Thus do homely little
    mutants like ""Nasty, Freak"", which sounds like CocoRosie aimlessly warbling over a 1980s Nintendo game
    soundtrack, jostle against excellent songs like ""R.C.M."", where some guttural Tom Waits jive talk rolls
    into a woozy, male/female electronic juke joint boogie in the vein of recent Fiery Furnaces as distilled
    into one potent minute. </p><p>
    
    The first EP begins promisingly enough, with the Deerhoofian, melodic no-wave of ""FYC"" and the sort of
    cheesy but catchy enough synth-pop of ""Water Damage"", but the incipient momentum is broken by ""Bus Stop"",
    a grating collage of traffic sounds and detonating sonic shrapnel, and the meandering, demented sing-along
    ""Great Garden"".  The second EP is more consistent, pinioned by the detuned synthetic piano, loose percussion
    and maniacal call-and-response vocals of ""Dead Bass Thing"", the dense, recessed prog and muttering oration
    of ""Jim, the Spelunker"", and the <i>Rocky Horror</i>-style cabaret ""Subtlights"", but it's also interlarded
    with questionable choices like the indistinctive minor-key dirge ""Poisson"" and the vexing synth-klezmer of
    ""Oui Oui Oui"".  <em>EPS</em> is recommended to entrenched Rah Bras fans and those who want to frighten their
    parents, but newbies are encouraged to check out the more accessible and fully realized <em>Ruy Blas!</em>
    before venturing into these murkier, more treacherous environs. </p></div>"|6928.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6928-eps/|6.8|Brian Howe

    thin plastic sleeve.  The package sits fat at three stories high; the spine is broad, smooth and silver.
    Pennie Smith's unfocused, emblematic cover shot remains intact, with Paul Simonon's bass hovering, vertical
    and doomed, between Elvis-baiting pink and green text.  Stacked inside are three separate discs: the original
    19-song album, a 21-track disc containing rehearsal sessions for the record (""the long lost <em>Vanilla Tapes</em>""),
    and a DVD of <em>The Last Testament</em>, Don Letts' 30-minute, after-the-fact documentary about the making of
    <em>London Calling</em>.  Here, neatly lined up: preparation, realization, hindsight.  Finally.  This is how
    they did it.</p><p>
    For those who came of age in the late 80s and early 90s, calling The Clash a punk band was (and remains)
    more a matter of affect than honesty-- in 2004, wholly and completely divorced from a context that never
    fully resonated with a global audience, The Clash are a rock band, and 1979's <em>London Calling</em> is their
    creative apex, a booming, infallible tribute to throbbing guitars and spacious ideology.  By the late 70s,
    ""punk"" was more specifically linked with rusted safety pins, shit-covered Doc Martens, and tight pink sneers
    than any steadfast, organized philosophy; The Clash insisted on forefronting their politics.  This album
    tackles topical issues with impressive gusto-- the band cocks their cowboy hats, assumes full outlaw position,
    and pillages the world market for sonic fodder and lyric-ready injustice.  A quarter-century after its first
    release, <em>London Calling</em> is still the concentrate essence of The Clash's unparalleled fervor.</p><p>
    As always, <em>London Calling</em>'s title track holds steady as the record's cosmic lynchpin: Horrifyingly
    apocalyptic, ""London Calling"" is riddled with weird werewolf howls and big, prophetic hollers, Mick Jones'
    punchy guitar bursts tapping little nails into our skulls, pushing hard for total lunacy.  Empowered and
    unafraid, Strummer reveals self-skewering prophecies, panting hard about nuclear errors and impending ice
    ages.  He also spitefully lodges some of the most unpleasantly convincing calls to arms ever committed to
    tape, commanding his followers-- now, then, future-- to storm the streets at full, leg-flailing sprints.
    Even if The Clash were more blatantly inspired by the musical tenets of dub and reggae, ""London Calling""
    unapologetically cops the fury of punk's blind-and-obliterate full-body windmilling, bypassing the cerebral
    cortex to sink deep into our muscles.  From ""London Calling"" on, The Clash do not let go; each track builds
    on the last, pummeling and laughing and slapping us into dumb submission.
    </p><p>
    And now, we get to watch how it fell together: Using only a Teac four-track tape recorder linked up to a
    portastudio, The Clash inadvertently immortalized their <em>London Calling</em> rehearsal sessions at Vanilla
    Studios (a former rubber factory-gone-rehearsal-space in Pimlico, London) in the summer of 1979, several
    weeks before the album sessions officially opened at Wessex Studios. One set of tapes got left on the Tube.
    Another got crammed into a box.
    </p>
<p>
    The intricate (and generally convoluted) mythology of the ""long lost recording"" is embarrassingly familiar
    to rock fans-- even non-completists are awkwardly prone to chasing down bits of buried tape with insane,
    eye-bulging intensity.  With precious few exceptions, the anticipation of a hidden, indefinitely concealed
    secret generally supercedes the impact of the actual artifact.  Still, the possibility of stumbling into
    transcendence keeps the search heated, and sometimes stupidly dramatic.  Earlier this month, Mick Jones
    bravely explained to <em>Mojo</em>'s Pat Gilbert exactly how he uncovered the tapes: ""I sensed where they
    were and that took me to the right box.  I opened it up and found them... It was pretty amazing.""
    </p>
<p>
    Snicker all you want at the supernatural, sixth-sense implications, or at the idea of Jones' third eye
    blazing hot for misplaced Clash recordings-- the 21 tracks that the constitute <em>The Vanilla Tapes</em>
    are just revealing enough to justify all the smoky mysticism.  The tapes feature five previously unheard
    cuts-- ""Heart and Mind"", ""Where You Gonna Go (Soweto)"", ""Lonesome Me"", the instrumental ""Walking the
    Slidewalk"", and a cover of Matumbi's version of Bob Dylan's ""The Man in Me"", plucked from Dylan's 1970
    album <em>New Morning</em> and reproduced in full reggae glory-- and together they reveal producer Guy
    Stevens' influence on the final sound of <em>London Calling</em>: muddy, raw, and insistently vague, <em>The
    Vanilla Tapes</em> see The Clash working hard, but also grasping for a muse.
    </p>
<p>
    Professionally, Guy Stevens was best known for ""discovering"" The Who and producing a handful of Mott the
    Hoople records, but it was his recreational exploits that carved the deepest cut into Britain's collective
    pop memory.  With a frenzied halo of tightly curled brown hair and a penchant for destroying property,
    Stevens came to rule Wessex Studios, hurling chairs and ladders, wrestling with engineers, and famously
    dumping a bottle of red wine into Strummer's Steinway piano.  Fortunately, Guy was far more concerned with
    encouraging ""real, honest emotion"" than with achieving technical perfection (true to form, <em>London
    Calling</em> has its fair share of slipped fingers), and consequently, the band's determination at Vanilla,
    coupled with Stevens' shitstorming, led to <em>London Calling</em>'s odd and glorious balance of studied
    dedication and absurd inspiration.
    </p>
<p>
    And if <em>The Vanilla Tapes</em> aren't enough to satisfy your voyeuristic tendencies, there's more.  For
    <em>The Last Testament</em>, documentarian/DJ Don Letts (also responsible for <em>Clash on Broadway</em> and
    <em>Westway to the World</em>) weaves together bits of live footage, interviews with punk pundits and band
    members (they spout tiny clarifications between snickers and cigarette huffs), promotional videos, and a
    few small, grainy glimpses of the band recording at Wessex.  The studio shots were culled from footage
    that, like <em>The Vanilla Tapes</em>, had been unknowingly cardboard boxed for years-- in early 2004, former
    manager Kosmo Vinyl up a crate containing 84 minutes of hand-held footage of the <em>London Calling</em>
    sessions.  Most of the film turned out to be unusable, but Letts salvaged some revealing shots of Stevens
    in fine form, wrestling with ladders and banging around chairs, in a curious reversal of classic
    producer/band hijinx.
    </p>
<p>
    As an instruction manual, the 25th anniversary edition of <em>London Calling</em> offers up bits of helpful,
    ordinary wisdom (he who fucks nuns will later join the church, no one gets their shit for free-- and ""Balls
    to you, big daddy!"" is an infallible exit line), but the album's biggest lesson is still spiritual.  Like
    a bit of good gossip or a dog-eared copy of <em>On the Road</em>, Clash tapes tend to get passed around, and
    wind up forming countless intimate, enduring, and cathartic bonds.  That Joe Strummer's handwritten lyrics
    and modest scribblings have finally been tucked into the liner notes is only appropriate: <em>London Calling</em>
    is just as precious.

    that his role in Devendra Banhart's career was merely to release his music, that everything else took care
    of itself.  I imagine Gira felt strongly about Banhart from the get-go, and his pleasant surprise that the
    rest of the world (inasmuch as Banhart's newfound popularity translates to the ""rest"" of anything) has
    since come to agree is equally understandable.  Yet, I wonder if, like me, Gira gets the feeling that
    Banhart has arrived at a place where he's independent of Young God, himself, or his press.  Journalists
    are often accused of hubris, wherein they're supposed to believe the things they write about are necessarily
    benefited due to increased publicity.  In fact, musicians can benefit from this, but if I'm to believe Gira
    (and I do), Banhart's success is due more to people responding ""honestly to his music.""</p><p>
    The last time I wrote about Banhart, regarding his <i>Rejoicing in the Hands</i> album from earlier this
    year, I emphasized how removed from contemporary context his songs felt.  His music seemed to me neither
    superficially ""odd"" nor caught up in what my fellow music writers call ""freak-folk"" (despite the fact that
    Banhart's compilation <i>Golden Apples of the Sun</i> assisted greatly in defining the term).  His music
    felt like the impressions of one person, stopped along the way to record things he saw or thought, and
    that even when I had no idea what he was talking about, the conviction at the heart of the songs would
    resound a long, deep chord.  Almost two seasons later, things feel different: Like it or not, Banhart no
    longer sings for just one person (either himself, or whomever is hearing him) and, more than with any other
    artist, I'll identify him with 2004.  How's that for context?</p><p>
    Okay, so for the first fallacy in my revelation: None of the songs on <i>Niño Rojo</i> are any more or less
    intrinsically bound to 2004 than those on <i>Rejoicing in the Hands</i>.  They were recorded at the same
    Lynn Bridges-coordinated sessions that produced the prior album, and in fact will be released as a single
    double-vinyl set with <i>Rejoicing</i> soon.  I could take a very easy way out and assume that over time,
    these records will blend into one experience, in all likelihood becoming the definitive collection of
    Banhart's songs.  However, where I formerly praised the singer/songwriter for taking me back to a time
    before MP3s and compulsive music consumption, I now believe that his preferences for surreal list-songs
    and lazy sing-alongs are simply an excellent counterpoint to these modern extravagances.  And counterpoints
    are reactionary; they never exist alone.</p><p>
    The second fallacy is that by admitting that Banhart's music seems to have a different audience or status
    within whatever group he's supposed to speak for, despite not actually ""changing,"" is that I assume he was
    ever speaking for anyone-- even scarier, that his music should necessarily be judged by whichever way the
    wind is blowing.  Personally speaking, that's a sickening thought, but one that I take for granted in most
    mainstream music analysis.  Gira talks about honest responses to music, and mine is that Banhart's songs
    are now as typically, idiosyncratically ""him"" as ever.  I have the faint impression of a returning traveler,
    despite knowing these pieces aren't actually ""new.""  However, it's not spring anymore, and few who hear this
    record are going to be in the same frame of mind they were last April.  Perhaps that's a good argument for
    originally releasing <i>Niño Rojo</i> with <i>Rejoicing</i> as a double-CD set.  It's no judgment against
    Banhart, but my gut says this music will be received slightly less enthusiastically than his prior work.</p><p>
    That said, the music, fittingly, inevitably speaks for itself.  The most interesting to me are the songs
    that suggest Banhart could become some kind of mythical roots-rocker, as on ""We All Know"" and ""Be Kind"".
    There, I imagine a very informal meeting of the minds in Memphis, where the ghosts of Richard Manuel, Gram
    Parsons and a drunk Joe Strummer bark out the choruses in Banhart's half-euphoric, half-tossed off songs.
    But he's preoccupied with other things: ""The light of this whole world and mind aligns your legs to time.""
    I think that means he has a crush on CocoRosie's Bianca Casady, to whom ""Be Kind"" is dedicated.  He gets
    even more to the point on ""A Ribbon"", with his most straightforward request, ""I'd like to sleep with you
    if you'd like me to.""</p><p>
    However, Banhart's disinterest in obvious narratives is, for now, his greatest strength.  Even when, as on
    ""Ay Mama"", his statements would be clear, he obscures them.  ""Ay Mama, no hay que llorar,"" repeated over
    delicate, finger-picked acoustic guitar figures, serves as mantra-- all the better not knowing he's trying
    to persuade his mother that it's not necessary to cry.  Would the song have more emotional weight if I
    didn't have to google the translation?  Banhart, throughout <i>Niño Rojo</i>, demonstrates that it wouldn't;
    the whimsical non-sequiturs of ""We All Know"" (""Like the type of tongue that roots from your breast/ And it
    shakes your pretty little clavicle""), the zoological parade of ""Little Yellow Spider"" (where Banhart pays
    tribute to pigs mating with men, crabs turning to crab-cakes, and white monkeys who figured out something
    he couldn't understand) and the poetic depictions of ""Owl Eyes"" (""Semilla/ Owl Eyes unwinding/ Asia/ All
    your little diamonds, all your little diamonds"") reveal little beyond the impressions of dusty, old calm
    and the American surreal.</p><p>
    Banhart covers Ella Jenkins' ""Wake Up, Little Sparrow"" as the opener to this album.  The 80-year-old Jenkins
    has a made a career of creating children's folk music with an educational and inclusively moral bent, and
    perhaps lends <i>Niño Rojo</i> its best context: Over time, beyond cultural movement and sociological or
    musicological phenomenon, Banhart's record makes the most sense at the mercy of simple pleasures and the
    young at heart.  You want truth?  Beauty?  They're here, in basic forms.  Progress and relevance are very
    different concerns, and ones I'm willing to leave to historians with a better advantage.  And as all Gira
    had to do was release the stuff, at the moment, I'm content to listen in turn.</p></div>"|550.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/550-nino-rojo/|8.0|Dominique Leone

    bass' old-timers circuit.  It's telling, and even a little appropriate, that when artists such as Goldie,
    Grooverider, DJ SS, DJ Hype, Shy FX, and others have made appearances in Chicago, they've been booked into
    a venue best known for its ties to indie royalty than forward-looking dance music.  After all, it wasn't
    until jungle had devolved from visceral hardcore and its forward-looking peak to its chin-stroking artcore
    dead-end that it finally began to play in Peoria.  By the time drum 'n' bass crossed into indie consciousness,
    could newcomers be blamed for wondering what the fuss was about?</p><p>
    
    For most of the past 10 years, a ""jungle night""
    in America has more likely been held in a hipster tavern or a dimly lit lounge than on a sweat-soaked
    dancefloor-- it's no wonder that most of the genre's devotees abandoned it for garage or hip-hop or a
    revitalized house.  But perhaps more surprising is that it's making a comeback-- and not only turning the
    heads of hardened old-timers, but also providing a way in for those whom missed it the first time around.</p><p>
    
    One of the best ways to engage with contemporary drum 'n' bass is <i>Troubled Waters</i>, a DJ Clever mix
    culled from the 12-inch releases on his Offshore Recordings label.  Clever's mix doesn't so much recover
    jungle's fumbled ball and run with it as it does survey the sound's peak.  In that sense, <i>Troubled Waters</i>
    is a primer on the best of d'n'b circa 2004, which reflects the best of d'n'b circa 1996.  With only a
    handful of releases in the Offshore recordbox, Clever doesn't have the luxury of choosing tracks based on
    compatibility or a shared sense of style, but the record is oddly better off for it: Clever's unusual
    transitions provide variety and personality, as he blends leftfield drum 'n' bass that lurches from crisp,
    microscopically chopped beats to more soul-jazz-style excursions.</p><p>
    
    Deep Blue (of ""Helicopter Tune"" fame) contributes two tracks and nicely represents the jungle vanguard, but
    most of the offers are from young, largely unknown producers.  Appropriately absent, then, are many of the
    old cliches and templates-- ""Amen"" breaks, drug-heightened post-rave anxiety, pre-millennial tension.
    Indeed, many of these are no longer even applicable.  In their place isn't, to the possible dismay of some,
    a baton-pass to some new tech-driven reemergence of the cult of progression or the hyperkinetic, playful
    ""all killer, no filler"" that has characterized the ragga-jungle revival.  Instead, up-and-comers such as
    Sileni, Paradox, and Intex Systems seem trained on a balance between texture, intricate drum patterns, and
    noise in a way that recalls glitchy IDM and techno more than most of contemporary jungle's jazz-prog
    snorers.</p><p>
    
    Fairly abstract and scatterbrained, Offshore's output boasts lush washes of cinematic pleasure (Seba's
    ""Make My Way Home"") and ping-ponging excursions into sound (Sileni's ""Twitchy Droid Leg""), and even has
    a pair of almost purely rhythmic tracks appropriately titled ""Drum Track 1"" and ""Drum Track 2"".  Clever
    keeps things fresh and well-paced by skipping across a constantly shifting landscape rather than aiming
    to extract a mix's typical ebb and flow from a pool of tracks which don't seem to offer him that possibility.</p><p>
    
    In the early to mid-1990s, the sheer speed with which jungle progressed almost inherently kept all but its
    most dedicated devotees at arm's length.  Its quick turnover in vocabulary, style, and sound-- particularly
    considering these were the dark pre-Internet days-- made it one of that era's more clique-y and obsessive
    genres.  Each shift in style was so on the heels of the one before it that even largely uniform sets seemed
    thrilling to The In Crowd, even if they were monolithic to those peering through the windows.  <i>Troubled
    Waters</i> acts as a something of a second chance for those window shoppers.  Even Offshore's playful sleeves--
    with Pete Fowler-esque characters which are reminiscent of the ghost, boy, and bird that serve as mascots
    for Ghostly International and Spectral Sound-- are warm and inviting.  So while <i>Troubled Waters</i> is
    a lifeline to the contemporary underground for those set adrift on their blissful jungle memories, the
    record is also, more importantly, a lifejacket which finally allows toe-dippers to dive in at the deep
    end.</p></div>"|2577.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2577-offshore-presents-troubled-waters/|7.9|Scott Plagenhoef

    <i>This Is Meant to Hurt You</i>, as a relatively accessible announcement of a notable new voice in punk
    music.  Alternately melodic and inundated with noise, willfully abrasive and easily approachable, the EP
    raised expectations for the band's forthcoming full-length and backed up the band's steady opening spot
    on last year's Blood Brothers tour.  The band has finally emerged from the buzz created from its previous
    release with <i>Oxeneers</i>, a challenging debut that sidesteps inflated expectations by staying close to
    the group's established sound while still demonstrating a flexibility conducive to future musical development.</p><p>
    
    The album opens with an assault of rhythmic mechanical noise.  Slowly, Erin Tate's methodical drumming
    imperceptibly melts into the cacophony, and an angular guitar riff obliterates the artificiality of the
    track's introduction.  The resulting ""Shit Sisters"" is the most definitive example of TAAS's hybridization
    of diverse influences to date.  The song blends Steve Snere's sullen screamo vocals, Ryan Frederiksen's
    math-rock guitar precision, a trademark prog breakdown, and seamlessly inserted bursts of noise into a
    concise, piercing, and melodic statement of purpose.  The song also introduces the album's recurrent
    thematic strand of suffocating domesticity (""May there be porcelain/ 401K plans/ NASDAQ""), a theme further
    emphasized by Snere's conceit that most songs on the album were based on his experiences at a thankless
    check-cashing temp job.</p><p>
    
    Snere admirably seeks to take back the potency of suburban decay as a compelling image system from the
    clutches of countless overnight pop/punk sellouts.  His depictions of abusive domestic situations and
    tales of mental escape from oppressive middle-class environments are frequently harrowing and affectingly
    sincere.  ""Angela's Secret"" pulsates with bleak energy, twisting a grimy bassline and militaristic rhythm
    into a moving portrayal of one woman's agony in trying to raise her children while working at an interminable
    dead-end job.  Funereal ballad ""Your Pearly Whites"" uses a backdrop of sludgy guitars and sinister organ to
    aid Snere's disturbing oral-fixated reflection on the emotional scars of domestic abuse.</p><p>
    
    TAAS's glaring weakness is their tendency toward disengaging academic indulgence.  The album's subtitle,
    like the band's name itself, superficially hints at a certain pretentiousness that can be felt in the
    album's most over-exerted tracks.  The largely instrumental ""Gadget Arms"", heavy with foreboding harmonic
    atmospherics, disorienting reverb, and affected noise, initially complements Snere's intimately graphic
    imagery (""Breathe on me/ Never spit your last tooth"") but grows tedious over the course of its 7-minute
    runtime.  Interludes like the elegiac organ instrumental ""Tracing"" and found sound collage ""Oxeneers"" add
    texture to the album, but feel like labored artistic afterthoughts.</p><p>
    
    The album's melodic underpinnings, however, are its unmitigated strong suit-- the most memorable material
    derives its power from the complex construction of succinct and simple musical ideas.  The terse ""La Stanza
    Bianca"" fuses undisguised hardcore verses with a disconnected synth line and post-punk rhythm guitar, and
    the captivating ""Idaho"" forms several compelling elements-- a waltzing lo-fi organ progression, dueling
    math-rock guitars, and shifting time signature-- into a sprawling but rewardingly cohesive finale.</p><p>
<i>Oxeneers</i> adequately realizes the potential of <i>This Was Meant to Hurt You</i>, but the band could easily
    cut some of the prog-rock fat that intermittently hinders the album's momentum.  These Arms Are Snakes is a
    promising venture of a group juggling several parallel engagements and side projects (including Minus the
    Bear), though the band occasionally stumbles in establishing a singular voice.  Somewhere beneath the heavy
    exterior and detached indulgence is a jagged post-punk outfit screaming to be let free.</p></div>"|8269.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8269-oxeneers-or-the-lion-sleeps-when-its-antelope-go-home/|7.6|David Moore

    melody, and you have the stuff that wet dreams about a young Mia Farrow are made of.  Belle &amp; Sebastian
    have made a tidy living at this kind of music, while types like Kings of Convenience prefer to put the
    kettle on and take the time to tell a quiet story.  Jens Lekman offers a little bit of both approaches,
    as well as shared notches on the genealogical influence tree-- Morrissey, classic AM pop, self-examining
    folk, and the sardonic wit of Paul Heaton.  But Lekman's real talent is remaining forever the optimist.
    He's Harold Lloyd hanging from a clock that's tearing from the wall, but still smiling at the ladies from
    beneath his snap brim.  Let's have a hand for deadpan Swedish romantics-- they've got the grip to make the
    maudlin fun again.</p><p>
    Lekman can be lovelorn.  He's also been known to write keening song arcs about terminal teenager Rocky
    Dennis (whom you may recall as the tragic figure of the 1985 Eric Stoltz film <i>Mask</i>).  However,
    he usually tempers his melodramatic tendencies with screwy tangents and truckloads of self-deprecation.
    That's the name of the game on <i>When I Said I Wanted to Be Your Dog</i>, his first full-length after a
    series of well-received EPs.</p><p>
    The <i>Rocky Dennis</i> EP holdover ""If You Ever Need a Stranger [to sing
    at your wedding]"" includes Lekman's Moz-like resolution to cut off his arm in the name of true love.  But
    this is in the context of a concisely hopeful, piano-and-whistling ditty that ends with Jens the wedding
    singer looking forward to the blind possibility of meeting his true love at the reception buffet table.
    ""Happy Birthday, Dear Friend Lisa"" is busier, its assembled scratch-pop lilt defined by skeletal bossa
    nova and Caribbean loops.  They tickle Lekman's glowering vocal cheerily as Lisa blows out the candles
    and Jehovah's Witnesses knock on the door.  He knows he can't kiss her, 'cause she's only a friend, but
    he knows God can't either, and that's a victory in his black book.</p><p>
    Lekman also vacillates between caddish selfishness (he dumps his girl during a riot; like breaking it off
    in an upscale restaurant, it's one place you know there won't be a scene) and hazy romantic encounters with
    no strings attached.  He can't help wanting more from his bedmate in ""Cold Swedish Winter"", but she just
    ""wants somebody to hold me through the night.""  (The accompanying female vocal is also one of the album's
    prettiest melodies.)  These dynamics and <i>When I Said</i>'s spare arrangements lessen Lekman's Cute
    Factor, that frustrating, well-appointed nattiness that frequently mars Belle, Sebastian, and most of the
    rest of the twee establishment.</p><p>
    His songs usually suggest some past melody or song (or at least Stephin
    Merritt), but their characters, situations, and Jens himself are represented with such casual seriousness
    that they're immediately endearing.  Sleepy mandolins and love theme synthesizers team up for ""Psychogirl"",
    and the result is high comedy when Lekman imagines a meeting, budding romance, and ultimate breakup in the
    fleeting moments of a few half-thoughts.  His grip is slipping on the clock, but he had to shift to get a
    better look at the filly in the office below.</p><p>
    In the end, Lekman's greatest victory might be rhyming ""#2"" with ""coochie-coo"" and not causing fingers to
    reach down throats.  The song, album opener ""Tram #7 to Heaven"", is three minutes of driving a Citroën up
    a billowy cloud staircase, where the climax lists the various trams and routes.  Fun, love, misery,
    opportunity, life, and the ultimate ascent: The trams are Lekman's options, lined up and harp-twiddled
    in bittersweet and blistered-- but ultimately still optimistic-- relief.</p></div>"|4969.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4969-when-i-said-i-wanted-to-be-your-dog/|7.0|Johnny Loftus

As a
    significant piece of middle and upper class America's fascination with the black urban male, the prison
    serves as the proper denouement for the gangsta ethos-- the state-designated rejoinder to a life of crime
    and chaos.  In hip-hop, prison time equals instant credibility.  The quiet mass of incarceration outweighs
    even the deftest emcee's verbal posturing and childish braggadocio.  Moreover, pop culture has tagged prison
    with a sacred monasticism; inmates enter as thugs and leave as poets.  (Pac's opus <i>All Eyez on Me</i>,
    for instance, came off the heels of his incarceration.)  Of course, the surge in street cred and gift of
    perspective come at a price-- namely, that you were once in prison.</p><p>
    
    For a public starved for something more from commercial hip-hop than jewels, ass and titties, Jamal ""Shyne""
    Barrow's sophomore release is welcome throwback, drawing listeners into harsh pulp fiction that invokes the
    criminal spirit of Chester Himes.  Shyne the rapper and the person exist simultaneously as he backs his
    narratives with a 10-year sentence at Clinton Correctional and the public's usual anticipation for this
    album's release.  Few could have foreseen that success and security of his eponymous debut would have
    vanished like Diddy and J. Lo's getaway car.  Unfortunately, anyone hoping for ""Letter from a Birmingham
    Jail 2004"" will be kept waiting.</p><p>
<i>Godfather Buried Alive</i> exemplifies the limitations of the gangsta genre.  Unlike magicians like Ice
    Cube or Biggie who repeatedly refitted their chronicles of violence and spawned a generational backlash,
    Shyne falls into a <i>Mad Libs</i> style of fill-in-the-felony lyricism.  Over the haunting banshee vocals
    on the Kanye-produced ""More or Less"", Shyne drops wanting lines like, ""I'm living to die,"" and, ""Fuckin'
    big stars and big cars/ I can say I've seen it all and done it all.""  When Shyne opens his material to a
    subject broader than dumping snitches in the river, he only manages tautological nonsense like, ""Hip-hop
    ain't responsible for violence in America/ America is responsible for violence in America.""  ""Behind the
    Walls"" delivers more of Shyne's bumper-sticker gangsterisms: ""It's not where you from, it's where your gat
    at.""</p><p>
    
    Even the slick synth strings and Ashanti's surprisingly in-key vocals on ""Jimmy Choo"" come off mismatched.
    Shyne's battle-hardened cries for a chick who can cook his drugs hardly match Ashanti's chirps of, ""Can't
    nobody touch me like you do.""  The duo make a hard case for hip-hop's oddest couple, competing only with
    the Nappy Roots and Marcos from P.O.D.'s ""Aww Naww"" rock remix fiasco.</p><p>
    
    Shyne's misgivings, of course, are not without contrast: His response to 50 Cent's Hot 97 diss is brilliant
    handbook for D.I.Y. beef.  He dogs 50 over the telephone from prison.  One more time: on the telephone...
    from prison.  Scrap the presidential debates.  Bush and Kerry should take their ish out over IM from Rikers.
    Moreover, <i>Godfather</i>'s final cut, ""Diamonds and Mack 10s"", bleeds wrenching pathos and offers a
    profound, chilly cross-section of a Crown Heights black male.  Shyne momentarily lifts the thug's facade
    to recount the characteristic nihilism of the gangster credo: ""I'm suicidal, can't take this pressure or
    this pain/ Too much for these young eyes/ Real g's don't die, that's a lie / 'Cause I'm dyin' inside,
    cryin' inside.""  Shyne's ghostly stanzas ebb with intensity until his unnerving conclusion: ""I see demons.""</p><p>
    
    While <i>Godfather</i> is not Shyne's strongest release, his return to the gangster narrative may well spark
    a new generation of truth-baring rappers to bring C. Dolores Tucker back from obscurity.  While the J-Kwons
    and Juveniles enjoy the fruits of paradise and their Lexus helicopters, Shyne reminds us of the ones who
    didn't make it: the legions of his fellow Clinton inmates fighting to keep afloat under prison's psychic
    burden.</p></div>"|7778.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7778-godfather-buried-alive/|6.9|Jamin Warren

For now, the
    Bpitch Control labelhead seems to have taken a break from the boards, making 2004 both a year for administration--
    the label has issued more LPs and 12-inches this year than any before-- and, in the cases of her new
    <i>Remix Collection</i> and DJ mix <i>My Parade</i>, a year for archival and personal introspection as
    well.</p><p>
    
    ""Personal"" is used somewhat broadly here.  To a large extent, Allien is Bpitch Control, and the label
    maintains such a distinct identity, despite its growing roster of new artists, precisely because her own
    trajectory dominates.  And so <i>My Parade</i> lays out Bpitch's pre-history as much as Allien's: the
    beats 'n' breaks tradition of early 90s UK techno.  Allien identifies with some familiar tracks-- Midi
    Rain's 1991 track ""Always"" kicks off the mix with dense synth melodies and a fierce (though somewhat dated)
    16th-note drum loop, and Plaid's 2001 offering ""Squance"" is a nice throwback to the group's early singles--
    but curiously spends a lot of time spinning B-sides.</p><p>
    
    If Allien was looking to align herself with early
    90s Warp, the Blueprint mix of Wild Planet's ""Electron"" does not seem the most definitive choice.  Then
    again, this is not <i>The Parade</i>, but <i>My Parade</i>, and perhaps Allien pays tribute to these
    artists not simply as her influences, but as artists themselves: B-sides often house the more difficult
    or experimental offerings of 12-inch releases, and by using them so exclusively in <i>My Parade</i> (10
    of the album's 13 tracks are flips), Allien might be nodding to what she considers her tradition's more
    introspective releases.</p><p>
    
    The new Bpitch releases that Allien includes on <i>My Parade</i>, however, are not presented as UK techno's
    most highly evolved specimen.  Instead, Allien stuffs them together in the middle of the mix, as if to tease
    out Bpitch's debt even more graphically.  Allien's ""Bang Bang"", like the front side of <i>My Parade</i>, is
    more rhythmically than melodically interested, as the track convulses in a stew of percussive sounds.
    Modeselektor's ""Rave Anthem"" follows, though into slightly more melodic terrain.  Apparat's schaffel gem
    ""Cheap Thrills"", however, stands out from the Bpitch pack, clamoring limply through a storm of noise and
    fat rain.  After this brief Bpitch showcase, the heretofore dark and gloomy <i>My Parade</i> finishes out
    with a string of bright instrumentals.  Allien pays particular tribute to CJ Bolland's 1992 bright trance
    anthem ""Mantra"" by following it with her own Plaid-does-trance number ""Dresden"", one of her earliest
    releases.</p><p>
    
    If <i>My Parade</i> is Allien's frank homage to her influences, <i>Remix Collection</i> proves how distinct
    of an identity she has developed despite those debts.  The compilation chronicles much of Allien's career,
    from her 1996 heavy house remix of Gut-Humpe's ""Butterfly"" to a 2003 reconfiguration of <i>Berlinette</i>
    lead-off ""Alles Sehen"".  Much like Matthew Herbert's 2002 remix album <i>Secondhand Sounds</i>, Allien's
    <i>Remix Collection</i> works well as an album precisely because each remix so clearly bears her fingerprints:
    particularly her uncompromisingly dark, rhythmic displacements of source material.  Allien's reworking of
    Sascha Funke's ""Forms and Shapes"" understands the melancholy that neither the original nor any other of

For now, the
    Bpitch Control labelhead seems to have taken a break from the boards, making 2004 both a year for administration--
    the label has issued more LPs and 12-inches this year than any before-- and, in the cases of her new
    <i>Remix Collection</i> and DJ mix <i>My Parade</i>, a year for archival and personal introspection as
    well.</p><p>
    
    ""Personal"" is used somewhat broadly here.  To a large extent, Allien is Bpitch Control, and the label
    maintains such a distinct identity, despite its growing roster of new artists, precisely because her own
    trajectory dominates.  And so <i>My Parade</i> lays out Bpitch's pre-history as much as Allien's: the
    beats 'n' breaks tradition of early 90s UK techno.  Allien identifies with some familiar tracks-- Midi
    Rain's 1991 track ""Always"" kicks off the mix with dense synth melodies and a fierce (though somewhat dated)
    16th-note drum loop, and Plaid's 2001 offering ""Squance"" is a nice throwback to the group's early singles--
    but curiously spends a lot of time spinning B-sides.</p><p>
    
    If Allien was looking to align herself with early
    90s Warp, the Blueprint mix of Wild Planet's ""Electron"" does not seem the most definitive choice.  Then
    again, this is not <i>The Parade</i>, but <i>My Parade</i>, and perhaps Allien pays tribute to these
    artists not simply as her influences, but as artists themselves: B-sides often house the more difficult
    or experimental offerings of 12-inch releases, and by using them so exclusively in <i>My Parade</i> (10
    of the album's 13 tracks are flips), Allien might be nodding to what she considers her tradition's more
    introspective releases.</p><p>
    
    The new Bpitch releases that Allien includes on <i>My Parade</i>, however, are not presented as UK techno's
    most highly evolved specimen.  Instead, Allien stuffs them together in the middle of the mix, as if to tease
    out Bpitch's debt even more graphically.  Allien's ""Bang Bang"", like the front side of <i>My Parade</i>, is
    more rhythmically than melodically interested, as the track convulses in a stew of percussive sounds.
    Modeselektor's ""Rave Anthem"" follows, though into slightly more melodic terrain.  Apparat's schaffel gem
    ""Cheap Thrills"", however, stands out from the Bpitch pack, clamoring limply through a storm of noise and
    fat rain.  After this brief Bpitch showcase, the heretofore dark and gloomy <i>My Parade</i> finishes out
    with a string of bright instrumentals.  Allien pays particular tribute to CJ Bolland's 1992 bright trance
    anthem ""Mantra"" by following it with her own Plaid-does-trance number ""Dresden"", one of her earliest
    releases.</p><p>
    
    If <i>My Parade</i> is Allien's frank homage to her influences, <i>Remix Collection</i> proves how distinct
    of an identity she has developed despite those debts.  The compilation chronicles much of Allien's career,
    from her 1996 heavy house remix of Gut-Humpe's ""Butterfly"" to a 2003 reconfiguration of <i>Berlinette</i>
    lead-off ""Alles Sehen"".  Much like Matthew Herbert's 2002 remix album <i>Secondhand Sounds</i>, Allien's
    <i>Remix Collection</i> works well as an album precisely because each remix so clearly bears her fingerprints:
    particularly her uncompromisingly dark, rhythmic displacements of source material.  Allien's reworking of
    Sascha Funke's ""Forms and Shapes"" understands the melancholy that neither the original nor any other of
    the song's several remixes could fully grasp, while her take on Gold Chains' ""Let's Get It On"" proves that
    she knows when to lay off a bit-- the song's memorable vocal and synth hooks remain completely intact.  Same
    goes for French duo OMR's ""The Way We Have Chosen"": Allien maintains the original's key ""Here Come the Warm
    Jets"" guitar melodies, and concentrates her influence in the song's breakdown, which even features her own
    glitched-out vocals.</p><p>
<i>Remix Collection</i>'s most historically popular cuts-- the remixes of Barbara Morgenstern's ""Aus Heiterem
    Himmel"" and of Golden Boy with Miss Kittin's ""Rippin Kittin""-- are unsurprisingly the album's brightest spots,
    too. The sheer vitality of Allien's Morgenstern remix flat-out embarrasses the lounge-y, Gainsbourgeous original,
    while Allien's subtle enhancements to the electro-snorter ""Rippin Kittin"" give the song's hook (""Daddy/ Can
    I go out and kill tonight?/ I feel/ I feel like taking a life"") remarkable chill.  It's a wonder people didn't
    feel more awkward dancing to Allien's version (the remix was a relative club hit in 2002), but that's further
    testament to Allien's talent: Given both its tact and personal energy, <i>Remix Collection</i> could just as

Though her voice has limits she often pushes, it's
    uniquely expressive: Whether persuading you about an esoteric political stance, holding you with a monologue
    like a captive at a dinner party, or wracking you with the problems lined up in her mind, Peacock is as
    serious as stone.  And she's just as powerfully feminine.  Her seductiveness doesn't sidle up to you so
    much as stare you down, and even a crooning whisper falls like a decision to marry.</p><p>
    None of her records-- even the few that are still in print-- capture Peacock's singing as clearly and
    thoroughly as this collection, which reissues her most commercial efforts out of a lifetime of difficult
    art.  Throughout her career, she stayed in the background or worked behind one man or another.  She
    started her career as a singer, pianist and composer in the 60s, when her marriage to bassist Gary
    Peacock led her to take the stage with Albert Ayler; she wrote ballads made of heavy notes with wide
    spaces between them, and Paul Bley, her second husband, recorded definitive versions of several of them.</p><p>
    But Peacock only started in jazz.  She and Bley talked Bob Moog into lending them one of his early
    synthesizers, and they were among the first people to drag one onto a stage, putting up with the 20 minute
    delays to patch it for the next song.  David Bowie was an admirer, and she turned down an offer to appear
    on <i>Aladdin Sane</i>, only to sign with-- and be strung along by-- Bowie's management.  A session with
    Brian Eno also fell apart, but she won over Bill Bruford, who appears on this record and who invited her
    to sing on <i>Feels Good to Me</i>.  You can also read accounts of her topless show at New York City's
    Townhall, or a holographic performance with Salvador Dali on Broadway.  But that's another story.</p><p>
    This collection, consisting of material released on the Aura label in the late 1970s, documents some of
    her few sessions as a group's unequivocal leader.  It includes the complete <i>X-Dreams</i> and <i>The
    Perfect Release</i> albums, plus two rare outtakes that were mastered from badly worn vinyl.  ""My Mama
    Never Taught Me How to Cook"", the first and strongest song from <i>X-Dreams</i>, creates a give-and-take
    between bluesy riffs and lurching disorder as Annette Peacock sings, speaks and wails the lyrics.</p><p>
    Our modern ears are accustomed to hearing a song lurch like a ship at sea, but something about Peacock's
    delivery still ducks categorization.  This is a song about family politics, with sly puns intimating
    brother/sister sex, next to accusations that her parents didn't encourage her, and didn't prepare her to
    be any better than she is.  But her real attitude is as elusive as the guitars (are they improvising, or
    under firm, Captain Beefheart-like control?), and so she gets her message across in a song that's as
    ambiguous as a relationship.</p><p>
    On ""Real &amp; Defined Androgens"", Peacock delivers an almost-spoken word piece over a harsh prog jam with
    chopping guitar chords and squalling sax.  But the later recordings on <i>X-Dreams</i> settle down: Peacock
    had relocated from New York City to England, where she assembled a strong funk-rock band that features
    Bruford, Mick Ronson, and Chris Spedding, and here she writes colorfully wistful ballads like ""Questions"",
    and also leads the band through a total reinvention of Elvis Presley's ""Don't Be Cruel"" that updates the
    song for the age of big lapels.</p><p>
    Peacock took an even smoother, almost disappointing turn on <i>The Perfect Release</i>.  The first four
    tracks from that disc are catchy funk-pop played by members of the Jeff Beck Band and sweetened with steel
    drums and a tweaky pitch-bending synthesizer.  They've aged about as well as ""Escape (The Piña Colada Song)"",
    and the background remains static, failing to provide any nuance to Peacock's political/astronomical
    musings.  After those first tracks, the set moves on to a reggae single, the seductive monologue-over-music
    of ""The Succubus"", and the 14-minute ""Survival"", a jam that never overheats and nearly runs to tedium until
    Peacock abruptly ends it with a jazzy quote from ""Silent Night"".  Still, <i>The Perfect Release</i> is a
    step down from <i>X-Dreams</i>: Dated in many ways, especially lyrically, it sounds more one-dimensional
    than almost anything in Peacock's catalog.  It delivers flat, clear messages, and that had never been her
    goal before.</p><p>
    That album's commercial failure just added insult to injury, and Peacock has never tried to sound this
    ""pop"" again.  (On her latest disc, 2000's <i>An Acrobat's Heart</i>, ECM led her back to austere
    balladeering.)  Many artists today-- not least Björk or PJ Harvey-- have crossed artistic experimentation
    with commercial appeal by wandering in new directions and then nailing down the discoveries and making
    them popular.  There are many reasons why Björk's idiosyncratic work has made her a star while Peacock
    never attained the fame that she aspired to in the 70s-- and that she firmly turned her back on in the
    80s.  But one clue is that Peacock never built up an obvious identity.  She looks so different from photo
    to photo in the liner notes that you could almost be looking at sisters.</p><p>
    For such a powerful performer, Annette Peacock has never been a diva.  She never shied away from letting
    her man take the spotlight, never sounded squeamish about mangling her own voice in electronic effects.
    It was easier to sound mysterious in the 70s, when your career, the story behind your career, and the
    subtext under everything you did weren't put under a microscope.  But even by those standards, Peacock's
    a cipher: She lets the work speak for itself, when it so chooses.</p></div>"|6552.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6552-my-mama-never-taught-me-how-to-cook-the-aura-years-1978-1982/|7.9|Chris Dahlen

    want to do this weekend?"" and the asked will respond with something along the lines of, ""I dunno.  Was there
    anything you wanted to do?""  Ultimately, a weekend itinerary is cobbled together off the cuff, bike rides and
    drives to Evanston sandwiched around chores and weekend work.  It's not a perfect system, but it works okay
    and leaves room for spontaneous frozen custard runs.  In the house of Anita &amp; Kevin Robinson of Portland,
    Oregon, I imagine the conversation goes more like this:</p><p>
    
    Anita: ""What do you want to do this weekend?""</p><p>
    
    Kevin: ""I dunno.  Cut a record?""</p><p>
    
    Anita: ""Sure.  Let's set up the living room.""</p><p>
    
    The couple makes their music a part of their domestic life, recording as a duo in their own abode-- their
    Big Pink if you like.  Their music doesn't really betray their personal relationship to one another in any
    specific terms, but it definitely has that home-cooked feel that announces its humble origins, even as
    their third album, <i>The Heat Can Melt Your Brain</i>, enters moodier, more dramatic territory than its
    predecessors.  The Robinsons are nothing if not ambitious, and their songs have blossomed into involved,
    thoughtfully arranged opuses that easily fold bells, celeste, saw, kazoo and surprisingly complex backing
    harmonies into their varied sections.</p><p>
<i>The Heat Can Melt Your Brain</i> opens with ""Alive with Pleasure"", which sets a crunching burst of
    frazzled fuzz bass and bowed saw against the airy sing-song melody that Anita swings between weightless
    and propulsive passages.  This all leads up to a nasty guitar outburst-- one of many showcases Anita's
    supple playing receives throughout the album, from the backward slashes that cut the inky funk of ""Business
    Casual"" to the spacey eagletoned interjections on ""The Center of the Universe"".  The latter is one of the
    album's finest songs, as Kevin's verse vocal echoes over watery organ and thumping drums, building to a
    strident, majestic chorus.  He also manages to squeeze in one of the album's most openly sentimental
    verses: ""The center of my heart is a beautiful girl/ One tear from her face could destroy the world.""</p><p>
    
    Kevin gets the lead on ""High Highs"", as well, a smoothly funky tune with a simmering, R&amp;B-inflected; chorus,
    and one of the duo's most adventurous songs to date.  That it's wedged between Anita's floating guitar
    freakout ""The Lucky Ones"" and the mellotron- and synth-drenched indie rock thump of ""Daylight"" is a stark
    illustration of the band's range, which extends even further on closer ""They Never Really Wake Up"", a
    gauzy interstellar lounge cut stuffed with wordless vocals and a bass part that Air by all rights should
    have included on <i>Moon Safari</i>.  It's hard to say exactly where Viva Voce ought to be filed, as
    they've more or less slid out of any one category on <i>The Heat Can Melt Your Brain</i>.  This, however,
    is an asset in my book, and a sign that Viva Voce's conflation of domestic and creative life is working
    wonderfully.</p></div>"|8520.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8520-the-heat-can-melt-your-brain/|7.6|Joe Tangari

    because he's a Northern California Dude in the City of Angels.  On their eagerly sun-spattered debut
    <em>So Much for the Cities</em>, The Thrills sidestepped such internecine quarrels by delving a bit deeper
    into the state's complex psyche than, ""San Diego, hey, that's where all the kids go.""  No one minded much,
    thanks to achingly low-key pop gems like the gorgeous debut single, ""Big Sur"".  But somewhere between there
    and here, these Dubliners must have stumbled through Watts; lost innocence hangs over their sophomore release
    like San Fernando Valley smog.</p><p>
    
    Instead of Santa Cruz or Hollywood, The Thrills' continuing travelogue takes us through ""New York Cit-aaaaay""
    (rhymes with ""committ-ay,"" at least when you're imitating the Stones' faked American accents).  That's when
    singer/songwriter Conor Deasy's narrator isn't going down in flames, burning bridges or dry-humping on
    dancefloors.  Meanwhile, the record was made in Los Angeles, and ""the city"" looms large and desolate as
    the songs' backdrops.  ""I guess that everybody went to a better party,"" Deasy whines.  Good for them.</p><p>
    
    Of course, <em>So Much for the City</em> wasn't exactly a day at the beach, either, despite the deceptively
    upbeat arrangements, which softly but deftly evoked The Beach Boys and Byrds.  Musically, <em>Let's Bottle
    Bohemia</em> opens with a big fake-out: a killer distorted guitar riff worthy of AC/DC circa <em>High Voltage</em>.
    If this were Jet or The Vines, an exaggerated, phony scream would punctuate the second-hand rebelliousness,
    but instead, Deasy elegantly leads the band into a shiny midtempo rocker much like the debut's ""One Horse
    Town"".  The crucial difference is the newly jaded swagger in Deasy's ever-almost-breaking voice.  ""The
    streets aren't paved with gold,"" he concedes, but he fights to hide how much that hurts.</p><p>
    
    Largely absent are the spacey Grandaddy synths that occasionally lent the band's debut a pleasant jolt of
    modernity.  Instead, ""Not for All the Love in the World"" infuses the proceedings with a heady rush of
    Coldplay melodrama.  Against the odds, its deliberate pacing and understated lyrics (""She didn't realize,
    that's a lot of love"") make for a subtle highlight.  Lead single ""Whatever Happened to Corey Haim"" is the
    real surprise, sounding like K.C. &amp; The Sunshine State with absurd Three Degrees strings backing a melody
    fit for Ben Folds' solo work.</p><p>
    
    ""Just don't change a thing,"" Deasy pleaded on the debut's ""Deckchairs and Cigarettes"".  The Thrills didn't,
    and neither did new producer Dave Sardy, despite a resume that includes production work for Marilyn Manson,
    Slayer, and (shock!) Jet.  But something changed <i>them</i>.  ""You can take the city,"" Deasy sings on
    ""Faded Beauty Queens"", which features tasteful guitar work from R.E.M.'s Peter Buck and tells one of the
    album's many stories of broken dreams and vanished glory (ahem, Corey Haim).  They call Los Angeles the
    City of Angels.  The Thrills didn't find it to be that, exactly.  But their forlorn, polished California
    pop is like the sprawling Valley suburbs: nice enough, if that's your sort of thing.</p></div>"|8038.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8038-lets-bottle-bohemia/|6.0|Marc Hogan

It wasn't quite a
    Humbert Humbert freakout, but the signs of aging had finally become visible.  For me-- and if you check the
    archives here you'll find the opposing point well-represented-- <i>Phantom Power</i> showed a band giving
    into time.  Continuously pushing boundaries throughout their decade-long run, it seemed the band had finally
    worn themselves out, and maybe grown a bit too content with their resting place.</p><p>
    
    A full-fledged return from the polyester soul nadir of <i>Rings Around the World</i>, <i>Power</i> saw the
    band massaging their trademarked Beach Boys glow into pastoral psychedelics and warm, salty epics.  But even
    so, its moments of unbridled experimentation and musical excursions were far less common than on their
    masterpiece, 1999's <i>Guerilla</i>.  The tacked-on electronic bewitchery at the end of ""The Piccolo Snare""
    exemplified the change: In contrast to its fellow album cuts, it was detectably forced-- just a tossed-off
    nugget for the tech-heads that SFA has always depended on.  So, following <i>Phantom Power</i>, perhaps it's
    only proper for a band so dependent on rebirth to allow others a chance to succeed where they've failed: in
    distorting the past.</p><p>
    
    First released last year on their own Placid Casual label, <i>Phantom Phorce</i> is narrated by Kurt Stern,
    the original's executive producer.  Using glib allusions to fictional turmoil during the recording sessions--
    complete with a reference to the whole debacle eventually appearing in <i>Mojo</i>-- Stern attempts to fuse
    these very separate, individual tracks together into a cohesive whole.  Unfortunately, he gets in the way
    more than he helps, and by album's end, you're likely to consider redubbing it without his contributions.</p><p>
    
    Though far less dynamic than its predecessors, <i>Phantom Power</i> was still home to a number of remarkable
    soundbytes, which offered this record's remixers plenty of manipulable material through which to embolden
    the original works, yet also retain the Furries' signature wit.  Killa Kela turns ""Golden Retriever"" into
    a spastic funk jam, choked-up with thudding glitch-beats and carnivorous beat-boxing.  High Llamas rebuild
    ""Valet Parking"" as a Beatlesque symphony, sifting past soft Day-Glo flutes and clouded strings, and channeling
    four orchestral transitions.  Perhaps the best cut-and-paster of the lot, Four Tet, applies his apple-coring
    talents to ""The Piccolo Snare"", so that the resulting track stumbles on funky, lock-step rhythms and a
    repeated chime-loop to combine the moonlight-boxed psychedelics of his own work with the plump grace of
    the original.</p><p>
    
    Yet, when the remix artists lose track of the Furries' source material, the results often bear more resemblance
    to faceless IDM than any of the band's untreated songs.  Wauvenfold's take on ""Sex, War and Robots"" falls in
    love with its own glitch-cutting, and winds up a jarring, unrecognizable mess that makes the most frenzied
    Mouse on Mars' tracks seem tame by comparison.  Likewise, Mego noise terrorist Massimo's ""Venus and Serena""
    ditches every scrap of the original song except slight vocal fragments, falling flat with gurgling electro
    beats and a grinding guitar.  Any song titled after America's favorite tennis twins can't afford to lose
    that sense of humor.  Here, Massimo freezes it into a Martian soundscape, and thus allows it to escape his
    grasp in an unremarkable skyjacking.</p><p>
    
    In the end, how much you make of <i>Phantom Phorce</i> will be related to your love for Super Furry Animals.
    It's the burden most remix albums have to bear.  To hear the group's material tweaked into schizophrenic
    tantrums and hymns to the echolalia of technology is certainly worth enduring the album's more watered-down
    inclusions-- even Kurt Stern's boring narration.  Plus, there's always the hope that seeing their material
    in the hands of some of the world's young contortionists might prove to be just the jolt the Furries need
    to send them back into the throes of prime creativity.  But then, does anyone really want to hear them as
    inspired by Boom Bip?</p></div>"|7603.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7603-phantom-phorce/|7.0|Derek Miller

    Swedish nonet The Legends.  The few early online reviews of the group's debut, <i>Up Against The Legends</i>,
    reveal none of the band members' names, and websites for their American and European labels are similarly
    mum on the group's background.  This we know: There are nine individual Legends (although some sources and
    photographs claim only eight).  The band formed in early 2003.  They had a gig opening for Stockholm-based
    Radio Dept. before they even had a committed line-up.  The principle players-- Johan Angeråld of Club 8
    may or may not be among them-- recruited friends, and friends of friends, some of whom had no musical
    experience and had to learn to play their instruments.  It's unclear which band members, how many, and
    which instruments; there's a big difference between teaching yourself guitar or drums and learning
    tambourine.</p><p>
    Obviously, The Legends are a concept-driven band.  The group was born as an idea that had to be fleshed out
    with actual flesh, so taking the name The Legends is apparently not an act of Hives-like audacity, nor does
    it appear to be a forward-looking mission statement.  Hiding behind their collective identity and withholding
    biographical information and even their individual names, The Legends live up to that name in the most
    mythological sense of the word.  Even the pictures of the musicians on the album cover are collages,
    rendering them literally as cardboard cutouts.</p><p>
    Whatever ends this strategy serves are debatable, but The Legends' rigorous anonymity, however suspicious,
    would seem to blur into the music, at least superficially.  <i>Up Against The Legends</i> traffics in a
    brand of retro-minded indie pop that borrows just enough from current garage-rock trends to put movement
    in the music, but not enough to garner any meaningful comparisons to fellow Swedes like The Hives or Sahara
    Hotnights.  They're more beholden to The Jesus &amp; Mary Chain's fuzzed-out style and Phil Spector's Wall of
    Sound than to <i>Nuggets</i> or The Stooges.  Still, given these sketchy outlines, their debut should be
    at best merely forgettable and at worst actively bad.  After all, pop doesn't always reward the DIY ethic
    the way punk does.  And songs like ""There and Back Again"" and ""Trouble Loves Me"", on first listen, do sound
    too trendy and maybe a little generic-- the product of genre formula rather than musical imagination.  The
    atmosphere of ""When the Day Is Done"" (featured on the <i>Wicker Park</i> soundtrack) sounds too studied to
    be as chilly as intended.</p><p>
    Seemingly handicapped, <i>Up Against The Legends</i> could have been lost in this year's overflow of surprisingly
    good albums by like-minded artists like The Concretes, Jens Lekman, Camera Obscura, and Saturday Looks Good
    to Me.  The first impression is that of an acceptable, if not stellar, example of a particular style-- maybe
    a high 6 on the Pitchfork rating scale.  So then, what separates it from the pack?  Perhaps it's due to <i>Up
    Against The Legends</i> incredible resilience: It grows on you like ivy.  With each subsequent listen, the
    album reveals more and more of itself through small, unexpected flourishes of sound that gradually accrue
    more than enough personality to fill the band-shaped hole.</p><p>
<i>Up Against The Legends</i> is heavily layered with hand claps, tambourines, soft-focus background vocals,
    and melodies that never seem to go where you might expect.  Someone's subtle, pulsing organ races alongside
    someone else's one-note bassline throughout ""There and Back Again"", adding a nice tension to the 50s-romantic
    guitar riff and the pleading, static vocals.  Whoever's playing the acoustic guitar theme on ""When the Day
    Is Done"" drops in a few extra notes at the end of each line, turning the melody back on itself.  Coupled with
    lyrics that describe the aftermath of a petty romantic argument, that small filigree drops the temperature
    a degree with each listen-- and the album is crammed with similar enlivening flourishes.</p><p>
<i>Up Against The Legends</i> is that rare pop album that doesn't immediately pop: It's less concerned with
    the present than with the future.  And who knows?  Perhaps whatever success attends this album's release will
    prompt the individual Legends to leave their hiding places and introduce themselves to their listeners.  But
    then, who The Legends are is so much less important than what their debut is: a solid, surprising album whose
    rewards are commensurate with the time you spend with it.</p></div>"|4971.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4971-up-against-the-legends/|8.0|Stephen M. Deusner

    of <i>The Manifestation</i> will come as a surprise.  Originally appearing in 2000 as a one-sided vinyl release,
    it's now manifest in the form of a two-song CD single.  The first track is a reissue of the original music,
    the second new material; both are 22-minute pieces with their thematic attention turned toward the heavenly
    bodies that govern our lives.  That's right-- they're about the cast of ""The O.C.""</p><p>
    
    No, sorry, they're about our solar system.  The title track is an ode to the sun in the body of a raga-inspired
    epic-- a form suited to its topic, as the movement of melodic notes around an established tonic conjures
    images of planets rotating around the star.  Ben Chasny's acoustic guitar mimics the ringing metallic tone
    and microtonal bends of a sitar, with tabla-style hand drums in the background.  The drone is partly
    sustained by a rhythmically plucked mouth harp, which bends and expands to paint a shimmering, warped
    surface; Chasny's use of non-western scales, as well as the general aura of mysticism maintained throughout,
    evoke ritualistic sun-worship.</p><p>
    
    The piece begins with a rumbling incantation, falling into a steady groove.  On top enters Chasny's vocal
    line, unencumbered by any time signature, and layered with a female spoken word part in the style of Gong.
    About 12 minutes in, the piece is overtaken by a formless, atmospheric drone of the sort early Tangerine
    Dream used to evoke the vastness and slow unfolding of large-scale cosmic events.  A slowly rotating LFO
    synth replaces the rhythmic oscillations of the mouth harp, and high, metallic string tones fall.  In its
    third section, the piece lands into a melancholy return with a reestablished tonic and some layered
    guitar/autoharp picking.</p><p>
    
    ""The Six Stations"" is a more subdued work.  It's ideologically based in The Music of the Spheres, the
    ancient Greek concept (popular amongst romantics throughout the ages) that harmonic ratios evident in
    intervals pleasing to the human ear have counterparts in relative interplanetary distances and bodies.
    Chasny's original vinyl release of <i>The Manifestation</i> contained an etching of the sun by Mike Mills
    on its non-playing side; here, Chasny aurally recreates that side by making the ""drone"" of this piece the
    sounds of a record needle playing over Mills' etching.  Thus, Chasny pays homage to his original ""side B,""
    and also lays down a sonic representation of the sun upon which the other musical ""planets"" can interact.
    Of course, none of this is evident in the recording itself, meaning that many listeners will hear what
    seems mainly to be an intentional obfuscation of the music.</p><p>
    
    The amplified vinyl clicks and pops combined with Chasny's guitar work, plucked in grouped torrents of
    notes, initially give the impression of a modern piece of cut 'n' paste laptop collage.  Mercury and Venus
    are represented by acoustic jams in two different keys and scales, before an unaccompanied monologue from
    David Tibet divides the piece with its depiction of Earth.  From there, the planetary divisions are a bit
    more vague-- Chasny engages in some more major-key meanderings before segueing into a pentatonic scale,
    his guitar now taking on the characteristics of a Koto, backed by the sound of muted rain and distant
    thunder.  Though it's an interesting journey in light of its Sun Ra-style theoretical basis, its lack of
    attention to aesthetic execution makes it a less engaging listen.</p><p>
<i>The Manifestation</i>, for better or worse, can be described in terms of trends from 30-40 years ago.
    Its basis in Indian music points to the Ravi Shankar influence that, coinciding with the proliferation of
    psychedelics, prompted many American and European artists to experiment with new scales, tones, and song
    lengths.  And, in the same way that evoking medieval chant or century-old blues necessarily conjures a
    sort of historical exoticism, <i>The Manifestation</i>'s success is partly due to its contextual throwback
    to a mysticism and wonder foreign to modern counterculture.</p><p>
    
    What makes this recording successful, and allows it to be captivating and transformative, is its obvious
    sincerity.  There's value in the wisdom of the now burnt-out, and <i>The Manifestation</i>'s best moments
    are borne of that spirit.  Chasny's wide thematic scope is refreshing in a musical landscape dominated by
    personal soul-bearing.  Our relationship to the extremes of the outer world deserves as much attention as
    do the subtleties of the psyche, and extended pieces here set a frame for listeners to consider the space
    between themselves and the vast beyond.</p></div>"|7202.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7202-the-manifestation/|7.6|Liam Singer

    Wilson went down into his parents' New Jersey basement and recorded what would become one of the most legendary
    self-released ""real people"" albums ever made: <i>You Think You Really Know Me</i>.  The record sounded as
    though it was aiming for some kind of Steely Dan/Shuggie Otis electro-funk fusion, but the uncomfortable
    intimacy and passion of Wilson's performance instead rendered the album a bizarre personal portrait of one
    man's lust, loneliness and inner turmoil.</p><p>
    
    Despite the limited original pressing of <i>You Think You Really Know Me</i>, the album managed to take on
    a life of its own via word-of-mouth and non-commercial radio.  Many listeners who were originally attracted
    by the substantial comedy value of songs like ""6.4 = Make Out"" and ""Chromium Bitch"", and were further drawn
    in by Wilson's crazed white-man soul and not inconsiderable musical talent.  Over the next two decades, the
    album was issued several times by various labels, its small but fervent following-- which included fans
    like Beck (who name-checked Wilson on ""Where It's At""), Matt Groening, and The Roots' ?uestlove-- growing
    with each release.  But nobody was really sure what had ever become of Gary Wilson himself.</p><p>
    
    Curiosity about Wilson hit a sort of critical mass following the latest reissue of <i>You Think You Really
    Know Me</i> on Motel records in 2002.  Though Motel released a collection of stray Wilson recordings as
    <i>Forgotten Lovers</i> in 2003, nobody realistically expected to hear anything more from him until Stones
    Throw Records' Peanut Butter Wolf finally tracked the man down in California.  At the time, Wilson was
    reportedly working at an adult video store and regularly gigging with a jazz lounge act, and was unsurprisingly
    delighted to learn about the acclaim his old work was receiving.  It didn't take much cajoling to convince
    Wilson to finally deliver a true follow-up.</p><p>
    
    So here we are with <i>Mary Had Brown Hair</i>, which sounds more like 27 days have passed since <i>You
    Think You Really Know Me</i> than 27 years.  There are more drum machines this time around, as well as
    chirping Doogie Howser, M.D. synths and treated vocals reminiscent of early Ween.  These ""modern"" touches,
    however, cause the album to lose a bit of the swank, mustachioed 70s vibe of its predecessor.  There's also
    an increased emphasis on conventional pop songwriting; although that's speaking relatively-- these songs
    resemble actual pop radio hits the way basset hounds resemble lake trout.  Otherwise, <i>Mary Had Brown
    Hair</i> surely delivers everything that Wilson enthusiasts could have hoped for, perhaps even too much so.</p><p>
    
    Erotic obsession and small-town alienation remain the central themes of Wilson's work, and as on his debut
    he here performs songs like ""Gary Saw Linda Last Night"", ""Our Last Date"", and ""Debbie, Debbie"" with an
    unnerving introspective intensity.  (I'm gonna go out on a limb and suggest that somewhere along the way
    Gary's caused some women to change their phone numbers.)  Fixated, adolescent love songs like ""Linda Wants
    to Be Alone"" (""She was writing a note to my parents saying that I was bothering her"") that were borderline
    creepy in 1977 are downright alarming now that the guy is legitimately in his 50s.  Scariest of all is ""Gary's
    in the Park"", which features a menacing Wilson intoning the lines, ""Gary's in the dark/ And you know I'll
    be waiting for you...""</p><p>
    
    The possibility exists, of course, that this whole troubled ""Gary Wilson"" persona is just a fictional
    construction of an artist that's simply giving his audience what they want to hear, a theory given
    credibility by the fact that, throughout the album, the singer refers to Gary Wilson in the third person
    as though it's just a role he's playing.  This illustrates what has always been the big conundrum regarding
    outsider music: If the artist is as lacking in self-awareness as he seems to be, it risks putting the
    audience in a condescending, ""let's all laugh at the freak"" position.  Or is Gary Wilson's whole weirdo-loner
    shtick an elaborate affectation meant to dress up what is otherwise nice but pretty mundane synth-pop?  Can
    he really have changed this little over the last 27 years?</p><p>
    
    Whatever the truth is regarding Wilson's methods and intentions, there's no doubt that <i>Mary Had Brown
    Hair</i> is one of the oddest and most baffling musical artifacts you're likely to get your mitts on in
    2004-- one that raises more questions than it answers.  How much you'll actually want to listen to it over
    the next 27 years is a question you'll have to answer for yourself.</p></div>"|8696.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8696-mary-had-brown-hair/|7.0|Matthew Murphy

In a year of highly touted reunions by everyone from the Pixies to Mission of Burma,
    I wanted to believe that The Zombies' first album since 1968's psych-pop masterpiece <em>Odessey &amp; Oracle</em>
    would be a first-class tour de force.  ""We haven't come together cynically, or to make a buck,"" songwriter
    and keyboardist Rod Argent assures us in the liner notes.  LIES!  Argent and singer Colin Blunstone have
    been touring together for the past few years, and even released a disc together under their own names,
    2002's unremarkable <i>Out of the Shadows</i>, that should have served as a stern warning.  But their new
    record gets the Zombies name, Argent writes, because it has a ""group"" sound, and because all the songs were
    written with Blunstone's voice in mind-- presumably including ""I Don't Believe in Miracles"", originally from
    Blunstone's 1972 solo record <em>Ennismore</em>, which here gets the 80s soft-rock treatment, ""Rose for Emily""
    piano intro notwithstanding.</p><p>
    
    It's depressing and embarrassing to talk about the actual music, because to do so reveals not only what
    happens when preternaturally unhip music geeks age (eep!), but also that I actually listened, critically,
    for several hours, to this dross.  Nevertheless: The album sets abysmally banal lyrics of love (""I get so
    cold without your flame"") and psychedelia (""catch the wind and kiss the sun"") atop overwrought 1980s MOR,
    replete with melodramatic string arrangements.  Something about ""Wings Against the Sun"" reminds me of
    treacly 1975 mellow-gold hit ""Dance With Me"" by The Orleans.  Opener ""In My Mind a Miracle"" (how does that
    jibe with ""I Don't Believe in Miracles"", anyway?) grooves like Stephen Schwartz's <em>Pippin</em>, without
    the Bob Fosse choreography.  Worse, it includes the following lyric: ""In you I found my <i>Odessey &amp; Oracle</i>.""
    I can't follow that.</p><p>
    
    As a result, I've spent the day listening to better Zombies-related efforts, from dazzling singles like
    ""She's Not There"" to Blunstone's solid 1971 solo debut, <em>One Year</em>.  That helps me escape from a tune
    about needing you ""like flowers need the rain"" (""Together""), which could pass for a lesser Jonathan Richman
    cut if not for the prog-rock vocals and utter self-importance.  But it can't blot out the lyric booklet in
    front of my eyes: ""It's time to move/ It's time to roll/ Feel it in my heart/ <i>Believe</i> it in my soul.""
    Blunstone shows off his prodigious pipes there with some fake soulfulness, while the band attempts what
    would pass for garage revival if it didn't sound so much like late-period The News (of ""Huey Lewis &amp;"" fame)
    fronted by the dude from Dream Theatre.  Then there's ""Memphis"", which goes all out with keyboards fitting
    for a Peabo Bryson single out of an early 90s Disney flick.</p><p>
    
    If you've read this far, you fell for the ""Zombies reunion"" gimmick, too.  You should have saved your time
    for worthier indie-pop efforts, plus figuring out how you can avoid getting this lame when you inevitably
    grow old, too.  If Argent and Blunstone aren't in this for a cynical buck, they've merely lost all aesthetic
    sense.  That happens, I suppose.  But I can't help but stare at the cover and wonder why they didn't lose
    their hair instead.</p></div>"|8960.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8960-as-far-as-i-can-see/|0.9|Marc Hogan

Robbins first made his mark in the early 80s, as the bassist for D.C. punks
    Government Issue, and then as the frontman for seminal post-punks Jawbox.  After an EP and two LPs of
    powerful ""proto-emo,"" as DeSoto dubbed it, Jawbox left Dischord.  Amid a minor flurry of puritanical
    hand-wringing during the indie boom of the early 90s, they signed to Atlantic Records to release their
    finest album, <em>For Your Own Special Sweetheart</em>, and a glossier, self-titled swan song, before
    disbanding in 1997.  When Jawbox folded, Robbins reunited with Government Issue drummer Peter Moffett and
    Jawbox guitarist Bill Barbot to form Burning Airlines, whose <em>Mission: Control!</em> and <i>Identikit</i>,
    sanded the rough edges from his former band's songwriting, and attempted more traditional lyrical and
    musical structures.</p><p>
    
    And now there's Channels, consisting of Robbins on vocals and guitar, his wife Janet Morgan on vocals and
    bass, and drummer Darren Zentek.  A logical progression from <i>Identikit</i>'s blend of jagged pop and
    brawny rock, their debut EP, <i>Open</i>, posits itself as the culmination of Burning Airlines' aesthetic:
    big hooks, bell-clear vocals, a smoldering and serrated pop sensibility (think Jawbox's ""Iodine"" or Burning
    Airlines ""The Surgeon's House""), and Robbins' most discernible and politically charged lyrics to date.</p><p>
    
    The first track, ""Disconnection Day"", audaciously imagines 9/11 as a future holiday that commemorates the
    death of critical thinking.  It begins with a wafting arpeggio and Robbins' distorted, submerged singing,
    before the vocals burst into the foreground and the guitars blossom like fireworks over the irregular peaks
    of Zentek's drumming.  Robbins' voice has accrued polish and nuance over the years, and his trademarked
    ""aaaayyys"" soar majestically over the mix. </p><p>
    
    The disjointed anthem ""Storytime (In the Street of Spies)"" has an aggressively circuitous guitar line that
    collapses into more spare and effective breakdowns, where the lyrical turn ""surveyor for new maps of hell""
    shines through, representing Robbins' more forthright (at least, forthright for the author of enigmas like
    ""FF=66"") mode of expression.  The driving, staccato ""Chivaree"" continues the murder-by-wordplay dogmatic attack,
    with the opening lyric, ""Kill all the copyrights and loosen my tongue,"" a cunning call for artistic freedom.</p><p>
    
    However, a reworking of John Cale's ""Fear"" is the EP's most striking song.  Swirling acoustic guitar amasses
    toward a chorus that just begins to erupt before stopping short and beginning the upward trek anew.  Janet
    Morgan's dulcet vocals make their first appearance on this duet, and are ably ballasted by Robbins' resonant
    baritone.  Morgan also closes the EP with ""Win Instantly"", a trebly, chiming lullaby on which her vocals are
    pleasant but benign-- one wishes for a harmony to enliven them, but nevertheless, their juxtaposition with
    the tortured dissonance of the chorus works passably well.</p><p>
    
    Robbins has shed Jawbox's raw power and abstruse tendencies, and reinvented his writing in a manner befitting
    these more intelligible songs.  I'm not going to pretend that I like <em>Open</em> as much as <em>For Your Own
    Special Sweetheart</em>, but there are few albums I <em>do</em> like that much.  Jawbox is now distant enough
    that Robbins' records must be judged on how well they stand upon their own feet.  Channels squarely does.</p></div>"|1780.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1780-open-ep/|7.7|Brian Howe

    screaming voices or cars hitting telephone poles.  But outpourings of joy can just lead to chaos and extreme
    volume.  Noise is simply what happens when there's ""too much,"" when containers are filled and things spill
    over the edges.  The actual feelings and sensations involved are wildly variable.</p><p>
    Freewheeling noise is what Flössin is up to, which is surprising considering who is at the center of the
    band.  San Francisco guitarist Christopher Willits spearheads Flössin, but this outlet is miles away from
    the focused and meditative micro-music he makes under his own name (the best of which is on the excellent
    12k label).  Here, Willits collaborates with Miguel Depedro (better known as Kid606) on computer and Zach
    Hill (of Hella) on drums for an improv project in which the trio serve up an unholy racket with a smile.</p><p>
    Word is that Flössin may one day involve a different set of players, but Hill definitely dominates on
    <i>Lead Singer</i>.  Fans of Hella will have no trouble picking out his style, which manages to be both
    nimble and heavy, but here, he applies his considerable chops to something more loose and unpredictable.
    At first, Hill sounds like he's soloing constantly, stringing one insanely complicated roll onto the next
    like Moon's ""My Generation"" outro extended to album length, but upon repeated listens, patterns in his
    sound emerge that are sympathetic to what Willits and Depedro are up to.</p><p>
    Though Hill's role is easy to ascertain, with Willits and Depedro it's hard to tell who's doing what.  Since
    Willits typically plays with his guitar processed via laptop, his tone can go anywhere at any given moment,
    and Depedro seems content to fill space with drone and assorted sound effects.  On the third track (titles
    appear on the sleeve, but they're crossed out with a sharpie), his guitar becomes a singing sword-- something
    like Fripp tunneling through Eno's delays-- and his mournful extended tones against Hill's triple-time hits
    make for an effective contrast.  The fifth track contains some speedy atonal riffs that definitely sound
    ""guitar-like"" inside a gray cloud of feedback, and then Depedro sets off-kilter loops of machine noise
    against Willits' anti-guitar heroics. Highlights come when Depedro and Willits lock together to spin out
    vaguely discernable melodies that somehow get broken in all the excitement.</p><p>
    Occasional clusters of CD skips appear to remind us that there is computer software in the room, but <i>Lead
    Singer</i> sounds strangely analog and most certainly live, with a strong dose of room ambience and a recording
    with such heavy bleeding it may as well be mono.  Most importantly <i>Lead Singer</i> sounds bashed out for
    the sheer pleasure of it, and the thrill is contagious.  If loud, rough, and noisy music once seemed an
    outlet for anger, bands like Flössin show how much happiness there can be in unbridled sound.</p></div>"|3322.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3322-lead-singer/|7.6|Mark Richardson

    an agreement of including some rousing ""You say [blank]!/ I say [blonk]!/ [Blank]!/ [Blonk]!/ [Blank]!/
    [Blonk]!"" action on your records.  The absence of such on their newest album, <i>Winds Take No Shape</i>,
    is a little disappointing.  Please don't tease us, Call and Response.  I wouldn't name my band Wicked
    Bridges and then fail to constantly deliver wicked awesome bridges.</p><p>
    
    Still, while their name doesn't refer to any crunk motifs in their music, it does aptly describe the shift
    evident in their newest release.  <i>Winds Take No Shape</i> seems to be the response to critics who called
    for more depth and less of the wide-eyed cuteness rampant on their self-titled debut.  Their music is still
    lighter-than-air, but a newfound strain of wistfulness brings it closer to earth.  Rather than presenting a
    fluffy, glossed-over reality, the songs here dance around the tug of melancholy.  And as predictable as it
    is that ""sadness"" should be linked to ""importance,"" and ""seriousness"" with ""maturity,"" this album proves
    that bias too inherent to ignore-- <i>Winds Take No Shape</i>'s relative soberness works to give Call and
    Response's breezy sound some weight.</p><p>
    
    Lyrically, the band has turned from their former themes of summertime teenage innocence to late fall,
    haiku-like imagery-- a move reflected in their transformed sound.  The lyrics of <i>Winds Take No Shape</i>
    continually evoke the revolution of the seasons and resulting impermanence of things, and these themes are
    embodied in the band's propulsive, syncopated arrangements.  The twists and turns of Carrie Clough's melodies,
    and their interplay with Simone Rubi's backing vocals paint the swirl of fallen leaves caught in the breeze.
    Intertwined in her phrases is the rhythmic and melodic counterpoint of Daniel Judd's picked guitar, as the
    drums and bass unpredictably shift the upbeat.</p><p>
    
    The clearest precursor to Call and Response's current sound is mid-era Stereolab; the similarity of Clough's
    singing to Laetitia Sadier's goes beyond having the same detached air to include sharing melodic themes, and
    the propensity to stress awkward syllables.  Also present are Stereolab's penchant for mid-song shifts,
    slightly swinging meters, and avoiding obvious chordal resolutions for surprising major-seventh turns.  And
    yet, <i>Winds Take No Shape</i> seems derived of its own inspiration, and atmospherically seeks something
    apart from the Lab's sometimes sterile polemics and exotic instrumentation.  Call and Response still fall
    into pop hooks, and the swing can give way at any point to the plodding bass drum of a soft and muted disco
    chorus.</p><p>
    
    Though the songwriting here points toward more ornamental possibilities, the arrangements on <i>Winds Take
    No Shape</i> remain within the standard band format.  The tracks are occasionally augmented with a cello
    or synth line, and elsewhere, keyboard washes and sparsely placed pieces of production add atmosphere.
    The backing vocals are carefully attended to, with several layers of harmonies present in the excellent
    ""Silent Chill"".  The band works thoughtfully with what's there, and the album feels inspired in its
    standard parameters, but fails to completely maintain the momentum it builds.  The second half is less
    focused than the first-- the songwriting on ""Landscapes"" doesn't meet the standards set elsewhere, and
    ""Station"" feels meandering.  Still, it closes well with ""Silhouette"", one of the album's strongest tracks.</p><p>
    
    The value of a work as album and unimposing as <i>Winds Take No Shape</i> is most easily determined when
    it's not being played, by the urge one has to visit it again.  This work's warm sound and above-average
    complexity in arrangement have brought me back repeatedly, and future releases will hopefully see them
    refining their new sound.  Call and Response have a lot of promise to fulfill.  Including a certain implicit
    promise made by a certain ambitious band name.  Ahem.</p></div>"|1250.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1250-winds-take-no-shape/|7.3|Liam Singer

    hotel-lounge irony chic, good for a chuckle but never without a smirk to let you know they're in on the
    joke.  In 2004, however, Nedelle &amp; Thom sound not at all ironic, but rather very serious and sincere on
    their debut <i>Summerland</i>, whose flowery pop blooms with bright melodies and summery harmonies meant
    to offset the dark bitterness of their lyrics about romantic turmoil and disappointment.</p><p>
    
    Nedelle is an Oakland musician who released her solo debut, <i>Republic of Two</i>, on Kimchee Records last
    year.  Playing Sonny to her Cher is Thom Moore, who is one half of The Moore Brothers.  They founded their
    friendship and eventually the group on their mutual love of Burt Bacharach.  He plays guitar and some keyboard;
    she sings.  Rounding out the group (on <i>Summerland</i>, at least) is the rhythm section from Boston-based
    Karate.</p><p>
    
    On the album's opener, ""You Take Me You Break Me"", Nedelle sings about romantic betrayal and public humiliation--
    her guy shows up at her party with another girl-- but her voice sparkles with such precise, prismatic clarity
    that it becomes a fed-up anthem.  10 uniformly chipper ditties follow, only two of which exceed three happy-go-lucky
    minutes.  The wistful ""In Time It Snows"" and the plaintive ""Care for Me"" have nice moments-- a catchy chorus
    or genuinely lovelorn lyrics-- and Thom's guitar adds simple but effective flourishes to ""It's Up to You"".</p><p>
    
    However, most of the time, Nedelle &amp; Thom get lost in their own nostalgia.  On tracks like ""You Know"", ""Sun
    in My Eyes"", and the unfortunately titled ""Puddle at Your Toes"", they try to re-create a particular sound
    down to a tee, even though they seem to realize they'll never match the silkiness of Dionne Warwick or the
    naturalism of Burt Bacharach's arrangements.  At times, Nedelle &amp; Thom sound as if their ultimate aim is
    mere mimicry, as if they were painters copying the Old Masters brushstroke by brushstroke.  Unfortunately,
    their color palette is garish and their technique only underscores the distance between their abilities and
    their inspirations.  As a result, these songs sound more like Captain &amp; Tennille than Brill Building pop.</p><p>
    
    When they do try to imprint themselves on the music, Nedelle &amp; Thom come across as aloof and elusive, with
    an insularity that stops just short of smugness.  Like the masks they wear on the album cover, they use
    their slavish devotion to their source material to conceal themselves.  If <i>Summerland</i> were part of
    some ironic joke, at least it would be trying to connect with an audience.  For all their earnestness,
    Nedelle &amp; Thom sound like they're singing just for and to themselves-- an inside joke between two friends
    or a guess-you-had-to-be-there story.</p></div>"|5904.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5904-summerland/|5.6|Stephen M. Deusner

    that life-affirming records are released daily, it's forever rare to stumble upon one as consistently
    mind-blowing and aesthetically far-reaching as Dungen's <i>Ta Det Lugnt</i>.  Because of this scarcity,
    when such an unexpected (and immediate) discovery <em>does</em> take place, it's like being struck by
    indescribable melodic lightning: Unlike discs that warrant facile disses or mediocre passing grades,
    the countless reasons for its boundless successes remain ineffable and shadowy despite repeat late-night
    close-listening sessions.</p><p>
    Simply put, Dungen exhibit all the signs of legitimate, hard-won staying power.  <i>Ta Det Lugnt</i>
    is an exceedingly triumphant psych-pop oddity that evokes Keith Moon's drum fills on <i>The Who Sell
    Out</i>, the wraiths of unsung bedroom psyche celebrants, and the acoustic sustain and harmonizing of
    The Byrds' <i>Younger Than Yesterday</i>, <i>Ta Det Lugnt</i> feels less like a new release than some
    ancient tome, a fully formed masterpiece dropped unexpectedly on corduroy laps from some blue-brown sky.
    It's so aesthetically tight, jangly verdant, and musty that even carbon dating insists that it could
    not be post-millennial.</p><p>
    To be sure, there's a major difference between retro and somehow embodying your parents' vintage zeitgeist:
    It's damn-near impossible to believe that the humming tubes, crackling drums, smoky backdrop, and complexly
    interwoven melodies on <i>Ta Det Lugnt</i> were birthed in a quick-fix iPod age.  But perhaps even more
    impressive is that, despite the music's headiness and intricacy, its anachronistic results feel unusually
    effortless, earnest, and unpretentious: Dungen seem driven to this sound not for bloodless cred points, but
    out of a very sincere devotion to the music from a bygone era.</p><p>
    Accomplished beyond his years, 24-year-old Swedish multi-instrumentalist Gustav Ejstes is the pin-up
    mastermind behind Dungen's vibrant polish.  For the full duration of his third album's 13 bracing tracks,
    he perfectly inhabits-- and then expands upon-- his homeland's late-60s/early-70s acid-rock scene.  <i>Ta
    Det Lugnt</i> particularly taps into the expansiveness of his Swedish psych predecessors, Pärson Sound,
    while maintaining a murky rocker edge: Imagine that band colliding with The Kinks, or Amon Düül II with
    Olivia Tremor Control, or Comets on Fire with The Zombies on their way to Terrastock.</p><p>
    Interested in pushing pop glitter to its limits, Ejstes doesn't go as far afield into psych-pop cliches
    like chirping birds and hippie atmospherics as his elder brethren, but his equally vintage garage sound
    allows a definite space for ethereality in the form of funereal dew-drop strings, free jazz breakdowns,
    brief whiffs of AM radio tuning, flute minuets, lushly cascading pianos, prog time changes, florid medieval
    chimes, sky-melting freakouts, church organs, fuzz-guitar jousts, doubled mountain-top whistles, roaring
    six-string solos, and autumnal instrumental interludes.  It's obvious his songs are painstakingly arranged
    with a sense of depth, gradations, and tonal three-dimensionality redolent of something as off the charts
    as <i>Pet Sounds</i>.</p><p>
    Continually, there's a perfect push-and-pull between catchy melodies, roaring solos, and spaced-out dramaturgy--
    the band's output is consistently upbeat even when heartbreakingly tranquil and melancholy.  ""Gjort Bort
    Sig"" flutters and drifts, reaching for the outer realms, before catching a subtle hurricane of quicksand
    spirals behind doubled astronaut vocals.  The sweet arboreal folk of ""Festival"" appears straightforward
    until it unleashes an echo-chamber bridge that absolutely shimmers.  And the title track feels like
    chamber-pop expanded to include a psych history lesson.</p><p>
    Because I took Latin and not Swedish in high school, I have no idea what Ejstes is singing about, but I
    like the verbal opacity-- the way syllables meld to the Hammond, flute, violin, bass, drums, guitars, and
    the way it masks any potentially subpar lyric that might detract from such brilliant arrangements.  Indeed,
    as the summer finally turns to dying leaves, Dungen's lush palette of mystical earth tones and trade winds
    seems the ideal soundscape.  This has been one hell of a year for psych, folk, et. al., but even with such
    fine releases as Animal Collective's <i>Sung Tongs</i> and Comets on Fire's <i>Blue Cathedral</i>, I doubt
    2004 will birth a more blissful sonic encounter than <i>Ta Det Lugnt</i>.</p></div>"|2573.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2573-ta-det-lugnt/|9.3|Brandon Stosuy

    WK-like extremes.  It's the only way to make the dead horse speak-- jab its flank with a Linda Perry hypo
    and first-team production values.  Neptunes, The Matrix, whoever.  The decision to go Big Empty probably
    won't score you any Shortlist Prize nominations, and Jay-Z might never toast you in the VIP, but your
    ridiculous gasbag of an album will make a few Coconuts endcap trollers happy, and will maybe even rock
    the exurbs for a few more blips of summer.  Sure, you'll just be another link in the wallet chain, but at
    least you'll be platinum.  And MTV2 will shake your hand at the Billboard Music Awards, offering you a
    folded-up sawbuck and a job as a presenter.  Who's laughing now, right?</p><p>
    
    Taking that route to the rotting top of Mt. Smart Aleck would be laughable, yet acceptable, for a guy like
    Har Mar Superstar.  It's a living and all that.  But this portly Minnesota vice hasn't made any of those
    kinds of career-boosting concessions.  Rather, he's kept his sound... well, <i>pretty much</i> exactly the
    same.  Once again, <i>The Handler</i> mostly offers service industry beats and the Minneapolis kid's same
    old jag of groupies' panties stories.  But there is at least one new wrinkle: Har Mar occasionally steps
    up the proto-electronic prattle of his past from its unsultry soul-jam roots to Chingy-style pop-rap.</p><p>
    
    Opener ""Transit"" travels without moving to a geeky Stevie Wonder falsetto while banal disco bumps at
    midtempo in the background, finally culminating with you-know-who leading a girls-on-boy call-and-response
    of which he is naturally the center of attention: ""Har Mar is so sexy! Har Mar is so sexy!""  Right, we
    heard that before, and it still isn't true.</p><p>
    
    Not that <i>The Handler</i> doesn't have its notable moments: If you wanna hear Karen O pretending to pork
    a fat fuck, she and Har Mar huff and puff over a splooging 80s pop retrofit called ""Cut Me Up""; ""DUI""
    (""Dialing Under the Influence"", natch) is a harmless enough distraction for white college kids to hook up
    to; and sooner or later, Har Mar gets around to teabagging Holly Valance: The Aussie hottie appropriately
    tarts the Missy Elliott reset ""Back That Camel Up"".</p><p>
    
    But the record is still mostly filler-- a hook for the gaudy live show-- proving again that there wasn't
    much to the Har Mar joke to begin with.  Do you miss the maudlin keyboard pacing and foofy harmonica sound
    of 1985 soft-rock, best typified by ""That's What Friends Are For""?  Then by all means, invest some time in
    <i>The Handler</i>'s ""Sugar Pie"".  Perhaps you want swishy raps about Freaky Freezies and public nudity,
    pinned halfheartedly to Taco's take on Irving Berlin's ""Putting on the Ritz""?  ""As"" has an endless supply
    of tan lines, popsicles, sun block, and flip-flops.  But then, even Taco himself got <i>that</i> kind of
    action at the peak of his fleeting fame skid.</p><p>
    
    If Har Mar Superstar had taken his catchphrasing and ponce-preening to <i>I Get Wet</i> levels, <i>The Handler</i>
    might at least flaunt some radio-compressed hooks, Pink and DMX guest shots, and more songs like ""DUI"" that
    hug the line between Beck and dreck.  But these productions are skeletal at best, mainstream kitsch-pop on
    a Casio budget.  As such, <i>The Handler</i> only meagerly amplifies what he was already doing, probably
    pleasing his no doubt respectable cadre of core followers, but handily turning off the rest of humanity.
    Seriously, dude, put your pants back on.</p></div>"|3738.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3738-the-handler/|1.9|Johnny Loftus

    Gelb's been living here for years.  Both as a prolific solo artist and with his long-running combo Giant
    Sand, Gelb has created a fascinating and meandering series of footprints across the landscape.  His work
    has never acknowledged any borders that might theoretically exist between mariachi waltzes, psychedelic
    guitar rock, uptown piano jazz, or dusty improvised C&amp;W; and without squinting much, one can easily discern
    reverberations of his travels in such freewheeling roots-conscious acts as Califone, Jackie-O Motherfucker
    or even in the more countrified moments of Sunburned Hand of the Man.</p><p>
<i>Giant Sand Is All Over the Map</i> is roughly Giant Sand's 53rd album, give or take an authorized bootleg
    or five, but it's the group's first record of original material since 2000's elegiac <i>Chore of Enchantment</i>.
    (The entertaining but uneven cover album <i>Cover Magazine</i> appeared in 2002.)  The album's title-- a
    phrase which has undoubtedly appeared in dozens of Giant Sand reviews over the years, maybe even including
    some written by me-- is here intended literally, as these songs were recorded at various locations around
    the globe with the assistance of one-time PJ Harvey collaborator John Parish.</p><p>
    
    The biggest and most obvious change here is the departure of the group's longtime rhythm section of bassist
    Joey Burns and drummer John Convertino, who have left to focus on their work as Calexico. One can't help but
    notice the loss of two such subtle and dexterous instrumentalists, but Gelb takes their absence in full
    stride.  I can't say for certain whether or not it's due to the exit of his former bandmates, but something
    has certainly got him all riled up here.  Throughout the album, he sounds as ornery as javelina in an undersized
    cage, and the result is some of the rowdiest Giant Sand music since the near-grunge of 1992's <i>Center of
    the Universe</i>.</p><p>
    
    The opening acoustic shuffle ""Classico"" sounds restrained enough until suddenly Gelb kicks his boots up on
    the piano and lets fly an electric guitar solo that sounds like miles of abandoned telegraph wire getting
    shredded by a twister.  This apparently puts the taste of blood in his mouth, because he then proceeds to
    lead the (predominantly European) ensemble through some of Giant Sand's most satisfying Crazy Horse-derived
    rockers ever, in the form of ""NYC of Time"", ""Flying Around the Sun at Remarkable Speed"" and ""Remote"", which
    features bone-rattling back-up yowls from Scout Niblett.  The record even includes an appropriately chaotic
    take on ""Anarchy in the U.K."" (here titled ""Anarchistic Bolshevistic Cowboy Bundle"") with charmingly
    imperfect vocals supplied by Gelb's daughter.</p><p>
    
    However, it wouldn't be much of a Giant Sand album if they just stuck to the main road, and as usual, they
    don't. Side trips here include the cowboy poker parlor instrumental ""Rag"", the Latin-tinged bolero of ""Napoli""
    and the sardonic narrative of ""Hood (View from a Heidelberg Hotel)"" which finds Gelb wittily tormenting the
    maids of a hotel who ""mostly can't pronounce its name.""  (You've also got to wonder whether he's addressing
    Calexico on this track when he sings, ""The way I'm feeling about the brotherhood/ Has me feeling down and
    up/ To no good."")</p><p>
    
    Some of these digressions occasionally cross the line and simply become irritants, particularly if you're
    someone who wishes that Gelb could just once give us a linear trail to follow.  But Giant Sand has always
    been about the journey rather than the destination, and I for one am certainly not going to begrudge Gelb
    his ambition to spread his distinctive style of American weirdness worldwide.</p></div>"|3445.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3445-is-all-over-the-map/|8.3|Matthew Murphy

It's devastating to watch the disease
    take its snowballing toll, as the faces around her become less familiar, and recent events fail to take hold.
    It's as though her memories are being erased in reverse order, leaving only her childhood.  The disease also
    eventually robs the sufferer of contemporary coherence, as sentences unravel before they've had a chance to
    even come together, which makes it all the more fascinating that she remembers, with astonishing thoroughness,
    the words and melodies to hundreds of popular songs from her youth and is able to sing them clearly and
    accurately.  The music she grew up with was certainly memorable-- the AABA forms and gracefully sculpted
    melodies of the Gershwin and Porter songbooks, Tin Pan Alley showtunes, traditional hymns and Vaudeville
    numbers-- but that it's remained with her even as everything else fades never ceases to amaze me.</p><p>
    
    The thing I've noticed about most of the songs she sings is that the words themselves aren't particularly
    memorable-- it's actually the melodies that give them weight in her mind.  Indeed, many of the words might
    have even been interchangeable with other verses set to the same music back in the day, and who remembers
    words on their own terms?  The average person could likely sing you hundreds of songs, but how many Tennyson
    and Byron or even Ogden Nash poems do think they could recite on command?  I don't think it's any secret that
    good melodies make mundane words ring somehow more meaningful with us-- check ""Yesterday"" for a good example--
    but the fact is still endlessly fascinating.</p><p>
    
    Since we've mentioned The Beatles, we might as well steer this thing where it's ultimately going, to an
    obvious disciple of theirs, one Chris Richards, a Canadian power-pop practitioner who makes especially
    good use of the power of melody to carry words that wouldn't read well on a page deep into our psychological
    recesses.   Take ""Don't Forget About Love"", for instance, which is a damn fine, sing-along-the-first-time
    heap of harmonies and ringing guitars that manages to make a line like this seem life-affirming: ""Can't you
    see?/ Woo hoo hoo/ Baby's with me.""  Is it the way Richards' nasal voice draws out the first syllable of
    ""baby"" that makes it work so well?  The way the subtle backward guitars squirm just under the surface?  Is
    ""who cares?"" an acceptable answer?  Because I'm just excited that it works, and Richards sounds like he is,
    too.</p><p>
    
    Aside from a clutch of 13 knockout melodies and harmonies sweeter than dried mango, it's little things like
    that downplayed wash of backward guitar on ""Don't Forget About Love"" that really elevate <i>Mystery Spot</i>
    beyond a possible fate as just another Killer B's (think Beatles, Beach Boys, Byrds, Burrito Brothers...)
    homage.  The whole album sounds great, in fact, the production ringing with clarity, but not overdone or
    slick.  Richards backs up every rubber cement vocal with a catchy guitar part, and the tandem is tastefully
    backed by understated backing by a small cast of skilled friends.  The opening pair of songs are two of the
    most ingratiating, as opener ""Is There Anybody Else?"" sinks its hooks in immediately with a charging guitar
    riff and backs it up with a massive chorus.</p><p>
    
    Really, though, the quality is pretty uniform across the album, and though almost all of it-- including the
    pedal steel-tinged ballads-- could be easily summed up with references to ringing guitars, buoyant harmonies,
    killer hooks and infectious energy, that doesn't give proper credit to how well the songs are differentiated
    and how memorable each is on its own terms.  Indeed, Richards has been incubating these songs for quite some
    time now, and his patience makes for one cherry bomb of a debut.</p><p>
    
    On return trips from visiting grandma
    Kuzmickus, I sometimes wonder what songs from my youthful halcyon days I'll be able to sing for my grandkids
    one day, and just how ridiculous a cappella renditions of ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" and ""Get Out of My Dreams
    (Get Into My Car)"" will sound.  I'm not saying Chris Richards is Cole Porter or even close, but it's not too
    hard to imagine ""Your First Mistake"" or ""Gracefully"" standing up in the memory banks even as other things
    fade, and on a record like this, that's the highest compliment.</p></div>"|6927.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6927-mystery-spot/|7.3|Joe Tangari

    choruses anymore, but have rather entered into your own experience.  This doesn't always happen, of course;
    generally only in something you've given yourself a chance to digest, perhaps heard a few times on the way
    to school or work, at the computer or as you sit on the train with nothing better to distract your eyes than
    the backdrop of other people as they're consumed with something totally apart from the song you're hearing.
    This place, your experience, is different from the one initiated by music because the meaning of its words
    and implied direction of its strains are less inherently meaningful than they are impressionistic suggestions
    for whatever is most meaningful to you.  I've read how this is supposed to happen all the time, but I think
    it's rarer than that.</p><p>
    
    Birmingham, UK duo George specializes in music that triggers the hyper-subjective experience for me (and a
    few others): Their 2003 full-length debut, <i>The Magic Lantern</i>, sneaked into Pitchfork's Top 50 albums
    list, and found a place in the hearts of folks I once called the ""midnight romantics,"" saving their most
    intense confessionals for the hour furthest from contact with any other person.  Suzy Mangion and Michael
    Varity make music with guitar, old organs and any percussion you can play with just your hands, and come
    out sounding less twee-poppers than Salvation Army hymn leaders.  Mangion's vocals are gentle, with an
    earthy timbre suited perfectly for singing homemade arias on the front porch; when she fills the back of
    George's songs with harmonies, I strain to find words other than ""angelic"" and ""graceful"" because they've
    already been hastily applied to less deserving singers.  They're good words for her.</p><p>
<i>All Good Things</i> is a four-song EP released on the small Spanish label Lejos.  Its brief runtime
    necessarily prohibits it from working up the same wistful, dew-covered conceits as <i>The Magic Lantern</i>,
    though its most engaging moments would have fit nicely into that record.  The opener ""Wait"" is the best:
    Beginning with Varity's guitar arpeggio, moving in what Leonard Cohen once described as the ""major lift""
    and a ""minor fall,"" Mangion enters with a soft solo vocal describing a being who looks down from the clouds
    as the rain falls on people who would be wise to find shelter.  Her protagonist is spreading ""gloom too
    soon/ 'Too soon,' they said,"" though during the chorus, as her own backing vocals drench the song just as
    the rain in her story does, she finds ""wives giving shelter"" and laments not being able to do more than
    watch the rain come down.  Were I looking for a narrative obviously applicable to myself, I'd be out of
    luck.  Were I looking for a beautiful piece of music, I'd have found it.</p><p>
    
    Varity takes the lead on ""My Blue Room"", a melancholy take on Brian Wilson's brand of bedroom symphony.  His
    vocals are thinner than Mangion's, but the track succeeds on the strength of its modest use of organ, tambourine
    and sleigh bells in Wilson's style, and a vocal arrangement that recalls the Beach Boys, albeit simplified to
    suit George's considerably more modest presentation.  There's also a brief instrumental, ""Man Taking a Stroll""
    (apparently starring clip-clip percussion as the man), and another short song, ""For the Last Time"", that ends
    the EP on a down note, moving forward in dirge-like fashion under its weighty church organ and Mangion's
    whisper-vocals.</p><p>
    
    Practically speaking, <i>All Good Things</i> is a stopgap.  Fans will certainly want more, and I'd advise
    anyone unfamiliar with the band to start with <i>The Magic Lantern</i>.  However, George's strengths are
    clear here, and my own reaction follows suit.  The hidden place, where expression becomes impression and
    the outside world folds inward, is still here.</p></div>"|3621.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3621-all-good-things-ep/|7.0|Dominique Leone

The Seattle-based hybrid group, known for absurd
    song and album titles that suggest a playful imagination rarely evidenced in their music, have maintained
    indie rock prominence for a little over three years, with only one proper album (2002's <i>Highly Refined
    Pirates</i>) and two previous EPs to justify their existence.  Their musical development is practically
    nonexistent-- the group's spacey, synth-spiked brand of hypercharged guitar rock has remained basically
    unchanged for years.  With no more material than Sufjan Stevens could muster in a week, or Robert Pollard
    in 12 minutes, the band has still built a substantial following.</p><p>
    
    On <i>They Make Beer Commercials Like This</i>, Minus the Bear expands its sound somewhat from its characteristic
    quasi-prog guitar noodling, embracing a more diverse sonic palette, from the punchy electrobeat post-punk of
    ""Fine and 2 Pts."" to the <i>Change</i>-era D-Plan emulation of ""Let's Play Clowns"". But Jake Snider, singing
    in his typical low-key deadpan, pretty much sums things up on the disc's opening track: ""Our basic program
    is the same.""  The band's precise dual guitar work and complex but unobtrusive choruses are strikingly similar
    to the music on the band's other releases.</p><p>
    
    The EP's best tracks avoid easy pigeonholing.  ""Dog Park"" establishes a distinctive verse consisting of airy
    synths and a meticulous repeating guitar pattern before dissolving into a reverb-drenched keyboard interlude,
    then doubling back into an animated chorus.  ""Pony Up"" overcomes its ponderous lyrics (""how can we claim that
    we know ourselves"") with some of the record's most compelling musical arrangements.  A few simple mixing tricks,
    like acoustic and electric guitar patterns pushed to opposite stereo channels, or the following channel-to-channel
    crash-pan of a rapid-fire guitar riff, are fairly obvious but nonetheless effectively dizzying sonic gimmicks.</p><p>
    
    The most ludicrously titled tracks are, perhaps counter-intuitively, also the least memorable.  ""I'm Totally
    Not Down with Rob's Alien"" immediately meanders with a pair of go-nowhere guitar figures that resemble Incubus'
    sludgy, shapeless alt-rock, while ""Hey! Is That a Ninja Up There?"" seems to have expended all its cleverness
    on its title.  The track is an indistinct muddle of weak guitar hooks, irritating sweeping synth tones, and
    tedious vocal melodies.  The shifting time signature initially distinguishes the track, but the song goes in
    too many directions and eventually splinters.</p><p>
    
    The prevalence of so much filler on a six-song EP is discouraging, and marks this EP as just another
    placeholder in a career long sustained primarily by placeholder EPs.  The disc effortlessly slips into
    Minus the Bear's modest discography, but shows about as much progression in the band's career as beer
    commercials have shown in the proliferation of women's rights.</p></div>"|5325.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5325-they-make-beer-commercials-like-this-ep/|6.4|David Moore

    full-length from Omaha new-wavers-gone-goth-rockers The Faint, is a hyperkinetic and confused soundtrack
    for wanderlusted, deficient attention spans, suffering from enough overactive production flourishes and
    inexplicable instrumental touches to obliterate the band's addictive dance jams.  So pick up your scattered
    crayons, kids, and sharpen their tips against the walls.  The Faint share your unfocused consciousness and
    are ready to commiserate.</p><p>
    
    The Faint's last release, <i>Danse Macabre</i>, was a tenfold leap beyond its synth-pop predecessor, 1999's
    <i>Blank Wave Arcade</i>; the band's decision to target the techno-goth introvert in us all, rather than to
    further embrace the wider appeal of 1980s retro-futurism, made clear that they cared not one whit for their
    audience's expectations.  And yet, even considering that album's novelties, few could likely have predicted
    the level of bewilderment that lies in store on <i>Wet from Birth</i>.</p><p>
    
    Almost all traces of the band's early new-waving are gone; rather, The Faint gorge themselves on synthesized
    strings and junkyard static, while limber dance-bass struggles in vain to retain any semblance of low-end
    against the harsh treble of their production's greasy, Plasticine coating.  The experimentation feels forced
    from the outset: On opener ""Desperate Guys"", a mounting string section (the album's most prevalent and
    unnecessary addition) slams headfirst into caustic bass-waves before Todd Baechle's signature wire-sharpened
    vocals join the pulse.  Simply busying up an otherwise very straightforward groove, these effects add little
    to the song, and in fact seem to serve no purpose other than to provide some transparent veneer of forced
    artiness.  Here, for the first time, it feels as though The Faint have lost faith in their previous strengths.</p><p>
    
    ""Southern Belles in London Sing"", too, falls victim to mismatched instrumentation.  Subtle horns creak from
    enveloping static before becoming lost in an overbearing string arrangement.  Its rugged, Depeche Mode-esque
    bassline gives way to rapturous Siren singers in one of the album's great what-the-fuck moments, adding one
    more cacophonous element to a song already suffocating in density.</p><p>
    
    Though more tightly arranged, ""Erection"" and closer ""Birth"" make the unforgivable mistake of calling attention
    to Baechle's horrendous lyrics.  The results are two bona fide contenders for worst song of the year, and
    could find themselves in a lonely race.  Limited to a bug-zapping bass and mechanized handclaps, ""Erection""
    never builds from its repetitive drone, instead buzzing shapelessly for nearly three minutes as a bawdy
    in-joke.  Rough-riding on an anarchist's punch of muddy guitars and doomsday percussion, ""Birth"" opens
    with the observation, ""In the beginning, there was semen,"" before dishing still more tired shock-value
    imagery and finally arriving at, ""I should have noticed the beauty/ And not how it hurt/ Wet like a cherry/
    In the blood-bath of birth.""  Yes, we get it.  Unfortunately, Baechle's grin can't excuse his trite Reznorisms.</p><p>
    
    The real misfortune is that these hyperactive misfires hide <i>Wet from Birth</i>'s central joys.  When not
    indulging in childish grossout humor or overstuffing their tracks with studio gimmickry, The Faint still
    prove powerful songsmiths.  The more stripped, simpler tracks here-- those scraped reasonably clean of
    tangential instrumentation and kitchen-sink decoys (""How Could I Forget"", ""Phone Call"", ""Paranoiattack"")--
    rank among their best work.  Indeed, beneath their frenzied effects and miswired production sense, they
    still chronicle America's black-lit dancemare and exhume the cheap thrills of 80s synth-pop with the best
    in their field.  Their mistake is in forcing too many ideas into every possible second, and that kind of
    overstimulation always ends the same way: Faint, say hello to the time-out corner.</p></div>"|2952.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2952-wet-from-birth/|5.5|Derek Miller

    had never met, or even spoke on the phone.  Making their acquaintance on the webboards at Okayplayer, the
    two took The Postal Service's album-by-correspondence technique to heart: Nicolay instant messaged beats to
    Phonte, who dropped verses, and then the Holland native mastered the product.  The result, <i>Connected</i>,
    is a sweltering, improbable 14-track symphony teeming with potent lyricism and subtle, lustrous rhythmatics.</p><p>
    
    In today's hip-hop landscape, the organic and emotive qualities of classic soul are often bastardized (cf.
    Jagged Edge) but rarely duplicated.  To wit: In its Hit Factory days, Motown churned out classics faster
    than Beanie Sigel garners arrest warrants.  So either Nicolay is a musical genius who simply understands
    the language of classic R&amp;B; better than most stateside producers, or a Stax Records jetliner crashed in
    the Netherlands, spilling thousands of LPs on his thatched abode when he was a toe-tapping toddler.</p><p>
    
    ""The Foreign Exchange Title Theme"" kicks <i>Connected</i> off with a syncopated harmony, while the welcoming
    voice of D.C.'s YahZarah wafts, ""Thank you for the music, thank you for right now.""  That ""right now"" bit
    is telling, too, as the record revels in the glory of the moment: Urgent, immediate, instant gratification
    is one of <i>Connected</i>'s calling cards.  ""Nic's Groove"", for example, is equipped with sleepy brass,
    delicious harmonies and a booming bassline.  It's like standing in the street during 5 minutes of the
    dopest house party you weren't invited to-- and when you dare to peek in the window, Nicolay hits his apex
    on ""The Answer"", bowling the crowd over with an ephemeral thunder while Oddisee, Ken Starr, and Phonte rock
    the crowd, the latter claiming, ""I applied for the job of rap nigga, but I was overqualified.""</p><p>
    
    But <i>Connected</i> is more than fluid construction and a unique backstory.  Embedded in the layered vocal
    arrangements and popping rhythms are the seeds of a quiet rebellion.  While crews like Mash Out Posse or
    Cocoa Brovaz may alienate newcomers with the furious intensity of their experiences, The Foreign Exchange
    delivers their triumphs and tragedies with silky surreptitiousness.  <i>Connected</i> reads like the diary
    of the young, black hip-hop hopeful, as Phonte reminds us of the thousands of struggling MCs who sit in the
    shadow of <i>The Source</i>.  He walks us through his money woes on ""Happiness"" (""Writing mad checks that
    might as well have 'Spalding' on them""), his girlfriend's pregnancy on ""Be Alright"" (""My girl was throwing
    up this morning/ I pray it was something she ate""), and his parents' disapproval of his life on ""All That
    You Are"" (""They can't understand how I feel when I'm on the track board turning the knob switch/ My moms
    keep talking like get a real job shit"").</p><p>
    
    Despite The Foreign Exchange's transatlantic relationship, the record's stripped-down approach is reminiscent of
    the days when kids hijacked streetlamps to power their block party turntables.  Amazingly, this album seamlessly
    flows without not only that street-level intimacy but without even the assistance of a shared studio.  The
    result is enough to make the most heartbroken cynics fall in love with independent hip-hop all over again.</p></div>"|3321.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3321-connected/|8.6|Jamin Warren

    yearn for a time before the cataclysm, when things were brighter and people knew how to party.  And in order
    to quench that yearning, the people will turn to the Nostalgialator, a great machine on treads perhaps
    constructed from melted plastic soldiers that brings the sounds and sensations of the past to the huddled
    masses.  Watch it, though: It occasionally snaps and sucks off history's sugarcoat to reveal what that time
    was really like.  If I gather correctly, this is the general conceptual arc along which hip-hop's strangest
    operator, Mike Ladd, has designed his first three solo albums.  It's almost as awesomely pretentious as his
    concurrent trilogy revolving around the struggles between the underground Infesticons and mainstream Majesticons.</p><p>
<i>Nostalgialator</i> is constructed in two halves, the first stuffed with interstellar electrofunk for the
    party at the end of the universe, the second a downtempo chill session that presumably signals a malfunction
    in the titular machine.  It groans to life with a collage of smooth beats, swelling crowd noise, coughing
    synths and barely intelligible shoutouts from the stage called ""Dire Straits Play Nuremburg"", and the air
    already feels charged with electricity.  Ladd flexes every muscle he has over the next 40 minutes, Bollywood
    horns blasting at the corners, sound sweeping into great, kinetic waves as Ladd raps, croons, speaks like
    the mental offspring of Gil-Scott Heron, shouts, and cranks up his falsetto.</p><p>
    
    He works that odd, scratchy falsetto on the spacey R&amp;B; single ""Housewives at Play"", mingling with the
    slinking synths and thumping beat and a De la Soul-ish breakdown that repeats itself into an echoing wah
    guitar figure that's positively out of this world.  His background playing in punk bands comes to the fore
    on ""Wild Out Day"", a frenetic blast of Mumbai hardcore that kicks Minor Threat in the face with a cartoon
    horn break while Ladd loses his shit barking out the verses.  The album flips in head-spinning fashion
    through British Invasion guitar breaks, organic drum explosions, crunching electro, and Ladd's slippery
    raps, the best of which might be ""Black Orientalist"", with its tumbling cadence, his viscous voice flirting
    with melody and teasing words into referential tangles to mince and mix Vietnam, colonialism, the war on
    terrorism, and black identity into a single, sweeping blur.</p><p>
    
    The album's second half flows with Ladd's stream of consciousness, as he waxes Gil-Scott on the title track
    in a swirling analog texture with a meditation on Ben Franklin and electricity: ""He discarded letters and
    chess for fire from clouds/ Delving in the games of gods, basking in new decadence beyond women in Paris
    and the death of Indians/ Something supernatural/ The harnessing of energy.""  Ladd's knack for imagery is
    breathtaking, as he spreads Franklin, ""thunderstruck junkie, fiend for sky crack,"" across history into the
    board room of ComEd and the wallet of the consumer dropping their check for the electric bill in the mail.
    The instrumental ""How Electricity Really Works"" takes this shift away from the first half's funkiness into
    extreme realms, mimicking 20th century classical music and ambivalent soundtrack music.  But it's the closer,
    ""Sail Away Ladies (Traditional)"", that takes Ladd furthest from the man we know, as he croons in a milky
    baritone over a sort of sci-fi country &amp; western backing.</p><p>
    
    By this point, the whole <i>Nostalgialator</i> concept has been swept clean aside by the wave of Ladd's
    21st Century musical assault, and that's perfectly fine-- the last thing I'd want to hear him do is
    compromise his mastery of wordplay and sonic trickery in the name of advancing some arcane plot.  As much
    as Ladd continually references the past, from Dr. Livingston and Picasso to Minor Threat, Funkadelic, and
    De La Soul, he moves the air with a beat that's entirely his own, the sum of too many parts to reflect any
    one too prominently, and his perceived role as a prankster on the sideline of hip-hop doesn't do his
    innovation or skill any justice.  <i>Nostalgialator</i> closes the book on an epic cycle of three loosely
    linked albums, and I can't wait to see what crazy glue seeps out of Ladd's head to hold together the next
    series.</p></div>"|4623.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4623-nostalgialator/|8.3|Joe Tangari

He's dazzled by the sudden appreciation his music is getting.""  Of course, it's all     Prater's doing.  Sure, acoustic guitarist Estribou recorded the Grateful Dead and released their first     single in 1965.  But that's hardly enough to keep the man on even the most detailed of musical maps, let     alone earn a dazzling level of popularity.</p>
<p>Jean-Paul Pickens is also one of popular music's many footnotes, a banjoist in Bay Area poet David Meltzer's     psych/folk-rock outfit Serpent Power, who could claim to be among the pioneers of Hindi modes-meets-Western     pop ""raga-folk.""  But that's a boast that could also be made by John Fahey or Sandy Bull or Robbie Basho--     all of whom worked at nearly the same time as, and were more innovative than, Pickens.  And so it follows     that <i>Intensifications</i>, Estribou and Pickens' split LP of solo improvised instrumentals, fell by the     wayside.</p>
<p><i>Intensifications</i> is not and never was groundbreaking-- even at its most extreme, the improvisations     are still relatively normal given the Basho-weirdo benchmark.  But the album <i>is</i> solid, and, amidst the     current free-folk love affair, is certainly relevant and worthy of its remastering, re-release, and     reconsideration.</p>
<p>To an extent, improvised solo instrumentals are less about a song and more about the player's technical     ability, so showboating factors heavily into one's appreciation of these virtuosic displays.  And despite     the album's split nature, Estribou and Pickens complement each other well.  Estribou's conceits are     primarily tonal and less rhythmic.  The raga opener, ""You Know, the One You Played Saturday Night"",     is somewhat dogmatic, beginning high and ghostly before settling into breezy strums and high noon modal     ebbing.  Slide picks and Delta blues licks dominate Estribou's tense double-plucked meanderings on ""Amalgam"",     whereas ""Metathanks"" seems decidedly more guilt-free, structured and countrified.  Estribou's last cut,     ""Eeee Minor"", is at once his most musically and rhythmically energetic piece, as he carefully fits his     most abrasive dissonances alongside dactylic jitter.</p>
<p>Pickens' portion of the record smokes from the start.  On ""Coo Coo Bird"", Pickens begins with a wash of     strings before launching into some swift and hyper-rhythmic but still remarkably melodic Americana banjo.     Burner ""Shady Grows"" sounds like a Celtic woodwind ditty performed at <i>Rescue Ranger</i> speeds, albeit     also with a high degree of melodic retention.  And the sprawling ""G.R."" is Pickens' answer to the variety     of playing styles Estribou displays on ""Eeee Minor"", as he places non-gimmicky rubato one-liners between     dense, swift packets of terrific strumming.  In a fictitious world where virtuoso folk guitarists contest     for title belts, ""G.R."" would cinch Pickens' victory over Estribou.  But there's no need for a grudge match     here: <i>Intensifications</i> features impressive performance from both artists.</p></div>"|2905.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2905-intensifications-with-jean-paul-pickens/|7.5|Nick Sylvester

    Schematic, Beta Bodega, and Rice &amp; Beans.  <i>Miad</i>, its compilation of predominately Miami artists,
    succeeds as a solid primer to a fertile scene, yet much of its music is so derivative that regional
    significance is rather moot-- it could've been mistaken for either an international compilation or a
    bootleg of Kid606 and AFX B-sides.</p><p>
    
    Regionalism has never much mattered to music whose software is the
    same regardless of locale, but increasingly generic elements are in full effect here: tweaked frequencies,
    drum machines falling down 20 flights of stairs, microtones and vocals time-stretched to a drill, and
    kiddie-Nintendo melodies ironically superimposed on hip-hop and jungle beats all schtuped-up before
    getting too placid.  Fortunately, most of the tracks still amuse.</p><p>
<i>Miad</i> opens with the brief, digital rainfall of Duster's ""Intro"", which drifts asleep and forgets
    its name by the time Captain Marmalade's ""Finding Out That You're in Love in the Seventh Grade"" kicks in,
    pitting a struggling novice drummer with a sweetened synth ballad.  The momentum picks up with Clapan's
    ""Shopping Cart Rmx"", which employs the same synth patch but chirps along to a classic Miami bass jaunt
    while Osiris takes such jeep beats to their self-immolating logic.  Xanopticon turns out crack-addled
    jungle on ""Retrn"", inviting Venetian Snares to a gentlemen's duel-- a good show that leaves only a few
    droplets of blood on the floor.</p><p>
    
    Meggablockx, meanwhile, baffles with ""Angel"", a downtempo ballad garnished with a synth-pop hook reminiscent
    of the <i>Reading Rainbow</i> theme, accompanied by snippets of what seems to be a LSD-laced bride reciting
    her vows at a new-age wedding.  Subjex's ""Subslaughter"" is fine, coagulated glitch-hop, while his remix of
    Phoenecia's ""Can Recall"" is spiced with moribund jungle beats and demonic crickets that hide in the bushes
    outside your house.  However, Cliquetpar is the standout with ""Elico in the Sea"", featuring Childisc's
    Elico Suzuki enjoying choral orgasms over stoopid, algorithm-abusing drill 'n' bass.</p><p>
<i>Miad</i>'s major misfires come with Beatwife's ""Random Bass Pach"", which seems to be a re-titled
    <i>Richard D. James Album</i> outtake, and Duster's ""Outro"", which is absolute filler, a 19-minute
    interval of silence before blurting a snippet from a death-metal demo tape.  'Tis a fine moment's grace
    of ironic pluck, but pretending to enjoy this piece to demonstrate your hipster credentials might lose
    you friends.  Now this is subversion.  Welcome aboard, Somia.</p></div>"|2053.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2053-miad/|6.9|Cameron Macdonald

Its protagonist,
    Andrew Largeman, has popped Prozac, Zoloft, and a whole smorgasbord of mood-altering and -enhancing medicines
    for most of his life, all prescribed by his well-meaning psychiatrist father.  These drugs allow both men
    to overlook the central tragedy in their family-- the accident that left Andrew's mother paralyzed-- but as
    a consequence, Andrew is never able to experience the emotions that he comes to realize comprise an identity.
    When he takes ecstasy at a party, it only disconnects him further from himself and others.</p><p>
    
    Scoring this trip is ""In the Waiting Line"" by Zero 7, which sounds exactly how Hollywood thinks a drug trip
    sounds: languid, midtempo beat; sampled sitar; vaguely psychedelic atmosphere; and what sounds like a bong
    hit during the bridge. As partygoers try to talk to Andrew and he begins to question his experience, Sophie
    Barker sings, ""Everyone's saying different things to me.../ Do you believe what you see?"" It's an overly
    obviously choice, as is much of this soundtrack.  On one hand, these 13 tracks, all of which are available
    on other albums or compilations, seem genuinely to be music the characters would pick to soundtrack their
    lives.  On the other, the songs all tend to comment too directly and too blatantly on their situations and
    motivations.  For a movie that manages to locate subtle humor and pathos in its visuals (all those shots of
    Braff standing square in the center of the frame, as if looking into a mirror), <i>Garden State</i> lets
    the music do too much work.</p><p>
    
    Coldplay's ""Don't Panic"", with its universal chorus (""We live in a beautiful world""), scores an early scene
    in which Andrew is driving to work amid all the maddening traffic of Los Angeles.  This use is plainly ironic,
    but still work better here than it did in <i>Igby Goes Down</i>, where its earnestness was overkill.  Nick
    Drake's ""One of These Things First"", however, speaks all too clearly to Andrew's identity problems: ""I could
    have been a sailor/ I could have been a cook/ A real live lover/ Could have been a book.""  And the film's
    final song, Frou Frou's ""Let Go"", buzzes trippily to its chorus, ""There's beauty in the breakdown,"" but its
    title and lyrics could have been written expressly for the movie's anti-drug message.</p><p>
    
    For <i>Garden State</i>, drugs are clearly not the key to a better life; Natalie Portman is.  Barring that,
    try music.  ""They'll change your life,"" Portman's character, Sam, remarks of The Shins as she passes Andrew
    a pair of headphones playing ""New Slang"".  She's almost right.  The Shins' two tracks on <i>Garden
    State</i> (including ""Caring Is Creepy"") are both recreational and medicinal: Drawing on 20 years of college,
    alternative, and indie rock, they are musically playful and subtle enough to be emotional Rorschach tests--
    each listener will draw a slightly different shade of meaning from them.</p><p>
    
    Similarly, the soundtrack's best songs are those that don't have such a direct connection to the story, that
    could have come randomly on the radio and just happen to fit the scene.  Braff makes good use of tracks by
    Remy Zero, Thievery Corporation, and former Men at Work singer Colin Hay, whose song ""I Just Don't Think I'll
    Ever Get Over You"" is a surprisingly effective barroom lament.</p><p>
    
    When Andrew and Samantha have their first kiss (after literally screaming into the abyss, another testament
    to the movie's lack of subtlety), Simon &amp; Garfunkel's ""The Only Living Boy in New York"" blares out of nowhere.
    It could be a sly nod to <i>The Graduate</i>, to which <i>Garden State</i> has been compared, but the song
    communicates a few very particular ideas about loneliness and connection without ever overstating them.  Later,
    Iron &amp; Wine's cover of The Postal Service's ""Such Great Heights"" plays as the camera pans slowly up the length
    of a bed to show Andrew spooning post-coitally with Sam.  Sam Beam slows down the tempo and substitutes only
    his guitar for Jimmy Tamborello's beats, in the process turning Ben Gibbard's whimsical, sometimes saccharine
    lyrics into soft-focus images that unfold patiently and tenderly.  Because its lyrics have little do with
    the action on the screen and its music supports the mood, Braff has created through character and image,
    ""Such Great Heights"" may be the most evocative song on the soundtrack-- refurbishing an upbeat song that
    sounds like a public declaration of love's exclusivity, this version sounds more like a whispered, consoling
    promise.</p><p>
    
    Perhaps due to the movie's basis in Braff's New Jersey childhood, or to some kind of film debut jitters,
    <i>Garden State</i> the movie tends to overexplain its characters' motivations, as if they're not already
    apparent in the images and performances.  The final 10 minutes, for example, could have been shot with no
    dialogue at all, and not only would the meaning have still come across, it might have even had more impact.
    <i>Garden State</i> the soundtrack similarly spells out its intentions all too clearly, leaving little to
    the viewer/listener's imagination.  The songs may be memorable-- some of them may even change your life--
    but as a soundtrack for a movie that barely needs any music to convey its message, they end up being
    something less than their sum.</p></div>"|7891.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7891-garden-state/|7.0|Stephen M. Deusner

    operations spun off from that multi-limbed Montreal-based behemoth.  And, as has been the case with other
    branch offices like Set Fire to Flames, Do Make Say Think, or A Silver Mt. Zion, Fly Pan Am have experienced
    some difficulty establishing an identity distinct from their parent organization.  Due primarily to Tellier-Craig's
    instantly recognizable playing style, the angular instrumental art-funk that predominated the group's first
    two albums too often resembled a pared-back, less engaging GYBE!</p><p>
    But that all changes dramatically on <i>N'Ecoutez Pas</i> (which, unless my pidgin French has failed me,
    translates to ""Don't Listen"".)  Here, on their third full-length, Fly Pan Am complete a Black Dice-caliber
    personality shift, abandoning all previous formulae and pushing their sound outward in all directions.  For
    the first time, they incorporate vocals into their attack along with an unruly array of electronics,
    keyboards, and field recordings-- all of which results in their finest and most fully realized work to
    date.</p><p>
    The album is erected around the twin pillars of ""Autunt Zig-Zag"" and ""Trés Trés Retro"", two 11-minute
    showpieces that give Fly Pan Am enough elbow room to flex their suddenly considerable Krautrock-nourished
    muscles over massive hunks of terrain.  ""Zig-Zag"" is Fly Pan Am's noisiest and perhaps best piece yet,
    combining layers of hissing electronics with a wriggling edifice of distorted guitar worthy of My Bloody
    Valentine, all while garbled voices whisper and conspire malevolently.  In French, no less.  Eventually, the
    fog lifts enough to reveal the charred tree stumps that pass by your railcar window as countless little
    bug-sized motors chug away ineffectually.</p><p>
    ""Trés Trés Retro"" is a somewhat simpler affair, and its stuttering drums and hypnotic, loping bass hearken
    back to Fly Pan Am's 1999 debut, on which they dabbled extensively with minimalism and the beauty of repetition
    (most memorably when Tellier-Craig at one point plucked the same simple chord repeatedly for over 10 minutes).
    Here, though, the band gives the rhythm section plenty of traffic to weave through, with blinking stoplight
    keyboards and strange cut-up vocal edits constantly emerging to ensure that you don't get too mesmerized by
    that centerline.</p><p>
    The shorter tracks assembled around these two epics are something of a motley bunch, though impressive in
    their scope and variety.  The handsomely dissonant opener ""Br\xFBlez Suivant, Suivante!"" brings Fly Pan Am
    about as close to conventional song structure as they've ever been, calling to mind <i>Evol</i>-era Sonic
    Youth.  The jagged, muttering ""Pas à Pas Step Until"" should cause Boredoms fans to crane their necks.  Less
    successful are brief electronic morsels like ""Buvez Nos Larmes de Métal"" (translation: ""Drink Our Metal
    Tears"") or the burbling, appropriately titled ""..."" which, at best, functions as a palate cleanser.</p><p>
    So while <i>N'Ecoutez Pas</i> might not be the most consistent record you'll ever hear, at its best it finds
    Fly Pan Am approaching peaks of intensity and ragged splendor that few bands even acknowledge, let alone
    attempt to scale. Even better is that the whole thing is too damaged sounding to even remotely resemble
    GY!BE: For the first time, Fly Pan Am soar on their own wings.</p></div>"|3121.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3121-necoutez-pas/|8.0|Matthew Murphy

They're going for
    a cohesively conceptualized oeuvre: a pulpy sci-fi epic serialized to music.  The latest Fingathing LP picks
    up where they left off in the most literal sense imaginable: Not only does it continue to fine tune and
    flesh out their glitchy astral-funk, it resumes the intergalactic adventure yarn that's been unfolding over
    the course of their entire career.</p><p>
    
    After faking their deaths at the end of their last record, our heroes are racing through space in metal
    coffins on a collision course with the sun.  Of course, en route to their true demise, Parker and Sneak
    slip through a rift in the space-time continuum (in the genre of sci-fi that Fingathing pay lip service
    to, space and time seem to rend as easily and frequently as cheap nylons) and wind up in The Red Nebula.
    And that's just in the first track, ""Walk in Space"".  With the homage to the <em>Star Wars</em> cantina band
    on its cover, its unabashedly kitschy geek-chic concept, and its blend of twitchy IDM, instrumental hip-hop,
    and gaudy sound effects, <em>Fingathing and the Big Red Nebula Band</em> seem born for anime kids, suburban
    B-boys, and <i>Adult Swim</i> message boarders.  It's funk as a musical metaphor for escapist fantasy,
    rather than for sex.</p><p>
    
    Not that the concept is so distinctly discernible from the songs.  I'm not sure how one would glean that
    the bombastic, vocoded club cut ""Walk in Space"", which plays like a crunk M83, has anything to do
    with space coffins and inter-dimensional travel without access to the album's press release.  Besides some
    diced up one-liners like ""walk in space"" and ""it looks great up here"" that serve more as rhythmic fodder
    than narrative devices, there's no inkling of the storyline. </p><p>
    
    Except that once you <em>know</em>, it's a soundtrack for careening through space, which you might figure out
    by diligently studying the mural in the liner notes with pictures illustrating the action each track
    represents, the concept dovetails so seamlessly with the music that it seems plain as day.  As ""Walk in
    Space"" shucks and jives through sinuous keyboard lines, syncopated drums, sweeping synthetic strings, and
    elastic bass, hairpin-turning on picturesque breakbeats, one can vividly imagine peering though a porthole
    as the cosmos rockets by, exploding with supernovas, seething with varicolored vapors, whirling with
    galaxies. </p><p>
    
    The pattern holds for the remainder of the album: The concept is imperceptible from the songs, yet makes
    intuitive sense regarding them when you're aware of it.  ""Reanimo"", in which a giant robot of the same name
    frees Fingathing from their coffins, is a grimy, minimal bounce track of Neptunes-baiting electro soul with
    shifting permutations of snap and drone.  The shambling ""Open a Door"" is less rigid than the preceding tracks:
    90 seconds of clangorous noise, deep throbs, and mounting solar winds.  It rolls without a hitch into the
    fluid, Morricone-meets-Boards of Canada shimmy of ""Themes from the Big Red"".  Also worth noting are the
    prog-hop alarum ""Rock the Whole Planet"", the amped-up death march ""Big Bang"", and the weepy, orchestral
    suite of ""Music to Watch Aliens By"".</p><p>
<em>Fingathing and the Big Red Nebula Band</em> closes with the sleek and triumphant bravado of ""Return to
    Earth"", a more soothing space muzak to bear Parker and Sneaky home.  The thread will surely be picked up,
    however obliquely, in the next installment of Fingathing's interplanetary romp.  The American release of
    the record also includes a bonus disc called <em>Time Capsule</em>, a collection of five songs culled form
    their <em>Main Event</em> and <em>Superhero Music</em> LPs, which evince a more traditional instrumental
    hip-hop style and emphasize the major leaps in technical proficiency, spacious production, genre
    variegation, and sheer propulsive force Fingathing has achieved.  The story remains the same-- wildly
    improbable and allusively rendered-- but the music has inflated and deepened in a manner befitting the
    giant robots, imploding planets, and freaky cast of thousands it contains.</p></div>"|3320.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3320-fingathing-and-the-big-red-nebula-band/|7.8|Brian Howe

    foundation of stern concrete dirges and black-holed soundwaves.  Bands like Low and Slowdive have to work
    that much harder to wedge distinguishable characteristics into their sound given that the genre's glacier-paced
    dynamics allow for much less melodic wiggle room.  The destinations for a slowcore song are limited: Blissful
    transcendence and candlelit gloom can coincide for only so long before they dissolve into <i>Requiem for a
    Dream</i>, all hopping-refrigerators and funereal paranoia.  At least with garage rock or three-chord teenie-punk,
    you give the people what they want: Melodic anthems to shout along with in the Zippo-light.  Slowcore's dank,
    dark niche is the sole place the music even finds voice, and there are only so many Rorschach reads in the
    void.</p><p>
    
    Steadily, former BYU grads Aaron and Adrienne Snow, the married couple that forms the core of ethereal
    quartet Landing, have released four decent, if unspectacular, albums of waxy soundscapes that fit quite
    cozily in the genre.  For better or worse, their fifth record (and second for K), <i>Sphere</i>, finds
    them treading the same tepid water.  Subdued beats and lunar synth washes paint these 10 tracks shades of
    empty space.  They ask only to subside into their meandering guitar lines and Jetson-streaked atmospherics,
    leaving nary a trace of their passing.</p><p>
    
    A quick look at the track titles, autumnal claims like ""Fluency of Colors"", ""Into Silence"" and ""Gravitational""
    provide an apt summary of the album's desired effect.  Still, these multitudinous names are misleading; more
    appropriate would have been a single epithet and 10 roman numerals, as the uniformity here leads to its generally
    anemic quality.  Most of the tracks seem content to wallpaper your Sunday mornings, as you sift through the
    smoky split-ends of your Saturday night and free your thoughts for pre-coffee tasklessness.  Little is
    required of you, and even the subtle tensions offered by Landing have the feel of microwave warmth: crisp,
    mechanical and perfect for auto-defrosting.</p><p>
    
    In the few places where the listener is jarred out of his relative ambivalence, the music gurgles up beyond
    its vague, ritualistic glow to form gauzy imprints on the surroundings.  The aforementioned ""Fluency of
    Colors"" opens with toothpicked drumbeats and chiming electric guitars, deftly mounting into an epic
    lead-off.  As it sputters out into an acoustic-guitar stroll, the song captures the wandering excitement
    of a city recovering from blackout and streaming into the streets to revel in the rare comfort of dark
    hours.  Sadly, the album fails to live up to its insistent desires.</p><p>
    
    Along similar lines, on ""Filament"", Adrienne Snow's warm voice subtly collides with its stumble-drunk drums
    and aspirined synths to provide rarified atmosphere from a work that seeks just that.  As Snow's Siren-drift
    distills itself into the song's vibrating guitars, it's one of the few moments where Landing seems to fully
    understand that there must be some return from escape, that something must tug you back from spaceless jamming
    to ground you against the psychic drone.</p><p>
    
    By the end, it's clear that <i>Sphere</i> is ably managed if not particularly accomplished.  As leaves curl
    yellow and the air sours grey, fall will cool into a time for the year's wistful contemplation.  Landing is
    willing to streak this period with the appropriate violet hues and entombed daylight if you give them a
    chance.  But take them up on their offer, and you may quickly understand the solemnity of summer's failed
    growth.</p></div>"|4673.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4673-sphere/|5.8|Derek Miller

Back in
    the fabled early days of The Replacements, his abundant songwriting skills always shone brightest whenever
    his audience was most justified in expecting a full-fledged drunken implosion.  However, things went south
    for Paul once listeners began to recognize his genius and demand that he fulfill it by delivering unto us a
    tour de force, or at the very least a big record with hit singles.  Record companies got into the act and
    threw him huge recording budgets and trips to the studio with the likes of Don Was, and our man buckled and
    began to poop out lifeless mediocrities like <em>Don't Tell a Soul</em> or <em>Eventually</em>.</p><p>
    So in a way it was only too predictable what would happen after the commercial and artistic nadir of 1999's
    <em>Suicaine Gratifaction</em> chased off the remnants of his audience.  With nobody listening and all pressure
    lifted, he went down to his basement and reclaimed his mojo on 2002's unvarnished double <em>Stereo/Mono</em>
    release and hasn't looked back since.</p><p>
    Perhaps in part to further minimize the demands put on each individual album, Westerberg is now following
    one of Bob Pollard's most cherished songwriting axioms: If you can't always dazzle them with brilliance,
    stupefy them with productivity.  (The idea being that it's a lot easier to forgive the occasional ""Silver
    Naked Ladies"" if you haven't waited three years to hear it.)  <em>Folker</em> is Paul's fifth album of new
    material in the last two years, which is more output than he managed in the preceding 10.
    </p><p>
    Adhering closely to the formula established on <em>Stereo</em>, the album again finds Westerberg all alone
    down in the rec room, muffing lyrics, gloriously airmailing guitar solos, playing the drums like he's doing
    the dishes, and generally having a fine time.  In fact, there are moments when <em>Folker</em> reaches
    <em>Vampire on Titus</em> depths of fidelity, which probably qualifies it as his sloppiest recording yet,
    Grandpaboy or no.  By now, though, we've all learned that if a Westerberg tune can't cut it in this
    environment, there's no amount of studio polish that'd have been able to fix it anyway.
    </p>
<p>
    Things get off to an inauspicious start, with the banal one-note joke ""Jingle"" (""Buy it now, buy it now/
    This is my single/ This is my jingle"") lasting at least twice as long as necessary despite its one-minute
    runtime.  Thankfully, Westerberg recovers to settle into a nice hitting streak, bashing through effortlessly
    catchy songs like ""Looking Up in Heaven"" and the very GBV-ish ""As Far as I Know"" with an ease seldom
    heard since ""Waitress in the Sky"".
    </p>
<p>
    There's a disarming simplicity and artlessness to these and other highlights like ""23 Years Ago"" and ""Gun
    Shy"", with an increased emphasis on persistent pop melody over crafty wordplay.  This is fortunate since
    <em>Folker</em> is not Paul's strongest effort lyrically, with the quotable gems (""Bring a thimble and I'll
    pour my thoughts out"") just barely outnumbering the groaners (""I promise not to bug you/ Only just to hug
    you."")
    </p>
<p>
    That's not to say the album is entirely without thematic heft.  On the contrary, the album's emotional
    centerpiece is ""My Dad"", a tribute to Westerberg's recently deceased father that stands among the most
    nakedly heartfelt he's ever written.  In hands less deft, a number like this could've become unbearably
    maudlin, but Westerberg's wry humor and painterly eye for detail (""He's never seen me play/ But he gets
    a kick from the newspaper/ When he sees the family name"") make it a stirring and poignant elegy, and when
    it closes with him repeating, ""My dad I love,"" it should bring a lump to the throat of even the most jaded
    ironyhound.
    </p>
<p>
    Not even Westerberg's classic albums have been free of filler (unless you can honestly say you still get a
    kick out of ""Gary's Got a Boner"") and <em>Folker</em> has its fair allotment of pointless misfires like ""$100
    Bride"", with its unfortunate chorus of, ""I promise not to leave the room/ Even if I've gotta vomit.""  It's
    tracks like this one that'll drive you insane if you're deluded enough to think that Paul still has that
    flawless masterpiece in him somewhere.  But if you've resigned yourself to the fact that we're always going
    to have to accept his periodic pearls of brilliance with a healthy side portion of flies in the sherbet,
    <em>Folker</em> should meet and possibly even exceed your expectations.
    </p>

    Through 2000's debut, <i>The New Song and Dance LP</i> and 2001's ""Dance to the Underground"" 12-inch, Radio
    4 followed their neo-Clash/Gang of Four tendencies into a more indie-danceable context, and it just about
    worked.  Meshies dropped ""Radio 4"" in the same breath as The Rapture and !!!, and none of them were shocked
    when the band asked the DFA to produce their sophomore effort.  The first half of <i>Gotham!</i> showcased
    the band's live energy with smart but spare embellishments, and preserved the grassroots vitriol that gave
    at least some credence to their incendiary political lyrics.  The second half, however, felt like an afterthought:
    Its production is noticeably heavier on what are infinitely less compelling songs, as the DFA frantically
    lipstick and sunglass Bernie Lomax to conceal the album's rigor mortis.</p><p>
    
    Despite it all, Astralwerks signed the band in 2003.  Most would think Radio 4 would use this budget upgrade
    to trudge up some fresh material-- by now it had been two years since the band recorded <i>Gotham!</i>-- but
    they still couldn't muster the energy.  Instead, we got the <i>Electrify</i> EP, which included a barely
    distinctive re-recording of 2001's ""Dance to the Underground"", and 6 consistently awful remixes.  Radio 4
    had written itself in water: That quickly, they'd become has-beens, and from there, any headway made would
    go toward reclaiming lost ground.</p><p>
<i>Stealing of a Nation</i> is the polar opposite of monumental.  Its 12 songs brutally follow the modus
    operandi of <i>Electrify</i>, in that all are simply thinly disguised re-recordings of ""Dance to the
    Underground""-- each more obscene than the next.  What's worse, the band doesn't have the indie-dance acumen
    of James Murphy and Tim Goldsworthy to fall back on anymore: Instead, there's Martin ""Max"" Heyes, whose dated
    Primal Screamisms drown out the band's already feeble melodies and political agenda.  Radio 4 can be commended
    for at least trying to move past the purposeful lo-fi of <i>Gotham!</i> and into fresher territory, but
    there's no bell or whistle in the world that could energize the utterly impotent songs at the core of
    <i>Stealing of a Nation</i>.</p><p>
    
    While Radio 4 whine about bands moving to New York for the wrong reasons (The Scene!) on album single and
    opener ""Party Crashers"", the band crashes a party themselves-- the pilled 'n' thrilled, screamadelic one
    across the pond that's been shut down for 13 years.  The change of direction is not at all accidental--
    even the title <i>Stealing of a Nation</i> aligns the band with New Order (who recorded both ""State of the
    Nation"" and ""Shame of the Nation"") and all of Manchester's post-New Order antics-- but come on, does every
    song after ""Party Crashers"" have to rip Happy Mondays' ""God's Cop"" and Primal Scream's ""Don't Fight It,
    Feel It"", too?</p><p>
    
    Of course, the similarities between Radio 4 and producer Max Heyes' previous clients would be a less pressing
    issue if the band had any charisma whatsoever.  It's difficult enough for frontman Anthony Roman to convincingly
    rally the troops against The Man and The Machine on ""(Give Me All of Your) Money"" and when his voice is swaddled
    in the purple robes of high-gloss production, but his lazy three-note melodies couldn't even start a lunchroom
    food fight.  Meanwhile, guitarist Tommy Williams and keyboardist Gerard Garone trade equally malnourished
    riffs on 9/11-by-numbers ""State of Alert"", and Heyes' insistence on the drum machine on ""Transmission"" and
    ""The Death of American Radio"" keeps live drummer Greg Collins from contributing anything more than a credit
    in the liners.</p><p>
    
    Two songs that Radio 4 intended as clear homage to their influences only further indict <i>Stealing of a Nation</i>.
    ""Nation"", which the band openly modeled in sound, political agenda, and track placement (right in the middle)
    after The Clash's ""Straight to Hell"" on <i>Combat Rock</i>, neatly reiterates all of <i>Stealing of a
    Nation</i>'s shortcomings, from Heyes' outmoded soundboards to Roman's unconvincing, merely observational
    politics to the entire band's inability to write remotely compelling melodies.</p><p>
    
    And then, right before the aptly titled closer ""Coming Up Empty"", Radio 4 dub-stomps with unusual swagger
    through ""Dismiss the Sound"" with unmistakable similarity to ""Albatross"" by Public Image, Ltd., from whose
    song (""Radio 4"") the band takes its name.  But of course, Roman hardly skims the depth of Johnny Lydon's
    conviction, and Radio 4 sells off PiL's atonal confession for glitzy and insubstantial chorus effects.
    Like the rest of the album, the song's slickly produced fancy face also becomes its muzzle, robbing Radio
    4 of any bite it could have had.  <i>Stealing of a Nation</i> truly has nothing to offer musically, nor
    does Radio 4 urge anything of note politically, sticking to the trite ""America Is Fucked!"" hogwash that
    any seventh grader with a blog and a dial-up could piss out in an afternoon.  Never has a band been so
    undeserving of its own name.</p></div>"|6651.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6651-stealing-of-a-nation/|2.1|Nick Sylvester

<p>Ours is a generation overwhelmed by frustration, unrest, dread, and tragedy.  Fear is wholly pervasive in     American society, but we manage nonetheless to build our defenses in subtle ways-- we scoff at arbitrary,     color-coded ""threat"" levels; we receive our information from comedians and laugh at politicians.  Upon the     turn of the 21st century, we have come to know our isolation well.  Our self-imposed solitude renders us     politically and spiritually inert, but rather than take steps to heal our emotional and existential wounds,     we have chosen to revel in them.  We consume the affected martyrdom of our purported idols and spit it back     in mocking defiance.  We forget that ""emo"" was once derived from emotion, and that in our buying and selling     of personal pain, or the cynical approximation of it, we feel nothing.</p>
<p>We are not the first, or the last, to be confronted with this dilemma.  David Byrne famously asked a variation     on the question that opens this review, and in doing so suggested a type of universal disaffection synonymous     with drowning.  And so The Arcade Fire asks the question again, but with a crucial distinction: The pain of     Win Butler and Régine Chassagne, the enigmatic husband-and-wife songwriting force behind the band, is not     merely metaphorical, nor is it defeatist.  They tread water in Byrne's ambivalence because they have known     real, blinding pain, and they have overcome it in a way that is both tangible and accessible.  Their search     for salvation in the midst of real chaos is ours; their eventual catharsis is part of our continual     enlightenment.</p>
<p>The years leading up to the recording of <i>Funeral</i> were marked with death.  Chassagne's grandmother     passed away in June of 2003, Butler's grandfather in March of 2004, and bandmate Richard Parry's aunt the     following month.  These songs demonstrate a collective subliminal recognition of the powerful but oddly     distanced pain that follows the death of an aging loved one.  <i>Funeral</i> evokes sickness and death,     but also understanding and renewal; childlike mystification, but also the impending coldness of maturity.     The recurring motif of a non-specific ""neighborhood"" suggests the supportive bonds of family and community,     but most of its lyrical imagery is overpoweringly desolate.</p>
<p>""Neighborhood #1 (Tunnels)"" is a sumptuously theatrical opener-- the gentle hum of an organ, undulating     strings, and repetition of a simple piano figure suggest the discreet unveiling of an epic.  Butler, in a     bold voice that wavers with the force of raw, unspoken emotion, introduces his neighborhood.  The scene is     tragic: As a young man's parents weep in the next room, he secretly escapes to meet his girlfriend in the     town square, where they naively plan an ""adult"" future that, in the haze of adolescence, is barely comprehensible     to them.  Their only respite from their shared uncertainty and remoteness exists in the memories of friends     and parents.</p>
<p>The following songs draw upon the tone and sentiment of ""Tunnels"" as an abstract mission statement.  The     conventionally rock-oriented ""Neighborhood #2 (Laika)"" is a second-hand account of one individual's struggle     to overcome an introverted sense of suicidal desperation.  The lyrics superficially suggest a theme of     middle-class alienation, but avoid literal allusion to a suburban wasteland-- one defining characteristic     of the album, in fact, is the all-encompassing scope of its conceptual neighborhoods.  The urban clatter of     Butler's adopted hometown of Montreal can be felt in the foreboding streetlights and shadows of ""Une Annee Sans Lumiere"",     while Chassagne's evocative illustration of her homeland (on ""Haiti"", the country her parents fled in the     1960s) is both distantly exotic and starkly violent, perfectly evoking a nation in turmoil.</p>
<p>""Neighborhood #3 (Power Out)"" is a shimmering, audacious anthem that combines a driving pop beat, ominous     guitar assault, and sprightly glockenspiel decoration into a passionate, fist-pumping album manifesto.  The     fluidity of the song's construction is mesmerizing, and the cohesion of Butler's poignant assertion of     exasperation (""I went out into the night/ I went out to pick a fight with anyone"") and his emotional call     to arms (""The power's out in the heart of man/ Take it from your heart/ Put it in your hand""), distinguishes     the song as the album's towering centerpiece.</p>
<p>Even in its darkest moments, <i>Funeral</i> exudes an empowering positivity.  Slow-burning ballad ""Crown of     Love"" is an expression of lovesick guilt that perpetually crescendos until the track unexpectedly explodes     into a dance section, still soaked in the melodrama of weeping strings; the song's psychological despair     gives way to a purely physical catharsis.  The anthemic momentum of ""Rebellion (Lies)"" counterbalances     Butler's plaintive appeal for survival at death's door, and there is liberation in his admittance of life's     inevitable transience.  ""In the Backseat"" explores a common phenomenon-- a love of backseat window-gazing,     inextricably linked to an intense fear of driving-- that ultimately suggests a conclusive optimism through     ongoing self-examination.  ""I've been learning to drive my whole life,"" Chassagne sings, as the album's     acoustic majesty finally recedes and relinquishes.</p>
<p>So long as we're unable or unwilling to fully recognize the healing aspect of embracing honest emotion in     popular music, we will always approach the sincerity of an album like <i>Funeral</i> from a clinical distance.     Still, that it's so easy to embrace this album's operatic proclamation of love and redemption speaks to the     scope of The Arcade Fire's vision.  It's taken perhaps too long for us to reach this point where an album is     at last capable of completely and successfully restoring the tainted phrase ""emotional"" to its true origin.     Dissecting how we got here now seems unimportant.  It's simply comforting to know that we finally have     arrived.</p></div>"|452.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/452-funeral/|9.7|David Moore

Mmm,
    okay, not exactly striking, but consider it; while acts from Iceland, France, or Japan are gladly filed under
    ""rock,"" most modern artists from the Southern hemisphere are relegated to the rarely visited ""world music""
    category.   There, they're paired with the folk and field recordings, where they're not too apt to receive
    the foreign aid of a customer's purchase.  There's something a little imperialist about filing away the
    attempts of ""third-world"" artists who mix rock with their own language and indigenous musics, while keeping
    Paul Simon's <i>Graceland</i> in full stock.  And though some releases, such as the <i>Putamayo</i>
    compilations (proposed motto: ""Tastefully ethnic for the upscale eclectic"") are happy to play into the
    sense of exoticism this division engenders, an artist like Caetano Veloso is well past due for some greater
    recognition.</p><p>
    Handed the reins of popular Brazilian music from bossa nova godfather João Gilberto in the 60s, Caetano
    Veloso and lifelong friend Gilberto Gil founded the revolutionary ""tropicalismo"" movement, bringing
    influences of psychedelic rock, garage, and art-music into their still distinctly Brazilian songwriting.
    Since then, Veloso has continued to expand his musical influences and worldwide recognition.  He has
    remained creative and vital in a way that's escaped most aging Western rockers, avoiding the trappings of
    ego as his popularity has grown.  In relation to his cultural role and import, he's been dubbed the ""Bob
    Dylan of Brazil.""</p><p>
    Of course, that comparison begs a few differences.  For one, though they're only a year apart in age, Veloso
    still appears respectable while Dylan bears an eerie resemblance to The Abominable Dr. Phibes.  For another,
    as Zimmerman returned to a Greenwich loft after singing his tales of poetry and upheaval, Veloso was writing
    them while under house arrest in 1968, imprisoned and censored by Brazil's then-military dictatorship for
    his subversive lyrics, musical experimentation and general encouragement of bohemian/hippie ways.  It can
    be hard to imagine that such a light melodicism as Veloso's could have been considered dangerous, but he
    writes from a cultural tradition that pairs lyrics of revolution and struggle with, to western ears,
    innocuous grooves.  Along with Gil, the popular Veloso was exiled in '69, living in London and expanding
    his musical language until his return home in '72.</p><p>
    The ""definitive"" collection of such a prolific, globetrotting artist is inevitably going to be shaped by an
    availability of materials, as copyrights are sure to be held by a multitude of parties in various countries.
    Last year, Nonesuch attempted to compile <i>The Best of Caetano Veloso</i>, complete with liner notes
    predictably contributed by a certain pale, wide-eyed man whose name rhymes with ""Mavid Fyrne.""  While a
    solid collection, it borrows heavily from Veloso's recent, easily accessed Nonesuch releases, with no
    representations of his revolutionary early sound.  <i>Antologia: 69-03</i> is a more career-spanning
    two-disc set (up until now only available as an import) which offers an admirably comprehensive representation
    of the artist's phases and styles.</p><p>
<i>Antologia</i> nods to Veloso's history of cross-Atlanticism in placing his beautiful cover of Italian
    Nina Rota's ""Que Nao Se Ve"" as its opening track.  The piece highlights an oft-overlooked facet of Veloso's
    musicality: So much emphasis is put on his brilliant songwriting that it's easy to forget what an excellent
    and subtle performer he is, as demonstrated here in his gentle falsetto.  Throughout his career, Veloso has
    worked in styles ranging from avant-garde tape experimentation to Afropop, and rather than taking a
    chronological approach, <i>Antologia</i> demonstrates his eclecticity in its sometimes jarring leaps of
    style.</p><p>
    Disc One throws together dramatic choral interludes, pieces of syncopated 60s rock, and more
    traditional works that gesture back toward bossa nova.  Veloso sings often about politics, but never fails
    to take the emotional and aesthetic angle on such topics, humanism trumping ideology.  The popular ""Haiti"",
    from his celebratory 1993 collaboration with Gil, <i>Tropicalia 2</i>, combines subdued, dark spoken word
    that points to the aesthetics of political unrest and life in the Haitian ghetto with a beautiful, sleepy
    chorus.</p><p>
    The tracks of Disc Two are even more uniformly excellent, highlighting Veloso's most adventurous side.  ""De
    Palavra Em Palavra"", is built from multitracked backwards voices and throat sounds a la Luciano Berio; ""Doideca""
    is a dissonant ballad halfway between samba and Schoenberg; and ""Tonda de Luna Llena"" sounds like a piece of
    Philip Glass opera with rhythmic accompaniment.  Veloso's arrangement skills are on display in the fantastically
    orchestrated, compact ""Enquanto O Lobo Nao Vem"", while the song ""Maria Bethania"", named for his sister and
    collaborator, is a propulsive English-sung ballad that ends in a slew of nonsense syllabics and strings.
    And one of the collection's highlights is Veloso's sparse, syncopated version of Michael Jackson's ""Billie
    Jean"", a cover surpassing even Devo's ""Satisfaction"" in so totally reinventing its subject.</p><p>
    Many of the best tracks on <i>Antologia</i> are Veloso's solo acoustic songs, where the tranquil surface of
    his gentle melodies belies musical waters as deep as the listener chooses-- Veloso makes musical complexity
    sound simple, and philosophy sound beautiful.  <i>Antologia</i> demonstrates how cognizant he has remained
    of North American and European music over the years, thoughtfully considering the methods and consequences
    involved in evoking dual cultural influences.  This album introduces listeners not only to the artist's
    prodigious output, but to a worldview in which the cross-cultural melding of styles is so natural as to be
    unconscious.</p></div>"|8430.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8430-antologia-69-03/|8.9|Liam Singer

Well-paced and
    cleverly sequenced, it is, in many ways, a throwback to the great records of the 1970s, and fresh enough not
    to sound like one.  Y'see, the album is a tough thing to perfect, and few bands really ever develop the
    consistency and variety necessary to flesh one out properly-- to make a record you'll want to hear in its
    entirety-- which makes the fact that this is The Citizens' first shot all the more impressive.</p><p>
    
    Opener ""What's Happening at the Seams"" puts the band's best foot forward.  It's a dramatic melody swelling
    in fields of reverb, the band doing their best to create an Eno/Lanois sense of largeness around the song's
    tightly rhythmic arrangement.  The track also lays out several of the band's general strengths, from their
    keen sense of dynamic tension to keyboardist/vocalist Mark Lesseraux's high, soulful tenor.  It's followed
    by one of the album's several rambunctious pop tunes.  ""Blusher"", with its oohing backup vocals, melodic
    bassline and insanely catchy hooks wrapped around oddball lines like, ""Sally got smacked with a blue knapsack/
    Just before she passed out from blood loss and boredom,"" is an avalanche of melody, the best of the songs
    that follow the band's power-pop muse.</p><p>
    
    The other uptempo songs run the gamut from raw, brash rock 'n' roll like ""Catch You on the Way Down"" to
    twisted, vulcanized boogie like ""In B for Backward"", which shifts meters and grooves with near-Dadaist
    abandon, as if John Bollinger's drums were a raucous blast from the 1920s.  However, the meat of the album
    isn't comprised of those songs.  Instead, it's built on a backbone of sweeping ballads, a strategy that
    sinks a lot of albums.  Fortunately, The Citizens largely avoid the pitfalls, mostly because Lesseraux can
    sing his ass off and isn't afraid to do it.  For evidence, look no further than the keening chorus of
    ""Kaleidoscope (Do You Recall?)"", on which he brings the high honey as the band constructs a desert expanse
    around him.</p><p>
    
    The Citizens have some obvious jazz and cabaret references, and most of their other ballads play to them in
    one way or another.  ""Deck Full of Jokers"" is listless and heaving, sounding like the band has kept on playing
    well into the night after the doors have closed and the audience has gone home with stray snare hits falling
    arrhythmically, guitars squeezing out ugly notes as violins play mock fanfares in the deep background.  Lesseraux
    trades verses with guest Felicity Fenton on ""You Might Be Right"", with the two sharing a haunting melody
    over creaky acoustic guitars.</p><p>
    
    But then, <i>Are We There Yet?</i> does have a few problems-- ""Clementine"" just doesn't kick into gear quickly
    enough, the spoken vocals on ""Mussolini's First Crush"" are a bit awkward, and of course, there's that regrettable
    cover photo (love the hats, though).  On the whole, though, this is an extremely solid debut by a band with
    all of its pieces very well in place.  If they can stick it out, it's easy to imagine them achieving great
    things.</p></div>"|1779.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1779-are-we-there-yet/|7.9|Joe Tangari

    from a more objective standpoint.  Moving Units were, in fact, there from the beginning.  That is, the Los
    Angeles trio started making danceable post-punk way back in 2001, before ""House of Jealous Lovers"" was
    helping turn any Brooklyn dive bar willing to buck the Cabaret Laws into a slapdash club.  But while Moving
    Units' style falls in close proximity to their brethren, they've always managed to exude a more anachronistic
    vibe.</p><p>
<i>Dangerous Dreams</i> is dance-punk, simple and unabashed, and the album wins points for its sincerity.
    Opener ""Submission"" thrives on understated vocals (Nic Offer take note) and facile mixing.  If anything,
    the band owe more to jam rock than the DFA in both their instrumentation and recording techniques, avoiding
    excessive digital adornments and laying down loose, man-made grooves.  ""Going for Adds"" follows a similar
    tack, dry-heaving angular guitar riffs over an accommodating bassline.  Again, each instrument is performed
    live and the song is seemingly unalloyed by digital processing or other tinkering.</p><p>
    But this approach can wear tiresome, as the ensuing 10 tracks prove.  Texturally, the group only does so
    much with their stabbing rhythmic guitars and faux-slapbass grooves, and most of the time their melodies
    aren't strong enough to sustain the monotonous instrumental tracks and lack of textural variety.  By
    comparison, !!! are vastly more successful at creating and sustaining intrigue through an insatiable
    penchant for sonic experimentation.  ""Hello? Is This Thing On?"" may be static for the majority of its
    7\xBD-minute runtime, but its devolution into a placid synth build behind Offer's discomfiting caterwauls is
    a refreshing take on the genre's increasingly rigid standards.  By contrast, Moving Units are dishearteningly
    buttoned-up and their bass-heavy romps quickly lose their vigor and grow oppressive.</p><p>
    Of these 12 songs, only on ""Between Us and Them"" do Moving Units churn out an indelible pop hook. Sadly,
    it's the album's sole glimmer of emotion.  And choruses like ""Emancipation""'s ""You control me/ I'm your
    slave"" will probably never sound sweet without at least a tinge of irony.  <i>Dangerous Dreams</i> is
    plagued by a pervasive feeling of been there/done that, and the album ultimately sounds like the same two
    or three tracks on repeat.  Moving Units may not be directly responsible for dance-punk's fustiness, but
    they can't help but suffer from it.</p></div>"|5606.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5606-dangerous-dreams/|5.8|Sam Ubl

    division (a recognized and surprisingly competitive weight class), they've got a whole field of challengers
    to fend off.  I'm thinking primarily of me, the critic, looking to measure their latest effort against its
    vaunted predecessors, counting the faults, tallying the improvements, making a decision.  But the band has
    garnered a sizable fanbase indifferent to prior allegiances-- mud-caked Bonnaroo jam fans, NPR-driven
    blues boosters, and fist-pumping hard rock loyalists have all been trampled under The Black Keys'
    roots-chewing corduroy stomp.  So really, it makes little difference what I have to say; most of you
    have already decided these guys are the real deal.  Those who haven't, however, can rest assured that,
    in judging The Black Keys' budding discography, <i>Rubber Factory</i> beats their previous two by TKO.</p><p>
    
    That's because it picks up right where <i>Thickfreakness</i> left off-- outside the bar in the gravel parking
    lot, swinging aggressively with Dan Auerbach's ferocious six-string and Patrick Carney's cymbal-and-snare
    seizures-- and brings the noise one step further.  There's more of an album feel to <i>Rubber Factory</i>,
    a conscious song-by-song progression rather than the visceral, overwhelming vibe that forged their debut,
    <i>The Big Come Up</i>, into a seething wrecking ball.  When Auerbach settles down with a lap steel on ""The
    Lengths"", it's no mere diversion-- there's true conviction behind his country blues balladry.  In its rosy
    tenderness, ""The Lengths"" is the biggest departure from the band's studied template.  Auerbach sings, ""Please
    yourself/ You don't have to be afraid,"" and it seems obvious he's convincing himself that he and Carney have
    carved out a niche deep enough they can break out of it with confidence to deliver something totally unexpected
    and achingly sweet.</p><p>
    
    ""The Lengths"" isn't the album's only curveball-- The Kinks cover ""Act Nice and Gentle"" finds The Black Keys
    tuning into the FM side of the dial.  Where Ray Davies' original is twangy, sugary pop, The Black Keys give
    it a honky-tonk swing, as Auerback plies the slide and Carney's fireworks fade to a gentle sizzle.  ""Grown
    So Ugly"" is a tragic prison blues penned by Robert Pete Williams and covered in the 1970s by Captain Beefheart.
    Auerbach tears into the standard with typical grit, but halfway through, pulls back into a short-lived vocal
    break that merits his position in the Fat Possum pantheon.</p><p>
    
    Those three tunes stand out as impressive tangents that skillfully mediate the rest of the album's oldtime
    Black Keys thunder.  Songs like ""Stack Shot Billy"" and ""Girl Is on My Mind"" show the memorable songwriting
    that made <i>Thickfreakness</i> a standout.  ""When the Lights Go Out"" opens <i>Rubber Factory</i> with a
    Bonham-esque bass pulse and an ominously pealing guitar, while closer ""Till I Get My Way"" lays one line of
    primitive Auerbach distortion over another more genteel melody until the two eventually swim together beneath
    Carney's splashy cymbal work.</p><p>
    
    And then there's ""10 A.M. Automatic"", <i>Rubber Factory</i>'s first single and easily one of the most
    radio-ready indie anthems of the year, next to Modest Mouse's ""Float On"".  It's the song most likely to
    show up in a Guy Ritchie flick next summer, a cool-as-fuck, hormone-laced dose of rock 'n' roll ecstasy.
    Here, Auerbach's voice attains that archetypal blues fever that induced the birth of rock 50 years ago;
    melody and rhythm mesh into a primal force that's raw and pure.</p><p>
    
    The Black Keys have consistently sought to keep their distance from modern blues, calling themselves a rock
    band above anything else.  But we all know the blues resides at the core of rock 'n' roll.  <i>Rubber Factory</i>
    sways back and forth almost imperceptibly between the two idioms, revitalizing the essence of both.</p></div>"|767.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/767-rubber-factory/|8.3|Jonathan Zwickel

    motorbike: Ladies and gentlemen and Kung Fu Ramone, put your fists in the air for Tokyo's own Guitar Wolf.</p><p>
    
    And with that, the commotion begins anew.  Returning from 2003's <i>UFO Romantics</i>, Guitar Wolf whips up
    <i>Loverock</i>, their latest bout of cement-cutter gutter-rock.  Their site awesomely refers to the unit
    as ""Japanese Greatest 'Jet' Rock 'N' Roll Band,"" a description which is deadeye accurate, since it illustrates
    the flair in Japan's popular culture for attaching heaps of haughty cool onto seemingly normal or even
    played-out things.  Alyssa Milano and fanatical kiddy toy trends aside, Japanese music often finds an eminently
    workable intangible at the delta where the traditional meets the confessional.</p><p>
    
    Behind his guitar and sweaty
    microphone, Seiji's denim-leather-and-sunglasses look is far less than new: It's even older than his band's
    revved up Ramonesabilly freakery.  But on <i>Loverock</i>, the sound again seems fresh and vital, from the
    glorious power chords and craptone recording of ""Demon Card"" to ""Blood Splashed Sky""'s unhinged bass guitar
    rumble.  Remember how cool Carl Perkins fanatic Masatoshi Nagase looked in <i>Mystery Train</i>?  Is it any
    surprise that noted style whore Quentin Tarantino tapped The 5678s' twitchy Cramps camp for <i>Kill Bill,
    Vol. 1</i>?  Everyone knows the truth: American signifiers are just cooler in Japanese hands.  And that hand
    is curled into devil's horns and thrust over the head of the motorcycle hoodlum inside <i>Loverock</i>'s
    cover art heart.</p><p>
    
    There's an argument here for generalized style over fibrous songwriting substance.  Diehards will scoff, but
    <i>Loverock</i>'s 27 hyperactive tracks tend to blend into a long snake howl, singeing the air inside a
    big-busted amp cone.  And anyway, do you <i>want</i> subtlety from three guys who once wrote a song called
    ""Kawasaki ZII750 Rock 'n' Roll""?  That shit's just not made to go slow.  Seiji, Billy, and Toru understand.
    The opening title track features a winning riff, ringing true through the international language of static
    and feedback.  Each spin of ""Jet13"" destroys one copy of <i>Get Born</i>.  This is the sound of un-ironic
    rock, the parallel universe to The Datsuns' market-researched shtick.  Guitar Wolf encourages you to get
    free of that and book a one-way black train ticket to the ack ack love gun smog of ""Katsumiya Tobacco City"".</p><p>
    
    The band does find some time for, er, hooks, particularly on ""Time Machine of Tears"" and the swaggering ""SF
    Tokyo"".  (Somewhere, 800 kids just yelled its chorus.)  But mostly <i>Loverock</i> is what you'd expect:
    bleating, bleeding, and brief blasts of splatter grease and shotgun garage, with a lot of front-end torque
    and little solos that sneak up behind.  (Bass gets into the act, too-- the Bass Wolf/Billy-penned ""Black
    Hawk"" is one of the album's most visceral stretches.) Guitar Wolf have been at this for well over a decade
    and the point of their blade has yet to draw blood, so it figures that there's precision and craft behind
    the creaking, screaming, and trash.  Even when Seiji is at his most psycho-- the reverberating surf 'n'
    psychobilly sleaze of ""Cosmic Space Girl"", for example-- you sense he knows exactly what he's doing.  After
    all, according to band lore, he's the <i>actual</i> Guitar Wolf, the interstellar cave dweller giving lesser
    rock types teeth chattering night terrors.  But he's also a traditionalist, committed to finding the jewels
    that remain in rock's aging chasm, even as the rust flakes and the bad habits keep maligning the damn brand.</p></div>"|3651.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3651-loverock/|7.5|Johnny Loftus

With increasing ease, laptoppers such as M83 and
    Ulrich Schnauss churn out the lush vibes of permanently influential tri-force My Bloody Valentine, Ride,
    and Slowdive, but always fall short of their vitality.  Artists obsess over Kevin Shields' gonzo production
    ethics but forget his equally impressive ear for melody, and without the cherry-colored hooks, shoegaze is
    a land of gimmicks: cute but stupid, talking loud and saying nothing.</p><p>
    
    On last year's <i>Dreams Top Rock</i>, Pluramon (aka Marcus Schnitzler, and a favorite of PFM's dean of
    writers, Mark Richardson) managed a pretty fine balance between traditionally uncompromising shoegaze
    melodies and potentially distractive recourse to iBook'd trickbags.  Mush IDM artist Clue to Kalo debuted
    quietly but promisingly with <i>Come Here When You Sleepwalk</i>, which boasted similar (though less
    successful) attempts at offering shoegaze a legitimate second wind.  Both acts nailed the hooks and
    ambience, but Portland-based quartet Charmparticles is one of the few bands looking to recreate the
    <i>rock</i> energy of early 90s shoegaze.  As on their late 2002 debut, <i>The Scenic</i> EP, the band
    essentially adds nothing new to the genre with their latest <i>Sit Down for Staying</i> EP, but to its
    credit, quenches its nostalgia with some remarkable melody-driven songs.</p><p>
    
    A mammoth guitar solo that comes at the end of ""A/O"" forms a curious midpoint for the <i>Sit Down for
    Staying</i> EP.  Before the solo, songs like ""Sixty-Four"" and ""Stand Up for Leaving"" stick to midtempo
    instrumental pleasantries with little bite, as if to keep listeners focused on Pamela Rooney and Adam
    Wayne's gorgeous vocal melodies.  At times, the chord changes are a tad too predictable to handle such
    bright hooks-- Charmparticles can sound like Coldplay covering The Cocteau Twins covering Coldplay-- but
    for the most part, there's always a passage like the washed introductory drones of ""A/O"" that keeps these
    first few songs from eating themselves.</p><p>
    
    After the solo, Charmparticles rush headlong into riff central.  The crisp, punchy ""Gas Gauge"" benefits
    from Sarah FitzGerald's string of bright ninth strums and drummer Nathanael Merrill's last-second two-beat
    recoil.  ""Solvent"" at first seems a little too alt-rock for its own good, but then Charmparticles strike a
    crunchy, tom-heavy break and a ghostly, single-plucked guitar line whose timbre will surely bear its share
    of Interpol comparisons.  ""Phone and Finder"" and its kind tambourine jangle bring the <i>Sit Down for
    Staying</i> EP full circle, incorporating the lessons of the album's two ""sides.""  It's Charmparticles'
    hardest and softest song to date, on their most ambitious and least ambitious effort to date.  For a band
    that so effortlessly pulls off convincing facsimiles, it's a shame Charmparticles can't muster up a little
    more ambition.</p></div>"|1778.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1778-sit-down-for-staying-ep/|7.0|Nick Sylvester

    a vast selection of custom AOL buddy icons, which could be put up for sale if the Alvin, Texas quartet were
    in a pinch.  The designs are mostly Kid Pix-like in their apathetic simplicity and garish color schemes, but
    at a time when cellphone ringtones are a multi-billion dollar business, there's surely a market for these
    lurking somewhere.</p><p>
    
    For now, By the End of Tonight are more likely to profit from their music.  Instrumental post-rock field
    isn't exactly a lucrative field, but the folks at Temporary Residence have made a run at industry monopolization,
    building a formidable roster of the genre's most prominent slog-rockers.  Joining a fray that already includes
    Explosions in the Sky, Cerberus Shoal, The Anomoanon, and Lumen, By the End of Tonight are set to succeed
    just by dint of good company.  It may help that they play high-energy, low-maintenance variations on established
    post-rock and speed-metal mores that should appeal to fans weary of Explosions' static soundscapes or Lumen's
    proggy grandiosity.</p><p>
<i>Fireworks on Ice</i>, the group's debut EP, is a wildly uneven four-song collection, full of mammoth peaks,
    sheepish lows, fatuous showmanship, and unfettered enthusiasm.  ""Sleeping While Driving Prevents Old Age""
    reconciles two different approaches the band explore individually elsewhere-- slapdash metal and melodic
    post-rock-- and is probably the most accurate representation of where By the End of Tonight are headed with
    their sound.  It's also the album's shortest track, one that underscores the band's mercurial style: For
    nearly three minutes, the song dabbles in transient guises, heavy on competent but confrontational riffs
    that fail to take hold.  Then, feigning exasperation, the band begin to fall apart and fade away before
    coming together again for a transcendent denouement that both surprises and elucidates.</p><p>
    
    It's worth mentioning that drummer Jeff Wilson plays a toy drum set-- not an entry-level knockoff, mind you,
    but the kind of quasi-instrument given as Christmas presents to ignorant toddlers. For such a skilled timekeeper,
    it's unlikely that Wilson chooses to use inferior equipment out of necessity but, though the approach may
    smack of gimmickry, he nevertheless manages to coax powerful beats from his ramshackle cans. More often than
    not, Wilson transcends his limitations, ripping dexterous tom rolls redolent of Billy Cobham in his Mahavishnu
    Orchestra years. Unfortunately, the drums do present a problem on ""Delirious"", a boxy, somewhat shrill piece
    that utilizes spare, dissonant guitar lines. In contrast to other tracks, the band here sound pitifully thin,
    as a surfeit of double bass riffage detracts from the stark guitar interplay, asphyxiating all semblance of
    melody.</p><p>
    
    ""Delirious"" may demonstrate that By the End of Tonight can't always control their impulses, but the rest of
    <i>Fireworks on Ice</i> is full of promise. Least ambiguous of the collection is ""Video Games in the Desert"",
    which is closer in proximity to bands like Converge than By the End of Tonight's Temporary Residence brethren.
    Here, the kickdrum flourishes and the gargantuan tom fills that hinder ""Delirious"" actually complement the
    interlocking guitar melodies, which vacillate between unabashed metal noodling and discordant arpeggios that
    trace directly back to <i>Daydream Nation</i>.  But the unquestionable highlight is the nearly 11-minute
    closer, ""It's Christmas Time Again..."", which owns all the aforementioned qualities and hints at the band's
    fantastic potential.  Unlike the other three songs on the disc, it features less high-wire speed-metal monkeyshine
    and more martial unison maneuvers, monolithic guitar fronts, and agile transitions.  Over the course of three
    distinct movements, it becomes clear that if By the End of Tonight helm their strengths and become more
    forthright with their melodies, they'll be a sure boon to a stagnating post-rock field.</p></div>"|1127.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1127-fireworks-on-ice-ep/|6.7|Sam Ubl

    I didn't understand why you were running for President again this year until I heard Chicago hardcore group
    Rise Against.  Their major-label debut is called <em>Siren Song for the Counter Culture</em>, a title which
    seems to share your present level of subtlety and humility.  As with you, their over-the-top bloviating for
    true believers is matched only by an eagerness to please their new corporate paymasters.  Which reminds me:
    Do you think Ben Stein and his Republican friends could sponsor these guys, too?</p><p>
    
    I'm sure you're already quite familiar with the lineage of punk rock.  Nevertheless, indulge me for a moment.
    My Pitchfork colleague Rob Mitchum once wrote that punk split into two camps: the ""goofy"" punk of Green Day
    and Sum 41, and the political punk of Bad Religion or Propagandhi.  It's a two-party system, see?  That said,
    Rise Against are the Optimus Prime of modern punk, combining the adolescent yearning of Blink-182 with the
    self-righteous snare drums of Minor Threat, or something.  You'll love it!</p><p>
    
    Rise Against are Political!  That much is clear.  You can tell because the first track is called ""State of
    the Union"".  A blistering hardcore number it is, too, with vocals reminiscent of the last time I forgot the
    all-important ""liquor before beer before all-you-can-eat Chinese"" rule.  ""Please secure your place in Hell,""
    one of the band's two singers helpfully puke-sings.  On the next track, ""The First Drop"", Rise Against
    earnestly remind us just how Political they are, with lyrics that always seem to end in exclamation points:
    They scream until their voice is gone! They've had enough! ""Can't you listen to what we have to say?""! I'm
    sure somewhere in there they actually say something, but it's hard to tell.</p><p>
    
    Of course, Rise Against are also Lovers! They can play the wounded adolescent just as skillfully as Saves
    the Day or former Fat Wreck Chords labelmates The Ataris. ""Never have I felt so cold,"" they emote. Since
    you no longer have a party, Mr. Nader, I bet you're feeling lonely, too. You can imagine the sheer catharsis
    of ""Paper Wings"", with its soaring pop/punk chorus over the usual four chords from ""Dammit"". Apparently,
    there's this girl, the train isn't waiting for her, ""and neither am I.""  The cheap teenage anguish is enough
    to make me want to break out my old MxPx records, until the Cheap Trick solo and gratuitous acoustic guitars
    remind me this song must be The Single.  Nothing like greenbacks to wipe away your tears, whether caused by
    the green-eyed monster or just the Green Party.</p><p>
    
    Rise Against are so multi-dimensional they offer a Jars-of-Clay-fronted-by-Gavin-Rossdale moment that proves
    what Chris Carrabba does actually takes talent: ""Swing Life Away"", a drearily unpoetic acoustic weeper about
    minimum wage and holding hands.  How fucking hardcore is that, man?  ""Rumors of My Demise Have Been Greatly
    Exaggerated"" swipes the perfect Morrissey song title to proclaim, ""It's life that scares me to death.""  Whoa.
    But the band's true ""siren song"" is ""Give It All"", which sums up their big problem (and my main question
    about your candidacy). ""There's a reason why I sing,"" they sing. ""And it's these reasons that belong to me.""</p><p>
    
    So they're singing... why, again?  I leave it to you, Mr. Nader.</p></div>"|6926.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6926-siren-song-of-the-counter-culture/|2.9|Marc Hogan

Harshly criticizing this compilation's individual tracks would
    be like complaining about the stitching on a PBS tote bag.  And, should I encourage others to purchase the
    record, I am essentially advocating donations toward the causes of organizations like MoveOn.org, Music
    for America, and The League of Pissed Off Voters.  Unavoidably, politics takes center stage to the music
    on <i>Future Soundtrack for America</i>.</p><p>
    
    That said, <i>Future Soundtrack for America</i> is a predictably mixed grab-bag of B-sides, live numbers,
    and previously unreleased material, though to the credit of all parties involved, the vast majority of the
    music is excellent.  OK Go kick off the record with ""This Will Be Our Year"", a straightforward Zombies cover
    that could only be recontextualized as a partisan rallying cry by some great stretch of the imagination.
    David Byrne's ""Ain't Got So Far to Go"", though, wastes no time getting to the point: His contribution is a
    folk narrative about a society's revolution against a ""kingdom in chaos.""</p><p>
    
    Most artists, however, settle for mild status quo boat-rocking.  Death Cab for Cutie's ""This Temporary
    Life"" is a bittersweet reflection on middle class ennui.  R.E.M. and Sleater-Kinney both contribute tracks
    (""Final Straw"" and ""Off With Your Head"", respectively) with titles more scathing than their content.  And
    on ""Going for the Gold"", a live acoustic recording spiked with ethereal slide guitar, Bright Eyes' Conor
    Oberst avoids overt political commentary to spin a characteristically miserable tale about winning the ""gold
    medal for idiots"" by fashioning his unspoken guilt into a structured song at the behest of malevolent coffee
    shop patrons.  Meanwhile, They Might Be Giants-- whose John Flansburgh, with Spike Jonze and McSweeney's
    Dave Eggers, was instrumental in the creation of this project-- continue to mine their treasure trove of
    historical gimmicks with ""Tippecanoe and Tyler Too"", a lively, vaguely reggae-inflected ""cover"" of an 1840
    campaign song.</p><p>
    
    Unexpectedly, the compilation's biggest risk-takers are also among its lowest profile.  Mike Doughty
    demonstrates a low-key acoustic direction in his post-Soul Coughing solo career, and offers the most
    articulate expression of the album's ever-present but undefined drive for governmental change on ""Move On"".
    He also presents a discernible platform, albeit in a language of generalities: ""I believe the war is wrong/
    I don't believe that nations can be steered.""  Ben Kweller wipes the Ben Foldsian smirk off his own face
    with the blistering ""Jerry Falwell Destroyed Earth"", a stripped-down mid-fi screed against the values of
    the far right.</p><p>
    
    Later, Clem Snide contributes ""The Ballad of David Icke"", a haunting a cappella number both virulent and
    sad in its paranoid depiction of a loved one stolen away by the ""secret rulers of the world.""  Laura
    Cantrell's tear-stained barroom country cover of John Prine's ""Sam Stone"" is comparably powerful.  The
    song, a devastating story of a soldier's disillusioned homecoming and subsequent descent into morphine
    addiction, is made newly powerful by Cantrell's disjointedly sweet interpretation.</p><p>
    
    And then there's the stitching.  Jimmy Eat World's shockingly competent paint-by-numbers cover of Guided by
    Voices' ""Game of Pricks"" is initially a head-turner, but the song is only notable in comparison to the band's
    pre-existing mainstream pop-punk image.  Elsewhere, Blink-182 and Yeah Yeah Yeahs bog down the album with
    mediocre rehashes of older material-- the inclusion of YYY's live number ""Date With the Night"" is particularly
    perplexing, as its poor sound quality makes the song difficult to endure.  The Flaming Lips' rethinking of
    ""Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots"", with its unadorned piano accompaniment, is so bland that even Wayne Coyne
    seems to get bored; toward the end of the song, he inserts an in-joke that undermines his sincerity for a
    self-satisfied giggle.</p><p>
    
    Fortunately, the fundraiser's organizers have wisely saved the best for last with Tom Waits' previously
    unreleased ""Day After Tomorrow"" and Elliott Smith's ""A Distorted Reality Is Now a Necessity to Be Free"".
    Waits' guitar ballad has the intimate feel of a home recording, and his portrait of a young soldier's
    ambivalence toward war and his all-consuming homesickness transcend a simplistic anti-war message to evoke
    the hard universal truths of <i>All Quiet on the Western Front</i>.  Smith's song is a perfect choice for
    the album's conclusion; his tactful, immaculate indie pop production provides the background for a touching
    account of struggle in a deranged world.</p><p>
<i>Future Soundtrack for America</i> is a time capsule from one of the most divisive periods in the country's
    history.  That it barely touches on the exasperation of the young audience it aspires to reach is not a
    weakness of the album, but rather a statement of just how desperate our political situation has become.  A
    certain faction of Pitchfork's readership may not appreciate the partisan qualifications and editorial
    moralizing that go hand-in-hand with the advocacy of progressive causes, but all citizens, regardless of
    taste in music, have political responsibilities.</p></div>"|2052.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2052-future-soundtrack-for-america/|7.4|David Moore

    has, not surprisingly, tended to focus on the rhythms prominent in Western club culture.  Microhouse is the
    only genre name to gain any real traction in this area because house music is the primary template in which
    these artists choose to work.  Which means there's still plenty of room for experimentation.  Metro Area's
    full-length from last year, for example, was interesting in part because it took Latin disco rhythms that
    were used as accents in trad 4/4 house and pushed them to the foreground.  It was exciting to hear stripped
    dance music with that much space that didn't have a steady kickdrum making time.</p><p>
    
    Tijuana's Fernando Corona is known more these days for the music he's making under his experimental and
    high-art leaning Murcof alias, but as Terrestre, Corona puts the beats first and foremost.  His stated goal
    for Terrestre is to take the sounds he hears on the street in Tijuana and reflect them with the kind of
    cracked and convex mirror only the computer can provide.  His unfairly overlooked split album with Plankton
    Man, reissued last year, was filled with cut-up samples of wailing voices, horns, nylon-stringed guitars,
    and other signifiers of traditional mariachi bands.  These easily identifiable fragments were affectionately
    inserted into catchy and fluid dance tracks, a combo that was inspired and original to say the least.</p><p>
    
    For <i>Secondary Inspection</i>, Corona ditches the overt Mexican folk references and loses himself in
    rhythm.  ""Botas de Oro"" immediately establishes that <i>Secondary Inspection</i> isn't going to be another
    exercise in dry minimalism.  Its syncopation seems designed more for marching than dancing (in gold boots,
    presumably).  It's not hard to imagine a drum corps doing a faithful cover of ""Botas de Oro"" and the exacting
    and well-rendered cymbal and snare patterns sound live, but then unexpected production touches-- like drum
    hits that echo, dub-style, into the distance-- remind us that's we're listening to computerized dance music.</p><p>
    
    ""Secondary Inspection Theme"" is, as its title would indicate, an even more expansive encapsulation of Terrestre's
    sound.  The album's best track, it's a terribly exciting musical melting pot as cowbells, tin cans, congas,
    a snare, wood blocks, and an eerie, screeching background drone arrange themselves around a rhythm that blends
    Mexican, Caribbean and African elements into a European dance context.  Terrestre's ""Theme"" is the sort of
    music where you wonder if the 3/4 upbeat coming through the syncopation references dub reggae or polka that
    found its way over from a border-town Tejano band.  But then, that's a question for musicologists; most
    important, ""Secondary Inspection Theme"" is eminently danceable and cuts across traditional boundaries.  It's
    a floor-filler for drum circle hippies and urban clubbers alike.</p><p>
    
    When Corona dials down the syncopation, he delves into darker atmospheres.  ""Ejido del Terror"" is a weird
    blend built around a tech-house pulse, with added conga hits and a scraped fish giving an extra boost to
    the upstroke hi-hat, while the percussion in the fast, polyrhythmic ""Alushe's Night Out"" is heavily processed,
    with individual creaks and glitches sharing time with the hand-drum fills.  Both of those tracks have eerie,
    otherworldly synth squelches that impart a feel of both Western desert melodrama and a post-apocalyptic
    cityscape.  When Corona says in interviews that he sees <i>Secondary Inspection</i> as informed by a
    post-9/11 sense of paranoia, these are the tracks to which he's referring.</p><p>
    
    Melody is not a primary consideration here; at the heart of <i>Secondary Inspection</i> is Corona's uncanny
    beat sense.  There is elasticity to Corona's programming that recalls Thomas Brinkmann's work as Soul Center--
    an unusual timing when sequenced elements trail a hair behind, paradoxically fostering a sense of relentless
    forward motion I can only describe as ""swing.""  Though it fits comfortably with essentialist house and techno,
    <i>Secondary Inspection</i> pushes the music in a highly personal direction, integrating rhythms and textures
    from Latin America to create precise and hypnotic dance tracks that rip.</p></div>"|8268.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8268-secondary-inspection/|8.6|Mark Richardson

    easy life, but also as a colloquialism-- ""your dogs are tired,"" on ""The Long Walk""-- or to set up, by way
    of the cat/dog dichotomy, a clever pun, when Nastasia admits that ""curiosity kills me.""  She also makes a
    musical pun when the cello quotes the ""give a dog a bone"" line of ""This Old Man"".  Nastasia doesn't fixate
    on the animal as a formal concept for the record-- it's more like a recurring gag.  Dogs pass through as
    easily as the fleeting smokes, or the beers that she and her friends half-heartedly throw back outside the
    high school, or an unsurprising string of bad relationships.</p><p>
    
    With its snarky cover shot and the salutation (""Thank you, comrades"") on the back sleeve, <i>Dogs</i> seems
    more light-hearted and somehow ""younger"" than Nastasia's other records, and for good reason: She recorded it
    five years ago, and is now re-releasing it for the fans she gained with <i>The Blackened Air</i> and <i>Run
    to Ruin</i>.  In her work since, she's honed an elusively grim atmosphere, and her albums are stronger for
    it-- not because they need moodiness to prop them up, but because the moods draw out the nuances of her
    frank but graceful songs.  On <i>Dogs</i>, she sounds more like a standard singer/songwriter, and it's hard
    not to treat this as a prelude to her better albums.</p><p>
    
    Nastasia has an understated voice with a limited range, and on several of these ballads, you can hear her
    drift into its limits, accepting a whispering tone as the cost of expressiveness; on her later albums, she
    sings more confidently, or lowers her voice to a warning.  The arrangements on <i>Dogs</i> are also a
    simpler precursor of <i>The Blackened Air</i>, where the strings and saws drift in on an autumnal gust, or
    the striking textures of <i>Run to Ruin</i>.</p><p>
    
    Steve Albini, who has engineered all of her albums, plays the part of creating an objective as-is document,
    but he and Nastasia have a good idea as to where to put the focus.  The recording makes impressive use of
    vintage instruments, whose birthdates and makers are detailed in the liner notes.  (Who knew that Nastasia
    was a socialist <i>and</i> a gearhead?)  The strings augment Nastasia's ballads without sweetening them,
    and Stephen Day's cello smoothly complements her voice.  But the delicate arrangements hold back louder
    songs like ""Nobody Knew Her"", on which a surprisingly powerful guitar deserves more room.</p><p>
    
    Nastasia has said she practices in the bathroom of her apartment, and <i>Dogs</i> has the ease of a performance
    that you're catching as you sit in the shower stall.  The songs here include some of the best she's written,
    but they're also some of the most unexpected.  Without this reissue, we could have forgotten that she has an
    ear for big guitar riffs, or that she sounds beautiful just playing straight on an acoustic guitar.  And who
    would have remembered that she has a sense of humor?</p></div>"|5714.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5714-dogs/|7.4|Chris Dahlen

    original godfather, DJ Shadow, and current champion Rjd2.  From the outset, Shadow's chiaroscuro hip-hop
    draped a decidedly somber shroud over the genre he christened; even his most unbound, overdriven stomps
    emphasize the down in downtempo.  Rjd2's <i>Deadringer</i> and <i>Since We Last Spoke</i> followed suit,
    stubbornly dejected albums that drew much of their soul from sadness.  And the thing is, this marriage of
    and technique works beautifully: A sense of apocalyptic uncertainty and dramatic tension emerges from minor
    chords stirring pastiche beats and ghostly vocals haunting overcast arrangements.</p><p>
    
    So, Diplo.  Short for Diplodocus, the tragic prehistoric behemoth, large beyond comprehension, invincible
    but doomed, felled by that silent predator called evolution.  The Diplo in question is actually a tall,
    skinny kid from Mississippi that's established a home with Philly's streetwise Hollertronix crew.  For a
    couple years now, Diplo and his partner Low Budget have run Hollertronix as a sort of crunk Underground
    Railroad, stealing away big-balled, white label southern rap into the seemingly sophisticated environs
    of the Northeast.  He's built a reputation as a party-starting, rabble-rouser DJ, fearlessly mashing Prince
    into New Order, greasing up Nirvana with Lil Jon.</p><p>
    
    But with <i>Florida</i>, Diplo takes a cue from his lauded predecessors and forgoes the debauchery for
    melancholy.  The album's downcast gaze frequently finds nuance in minor tempo changes, intersecting
    instrumental lines and well-placed vocals.  Diplo also shows the same reverence for vintage soul samples
    as Shadow and Rj-- slinky Rhodes lines abound here-- and, at least for the first part of the album, puts
    a lot of stock in a unique thematic cohesiveness.  Initially, <i>Florida</i> is wrought by heavy string
    and woodwind sections and a slow, cinematic pacing that oozes with brackish mystery, but eventually, Diplo
    abandons this sticky, vivid sensation for more self-conscious stylistic diversity.</p><p>
    
    Diplo spent part of his childhood in Florida, and the Sunshine State's flat, muggy landscape and wide skies
    are present in ""Big Lost"", the album's first proper song.  Coming after an abstract intro, it stands as its
    most identifiable track, embodying Diplo's steamy Jurassic funk vibe.  But there's no brontosaurus bass or
    weird caveman chants-- this instrumental gallops in on regal, repeated strings and garage-soul organ.
    ""Sarah"" rides a similar mood infused with a fuzzy, Tony Iommi-ish guitar line and tranquil piano for some
    dizzying contrast.</p><p>
    
    But after that, <i>Florida</i> stalks out of the swamp and hits I-95, speeding north with no particular
    destination in mind.  Vocals by UK it-chick Martina Topley-Bird are rendered abstract and murky, squelched
    beneath backwards horn samples and a lackluster beat, while the orchestral brass of ""Way More"" gives in to
    shivering electrobreaks.  And though ""Diplo Rhythm"" benefits from a tight rundown from Jamaica's Vibez Cartel
    and Brazilian crew Pantera Os Danadinhos, its shallow jungle rhythm is too studied.  Still, even while these
    tracks fail to impress in light of the album's first third, they reflect Diplo's ambitious (if unfocused)
    compositional skills.</p><p>
    
    Later, Diplo manages to pull things back on track with ""Indian Thick Jawns"", a tabla 'n' bass sizzler
    manhandled by the underrated P.E.A.C.E., formerly of Freestyle Fellowship.  Scratching out one of rap's
    best monotones, P.E.A.C.E. is something like a West Coast ODB, half-singing/half-speaking his lunatic
    spiel.  And finally, ""Summer's Gonna Hurt You"" revisits the seminal track off Diplo's <i>Epistimology</i> EP,
    its languid strings and soulful male vocals returning to the quintessential evening hues of Shadow and Rjd2.
    If a finale can be both warm and chilling, this is it.  More concerned with the thrill of the hunt than
    putting up the trophy, Diplo's <i>Florida</i> safari never quite bags the big game, but it often comes
    close.</p></div>"|2570.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2570-florida/|7.0|Jonathan Zwickel

    3.  In the first group and on the latter group's 1996 debut, <i>Ask Me Tomorrow</i>, Goswell shared vocal
    duties on 9 songs with frontman Neil Halstead, but on the three albums that followed, Halstead sang every
    song but one-- ""Comin' Home"" from <i>Excuses for Travelers</i> (which he wrote).  Goswell's willowy,
    expressive voice always seemed like a potentially dynamic counterpart to Halstead's understated whisper,
    but it was mostly an underused asset.  Instead, she usually hung back on bass and only occasionally supplied
    backing vocals, certainly to the frustration of fans desperate to hear more from the woman who gave ""Love
    Songs on the Radio"" its elegiac elegance.  So Goswell's own solo debut, entitled <i>Waves Are Universal</i>,
    seems not just long overdue, but, more critically, freighted with the high expectations of a horde of eager
    listeners.</p><p>
    
    On the album's lead-off track, ""Warm Summer Sun"", Goswell meets those expectations head-on.  Over a gentle
    guitar strum, she sings about falling over from lack of forward motion and decides not to ""waste my time on
    things that stop me feeling.""  Drums and guitar kick in for the second verse and the song builds gradually.
    SPOILER ALERT: Then traditional Irish uilleann pipes come in loud and jarring, like a Shyamalan twist ending
    that completely reframes everything that preceded it.  Suddenly, the song is not just a smell-the-roses
    reaffirmation, but a statement of career resolve.  If the beginning seems like a distillation of Mojave 3's
    strengths, the pipes serve the same purpose of Slowdive's droning guitars: Goswell has found the hidden
    connections between her current group's pastoralisms and her former band's shoegazerisms.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, little else on <i>Waves Are Universal</i> lives up to the promise of ""Warm Summer Sun"", though
    a couple of songs do come close: ""Deelay"" overlays loping rhythms with one of the album's most evocative
    melodies, while ""Coastline"" and ""Save Yourself"" churn with eddying guitars whose raggedness contrasts nicely
    with Goswell's crystalline voice.  But the rest of the album dispenses with the murky guitars in favor of
    burbling percussion, tasteful acoustic strumming, and occasional flourishes like the birdchirp samples and
    breathy harmonium in ""Gather Me Up"".  Producer David Naughton incorporates a dizzying array of instruments--
    shakers, Wurlitzer, vibraphone, bongos, letterbox bells, and rain stick.  Three songs even credit Mother
    Nature on Thai waves, rain and ambience.</p><p>
    
    Such inventive accompaniment, however, often overcompensates for weak song structures, lackluster lyrics,
    and a general lack of focus.  Over 12 tracks, Goswell undertakes a range of musical approaches, from quiet
    folk to more conventional rock to jangly pop, but not all of them work equally well.  Softer, midtempo songs
    like ""Thru the Dawn"" and ""Shoulder the Blame"" lag with inertia, and ""No Substitute"" is polished to a
    characterless AOR sheen (she can sound startlingly similar to Shawn Colvin).  ""Hope"" expresses the frustrations
    of city life, but the banal lyrics (""You give me space to live in/ You give me hope/ And that's just fine"")
    and Naughton's overproduction-- especially the chorus of back-up singers-- buff away the music's texture and
    tension.</p><p>
    
    The result is a warm summery sound that's agreeable, if not very exciting.  Goswell proves she's more than
    just another pretty voice, but too often <i>Waves Are Universal</i> sounds less than confident, almost timid.
    The album's ambition is rich musical diversity, but it sounds less adventurously eclectic than simply
    scattershot, less assertive than merely restless, eager to try anything but not always sure what works and
    what doesn't.</p></div>"|3650.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3650-waves-are-universal/|6.8|Stephen M. Deusner

Even when the complaints of the rich and famous are valid, they're still often
    insufferable.  It's no surprise that films about the horrors of being chased by the paparazzi or how awful
    it is for poor Julia Roberts to sit through media junkets fall flat on their egos.   And musically, negative
    responses to the klieg and camera lights haven't been much better.  Tracks about the pitfalls of celebrity
    culture or the trappings of wide-scale admiration and fabulous wealth-- from Pink Floyd's ""Money"" to Pink's
    ""Don't Let Me Get Me""-- are often patronizing and grating.  There are exceptions, of course: Eminem has been
    playing a compelling game of cat-and-mouse with his persona, fans and critics ever since he first hit the
    charts, and Kurt Cobain's wrestling with both self-hatred and a success he simultaneously courted and
    recoiled against are well explored on Nirvana's <i>In Utero</i>.</p><p>
    
    When Dizzee Rascal was promoting his debut record, 2003's trenchant <i>Boy in Da Corner</i>, he famously
    cited <i>In Utero</i> as his favorite record of all time.  Perhaps then it's no surprise that follow-up
    <i>Showtime</i> often deals with the London savant's fishbowl life as he negotiates both the expectations
    of those who hope he swims and the sharpened knives of those who wish he sinks.</p><p>
    
    Rascal's level of fame isn't close to any of the above artists-- he thanks the 100,000 people who bought his
    debut, and he's still pleased just to open for Jay-Z rather than throwing rocks at Jigga's now-abdicated
    throne-- and that's part of his problem.  ""Still Dylan the villain from around the way,"" Rascal is big enough
    that his detractors want to bring him down and small enough that they probably can.  So while a multiplatinum
    seller like Nelly can wonder, ""What good is all the fame if you're not fucking the models?"", Dizzee is not
    only mercifully teased by a woman on <i>Showtime</i>'s ""Face""-- she calls him a one-hit wonder and mocks his
    thin wardrobe and low-budget video before ultimately wishing a Jay-Z promo is on MTV Base-- but her words
    hurt.</p><p>
    
    ""People are going to respect me if it kills you,"" Dizzee mutters on the follow-up track, and if that's the
    central goal on <i>Showtime</i>, he's likely to accomplish it.  The album naturally lacks the shock of the
    new, the jolt of <i>Boy in Da Corner</i>-- instead, it's a consolidation of his strengths, lyrically and
    sonically, and a more satisfying listen than its predecessor.  Musically, Rascal continues along many of
    the same paths-- explorations into orientalism and modal composition; the lurching, clattering futurerattle
    of jungle, dancehall, and hip-hop echoing through concrete tenements-- although the finished product is much
    more muscular and confident.  Lyrically, he balances his paranoia with the spoonfuls of homespun advice and
    dew-eyed rallying cries that colored both his debut and <i>Treddin' on Thin Ice</i>, the solo bow from Wiley,
    another Roll Deep vet.  In short, Rascal is keeping his feet on the ground, reaching for the stars, and
    looking over his shoulder for those who want to lay him in the gutter.</p><p>
    
    Single ""Stand Up Tall"" has its finger on ""Pulse X"" and the exuberance and immediacy of <i>Boy</i>'s ""Fix Up,
    Look Sharp"".  ""Hype Talk"" ice dances with glitch-pop better than anything on <i>Vespertine</i>.  ""Imagine""
    takes fleeting elements of emo and the ""Girl/Boy Song"" to somehow magical results.  ""Learn"" demonstrates
    that Rascal can do orientalism as beats-and-banger instead of just minimalist soundtracks to introspection.
    He also looks further afield to Jamaica (""Face"") and America (""Everywhere"", ""Flyin'""), and gets playful on
    the one-two combination of ""Dream"" and ""Girls"".</p><p>
    
    The latter features the Kano-like cadence of Marga Man as he and Rascal wink and whistle at women over the
    track that sounds most like it could have tumbled off of <i>Boy</i>.  The former is the song that will likely
    receive the most attention, and could be the make-or-break point for <i>Showtime</i> fencesitters.  Taking
    its sing-song, Casio-tinkling chorus from Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein via Captain Sensible's ""Happy Talk"", ""Dream""
    is the record's most overt Jay-Z reference (it's a close cousin to ""Hard Knock Life"") and could become its
    commercial equivalent to ""Dry Your Eyes"", a recent UK #1 for The Streets.  ""Dream"" has a loopy charm and
    simple philosophy, and Dizzee's infectious exuberance for the track leaves him unable to resist adding his
    off-key vocals to the central lyric: ""You've got to have a dream/ If you don't have a dream/ How you gonna
    have a dream come true?""</p><p>
    
    Even when something doesn't exactly work, there are other elements to buttress the missteps: ""Knock, Knock""'s
    central lyrical conceit is propped up by the track's tea-kettle sighs as it moves at night down Jefferson
    Avenue (it's much too slow for the Autobahn).  The female vocal on ""Get By""'s chorus (which is more indebted
    to Kanye than the thug/diva duet template) has a bit of a square-peg/round-hole quality, but the song contains
    some of Dizzee's most quotable lyrics.</p><p>
    
    ""If I can't find my around/ I'll find a way across/ And if I can't find my across/ I'll bore straight through,""
    Dizzee insists on album closer, ""Fickle"".  Not a Smiths reference (""fame, fame, fickle fame""), the track is
    perhaps the record's highlight, and the best example of Rascal's approach-- a mix of pragmatism and optimism,
    of demonstrating bravado without denying his vulnerability.  Rascal's is a three-dimensional world, then--
    not black and white, us vs. them, me against the world, me against the music, playas vs. hatas, underground
    vs. mainstream, or mo money, mo problems.  There are elements of each of those cliches in his tracks, but
    he's smart enough to seek the nuances and contradictions in each of those supposed dichotomies rather than
    approach them as absolutes, an either/or, or a matter of right vs. wrong.</p></div>"|2346.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2346-showtime/|8.6|Scott Plagenhoef

    is an ingenious, overachieving experiment, a pushing away from the pack, a search for untrodden, unprecedented
    ground.  The ever-evolving project of Manchester madman Paddy Steer, Homelife has lurked in the Ninja Tune
    dojo for years and still hasn't been pinned down to a formula, moving between leftfield disco jazz, digital
    torch song soul, and goony electronic funk.  Surprisingly, in all its diffuse, foppish meandering, <i>Guru
    Man</i> leaves a sincere, wonderfully enigmatic impression, like an organic version of Wagon Christ's
    galactic travels as finger-painted during a cannabis-enhanced Advanced Jazz Band afterschool jam session.
    If playfulness is profound, then Homelife have spoken the Gospel.</p><p>
    
    Steer fills out album's mix 'n' match eclecticism with a 15-strong rotating cast that includes 808 State
    multi-instrumentalist Graham Massey on clarinet and saxophone and co-conspirator Tony Burnside on guitar
    and vocals.  A host of strings, keys, vocals, and cornucopia percussion keep Homelife's juicy heart beating,
    but Steer's intuitive, interwoven arrangements stitch it all together.  The result is a kind of loopy,
    groove-drunk Frankenstein's monster that happily ricochets between the cerebral and the silly.</p><p>
    
    The album's sequencing is shrewd, completing a graceful arc that literally starts with a bang and ends with
    a whimper.  It all gets underway to the sound of distant fireworks that pepper the woozy, horn-smeared opener.
    Those lead right in to the ridiculous title track, with nearly indecipherable lyrics sung by what sound like
    Alvin &amp; The Chipmunks' Swedish be-bop cousins.  Backed by tub-thumping bass drums and greasy keys, and littered
    by shards of broken electronic bleeps, the title song sets the tone for the weirdness that follows.</p><p>
    
    Well, almost.  As weird as the song is, things immediately take a turn for the downright bizarre.  The
    female-vocaled ""A Casa (The House)"" plays like the Tatooine Cantina Band doing Sun Ra and the Family Stoned
    before turning into a chime and banjo raga breakdown.  Coursing along on Tony Burnside's casual vocals,
    ""Harder"" builds one of the most mesmerizing, head-swinging, caught-you-dancing workouts I've heard all
    year.  The song is five uproarious minutes of slick, four-on-the-floor, blue-eyed Afrodisco that culminates
    with wiry organ and banjo tickled by choppy guitar, maracas, and a Dumbo-sized bassline.  It's hard to
    describe, probably harder for you to imagine, and impossible to sit still to.</p><p>
    
    The whole disc dips in and out of dimensions, running through the spin cycle but never rinsing out its
    debauched, impeccable sense of adventure.  Hazy ambient musings, Flamenco-flavored balladry, junkyard jazz
    poetry, Spaghetti Western psychedelica, and tweaky IDM math-rock are all shuffled into Homelife's trick
    deck.  And without sounding too fey, it does come together almost like magic-- loose but not sloppy,
    visionary but tangible, smart but not uptight.  The emotional distance between the sassy <i>Superfly</i>
    string melody of ""Lowdell Is Missing"" and the loungey vocal caress of album closer ""Strangers"" is large,
    but the eclectic three-song transition that spans it is natural, logical, almost perfect.  I often have a
    difficult time finding meaning in any work that's overtly fun, as if melancholy is the only path to
    enlightenment, but Homelife's crazy light reveals itself like a train.  I've been hit.</p></div>"|3991.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3991-guru-man-hubcap-lady/|8.2|Jonathan Zwickel

    blood-red text, dentist/producer Keith Hudson's 1974 solo album <i>Flesh of My Skin, Blood of My Blood</i>
    looks as if it could fit somewhere between Jandek's <i>Nine-Thirty</i> and <i>Telegraph Melts</i> in the
    mysterious Texan mumbler's shadowy discography.  But Hudson's outsider reggae music still sounds human,
    even if Leroy Sibbles' thumping bass is distorted beyond recognition and Augustus Pablo is made to blow
    steely harp instead of plastic melodica, the results of which sound like Stevie Wonder's work on the
    harmonica.</p><p>
    
    This is another welcome step in Basic Replay's reconsideration of the erratic (and mostly out-of-print)
    discography of ""The Dark Prince of Reggae.""  Last year, the label issued Hudson's delirious penultimate
    showcase <i>Playing It Cool and Playing It Right</i>-- here's hoping that <i>Torch of Freedom</i> isn't far
    behind.  The man's catalog is notoriously diverse, and even within these 12 tracks, the erratic Hudson
    swerves all over the place.  Opener ""Hunting"" is a tropical instrumental filled with the sound of rustling
    leaves, painfully modulated bass, Pablo's terse harmonica lines, and trickles of single-string guitar,
    birdcalls and rain patter, all mixed into a jungle haze.</p><p>
    
    The album's four instrumentals are less dubs than ways to allow the soupy soul of ""My Nocturne"" or ""Blood
    of My Blood"" to stew just a bit longer, making them taste less like roots music and more like a drugged
    concoction cut from the run out grooves of <i>There's a Riot Goin' On</i>.  ""Darkest Night"" is an original
    rhythm and is a seething, hypnotic drive down the heart of darkness highway (revisited to even more
    devastating effect on <i>Playing It Cool</i>) with dissolving congas, heavily wah-wah'd guitar, and
    beckoning siren calls from Candi McKenzie in the opaque, humid night.</p><p>
    
    From there it's unsteady as, through the murk of the tape, Hudson cracks up on ""Testing of My Faith"",
    claiming he ""can't hold back these anxieties"" while lamenting aloud: ""Why can't I be like any other man?""
    Even more telling is the amorphous croak-croon he unfurls on Woodstock hymn ""I Shall Be Released"". Just
    as Dylan and The Band scoffed at acidic, ""pie in the sky"" explorations during the Summer of Love, Hudson
    dodges simplified Rastafarian rhetoric to dig for something deeper and darker.  His hands plunge into the
    dank earth, and much like <i>The Basement Tapes</i>, he pulls up eternally black roots, weird gibberish,
    and the worms that writhe in the mud of the shared mind.</p></div>"|3967.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3967-flesh-of-my-skin-blood-of-my-blood/|7.9|Andy Beta

    graying occult kitsch: skulls of various sizes and colors, a yellowing palmistry chart, dice, feathers, a
    pentagram, a Celtic cross, a peace button, glass-encased roses, pictures of eyeballs, a Buddha, a stuffed
    black cat wearing a gold chain.  Obviously fine-tuned to reflect White Magic's bizarre goth-folk aesthetic,
    the assemblage flits endlessly between the personal and the peculiar: part-head shop, part-attic trunk,
    part-seasonal Halloween store buried in the back of the suburban mall.</p><p>
    
    It's an impressive display-- weird and comforting at the same time-- and as a visual representation of the
    band's music, it succeeds remarkably.  White Magic's rambling freak-folk is somehow perfectly reflected in
    each petrified rose petal, waxy skull, and scorpion-set-in-amber: a quirky, vaguely intriguing mix of Delta
    Americana and Euro-gypsy, tossed together with care.</p><p>
    
    Despite only having only six songs (and clocking in at 22 minutes), <i>Through the Sun Door</i> can seem
    inconsistent and half-cooked.  Still, the EP manages to show plenty of promise: There's a moment on the
    otherwise benign ""Keeping the Wolves from the Door"" during which vocalist Mira Billotte's voice seems to
    reach its outer limits, tottering for a few glorious seconds on the edge of total dissolution.  Mostly,
    Billotte howls like a dreamier Eleanor Friedberger, forsaking The Fiery Furnaces' gruff, trilling proclamations
    for blissed-out bits of campfire verse.  But the potential for apocalyptic breakdown remains at a continual
    high for White Magic, and when Billotte's throaty strains become heavy with that danger, the exhilaration
    she emits is both palpable and oddly inviting.</p><p>
    
    Perhaps unsurprisingly, White Magic occasionally meander a bit too close to the knight-guarded edges of
    their local Medieval Times fairgrounds: The band tends to blindly embrace the same kind of awkward, barefoot
    spirituality that goes hand-in-hand with gnawing on giant chicken legs and wearing three layers of princess
    robes (see ""Plain Gold Ring"", especially).  While not totally unconvincing, the band's gentle strummers tend
    to be far less engaging than their richer, slightly-less-directed romps.  The record's two strongest tracks,
    ""One Note"" and ""The Gypsies Came Marching After"" are both centered on bizarre (and entirely out-of-tune)
    piano melodies, with guitar clangs, thick percussion, and Billotte's unhinged warbling running in a bunch
    of weird, paranoid circles.  It's a dizzying turn, but ultimately worth its weight in stubbed toes.</p></div>"|8780.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8780-through-the-sun-door-ep/|7.4|Amanda Petrusich

    repeated on its screen, a little electrical schematic with ""Endochine"" scrawled in the middle, a partial
    fingerprint... let's not beat around the bush.  This is Radiohead, Jr. album art at its most facile and
    unimaginative.  Its Photoshop 5.0 throw-together look functions nicely as a microcosm of just how grossly
    Radiohead have been misinterpreted by their legion of imitators, and while Endochine themselves don't fare
    as badly at it as, say, Marion, Palo Alto, Ours or Cardia, their debut makes crystal clear that baby's got
    <i>The Bends</i> and has memorized every note of it.</p><p>
    
    The Austin, TX quintet (don't let the occasional Oxford inflection fool you) are capable, even superlative
    musicians, and the two-part harmonies of guitarists Casey McPherson and Nathan Harlan broaden the band's
    post-Britpop scope, even as they shoplift their melodic tics from Thom Yorke and pinch their falsettos from
    Coldplay's Chris Martin.  ""A New Beginning"" parachutes a Martin-ish croon into the middle of a shuffling,
    piano-dirge stew (complete with mellotron choir) with a melody that borrows almost every one of Yorke's
    signature moves, including those little slurs into dissonance he does so well.</p><p>
    
    Most of the album charges harder than that song, as the band shoots for epic anthems and sometimes come
    close to hitting the mark.  ""Breadline"" rides thumping drums and blaring guitars, but then the band fall
    prey to the obligatory stereotyped drug references (""Shooting up in the mainline/ I'll get my fix"") and
    sunnyside preaching (""You must keep on holding on"") that plague so many bands operating in this territory.
    Though Harlan and McPherson try their damnedest, delivering those kinds of lines with conviction doesn't
    make them any more meaningful.  The two deliver some of their best harmonies on ""Music to Drive and Cry To"",
    sounding a lot like Doves with bigger guitars, and achieving a sort of epic sweep as they plow through the
    reverb with big, buzzing riffs.</p><p>
    
    But that's the overarching problem with the album-- the whole thing has a kinda-broad sweep and a sorta-epic
    feel, yet never quite reaches either goal, ultimately coming off as an attempted masterpiece that lacked the
    substance to hit home.  This is actually symptomatic of a lot of the post-Radiohead rabble, and while they
    frequently manage to get things right on paper-- the soaring melodies, the bold, jagged guitars, the odd
    synth or drum loop here and there-- it always lacks the risk that made Radiohead's original item work so
    well, and there's nothing different happening here.  Endochine certainly have potential, but they need to
    let their assets coalesce in their own way first if they're ever going to realize it.</p></div>"|2910.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2910-day-two/|5.7|Joe Tangari

    Drive-In, De Facto, The Mars Volta) has been recording since 2001.  In its entirety, it will comprise the
    soundtrack for Rodriguez-Lopez's film of the same name.  That this project steps back from the structured
    post-prog of The Mars Volta and bends more toward the esoteric experimentalism of De Facto is unsurprising--
    it takes its title from the opening track of De Facto's 2001 LP <i>Megaton Shotblast</i>.  What <i>is</i>
    surprising is that an undertaking of such magnitude and rich detail remains so shrouded in mystery.</p><p>
    
    There have been few concrete details revealed about this project; most of the information is fragmentary at
    best.  Cryptic message board posts, befuddling repetitions, frustrating omissions, red herrings and blind
    leads accrue-- either no one knows anything about this project, or they just aren't willing to say.  When
    queried, GSL Records founder Sonny Kay replied: ""The film is 90 minutes long and will be out in the spring.
    That's all I know.""  Factual glimmers from the digital rumor mill maintain that the film is fictional and
    is nearing completion in Los Angeles, and that Rodriguez-Lopez collaborated with numerous friends on the
    soundtrack, including John Frusciante and members of De Facto and The Mars Volta.  Between these shadowy
    spires of dubious information, a vast lacuna remains.</p><p>
    
    The word ""shambolic"" appears with startling frequency in reviews of <em>A Manual Dexterity, Vol. 1</em>.  It's
    a good word, with a robust utility that belies its seldom-used stature (my word processor's spellchecker
    is trying to convince me that it doesn't exist), but one wishes ""rambolic"" and ""fumbolic"" were words as
    well.  The record opens with ""Around Knuckle White Tile"", the title's abstract word collage representing
    Rodriguez-Lopez's lyrical tendencies, which are almost entirely absent from this mostly instrumental
    recording.  The track's initial ambient rustles and haunted house sounds take a couple of minutes to set
    the scene, before morphing into a dim, lounge-y fugue with spinning traces of incandescent guitar.
    Freeform drumming enters to impose order upon the 7-minute walkabout as it assembles itself with subtle
    shadings of tone and color.</p><p>
    
    ""Dyna Sark Arches"" spends a full minute establishing an aura of receding, minimal atmosphere before collapsing
    into prickly, staccato funk embellished with crystalline string bends and solos that are strikingly reminiscent
    of pre-<em>Good News</em> Modest Mouse.  ""Here the Tame Go By"" drops a sizzling cluster of prog-guitar into
    the center of an immense expanse of arid atmosphere.  Fans of The Mars Volta should take note of ""The
    Palpitations Form a Limit"", the record's only foray into standard rock dynamics and vocals.</p><p>
    
    A ""deus ex machina""-- literally ""God from a machine""-- is a narrative device employed to resolve an inextricably
    tangled plot (e.g. ""And they all died in an avalanche"").  As such, it typically arrives at the end of a
    work.  Rodriguez-Lopez placed his deus ex machina-- a standout track with that name-- in the center of his
    record.  The song is a seamless fusion of foundational dub, digital glitz, and unadulterated Latin jazz,
    a moment of pop lucidity amid all the abstruse avant-gardism.  However, since the denouement of this review
    won't truly resolve until the film materializes, I'll close with a divine intervention of my own:</p><p>
    
    ""And the Internet, crumbolic bastion of misinformation, subsided at last beneath the digital sea.  The end.""</p></div>"|6924.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6924-a-manual-dexterity-soundtrack-vol-1/|7.5|Brian Howe

In British English, the same nouns
    generally use a plural verb.  As a result, you can't debate the relative merits of Radiohead versus Blur
    without first determining whether Blur <em>are</em> or merely <em>is</em>.  Now, Supergrass aren't (isn't?)
    the most self-conscious bunch of apemen, but the title of their new ""best of"" collection clearly adopts
    the Americanized diction.  While this Oxford trio will never pass for American, they're not trying to.
    A decade after ""Caught by the Fuzz"", Supergrass look to break the surly bonds of Britpop and establish
    themselves in the rock 'n' roll pantheon, borders and oceans be chuggered.</p><p>
    
    What's striking about <em>Supergrass Is 10</em> is its revelation that, despite the occasional stabs of
    <em>Parklife</em> rhythm guitar and music-hall tinges, Supergrass never really belonged to the scene from
    which they sprang.  Liam and Noel wanted to be The Beatles.  Damon wanted to be admired.  Jarvis wanted
    to be clever.  Thom wanted everyone else to be miserable, too.  Meanwhile, the Cornelius-faced Gaz Coombes,
    the man with the mutton chops?  He just wanted to feel ""Alright.""  So while Noel attempted rewrites of
    <em>Abbey Road</em> and Menswe@r became the punchline to this joke, Supergrass built up a catalog of raucous,
    jubilant, unrepentant unpretentiousness-- influenced by The Kinks and Buzzcocks, yes, but increasingly
    tapping into the swagger and immediacy of early rock and Delta blues, as channeled through the Rolling
    Stones and T.Rex.</p><p>
    
    ""I'm a rock 'n' roll singer in a rock 'n' roll band,"" Coombes declares in ""Seen the Light"", his voice
    strangled in an apparent Elvis impression that makes Graham Coxon's American accent for Blur's ""Rednecks""
    sound authentic.  The song's scraggly boogie could serve as an object lesson for more recent Bolan adherents
    like The M's.  ""Strange Ones"" is a bizarre, brilliant mash-up of British punk and obscene blues.  Old ""Lenny""
    B-side ""Wait for the Sun"" is dead-on acoustic Zep.  Even ""Pumping on Your Stereo"", the closest thing Supergrass
    had to an American hit, sounds more like the faux-Southern rock of ""Rocks Off"" than ""Common People"".</p><p>
    
    The band's more Britpop-tinged hits hold up, too.  The punky sturm-und-drang (and goofy backing vocals) of
    ""Caught by the Fuzz"" are still worth getting arrested over.  The sublime ""Moving"" glides comfortably along
    like the Acela Express, with sleepy strings that might have appeared in Mancini's score for <em>Silver
    Streak</em>, before bursting into its brilliantly jerky ""chorus"" (if that's what you'd even call it in a
    song that doesn't really have verses, per se, just hooks).  ""It's Not Me"" provides one of the album's rare
    respites; its electronic burps and effects sound more like <em>Moon Safari</em> than I ever realized.</p><p>
    
    And what of new single ""Kiss of Life""?  Well, it won't resuscitate the group's stardom, which apparently is
    waning in the U.K. (they never really broke the States).  The song sees the band reborn under punchy
    percussion, as the funky jam of cleverly sequenced preceding track ""Sun Hits the Sky"" gives way to the new
    one's Talking Heads-style polyrhythms.  It could be great, too, if the best lyric weren't ""your love's like
    a heart attack"" and if Bono hadn't already used the verse melody in ""Mysterious Ways"".  The other new song,
    ""Bullet"", is a dark bit of Goth about, uh, bullets, that has Coombes wondering, ""I'm in a world of marching
    soldiers and who am I?""  Hey, didn't we just slam Joan of Arc for that kind of nonsense?</p><p>
    
    If you already own the original albums, <em>Supergrass Is 10</em> runs a bit long at 71 minutes.  And there's
    no reason it couldn't be in chronological order, really.  The American edition will add a live disc, but it
    will be tough to improve on the album's defining track, ""Richard III"", from <em>In It for the Money</em>.  Yes,
    it's the most blatantly British title on a collection that I've just said proves Supergrass's significance
    beyond cloistered Britpopdom.  But listen: It starts slow-- just some warm-up sounds-- before exploding into
    stern alarums of distorted guitar and a barbaric ""whoop!"" from Coombes.  The melody is as catchy as ever
    for this group and then something happens, something otherworldly.  Is that a... theremin?  Somewhere in
    those good vibrations, Supergrass become one of the funnest bands of the 90s, singular or plural.</p></div>"|7626.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7626-supergrass-is-10/|8.5|Marc Hogan

    bootleg.  If you ignore Steve Byram's fantastic cover art, it's easy to imagine this as a cassette labeled
    in handwritten scrawl: ""these are the good parts.""  Many of Berne's releases on the Screwgun label have
    looked like bootlegs-- live sets with his bands Bloodcount and Paraphrase came in cardboard sleeves-- but
    this recording of the Hard Cell trio feels and sounds rough.  Two of the four tracks were captured by ""an
    ordinary person in an orderly manner"" (code for a guy up front with a mp3 recorder?) and Berne is basically
    advertising this disc as a chance to hear his bandmates blow the roof off.</p><p>
    
    Berne has been generous with live releases of his projects, especially those from bands that never made it
    into the studio (again, Bloodcount and Paraphrase), and in the half-dozen live discs that he's issued on his
    own, he has yet to ship a dud.  On the free improvisations of Paraphrase's <i>Please Advise</i>, the trio
    roamed like kids in a haunted house, slamming open new doors every few minutes.  <i>Ornery People</i>,
    Berne's live duet with Michael Formanek, had the knotty diplomacy of two brothers arguing over a check.
    Almost none of Berne's compositions runs less than 10 minutes, and the players can race across the map a
    different way every time, banging through the structures with a spontaneity that merits alternate takes.</p><p>
    
    Berne also has a knack for picking combustible performers.  In addition to the bandleader himself, the Hard
    Cell trio includes keyboardist Craig Taborn and drummer Tom Rainey, each of whom played on Berne's 2001
    recording <i>The Shell Game</i>.  When you add guitarist Marc Ducret, you have the band that released Berne's
    most recently acclaimed studio disc, 2002's <i>Science Friction</i>.  (Did you bring your scorecard?)  Indeed,
    the repertoire on <i>Hard Cell Live</i> will be familiar to anyone who has heard <i>Science Friction</i>,
    but the compositions are only part of the focus: As previously mentioned, Berne wants to showcase his
    bandmates.</p><p>
    
    Taborn and Rainey play each piece <i>staccatissimo</i> as they rattle together like rutting marionettes,
    switching from hammering patterns to improvised splashes while Berne squalls in the middle as the fulcrum.
    Even when Berne tries to angle a piece into a pensive section the other guys won't let him go, keeping him
    trapped in their crosscurrents.  It's rare to hear Taborn play piano on this material, and the wood-and-wire
    sound knocks well against Rainey's tapdancer cymbals.  The random blast of electric noise on ""Huevos"" is
    also a nice shock.</p><p>
    
    All three men have played this aggressively before, but they've never cut an entire album at this pace.  A
    recording of a complete show would have more archival value-- and Berne's bands are often as rewarding in
    the ebbs as the flows-- but that's not the point.  The listener has the same experience flying through this
    record that the musicians had making it: How fast can we take this?  What's around <i>this</i> corner?</p></div>"|665.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/665-acoustic-and-electric-hard-cell-live/|7.8|Chris Dahlen

    backing band and barreled through a set of quickly composed and completely unrehearsed songs in one of the
    vaunted venue's very last sets.  A few days later, while the Ax was closing its doors for good, McCaughey
    was back in Washington state spending a day in the studio with one of his typically intriguing assemblages
    of mid-level rock stars.  A core band featuring McCaughey, John Ramberg, R.E.M.'s Peter Buck and ex-Ministry
    drummer Bill Rieflin hammered those same songs into shape in roughly the amount of time it takes to bake
    beans in a slow-cooker, and then allowed the resulting album, awkwardly titled <i>In Rock</i>, to disappear
    into collector-geek obscurity: He pressed 1000 copies and sold them all at a single show.</p><p>
    
    But such a fate was not what those songs deserved, and thankfully, McCaughey and Yep Roc Records realized
    this.  The version of <i>In Rock</i> they've now dropped on the world at large isn't exactly the record
    that hardcore indie-pop fans have been overpaying for on the internet auction circuit-- McCaughey has cut
    two songs and added four new ones.  The liners don't bother to point out which of these tracks weren't a
    part of the original release, but it hardly matters; the material all melds pretty well and everything
    is played with spontaneous abandon, as befits these sickly sweet confections, several of which rank among
    the finest McCaughey has placed on a Minus 5 album.</p><p>
    
    Most of these songs are short and to the point, laced with McCaughey's trademark wit and served with a short
    stack of harmony vocals and a lot of fuzzy guitar.  Opening instrumental ""Bambi Molester"", named for the
    Croatian surf band with which Buck and McCaughey have recently associated, nearly drowns in that fuzz, its
    surf beat and Dick Dale-ish guitar lines completely subverted by distortion.  ""Where the Wires Meet the
    Skies"" uses a buzzing, frenetic SoCal backing to the advantage of McCaughey's great vocal melody-- about
    the only thing the song's missing is a big, blaring horn section, an absence they've filled with backing
    vocals and Big Muff-laden guitars.  The tumbling ""whoa-oh-oh-oh""s of ""Courage Is the Smallest Bird"" stick
    to the roof of your brain like rubber cement, while ""The Girl I Never Met"" hits the lounge with acoustic
    guitars fluttering.</p><p>
    
    Lounge Ax gets a direct mention in ""The Night Chicago Died Again"", a jokey song about a terrible flood that
    hits Chicago, though the Ax stays open.  Over a Georgia Satellites-ish backing, McCaughey gets in his best
    lines detailing which members of the band Chicago were killed in the disaster: ""Among the casualties/ Daniel
    Seraphine, Cetera, Lamm &amp; Pankow/ Not Terry Kath, but the guy who replaced him.""  If that song skirts the
    edge of goofball overkill, though, ""Dr. Evil: Doctor of Evil"" crosses it entirely with its new-wave stomp
    and motormouthed spoken verses.  The song also manages to directly quote The Youngbloods' ""Get Together"" in
    its breakdown, one of a litany of moments that could've been danced to in the 60s (or the 70s-- McCaughey
    predicts you'll ""do the strand"" on ""Cosmic Jive"").</p><p>
    
    After this year's earlier, darker <i>I Don't Know Who I Am: Let the War on Music Begin, Vol. 2</i> and the
    strangely lackluster <i>Down with Wilco</i>, <i>In Rock</i> is a hugely welcome blast of pure pop mayhem
    from one of its finest practitioners.  It's basically everything you'd want in a modern, self-aware power-pop
    album, proudly referential of its influences, but never reverent toward them, and insidiously catchy for all
    but a few of its 35 minutes.  And to think, most of us nearly missed a chance to hear it.</p></div>"|5320.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5320-in-rock/|7.6|Joe Tangari

In the past year, the California region has produced its fair share of
    seemingly effortless, vaguely generic pop, ranging in quality from pretty good (Dios) to pretty damn good
    (Rogue Wave).  The spectrum for potential success within the regional genre is limited, though, precisely
    because of the inherently amicable nature of the music itself.  Accordingly, it's nearly impossible to
    seriously knock an album like <i>Poison Arrows</i>, whose utterly harmless brand of rock is so airtight in
    its calculated construction that even the inevitable half-hearted smile and head-nod is justification enough
    for the album's existence.</p><p>
    Communiqué formally departed from their CA-based punk roots (as American Steel) last year, when the
    keyboard-intensive pop sound of their 2003 EP <i>A Crescent Honeymoon</i> garnered some attention from MTV
    and a few high-profile music publications.  The addition of a keyboardist, Corey Gowan, didn't exactly
    support lead singer/guitarist Rory Henderson's conception of the group as ""punk,"" but enabled the band to
    openly embrace a pop aesthetic at odds with the tone of their previous work.  <i>Poison Arrows</i> is the
    fruition of the band's new direction, but the results, while intermittently catchy, are largely unremarkable.</p><p>
    The album opens with ""The Best Lies"", which, with its buzzing synth bassline and indistinct, treble-heavy
    guitar muddle, turns on a dime from Cure-on-Zoloft verses to positively textbook pop choruses-- even the
    lyrics (""All the best lies are sealed with a kiss"") are suspiciously inoffensive.  ""Evaporate"" is driven by
    a cheesy organ progression and weak new-wave dance beat, leading to a chorus nearly identical to that of
    the first track; unimaginative repetition, particularly in choruses, is the group's most consistent offense.
    ""Dagger Vision"" is one of many songs to employ a recently ubiquitous stock Cars synthline.</p><p>
    ""Perfect Weapon"" drips with imitative disco-pop affectation, ""Strays"" effectively streamlines The Shins'
    unique brand of ambiguous 60s quotation, and ""Death Rattle Dance"" is a spirited, straightforward rock number,
    though lyrics like, ""I wanna scream and shout/ Let it all out,"" cut a bit close to teen movie soundtrack
    material.  At some point during the unassuming closing ballad, ""Rattling Bones"", a distinct numbness sets
    in as the faint memories of every other song on the album slowly dissipate.  <i>Poison Arrows</i> is the
    very definition of pleasantly forgettable: For further proof, one need only reference <i>Rolling Stone</i>,
    who, perhaps portentously, have labeled Communiqué's music ""rock at its finest.""</p><p>
    Well, no.  But again, how negative can one's attitude be toward this stuff?  Communiqué straddles the
    retro-crazed Shins vs. Strokes divide so successfully that their sound is practically anonymous.  Paradoxically,
    by pandering to every conceivably fashionable contemporary musical trend, the band transcends universal
    accessibility and becomes something of a non-entity.  There's literally nothing that distinguishes this
    music from anything that a plethora of other marginally credible aspiring mainstream artists have to offer.
    Still, <i>Poison Arrows</i> retains a certain chameleonic charm.  Generally agreeable and eager to please,
    Communiqué make a concerted effort to push no boundaries, offer no hidden pleasures, and suggest little
    potential for future musical development.  Which is to say, of course, that they should do just fine.</p></div>"|1777.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1777-poison-arrows/|6.1|David Moore

In the midst of the opener on The Good Life's
    latest album, the cheekily titled <i>Album of the Year</i>, lead singer Tim Kasher is name-dropping his taste
    for curb-front cult faves.  Now, I hate to be a quibbler, but perhaps Bukowski's more applicable to the
    emotional thrashing in Kasher's other group, Cursive.  The more appropriate literary one-off for this record
    might be Nelson Algren, whose resurgent castaways could settle quite comfortably into the spoon-fed healing
    and isopropyl fumes of Kasher's newest songs.</p><p>
    
    Whereas Cursive has made a career of pleading for catharsis through bruised, over-the-top emoting, The Good
    Life has always detailed Kasher's lonely nights; he formed the group for the material that would have sounded
    too sleepy alongside most of Cursive's ranting and raving.  Adopting soft, shadowed hues and more rounded
    arrangements for his confessional tales, Kasher's The Good Life project has made steady progress from its
    Cure-esque first two albums to more crisp, autumnal sounds.</p><p>
<i>Album of the Year</i>'s premise is somewhat ungainly: to document the passage of a year in 12 songs, one
    for each month.  But, to appreciate its stark, lovelorn poetics, you need know none of this.  The songs are
    instantly welcoming, flickering with enough hope and tenacity to outlast Kasher's heartbreak.  It's not
    enough to revel in your own melancholy without understanding what's being gained through its endurance.
    Augmented by Mike Mogis' best production of the year (and manning the boards for a label like Saddle Creek,
    it's been a busy one), each song seems to hover in fathomless space, but interacts with an effortless
    synthesis that belies such separation.</p><p>
    
    ""Night and Day"" is a trapeze-wired
    waltz that shuffles along on a broken accordion and Mogis' starlit Wurlitzer.  In three dizzy minutes, it
    makes you uncomfortably familiar with the forlorn vagrants that populate Kasher's world.  ""You're No Fool""
    adds to this circus-tent feel by combining a lonely saxophone line with a bar-soaked piano, painting a dark
    tale of exes incapable of losing former lovers.  The strong, almost insolent saxophone returns you to Kasher's
    ability to wallow in sorrow without sinking under its weight, the redemption of the past through its seemingly
    insufferable passage.  Here, Kasher again reminds one of his kinship with Algren, as the track would have
    fit perfectly alongside Elmer Bernstein's jazz score for the film adaptation of <i>The Man with the Golden
    Arm</i>.</p><p>
    
    On ""Inmates""-- the one track where Kasher allows someone else to voice his heartache-- Jiha Lee steps in
    without missing a beat to add a seductive, mesmerizing shyness.  Atop a soft acoustic guitar, distant bongos
    and tingling electronics, both Lee's voice and the epic track build before Kasher turns the song into a duet
    and electric guitars grind out the transcendent ease.  By the time ""Inmates"" ends with Lee's pronouncement
    that ""she can""t be your prisoner,"" the song seems to have packed an entire relationship's worth of tempo
    shifts and transgressions into its 9-plus minutes without ever sounding bloated.</p><p>
    
    The complaints with the album are worn-in with old caveats, namely the ""emo"" tag.  Those unfamiliar with
    Kasher's songwriting could mouth that forbidden word after the album's initial sad-eyed glance.  One might
    hear the hysterical strains of Ben Gibbard or Chris Carraba in Kasher's reckless emoting.  But remain calm
    and it will pass: The vibrant productions and transient lyricism will pull you through that knee-jerk
    response.  Kasher has turned his pissings and moanings into grand, translucent tales that typically avoid
    the isolation of self-indulgence (occasional slip-ups like the sugary bleating of the title track to this
    year's <i>Lovers Need Lawyers</i> EP only prove how adeptly most of the album is handled).  He might tell
    you otherwise, but like Isaac Brock, he knows that it's tough to live like Bukowski.  Instead of seeking
    spirituality in pocket-change or San Franciscan street-grime, he's after the sudden comprehension gained
    from nights spent alone and stories that translate the open pitfalls of the heart.</p></div>"|3646.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3646-album-of-the-year/|8.0|Derek Miller

    Singers-- Greg Dulli has covered several anthologies' worth of songs on stage and on singles.  Musically,
    Dulli is omnivorous, devouring everything from Henry Mancini's ""Moon River"" to Hole's ""Miss World"" to New
    Order's ""Regret"" to Prince's ""When Doves Cry"".  A covers album was inevitable.</p><p>
    Reflecting Dulli's range of interest and influence, <i>She Loves You</i> covers a lot of territory in just
    11 songs: R&amp;B;, showtunes, classic rock, jazz, blues, soul, and Björk.  For some artists, this line-up--
    which includes songs by Hope Sandoval, John Coltrane, David Holmes &amp; Martina Topley-Bird, Lindsey Buckingham,
    and Marvin Gaye, among others-- might appear too willful and calculated in its range of styles and genres,
    but Dulli's precedent-setting live performances and B-sides deflect that
    criticism.  Diversity, however, is never an end in itself, and fortunately, The Twilight Singers evince an
    understanding of these songs, resulting in some intriguing interpretations.  Dimming the lights and spreading
    them out on satin sheets beneath the mirrored ceiling, Greg Dulli-fies these songs, translating them into
    his particular brand of dark-end-of-the-street, soul-derived rock and, at his most brazen, altering their
    meanings.</p><p>
    Unlike the four cover songs on Afghan Whigs' 1994 EP <i>What Jail Is Like</i>, this is no one-night stand.
    Rather, <i>She Loves You</i> treats each song differently while still being carefully sequenced so that its
    tracks cohere into a narrative of love and loss, resulting in a record that manages to sound as if its
    tracks were the product of one mind.  (Although, in fairness, Dulli's musical mind was itself formed by
    many of these songs, which prompts a chicken-or-the-egg conundrum).  The Dulli who sings the edge-of-the-precipice
    ""Hyperballad"", for example, could be the same one who wrote ""Be Sweet"" or ""Something Hot"".</p><p>
    On Fleetwood Mac's ""What Makes You Think You're the One"", Dulli loses the original's regimental march tempo,
    allowing the song to sprawl and stretch as he mimics Lindsey Buckingham's slurred vocals.  ""Too Tough to
    Die"" merges Topley-Bird's dark Americanisms onto a New Orleans piano shuffle, and on ""Real Love""-- first
    recorded by Mary J. Blige-- he builds on the jump-rope rhythms of the original, letting a sawing guitar
    drive the chorus.  Elsewhere, the Gershwin Brothers' classic ""Summertime"" sounds new, darker.  Over a
    70s-soundtrack guitar flourish, Dulli sings ""hush, little baby, don't you cry"" like a sexual predator, his
    voice sounding pack-a-day ragged.  It's sinister and not a little unnerving, but he makes it fascinating
    just the same, mostly because his interpretation doesn't stray from the original, just re-frames it.</p><p>
    That approach doesn't necessarily work across the board: Dulli's biggest misfire on <i>She Loves You</i> is
    ""Strange Fruit"", popularized by Billie Holiday but written by Abel Meeropol, a white, Jewish, Communist
    schoolteacher.  Vividly describing a Southern lynching, it has become canonical, among the first popular
    songs to address American race relations.  Its specific descriptions of seemingly tangential details only
    add to the inherent horror of its topic, and even Holiday's version sounds slightly eroticized by the tactile
    descriptions (""scent of magnolia sweet and fresh"") and the chiaroscuro contrast between that pleasure and
    sheer pain (""then the sudden smell of burning flesh"").</p><p>
    Dulli and occasional Twilight Singer Mark Lanegan make the sensual lyrics sound desperately sexual: The line
    ""black bodies swaying in the summer breeze"" here evokes images of lovers, not corpses, and ""the bulging eyes
    and the twisted mouth"" describe the body in orgasm.  It's a brave, if facile, read, completely disregarding
    political correctness as it plumbs the song for other issues.  Dulli goes for obvious horror-show theatrics--
    lumbering guitar lines, Sturm-und-Drang pace, tortured vocals-- which cheapen the song's devastating metaphor.
    Simply put, the song looms too large for him; he cannot manage to wrap his persona around its gruesome subject
    matter and deep history.</p><p>
    While ""Strange Fruit"" aims for intense psychodrama, Dulli gets more impact out of the simple do-do-do's on
    Marvin Gaye's ""Please Stay"", the sadomasochistic subtext of ""Black Is the Color of My True Love's Hair"", the
    vertiginous emotions of ""Hyperballad"", and the hope in the face of heartache on Mary J. Blige's ""Real Love"".
    They may not be as ambitious as ""Strange Fruit"", but they do remind us why the earth moved for Dulli in the
    first place.</p></div>"|8212.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8212-she-loves-you/|7.4|Stephen M. Deusner

    <i>Juxtaposition</i>, will almost solely depend upon your appetite for instrumental, electronic-based
    post-rock.  If you've had even trace amounts of it in your diet the past few years, it's unlikely that
    you'll find anything new or overly exotic here.  So the only question is: Do you have room for more?</p><p>
    
    Hailing from Vienna, Radian is comprised of bassist John Norman, drummer Martin Brandlmayr, and keyboardist
    Stefan Nemeth.  As with 2002's <i>Rec.Extern</i>, the trio has brought in John McEntire from the Tortoise
    Institute of Percussive Arts (TIPA) to serve as engineer and midwife.  In an apparent effort to sweep away
    all audio footprints, the group recorded and edited the electronic portions of these tracks in Vienna, then
    recorded the live bass and drum parts in Chicago with McEntire before stitching together the entire creature.
    It's a bit of a riddle why they bothered with this time-consuming technique, since it hasn't appreciably
    altered their sound from past efforts.  One has the nagging suspicion that for Radian-- as has too often
    been the case with IDM acts-- the process has become more important than the product.</p><p>
    
    Regardless of what procedures they used, the results sound just fine-- if somewhat familiar to fans of
    Tortoise, To Rococo Rot, Pan American, or Radian's previous work.  Despite the three musicians' activities
    in improv and free jazz, very little seems to have been left to chance on <i>Juxtaposition</i>.  Each track
    is a deliberate layering of textures and elements, with every microtone sounding as fussed-over as the
    sculpted icing on an elaborate wedding cake.</p><p>
    
    With the origins of all sounds well obscured, ""Shift"" kicks the album off with what could be the promo music
    for a troubled TV news broadcast before the bass and drums join hands and finally settle into a satisfying
    lumber.  ""Rapid Eye Movement"" begins with what sounds like the rhythmic whirr of a malfunctioning refrigerator,
    and then cycles through a pulsating series of ominous chords and steel wool abrasions.  Elsewhere, they make
    pleasant use of a marimba (or the electronically manipulated approximation of one) and everybody seems to be
    getting along just famously until the finale ""Nord"" dumps you off unceremoniously at an undisclosed waterfront
    location while a black-suited man with a mysterious attache case keeps drawing closer and closer.  You're
    finally exited with a gradual hiss-out to silence.</p><p>
    
    I don't know how much of the credit goes to McEntire, but the album's production is flawless.  The drums in
    particular were recorded with an almost pristine clarity, and the bass' supple warmth keeps the finicky
    proceedings from getting excessively sterile.  In fact, <i>Juxtaposition</i> is so well put together as a
    package that I would like to be able to recommend it without reservation.  And for everyone who hasn't
    already had his or her fill of Radian's well-executed but too-familiar brand of amusement, I'll gladly do
    so.</p></div>"|6648.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6648-juxtaposition/|7.1|Matthew Murphy

    Of the Saddle Creek roster, Beep Beep come closest to the horny electro-rock of The Faint (indeed, Joel Peterson
    plays bass for both bands), but while this group piles on the guitars and scrimps on the keyboards (The
    Faint inverts that ratio), they're a far cry from Bright Eyes, Cursive, Rilo Kiley, or any of Saddle Creek's
    other signature bands.  Instead, Beep Beep are accumulating fair if superficial comparison to Wire, XTC
    and Gang of Four.  They echo XTC's brimming atmospheres and sculpted production as well as the anthemic
    post-punk tendencies of Gang of Four and Wire, but their compositions aren't lean enough for the comparisons
    to stand up under close scrutiny.  If anything, it might be fair to say Beep Beep sound like two or three of
    those bands played simultaneously.</p><p>
    
    The group is comprised of the core guitar/vocal unit of Eric Bemberger and Chris Hughes (who played in The
    Magentas with Conor Oberst and The Faint's Todd Baechle), bassist Katie Muth (who has since ditched the band
    for grad school and was replaced by Petersen), and drummer Mike Sweeny (who is also a member of Criteria, a
    band fronted by ex-Cursive guitarist Steve Pedersen-- Saddle Creek keeps it in the family).  Bemberger,
    Hughes and Peterson also played together in an obscure band called Gabardine, which released one EP before
    disbanding in 1998.</p><p>
    
    That Bemberger and Hughes have been collaborators since long before the advent of Beep Beep is apparent in
    the skillful, confident instrumental interplay on <em>Business Casual</em>.  But even the well-honed dynamic
    fails to fully compensate for the overplayed, cluttered arrangements.  While impressively rendered, they are
    often, put simply, just <em>too much</em>, and as such, the record's expansive sonic palette seems more imposing
    than engaging.  I'll look forward to seeing Beep Beep perform, as the record sounds as if it would absolutely
    lay waste in the live setting, but a softer touch and sparer arrangements might have been more palatable for
    the recorded format. </p><p>
<em>Business Casual</em> opens with ""I Am the Secretary"", an exploding cluster of the digital flux, percussive
    muted strings, jagged guitar shrapnel, and theatrical, Sick Lipstick-ish singing that dominate the album.
    Note that <em>Business Casual</em>'s lyrical themes are touted as explorations of ""office culture, as well as
    religious, environmental, and sexual deviance,"" and are often undecipherable. But the deviance, if nothing
    else, shines through the affected caterwauling.  ""Oh No!"" is a standout, with the same driving rhythm as
    the rest of the album, but a starker and more discernible peristaltic thrust-- one that breathes new life
    into the tired formulation ""angular.""  ""Giggle Giggle"" rolls out a staccato funk reminiscent of The Natural
    History over a ping-ponging electronic bass tone and, as the fourth song on the record is accompanied by a
    burgeoning anxiety stemming from the unremitting onslaught of strobe-light changes and vocal tomcatting.</p><p>
    
    One can't accuse Beep Beep of being lackluster or uninspired.  <em>Business Casual</em> is fierce and competent,
    and evinces the rippling of powerful musical muscles.  But its affectations are so grating that it's tough
    to make it through it all in a single listen.  I'm not averse to abrasive, nerve-testing music, but I'd
    prefer more contrast.  Beep Beep's songs have a certain keening shrillness that will leave all but the
    hardiest nerves frazzled and jangling.</p></div>"|1126.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1126-business-casual/|6.8|Brian Howe

    their half-assed records, and two billion of their mostly terrible live performances.  No matter how great
    something sounds on record, we still want to <i>see</i> something happen when we go to concerts.  We want
    to be entertained, and we want an experience beyond what the record already offers.  Rock stars have it
    easy: They do a couple kicks once or twice in the middle of a sweet riff, or they tear off their t-shirt
    with their teeth and bam-- instant respect from the crowd.  But laptop-based acts have to go the extra mile
    to keep the audience engaged.</p><p>
    
    Matmos have done it well-- their <i>Chance to Cut</i> routine involved a live video feed of MC Schmidt drilling
    himself with an acupuncture needle while Drew Daniel manipulated sound in real time.  Many other acts offer
    elaborate visual projection to bolster their show's energy.  But if you don't have the cash to throw down
    for a projector, there's one other way a solo lap-pop act can up his stage cred: Get more people up on stage
    and play some live instruments.  Manitoba did it for his <i>Up in Flames</i> shows in 2003, and now tourmate
    Kristian Craig Robinson (Capitol K) has followed suit.</p><p>
    
    Robinson's third album, <i>Happy Happy</i>, carries that live band dynamic into the studio, adding his
    lycanthropic protege Patrick Wolf to the mix, along with drummer Adam Stringer, Jo Apps on bass, synths
    and co-vocals, and the heady Leafcutter John Burton on guitar and laptops.  Robinson still handles most
    of the vocals and provides the songs their typically unpredictable IDM backbones.  But if the new approach
    lends <i>Happy Hour</i> a sense of cohesion, it surprisingly lacks energy.</p><p>
    
    As if purposefully contrasting his old sound with his new one, Robinson performs <i>Happy Happy</i>'s first
    four songs by himself.  Opener ""Love in Slow Motion"" is the best of this bunch, its glitched-out, guitar-led
    rock drive successfully mining the same territory as Lali Puna's <i>Faking the Books</i>, though without that
    record's sense of restraint.  However, Robinson butchers the title track-- another solo effort-- with an
    irritating ""Happy! Happy!"" that aims to sound like The Stone Roses but ends up more like Weird Al.</p><p>
    
    Robinson
    is joined by his collaborators on ""New York"", which rides its jam-bandy undercurrent with occasional recourse
    to synthy Cure-isms, as Leafcutter John riffs his way through the half-baked slosh.  The beginning of ""Glorious""
    falls into the same rut with a ""made to sound live"" production that begs for Phish bootleg comparisons and
    bead-in-hemp necklaces from Pac Sun.  The song then takes a sharp turn into the trip-hop mezzanine, pimping
    a dark and slinky bassline reminiscent of Chris Corner's production work with Sneaker Pimps.  Unfortunately,
    trip-hop is clearly not Capitol K's ""thing"": ""Revolution"" may be the worst song I've ever heard.</p><p>
    
    Two songs on <i>Happy Happy</i> are so good, so full of life, that you have to wonder what went wrong with
    the others.  The dark piano melody and female swoons that haunt the synth-popped ""Tiger"" eventually give
    way to a truly inspired Gainsbourg groove, one punctured by Kristian and Jo Apps' doo-doo-doo syncope across
    the pan.  And ""Prayer for Peace"" is <i>Happy Happy</i>'s hot metal Doberman, sporting Leafcutter's cyborg
    guitar rant and a wild dub groove complete with flute flutters and lumbering octaves in the low end.  Both
    songs work because they are, if you will, ""band songs"": Capitol K The Band is not so forcedly trying to bulk
    up the laptop-based compositions of Capitol K The One Guy.  The Band is playing to its own strengths here,
    and, for what it's worth, maybe Robinson's laptop experiments would be best left for post-production.</p></div>"|1292.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1292-happy-happy/|6.4|Nick Sylvester

    Owls, Cap'n Jazz, Friend/Enemy, etc., might have something to say about the current national and global
    political landscape.  And so he does: In recent interviews, Kinsella's commentary on the state of things
    has ranged from understated irony (""I'm still a 'feminist'"") to pointed anti-Bush administration railing
    (""I'll line up wherever I can against their fundamentalist doomsday plan"").  The title of Joan of Arc's
    latest concept review waiting to happen, <i>Joan of Arc, Dick Cheney, Mark Twain...</i>, suggests that
    Kinsella might finally be prepared to hang up his dubious title of dadaist indie lightning rod to make an
    album statement of some political import.  Let's find out:</p><p>
<i>""If D.C.'s streets make a neat pentagram and every dollar bill brags God's behind our plan/ Who am I to
    have any idea who I am?""</i></p><p>
    
    Ouch.  Yes, Tim Kinsella just turned a potential indictment of Bush's ""crusade"" into a personal statement of
    his existential crisis.  The rest of the album follows suit-- hints of Kinsella's criticism of the reigning
    machine are buried within awkward stabs at soul-searching and meandering character studies.  In fact, Dick
    Cheney is invoked only once, on ""The Title Track of This Album"", when members of the band blankly repeat the
    phrase, ""Joan of Arc, Dick Cheney, Mark Twain,"" over electronic noise from a drill.  That's some biting
    commentary, all right.</p><p>
    
    I'm all for confrontational absurdism as a means of personal exploration in experimental rock-- Xiu Xiu has
    been doing it successfully since Brent DiCrescenzo got his last piece of Kinsella brother flame mail.  But
    there's a thin line between expressing unspecific political frustration (I believe it was Nic Offer who
    ordered the president to, er, fellate him) and embracing empty nihilism to avoid the task of forming a valid
    personal ideology.  The group's blindly cynical mud-flinging is best represented on ""80s Dance Parties Most
    of All"", where Kinsella, smart-ass to the core, argues (with tongue in cheek) that Internet porn, grammar,
    24-hour days, Friendster, and global warming are all ""conspiracies.""  Like the historical figures in the
    album's title, these things are listed arbitrarily, leading to an unavoidable question: What's the point?</p><p>
    
    Therein lies the fundamental flaw of the album: There isn't much of a point, and in view of our current
    political climate, Dick Cheney isn't a name to be dropped frivolously.  Likewise, irony for irony's sake
    doesn't carry the same hipster-courting, smirk-inducing weight it might have back in the halcyon days of
    the late 90s, when an Al Gore concept album full of lyrics like, ""There's politics to dressing warm/ And it
    has a subtext of muscle,"" and my personal favorite, ""I've only one question left unanswered by both Sid
    Viscious [sic] and my mother-me-who?"" could have been conceptually hilarious, if not exactly insightful.</p><p>
    
    In 2004, however, the baseless pessimism that pervades most of these songs comes across as lazy and irritating.
    ""Apocalypse Politics"" is particularly telling; the line, ""With the earth agreed a circle/ Any and all points
    can each be the center simultaneously,"" is essentially a variation on the elliptical Zen premise of Modest
    Mouse's ""3rd Planet"".  The crucial difference is that in Isaac Brock's version, the universe's profound
    circularity is humbling, reminding us that eventually all things will ""end up where [they] were.""  Kinsella,
    on the other hand, crudely concludes that the ""world continues ending in its infinite variable speeds.""
    Kinsella's manic rhetoric has often been a divisive feature of Joan of Arc's output, but here the superficiality
    of his simple end-of-the-world theatrics is transparent.</p><p>
    
    The album's saving grace is the surrounding music, which almost, but not quite, makes up for Kinsella's
    constant barrage of tiresome non-sequiturs.  Most songs exhibit a further expansion of the band's subdued
    post-rock inclinations explored on 2003's <i>So Much Staying Alive and Lovelessness</i>, replacing the often
    formless compositions of their earlier work with relatively structured acoustic experimentation.  ""Queasy
    Lynn"" finds its foundation in thundering carnival atmospherics, ""Onomatopoeic Animal Faces"" is a spare
    piano dirge, and the aforementioned ""Dance Parties"", with its muted cowbell-driven beat, quickly works into
    a dynamic, perpetual acid-folk groove.</p><p>
    
    Fragments of spastic acoustic instrumentation, such as the discordant piano figures in ""Questioning Benjamin
    Franklin's Ghost"", follow their own loose internal logic, and even abstract electronic experiments like ""Deep
    Rush"" demonstrate welcome restraint and concrete structure, further distancing the band from the shapeless
    music of <i>The Gap</i> and <i>Live in Chicago, 1999</i>.  The band's overall sound has arguably never been
    more cohesive, thanks in part to Tortoise producer John McEntire's mixing efforts, and their development as
    a collective is promising.</p><p>
    
    Still, the music, though admittedly provocative, almost always plays the role of sonic backdrop to Kinsella's
    ridiculous tangential meditations, which ultimately sink the album.  The despicable legacy of Dick Cheney
    &amp; Co. deserves more consideration than a passing ""go fuck yourself"" in the form of a meaningless title
    reference and unflattering album cover portrait, and that seems to be all Kinsella has to offer.</p></div>"|4271.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4271-joan-of-arc-dick-cheney-mark-twain/|5.3|David Moore

    Given such a defiant creed, one would imagine said music to be dauntingly strange, but surprisingly, <em>San
    Francisco's STILL Doomed</em> sounds downright traditional compared to many of Crime's peers.  Essentially,
    it's sneering, overdriven, classic rock 'n' roll-- and I'm talking <em>classic</em> classic; Little Richard,
    Jerry Lee Lewis, rollicking, bass-heavy 1950s classic, inflected with R&amp;B; and rockabilly, with a first-hand
    memory of the blues from which it came.  Even buried under sheets of ambient noise and abrasive distortion,
    it's immediately recognizable as rock 'n' roll.  Imagine what The Animals would have sounded like if they
    were <em>literally on fire</em>, howling in pain.</p><p>
    
    What's remarkable about Crime, then, is their ineffable ferocity, which must have been doubly outrageous
    emanating from four anti-punks in greaser-noir and S.F.P.D. uniforms.  It's said that Crime was the first
    punk band on the West Coast to release their own single-- ""Hot Wire My Heart"" (which Sonic Youth would cover
    on <em>Sister</em>) b/w ""Baby, You're So Repulsive"", in 1976.  This was followed by 1977 single ""Frustration"",
    b/w ""Murder by Guitar"", and an infamous performance for the inmates of San Quentin, which is starting to sound
    like an okay place-- I mean, <em>I've</em> never gotten to see Johnny Cash or Crime in concert, and I'm a (mostly)
    law-abiding citizen. </p><p>
    
    Crime disbanded in 1981, after their third single (not included on this collection) earned the approval of
    critics, but alienated fans with its fashionable new-wave tendencies.  They left behind a lot of unreleased
    material and legends of flagrantly self-defeating behavior, from canceling a gig with The Damned because
    they refused to open, to promoting a show at a bisexual club with a Hitler poster that prompted the club's
    owner to pay Crime $100 to not play, to telling Seymour Stein of Sire Records that The Ramones were ""hippies
    that should cut their hair."" </p><p>
    
    Swami has re-mastered and re-issued Solar Lodge's 1990 release <em>San Francisco's Doomed</em>, which was a
    CD document of two late-70s rehearsal sessions.  Swami's version is essentially identical, except for
    additional versions of ""Hot Wire My Heart"" and ""Baby, You're So Repulsive"" from the band's original 1976
    incarnation.  It marks the closest we'll ever come to a proper Crime album, and, at least until Revenant
    Records' plan for a box set and DVD comes to fruition, the most faithful document of a band heretofore
    remembered through murky bootlegs and a credit in Sonic Youth's liner notes. </p><p>
<em>San Francisco's STILL Doomed</em> is a torturous, detuned and feedback-laced stomp through rock 'n' roll
    standards.  While many punk bands got by on weirdness, employing maneuvers that were a metaphor-conjuring
    wet dream for critics, Crime relied less on innovation than on furious, strident rhythms.  From the demented
    boogie and blazing leads of ""Frustration"", to the droning, halting guitars and mobile bass melody of ""Crime
    Wave"", to the plodding dissonance of ""Murder by Guitar"", the 1978 session is an exercise in strenuous
    distortion, damaged riffage and disintegrating classic rock.</p><p>
    
    The 1979 session, meanwhile, evinces a greater emphasis
    on rockabilly (including a song called ""Rockabilly Drugstore"", natch), but doesn't hint at the new-wave
    mishaps that would tarnish Crime's last days.  The new versions of ""Hot Wire My Heart"" and ""Baby, You're
    So Repulsive"" are a bit rawer, but really aren't stylistically different from the subsequent sessions, and
    demonstrate that Crime was most effective when, instead of trying to fit in or react against, they defiantly
    locked on to primal rock archetypes and rode them hard into infinity. </p></div>"|1776.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1776-san-franciscos-still-doomed/|7.8|Brian Howe

This breed is in their late
    20s to early 30s, pale, tall and fragile, notably anti-indie-rocker, and stands quietly askew to their
    soul-patched, aging ""alternative"" siblings.  Their taste is built quite specifically upon the dream-rock
    lineage of the shoegazers and the goth-tinged ambient pop stemming from the Cocteau Twins.  These figures
    have slowly figures infiltrated my musical knowledge-- a Jamie who burned me a copy of Slowdive's beautiful,
    impossible-to-find <i>Pygmalion</i>; a Steve who introduced me to the output of Azure Ray; a kindly record
    store employee who repeatedly insisted I listen to This Mortal Coil.  Firm believers in the most beautiful,
    emotional, human sounds to come out of the late 80s and early 90s.</p><p>
    
    Having seen Lanterna's Henry Frayne play live a few months ago, I can comfortably conclude that he fits the
    physical and musical profile of these listeners.  A towering, soft-spoken man who began playing unannounced
    as he stared at the pedals by his feet, his delayed guitar soon filled the room with slow melodies set to
    the dramatic beats emanating from his laptop (the modern equivalent of shoegazing being, of course, screenstaring).
    As Lanterna, Frayne has been producing a consistent strain of guitar-based instrumental music for several
    years now-- one that largely ignores any apparent influence from the past 10 years.  On new album <i>Highways</i>,
    he replaces the programmed beats of his past releases with live drummer Eric Gebow and ""tape effects"" from
    Mike Brosco, altering his increasingly honed sound.</p><p>
    
    A new listener might be tricked by opener ""Clear Blue"" into thinking <i>Highways</i> a Windy &amp; Carl-derived
    textural work, until ""Brightness"" bursts in with the clean-reverbed chords of an Eno-produced U2 song.
    Lanterna is usually spoken of in terms of ambient; in fact, I found him filed under ""new age"" at my local
    record store, though the closest <i>Highways</i> comes to that territory is with a few Spanish-sounding
    guitar licks in the beautiful ""Adriatic"".  The live drums and ambient pop guitar tone actually bring
    <i>Highways</i> closest to instrumental, distortion-free dream-rock.  The songs maintain standard arrangements
    and known forms, confident in their chordal simplicity.  It's really a logical extension of the genre-- a
    lot of shoegazers hated writing lyrics anyway, and despite all their talk about keeping vocals low in the
    mix to render them ""another instrument,"" many were probably more afraid of the commercial implications of
    making purely instrumental music.  Not so for Lanterna, who lets his delayed arpeggios speak for themselves.</p><p>
    
    The term ""cinematic"" is often applied to vocal-free work in describing the spaciousness inherent where no
    human voice or lyrics exist to grab focus or give specific meaning to the sound.  Here, however, ""cinematic""
    is applicable to Lanterna's sense of the dramatic as well.  The bent, western guitar melodies of ""Canyons""
    or ""Brooklyn"" convey sweeping visual impressions.  Frayne is not after the dark emotional ambiguity of
    beatless drones, and his generally major-key melodies avoid the sinister, conveying a subdued and hopeful
    feel.  The album's brick wall is its lack of substantial textural exploration.  Frayne has found a sound
    he likes, and ventures outside of it little, aside from occasionally changing the speed of his delay.  While
    instrumental outfits like Stars of the Lid are intent on mutating their guitar sound through manipulation of
    attack and decay, Lanterna's not of an experimental mind.  Yet when he does exceed his standard parameters,
    the results are worth the effort.  My favorite piece on the album is its closer, the title track, in which
    Frayne transforms sparsely plucked guitar notes into deep oscillating drones.</p><p>
    
    It seems cliched to call an album like <i>Highways</i> ""good driving music.""  But its title doesn't exactly
    resist the connection of this sort of sound with the blur of landscapes whizzing by, mind both open and numb,
    body immersed in and removed from the surroundings in that perpetually transitory state.  And after all, the
    most consistent tempo on <i>Highways</i> is a propulsive pace that would most accurately be called ""driving.""
    So I guess we'll just have to keep this album handy for those late afternoon country car trips necessitating
    a soundtrack, when feeling runs deep enough to render words unnecessary.</p></div>"|4689.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4689-highways/|7.6|Liam Singer

A technician is there to hear it, and he captures the
    resulting tic on his unidirectional mic.  The speck of sound spikes on a nearby monitor, and soon it's been
    tweaked and expanded like digitized grey matter silly putty, permuting beats and dot-matrix melodies into a
    new orchestral maneuver that bumps with quiet dignity from a dark and inviting future.  Geoff White is versed
    in this pinprick aesthetic.  Under his own name (for Force Inc., amongst others), he's produced quiet techno
    that shimmers like an echo in a subway tunnel, but is also stippled with the steely signature of sparks
    flown.  Both rigid and poseable, his tracks are like robots with swivel-arm battle-grip.</p><p>
    
    Debuting for Ghostly International as Aeroc, White leans back from that approach.  Instead of wrapping
    plastic rhythms in expansive, fleecy melodies, <i>Viscous Solid</i> approaches glitch through the point of
    a guitar pick, and takes its time at the crests of its deep breaths.  Whereas even minimal techno relies on
    a rhythmic framework, Aeroc dives headlong into doctored sounds without borders for restriction.</p><p>
    
    Word on the street says a manipulated acoustic guitar was responsible for the majority of <i>Viscous Solid</i>.
    It's definitely a factor in opener ""My Love, The Wave Break"", where repeated strums coast over consistently
    percussive smudges.  The untreated acoustic adds welcome warmth to the track's more traditional underpinnings,
    giving it the quality of a hologram in the midst of a particularly leisurely daydream.  A brief, windblown
    surge leads into ""Mahy"", where that familiar ping-pong tickle travels parallel to the guitar's gentle ramble.
    Here, however, it's almost too far away from the foreground beat.  Aeroc could be ruminating on the static
    effect of technology on organics, but he likely just got carried away with the echo pedal.</p><p>
    
    Aeroc uncovers weight in the quietest of places.  ""Fall First"" pits the hums of dueling industrial refrigerators
    against a downed power line's threatening pops and clicks; the result is a pulsing channel of eerie, creeping
    gloom.  However, this song is also the corridor into <i>Viscous Solid</i>'s holding pattern center.  ""Wish
    Eyes"" and ""Vio La"" drift into a tonal experimentalism that's effective, but somewhat banal next to tracks
    that blend their formless, swirling approach with subtle yet expressive rhythms.  ""Enter""'s layered bass
    tones ooze like black jelly, filling in the divots that line its backbone blips and cut-up acoustic chording.
    One of the album's strongest songs, ""Enter"" blends minimal techno's engaging, subtle rigidity with Aeroc's
    own penchant for six string-derived eclecticism.</p><p>
<i>Viscous Solid</i> actually grows stronger as it moves along, even with the occasional stall in momentum.
    The sunny, layered guitars of ""Onward... Upward"" are almost unexpected when they finally arrive, but that
    doesn't prevent the track from conjuring images of a Zip drive named Gordon Lightfoot playing a concert for
    out-of-work CPUs.  And emerald grass grows from between his microcircuits.  ""Summer's Almost Over"" closes
    things out with its insistent, stuttering plinks and channel-shifting swells.  Sticking around until its
    halfway mark brings a flurry of rangy acoustic snippets that surface trebly and flat, field recordings
    floating over what's become a multi-part rhythm when no one was watching.  That's how, in its best moments,
    <i>Viscous Solid</i> is like plugging an electroencephalogram into the pickup of a Guild.</p></div>"|451.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/451-viscous-solid/|7.0|Johnny Loftus

    that, rather than exploiting the foreign and exotic ""other,"" reveled in their exotic and foreign reflection
    of us.  The mix of familiarity and strangeness in Japanese imitations of American forms produced an
    equally hazy mix of sincerity and novelty in enjoyment.  But through experimentation with an ever-growing
    number of Western underground genres, the Japanese have moved in their own, enviable direction.  Lo-fi
    experimental rock is popular with the kids overseas (hence The Microphones' recent ""Live in Japan""), but
    there are only a handful of reciprocal acts that have made it over here so far.  Osaka-based duo Nagisa Ni
    Te are one, immersed in 60s/70s American psych-folk and a lo-fi connection to the natural world via
    imperfect multitracking and distracted guitar strumming.  Despite being billed as Japanese avant-folk,
    <i>The Same as a Flower</i> subsists on relatively standard, slow, guitar-based songs.</p><p>
    
    Fortunately, Nagisa Ni Te avoid sounding derivative, and some unique characteristics set them apart as
    worthy of attention.  The strongest of these is a pervasive aura of childlike innocence and wonder, usually
    an unconvincing pose when coming from American musicians.  Shinju Shibayama and Masako Takeda's direct,
    unprocessed and imperfect singing strikes at a deep and sincere place.  Some of their simple melodies are
    possessed with the placidity of lullabies, as in ""A Light"", while others run along the traditional pentatonic
    scale, such as in ""Thread of Souls"".  Nagisa Ni Te's songs balance a home-recorded sense of creation and
    experimentation with a propensity to swell into grand orchestral finales.  Yet while the mood remains
    wistful and appealing, the songwriting on <i>The Same as a Flower</i> is not that strong, offering few
    musical moments that linger beyond the immediate.  This forgetablilty works on some level in their favor--
    the album as a whole comes across as a wispy piece of lazy late-summer listening.  But overall, that
    lightness is what prevents the record from the transcendence to which it aspires.</p><p>
    
    Because of the duo's generally unremarkable songwriting, the album's best moments occur when Nagisa Ni Te
    get creative with arrangement and production.  ""River"" creates a big piece from a small idea, propelling a
    simple melody into rounds and canons that imitate the flowing, winding object of the song's title.  ""Wife""
    layers plucked, detuned guitars over a percolating organ beat, offering an instrumental island before the
    12-minute centerpiece ""Bramble"", which culminates in the album's most dense and distorted moment.  The slide
    guitars and ending strings and harmonies of ""After a Son"" embody the blooming psychedelia that Nagisa Ni Te
    hint at elsewhere.  And the sparse, acoustic closer ""Hope"" creates one of the album's most beautiful places,
    exemplifying the intimate, minimal sound that they're able to realize quite well.</p><p>
<i>The Same as a Flower</i> didn't make much of an impact the first time around, but it drew me back to
    repeated listens, and grew grander each time.  After the standard melodicism and fairly reserved sound,
    there remains something undeniably appealing about this male/female duo's unpretentious yet confident
    delivery.  If they can start writing songs that meet the standard of the musical stage they set, then
    we'll have a take on some classic genres that itself is worthy of imitation.</p></div>"|5699.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5699-the-same-as-a-flower/|6.8|Liam Singer

    Heavily nuanced and intensely personal, the book carefully contemplates the bizarre recovery of 2000-year
    old human bodies-- preserved with horrifying perfection-- from Denmark's massive bogs.  Unsurprisingly,
    Heaney had written about these bogs before, often cataloguing the stalled, ancient objects that had been
    dug up, wholly unchanged, from their weird, sludgy depths.</p><p>
    San Diego's Castanets, whose non-CDR debut has just been released by the Asthmatic Kitty imprint, express
    a similar fascination with swamp-culture, and the contemporary repercussions of age-old traditions.
    Nodding briefly to Six Organs of Admittance and the No-Neck Blues Band, the band leers large at American
    country's longstanding definitions: For Castanets, country music should sound like death, and more
    specifically, death-by-murky-submersion.</p><p>
    Frontman Raymond Raposa moos his deep gothic ballads like he's dog-paddling backwards through big Florida
    swamps, banging his knees on knobby cypress roots, ruffling pools of duckweed and featherfoil, desperately
    digging Spanish moss out from his nostrils, battling hard for buoyancy.  The process is slow, the water
    explicitly thick and unapologetically sinister, easing a dim, wet descent into Earth's impenetrable goo.
    But the bits Raposa brings back-- quivering promises, deadpan defeats-- are, like Heaney's un-antiquated
    artifacts, startlingly real.</p><p>
    With the help of his bandmates, Raposa's hollow, boxy vocals are set against spare funeral dirges (""Cathedral
    2""), stompy guitar throwdowns (""Industry and Snow"", the outstanding ""Three Days, Four Nights""), and planes
    of free-folk ping (""You Are the Blood"").  Still, Raposa's candlelit pipes are inevitably centered, shaking
    with loneliness and dread-- even guest vocalists Brigit DeCook and Liz Janes' murmurs and screams sound like
    they're coming from another room, their pale shouts muffled and heavy with desperation, chasing Raposa's
    grief.</p><p>
    Raposa does manage to pack in a few chances for air: ""As You Do"" takes a more traditional stab at classic,
    Americana-fed melancholy, with warbling slide guitar, sweet acoustic strums, and gentle percussion.
    Consequently, ""As You Do"" transforms into a gentle, rolling lament, more wheat fields than swamp scum.
    Closer ""Cathedral 4 (The Unbreaking Branch and Song)"" is fed by a sparkling backbeat and cute guitar
    noodles-- clocking in at just under 2\xBD minutes, it's a fleeting glimpse of solid land.</p><p>
    Raposa is reportedly working on a novel that will expound on the themes of <i>Cathedral</i>, and such literary
    aspirations aren't particularly surprising, given then poetic weight of the record, which nobly grapples with
    issues of faith, death, splitting synapses, eating breakfast, spirits, and landscapes.  And, like any good
    book, <i>Cathedral</i> the album is best suited to awkward late-night consumption, to be devoured while hiding
    under the sheets, clutching a flashlight, breathing heavy and deep.</p></div>"|1774.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1774-cathedral/|8.5|Amanda Petrusich

    Adamsville, called the Buford Pusser Highway.  It's four-lane now, but years ago it was only two lanes of
    blacktop over steep hills and wide curves.  Along this road were located both of the county's high schools,
    about 12 miles apart.  Often, before or after school, students would race from one to the other, and several
    graduating classes were absent at least one student killed along this road.  If you were fast enough, you
    could make it in eight minutes, but it depended on the absence of cops, and you had to have a good car--
    like a Corvette, the kind Sheriff Buford Pusser crashed on the same stretch back in 1974, a little over a
    year after the first biopic of his life, <i>Walking Tall</i>, was released.  Before he died, Pusser, a
    former wrestler, had earned his infamy ridding the county of the State Line Gang, which ran prostitution,
    drugs, and gambling rings as well as countless backwoods liquor stills.  Legend has it that he accomplished
    this moral purging wielding only an axe handle.  A historical placard now marks the spot where his car left
    the highway.</p><p>
    
    Pusser is part of what Patterson Hood calls ""the Mythological South"" in the liner notes to the Drive-By
    Truckers' sixth album, the inevitably titled <i>The Dirty South</i>.  The band has explored this mythological
    South on previous albums, most notably their double-disc <i>Southern Rock Opera</i>, and like Buford with
    his stick, they've busted up the larger-than-life myths of figures like George Wallace and Ronnie Van Zant.
    Similarly, this album doesn't reify or even demonize the late McNairy County sheriff, but simply demythologizes
    him.  As Hood announces at the beginning of a three-song suite about Pusser's legacy, ""This is the other side
    of that story.""</p><p>
    
    On ""The Boys from Alabama"" and ""The Buford Stick"", Hood relates the stories of the small-time shiners who
    lost their stills and their livelihoods to Pusser, who they claim was ""just another crooked lawman.""  In
    between, Mike Cooley sings ""Cottonseed"" in the voice of one of the State Line Gang who feels the burden of
    having dispatched so many souls to their Maker.  Neither Hood nor Cooley takes a side in this rural turf
    war, but they try to reveal another facet of the story and empathize with the people vilified by Pusser's
    legend.  For the Drive-By Truckers, black-and-white aggrandizement is much less interesting than gray-area
    truths, and in a sense, <i>The Dirty South</i> rescues the flawed man from the ideal perpetrated by the
    movies.</p><p>
    
    All of this would be dryly academic if the band's music wasn't so sturdy and solid.  As on previous albums,
    the Drive-By Truckers back their ambitious, word-dense songs with down-and-dirty Southern rock that's direct
    and bare-boned, yet often explosive.  The three songwriters-- Hood, Cooley and Jason Isbell-- are also three
    rowdy guitar players, and their triple-prong attack instills songs like ""Where the Devil Don't Stay"" and the
    live staple ""Lookout Mountain"" with a raw intensity.  Shonna Tucker, who replaced Earl Hicks on bass, and
    drummer Brad Morgan form a confident rhythm section, accommodating gritty guitar solos and letting the songs
    sprawl and stretch in unexpected directions. Though rooted in countless major influences-- from .38 Special
    to Skynyrd to The Band (as explained on Isbell's ""Danko/Manuel"")-- the Drive-By Truckers' Southern rock
    always sounds homemade, and like liquor from a still, it's extremely potent.</p><p>
    
    More crucially, they marshal this dynamic not only to tackle the South's icons, but more importantly to
    construct a sober, solemn view of everyday Southern life, whether through family histories like Hood's
    ""The Sands of Iwo Jima"" or story-songs like Cooley's racecar drama ""Daddy's Cup"".  ""Puttin' People on the
    Moon"" is an Alabama version of Springsteen's ""Atlantic City"" with higher stakes: Instead of escaping on
    that cross-city bus, the narrator loses his wife and friends to cancer (presumably from NASA testing) and
    lives out his life in inescapable drudgery, dealing drugs out his front door.  Isbell's starkly devastating
    closer ""Goddamn Lonely Love"" recounts the torture of a long-distance relationship; although this is only
    his second album as a Trucker, already he can hold his own with his seniors.</p><p>
    
    Granted, <i>The Dirty South</i> doesn't play on the band's brash humor like <i>Alabama Ass Whuppin'</i> or
    <i>Pizza Deliverance</i>, and it isn't nearly as personal an album as last year's <i>Decoration Day</i>:
    There are only one or two songs about the band members' own exploits and tragedies, so at times it lacks its
    predecessors' unshakable urgency and tough-mindedness.  On the other hand, aside from the Pusser suite in the
    middle, <i>The Dirty South</i> is more consistent and cohesive song-for-song, its wide scope more public than
    personal.  Rummaging through the iconography of the South, the Drive-By Truckers distill <i>Southern Rock
    Opera</i>'s myth-breaking and combine it with <i>Decoration Day</i>'s family photo album, and the result is
    a uniquely regional morality.  All of these people-- from legends like Sam Phillips (""the only man Jerry
    Lee would still call sir"") to family like Hood's grandfather (""He believed in God and country, things was
    just that way"")-- are points on a compass of good and evil, strong and weak, outraged and complacent,
    through which the Drive-By Truckers are seeking a true north.</p><p>
    
    Despite the recent resurgence of Southern rock, this quest for a populist sense of Southern identity-- as
    it applies to a community and not just to a woman or the rest of the band-- seems rare these days.  It's
    not just self-aware regionalism or Southern-by-the-grace-of-God cockiness, but something deeper: On these
    14 songs, the Drive-By Truckers find the connections between these larger-than-life figures and the
    life-size experiences that shaped them.  For them, the South is a stretch of highway where many have died,

""Could you be so
    kind as to perform some pigeon abatement on the front of your residence?"" the landlord notice-like sheet
    requests.  ""Birds [particularly pigeons] and their feces dust are THE main source of the human disease MAC
    [microbacterium aviary complex]... Walking past your residence, we are forced to not only breathe the
    excrement dust blowing about, but also be physically bombarded by the pigeons roosting above.""  And yet,
    when good health is perpetually endangered by the mundane, there is cause for celebration.  The EP's cover
    is adorned with Pigeon Funk's construction paper-cut, high school pep rally-stylized logo photographed on a
    sidewalk splot of pigeon dung.  The microhouse aerobics session heard on the record (supposedly inspired by
    how pigeons ""dance""), also finds bliss while the MAC fever kicks in your head.</p><p>
    Pigeon Funk is the side-project of Bay Area laptop-noise stalwarts Kit Clayton, Sutekh and Safety Scissors.
    ""Dorkcore"" could be the possible definition for their sound: a hybrid of noisecore and coagulated microhouse
    that typically hits the disco floor and falls down laughing after attempting to dance.  Is there an issue
    of life-threatening intoxication?  Possibly, but there's also an odd innocence at play here.  It reminds me
    of how an acquaintance spent 20 minutes telling people how the Empire State Building trumps the Transamerica
    Pyramid in size at San Francisco's Chinese New Year parade.  Pigeon Funk's eponymous debut could serve as
    dorkcore's Rosetta Stone.  The opener, ""Pied-billed Grebe"" awakens that genre with a digital-dub melody
    spraying forth in the air while bloops and blops scatter like leaves.  The Berlin-dub element (reflecting
    Clayton's solo flotation-tank meditations) reappears elsewhere in the levitating rhythms of ""Opposite of
    Opossum"", and how ""Anotherp""'s synth gloss paints the evening stars that can be barely seen through the
    ganja haze.</p><p>
    However, Pigeon Funk finds little need to break bread with Jah when the Saturday morning cartoons are on.
    ""Pigs on Fun"" sets this spirit with rickety toy-synth percussion and an electro-dancehall melody that
    jabbers with 20 tablespoons of sugar in its mouth.  Those same calories fatten ""Fly the Coop"" and its
    Pokémon-disco piece that spills cheap beer all over the carpet.  ""Pom Pomp Po P"" is the most accomplished
    moment, where contorted house number nearly sounds like a field recording of a financial district-block
    party with its slickly reverberated beats.</p><p>
    True to the oeuvres of Pigeon Funk's members, the minute-detail-per-second ratio is so high that the music
    demands several listens before noticing every bit of digital detritus.  The overall impact may be too busy
    and demanding for idle club listeners, but there's so little solemnity here that the bewildered needn't be
    too worried.  Here you have the Zappa-esque collage piece ""Pombo Doente"" that superimposes a NPR-dry voice
    instruction track about injured pigeon rescue techniques over a black market bazaar of FM radio-dial
    recklessness, nose-blowing, and disco breaks for kindergartners.  To rationalize the connection between
    aviary care and such cacophony would be just a wee bit pretentious, mind you.  However, the album's prime
    weakness is its homogenous, glib emotion that can grow wearisome over the course of 50 minutes.  Fortunately,
    the closer, ""Poule Bossa"" leaves listeners with a moment to take to the heart with a sleepwalking bossa nova
    tune that walks around the block until it gets falls into an open sewer and ascends through clouds of
    heavenly distortion toward the after-life.</p><p>
    Dorkcore is taking bodies.</p></div>"|6551.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6551-pigeon-funk/|7.7|Cameron Macdonald

    leave you craving a vat of fries from a corporation toward which the French
    are notoriously prone to arson.  Zeidel isn't French; she's everything but.
    Living and working in Paris, the singer/songwriter looks as though she devoutly
    avoids all forms of bad cholesterol.  Likewise, the songs on her third album
    are lean any way you slice 'em, varying from prudently understated to downright
    malnourished.  Yet, <i>Not Going Anywhere</i> brims with spotless pop melodies.
    The question is whether listeners will grasp such airy, unadorned fare.</p><p>
    
    Zeidel is no chanteuse; rather, she's a chirper, and a beautiful one at that.
    Her voice lays soft and low over <i>Not Going Anywhere</i>, gently touching
    down now and then, only to flit off after a few hushed syllables.  At times
    she's frustratingly reticent; over ""Polly""'s spare opening, she warbles when
    she ought to belt.  Other times she's nearly inaudible.  But then a certain
    artlessness is this album's vibe; it's best taken at face value as a comely
    collection of modest pop songs working nicely within their narrow dynamic
    confines and exploding with detail upon more careful examinations.</p><p>
    
    While it may be tempting to call this a folk record, its instrumentation is
    generally too ornate for that genre appellation.  Yet the title track (a
    strong if somewhat misleading opener) is unalloyed save a few coruscating
    string swells, and that's to Zeidel's benefit.  Her voice carries a lone
    acoustic guitar better than it would a lavish orchestra, and is easily
    smothered by overzealous production.  Hasty, soft-spoken verses on
    ""Sailor &amp; Widow"" are weighed down by a tepid blues vamp (though the track
    is salvaged by a massively catchy chorus), while ""Polly"" climaxes with a
    surfeit of gilt horns and tip-toeing glockenspiel, bearing an otherwise
    perfectly acceptable song toward kitsch.</p><p>
    
    While Zeidel seems to have abandoned her penchant for pasteurized trip-hop
    (aping Portishead and Massive Attack at best; at worst, a middling Dido
    impression) and nodded off toward a more traditional breed of songwriting,
    <i>Not Going Anywhere</i> deserves no adult-contemporary belittlement.  She's
    too sincere, her stylistic breadth too broad, her songs too emotive and
    endowed of too long and storied a history to invite that branding.  ""Sit
    in the Sun"" and ""By the Cathedral"" tug at opposing emotions, at once jocund
    and unsettling.</p><p>
    
    There's also a nagging spirituality to <i>Not Going Anywhere</i>, more secular
    than devout.  Children's choral intonations on ""End of May"" add to the aloof,
    otherworldly aura.  The young throats appear again, accompanied by a mildly
    stilted harpsichord on ""Right Now and Right Here"", to slightly less moving
    effect.  Still, these songs are thoroughly engrossing, and the world Zeidel
    bears the listener through is affable and beatific, if occasionally soporific.
    On ""Seventeen"", she sings, ""Life is a mellow dream, almost unspoken,"" and it
    somehow resonates beautifully: The song is the album's most somnolent, replete
    with lulling harp, bleary strings, and soft, almost undetectable wind instrument
    flourishes.  Stay awake if you can, and notice the scrupulous attention to detail
    that makes <i>Not Going Anywhere</i> such a pleasant listen.</p></div>"|450.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/450-not-going-anywhere/|7.5|Sam Ubl

    to the scene dwellers through David Swanson's yowling mouth and Moog squawk.  A bit older now, and with their
    rep attaché bulging, the trio has issued <i>Flamingo Honey</i>.  But apparently enamored of their own hype
    aura, they've spelled out ""too cool for school"" in wracked and twisted pipe cleaners and call the tangled
    and spiny mess a second album.  It's presumptuous and irritating, this recording of 10 one-minute songs.
    Presumptuous because at least two of those minutes are cocktease throwaways resting crumpled at the feet
    of Beck and Thurston Moore.  Time wasters.  Irritating, because a few other of these minutes gleam with
    something compelling, only to yank the rug right as we get our footing.</p><p>
    Types like The Locust get away with brief encounters of the weird kind 'cause their little songs are dense
    brutes or folded-up epics.  On <i>Flamingo Honey</i>, Whirlwind Heat have only given us ideas, random thought
    bubbles full of pickup sticks shaved to points and the notion that this all seemed like a hoot that day in
    the studio.  Opener ""The Bone"" is a warbling ellipsis at the end of Sonic Youth's <i>Sister</i>; ""The Meat
    Packers"", its noisy neighbor, is just insulting.  But then comes ""The H Is O"", and ""A Worm's Coat""-- both
    steps in the right direction.  These build kicky dance-punk rhythms in the style of the moment; Swanson's
    Moog isn't overbearing, and he almost sounds like Ben Kweller on the latter.  There might even be some
    influence from <i>Flamingo</i> co-producer Brendan Benson.  But then they're over.  The opposite of a
    one-joke <i>Saturday Night Live</i> sketch stretched to tedium, Whirlwind Heat tells us something good
    and takes it back just as quick.</p><p>
    Whirlwind Heat's primary influences (Devo, Brainiac) were adept at leaving just the smallest amount of space
    for melody.  The band tries that trick here, building ""Flamingo Lawns"" around a loping vocal and a cool Brad
    Holland drum beat.  But as it's obscured by Moog freakery around the 23-second mark, and a harmonica appears
    for some reason, the song becomes like an annoying ringtone on the bus.  Put that shit on vibrate, Whirlwind
    Heat!  And next time, have enough respect for the listener to make something whole from the fun of ""H Is O""
    or ""Lazy Morning""'s bittersweet melody and lonely whisper quality, because right now, it feels like you're
    coasting on self-congratulatory vapors.</p></div>"|8643.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8643-flamingo-honey/|2.9|Johnny Loftus

Or, she fascinates us in the same way we're drawn to religious and other mystical figures.  Yet, despite the cultural roles of artists as spiritual alchemists and conduits to where all of our trials and errors are given spectacular treatments and endearing portraits, we balk when they appear to have indulged themselves.  Why is this?  I understand that indulgence is supposed to be a sin, a crime against humanity and nature, but artists are among the very few whose responsibility for discovery supercedes an obligation to personal restraint.  After all, don't they usually pay for this by existing in a perpetually tortured state?  Most artists toil in obscurity, driven by nothing more than a vague compulsion to ""create,"" so self-indulgence is the least I can grant them in exchange for a few bits of divinity.</p><p>  And then there's Björk.  She seems pretty indulgent, and despite the enigmatic, moderately antisocial persona, I've never quite understood why I called her an artist.  As artistic qualifiers go, eccentricity is beyond superficial; it's downright misleading in most cases, and no matter the number of interesting musical concepts with which she aligns herself, I always figured ""real"" artists had to deliver a few concrete answers now and then.  Answers, if not about my world, then about Björk's.  I watched her sing ""Oceania"" (the first single from <em>Medulla</em>, though don’t try buying it, it's not for sale-- the artist strikes again!) at the Olympics, and it occurred to me that beyond the usual promotional gears at work, somebody must really feel she's important.  They could have had anyone-- say, a reassuring Celine Dion or a physically ideal Beyonce-- but they chose a prickly, decidedly uncomfortable Icelandic woman.  On aesthetic grounds, I can't argue with their choice, but I continue to wonder about Björk's significance.</p><p> <em>Medulla</em> suggests that if she is artistically important-- and I should preface all of this by stating I don't normally evaluate music or musicians based on my perception of their ""importance""; Björk simply makes it difficult to do otherwise-- it's as a small scale model of the same individualist, mundane obsessions that dominate popular culture.  Just as television networks bank on our interest in reality, Björk's emotional impact seems dependent on one's fascination with her.  <em>Medulla</em> (her fifth album, and first since 2001's imperfect, introspective <em>Vespertine</em>) presents no set of ideas more compelling than those concerning its creator, her whims and impressions.  That it's her a cappella record is just an interesting bonus, as it's no more or less ""her"" than any of her records.</p><p>  Ironically, the sound of Björk ""getting to the essence"" of herself is more dependent on outside musicians than usual.  In addition to producing collaborators Mark Bell, Matmos and Mark ""Spike"" Stent, Björk enlists the vocal talents of The Roots' Rahzel, Japanese beat-boxing wonder Dokaka, American freak-patron Mike Patton and English progressive pop icon Robert Wyatt, among others.  <em>Medulla</em> is the result of concentrated efforts on behalf of the best and brightest Björk could round up, and in the spirit of her symbolic godfather Miles Davis, betrays her knack for using talent to her best advantage.  Use of the human voice on this album will get the headlines, but the bulk of the story is rote Björk.</p><p>  That said, <em>Medulla</em> is her most musically adventurous record since <em>Post</em>.  ""Where Is the Line?"", featuring Patton's growl, an eerie choral arrangement and ingenious, jackhammer rhythm track powered by Rahzel and edited by Bell.   Björk's melody doesn't seem particularly interesting until you try to follow along amidst the cut-up beats and falling, wailing choral voices.  The machine-gun-precise percussive hits, accentuated by Patton's bullfrog squelch, hit harder than anything she's done since ""Army of Me"".  ""Pleasure Is All Mine"" begins as seductive, wordless call and panting, before melting into lush, gorgeously arranged harmonies and Björk's dream-noir melody.  She uses Patton's lower register to flesh out the arrangement, and her own singing is as powerfully resonant as anything I've heard from her.  Throughout the album, Björk's commitment to bringing out the strength of her melodies, despite considerable opportunity to get lost in the wall of sound, is admirable and the mark of someone who understands the importance of serving her songs.</p><p>  ""Oceania"" has been marketed as the ""radio single,"" though with its bizarre, swooping soprano lines and cyclical chord progression outlined by a chorus of Wyatt vocal samples, is hardly the most obvious choice to sell <em>Medulla</em>.  I'd have chosen the considerably more upbeat ""Who Is It"", which reminds me of ""Alarm Call"" from <em>Homogenic</em> in the way it applies Björk's idiosyncratic performances to a traditionally pleasant sounding template-- though ""Who Is It"" features a much more interesting chord progression during the verses, and an altogether incredible rhythm track, again provided by Rahzel.  The only other song on the record that might conceivably work on the radio (sans remix) is the house-y closer ""Triumph of a Heart"", featuring Dokaka's mouth percussion.</p><p>  The more atmospheric songs on <em>Medulla</em> are arguably its most evocative and powerful.  ""Vokuro"" (or ""Vigil"") is one of two songs sung in Björk's native Icelandic, and is in fact an adaptation of a piano piece by Jorunn Vidar.  Björk sings its plaintive strains accompanied by a solemn choir, and brings out its inherently hymn-like qualities.  Wyatt overwhelms ""Submarine"" with his ghostly, striking vocals, thickly layered and overdubbed.  Björk doesn't even enter with the melody for almost a minute-and-a-half, by which time Wyatt has already made his redoubtable mark.  Not to be outdone, Björk's collage of sighs, whispers, cries and otherwise indescribable sounds on ""Ancestors"" might scare fans accustomed to a steady diet of actual songs.  It reminds me of the work of American experimental vocalist and composer Meredith Monk (Björk has performed her ""Gotham Lullaby"" in concert several times), though some folks may just hear it as the ""unlistenable"" song on <em>Medulla</em>.</p><p> <em>Medulla</em> is an interesting record.  It continues Björk's run of releases that sound nothing like their predecessors, yet is, as ever, particular to her.  Furthermore, she's found a way to bathe her immediately distinctive melodies and vocal nuances in a solutions that cause me to reevaluate her voice and her craft. I shouldn't be surprised: She's made a career of making me interested in her world of sound.  And that she doesn't appear to be short on ideas 25 years into her professional career should end all speculation.</p><p> </p></div>"|737.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/737-medulla/|8.4|Dominique Leone

    quite like a public drug freakout.  I'm not saying drugs are right for everybody-- kids, stay away from
    crack unless you think you've got a pretty good shot at getting famous-- but through the years, drug
    addiction has consistently remained the ultimate in-style rockcessory of all fashion's fickle vicissitudes.
    For the layperson, addiction may be a tragic, often painful disease; for rock stars, it's simply bolsters
    ""mystique.""  Alright, I'm teasing, you got me.  Addiction is pretty terrific for everyone.</p><p>
    Nevertheless, plenty has been made of Libertines frontman Pete Doherty's battle with crack, and I was fully
    prepared to not say another word-- right up until I realized that The Libertines' self-titled follow-up to
    2002's <i>Up the Bracket</i> was indeed all about them and the interior struggles caused by Doherty's very
    public addiction.  It's all a glitzy mess with a fair share less charm than the debut, and whether <em>The
    Libertines</em> is a wreck by design, or simply reflects the still-fractured state of the band in recovery,
    no one can say.  All that's clear is that, once again, in the fishbowl of celebrity, addiction is being
    spun into a PR coup, a thing to be pitied, laughed at, cried at, forgiven, and ultimately used as just
    another excuse-- mostly for why this isn't a better album.  The woes of drug use arise here at intervals,
    concluding with the romantic lament, ""What became of the likely lads?/ What became of the dreams they had?""
    They signed with Sanctuary and released a slapdash second album; are you guys kidding me?</p><p>
    Considering the great heights this album occasionally reaches, it's a bit of a left-handed compliment to
    level the lone criticism that it seems hopelessly tossed-off.  It's brilliant at points, exhibiting the
    casual, grimy grace that laced <em>Up the Bracket</em> through English countryside benders, sing-alongs,
    and pub anthems, but evidently, The Libertines are creatures of excess, and even a good thing can be
    overdone.  Bands pull off ""accidental genius"" with more frequency than anyone has a right to expect--
    Pavement founded an empire based on it-- but even if The Libertines are more hits than misses here, it
    still takes a little more than slurred speech and sloppy guitars to drive this act home.</p><p>
    Instead of lending the skiffling, slightly skewed rhythms a special air of irreverence, or making the
    occasionally off-key barbershop caterwaul sound a little sweeter, as on <i>Up the Bracket</i>, <i>The
    Libertines</i>' half-assed effort here produces half-assed results.  Insouciance paid dividends for them
    in 2002 as they thumbed their noses at rock, dub, folk, and every other genre in arm's reach, but if you
    can possibly imagine it, that shambling style-blender was actually <em>tighter</em> then, both in terms of
    songwriting and cohesiveness.</p><p>
    The only issue here is one of investment (or possibly a calculated lack thereof), since little seems to
    have outwardly changed, except perhaps Doherty's singing.  To his credit, his vocal resemblance to Julian
    Casablancas is downplayed, as he instead opts to rely on his considerable natural vocal character over
    needless imitation, but with that, so goes the one polished instrument The Libertines had at their disposal.
    Carl Barât still has a stranglehold on Joe Strummer's uber-Cockney accent, and puts it to good use in the
    rowdy, fuck-all fashion that's expected, if sometimes too effectively (see: the staggering, raucously
    incoherent rant of ""Don't Be Shy""); but when Doherty goes on to slosh his own path through the impossibly
    English ""Narcissist"" (""Wouldn't it be nice to be Dorian Gray/ Just for a day?""-- that's Oscar Freakin' Wilde,
    folks), the vocal contrast between the two becomes conspicuous in its absence.</p><p>
    But what the hell, even ""Narcissist"" is still a riot.  The worst that can ever be said of this album is that
    if it suffers from an excess of half-formed ideas, or a lack of effort (even if a little extra elbow grease
    could've made some otherwise marginal songs much, much better), it's because they're too busy having fun,
    asshole.  The one thing The Libertines excel at without qualification is pure entertainment; they may not
    be masters of any of the styles they crazily flirt with, or even possibly talented enough to produce the
    craftsmanship this album begs for at points, but they string genres together so readily and wildly that it's
    tempting to allow one's self to be swept away in barrage and just have a great time in the face of other
    shortcomings.  You're just lucky that someone was diligent enough to resist all the fun this album promises
    and point them out for you; if not, you might hear the quiet call-and-response of ""Can't Stand Me Now"" or
    the infectious groove-stomp of ""Campaign of Hate"" or any of the myriad other relentlessly enjoyable moments
    on this album and forget that The Libertines aren't trying very hard.  Boo.</p><p>
    Okay, you caught me, I'm kidding; <em>The Libertines</em> is a charge.  But it does still seem unfortunate
    that The Libertines don't more frequently reach the heights at which their music frequently hints here:
    The echoing chords and free-form trumpet of the sprawling sea shanty ""The Man Who Would Be King"" best
    exemplify The Libertines' lack of stylistic allegiance.  Barely more than a string of ""la-la-la""'s and a
    chorus, the lightning riffs and hollow, dramatic spaces still kick sand in the faces of the rest of
    the album cuts.  The song is outdone only by the incomparable solo on ""The Ha Ha Wall""-- indescribably
    brief, bright, evocative, and maybe the single finest moment The Libertines will ever lay to tape-- and
    ""Music When the Lights Go Out"", a genuinely sad, sweet tune with lots of cowbell and a chorus of earth-shaking
    majesty.  These tracks show what might've been.</p><p>
    Instead, The Libertines settle for less because demanding more would've been harder.  And lest we forget why this
    album was a necessary casualty, the obvious (and crass) snorting that opens ""Last Post on the Bugle"" is an
    unnecessary hint.  Cocaine, crack, whatever-- whether their self-titled second album is a wreck on purpose
    or not, drugs are The Libertines' reason, and it's not a very good one.</p></div>"|4771.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4771-the-libertines/|7.1|Eric Carr

    may be a leading contender for Rookie of the Year.  Granted, the Canadian artist has a few releases under
    his belt, but <i>Chewing Glass &amp; Other Miracle Cures</i> represents a marked departure from Sixtoo's
    underground hip-hop roots and, in effect, serves as an ideal (re)introduction to one of Ninja Tune's most
    promising new additions.</p><p>
    
    Where Sixtoo differs from so many artists that beg a quick glance in the DJ Shadow Thesaurus is his newfound
    reliance on live instrumentation.  Squire has humbly described this album as a ""learning experience"" in the
    arrangement of live instruments, but tracks like the three-part ""Boxcutter Emporium"" suite, each deliberate
    and subtly constructed amalgams of abstract electronic flourishes and live drum and bass accompaniment,
    demonstrate an emerging mastery of dark trip-hop composition.</p><p>
    
    Recent touchstones include tourmates Blockhead and DJ Signify, whose collaborations with Sage Francis and
    Buck 65 are echoed in Sixtoo's few MC appearances.  On ""Funny Sticks (Reprise)""-- a spare rendition of the
    original ""Funny Sticks"" from 2001's <i>Antagonist Survival Kit</i>-- and ""Horse Drawn Carriage"", Sixtoo
    exhibits an awareness of his limitations as a rapper, and channels all of his energies as a lyricist into
    these limited appearances on the mic.  ""Sticks"" is an enraged expression of class unrest, and ""Carriage"",
    rapped in Buck 65's style of broken poetry, is an abstract exploration of guilt and vanity.  Sixtoo doesn't
    quite equal the skills of his former Anticon collaborators, but these tracks provide an adequate bridge
    between his intricate acoustic compositions and former hip-hop gloom.</p><p>
    
    Contributions from Godspeed You! Black Emperor cellist Norsola Johnson and bassist Thierry Amar blend
    seamlessly with Sixtoo's arrangements; Johnson's somber cello accompaniment is a standout on ""Snake Bite"",
    an ominous slow jam steeped in buzzing lo-fi distortion.  Eric Craven from The Hanged Up and Matt Kelly
    provide further support on drums and keyboard/guitar, respectively, and actually outshine their GYBE!
    contemporaries on a few occasions.  Kelly's effects and overdubs on Rhodes and Stylophone (a creepy-sounding
    little organ that's currently my favorite instrument of all time) on the sublime ""Old Days Architecture""
    constitute an album highlight, while Craven's live drumming flawlessly fuses with Sixtoo's frenetic
    electronic beats.</p><p>
    
    The real scene-stealer, though, is Can's Damo Suzuki, whose improvised vocals on ""Storm Clouds &amp; Silver
    Linings"" propel the album's most disorienting and defining track.  Backward tape manipulation shapes and
    fractures a frantic looped breakbeat, which spits and stutters behind Suzuki's vocals, and a slithering,
    nearly amorphous bassline and piercing guitar stabs further elevate the song's nightmarish qualities.  About
    midway through the track, Suzuki drops his hushed whispers and off-tune singing for a bizarre, throaty
    intonation that suggests some kind of perverse Louis Armstrong/Yamatsuka Eye hybrid.</p><p>
    
    The album's only significant fault is an overabundance of B-material and filler, which creates a distinct
    lag in the album's middle section.  ""Transient Control"" and ""Chainsaw Buffet"" suffer from an overextension
    of vaguely intriguing but repetitive musical ideas, and tracks like ""The Honesty of Constant Human Error""
    fall prey to atypically aimless jamming.  The album's filler is made all the more conspicuous by Sixtoo's
    admittance in his liner notes that this style of composition is ""risky"" and can often sound ""weak.""  On
    future releases, he would do well to take his own apprehension to meandering improvisation closer to heart.</p><p>
    
    Fortunately, Sixtoo is as confident in his composing abilities as he is aware of his weaknesses, and this
    can certainly be considered his watershed album.  Where so many electronic artists demonstrate their ""legitimate""
    acoustic abilities with the insistence of a neglected studio musician, Sixtoo's development as live musician
    and composer comes across as natural and well-suited to his talents.  In the morass of this year's more
    indulgent statements of acoustic aptitude, <i>Chewing Glass &amp; Other Miracle Cures</i> stands out as an
    admirably genuine fusion of acoustic composition with the sensibilities of electronic music.</p></div>"|7777.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7777-chewing-glass-other-miracle-cures/|7.8|David Moore

Take live
    hip-hop, for example.  Though no group has stepped into mainstream success like The Roots, several smaller
    acts across the country-- S.F.'s Variable Unit, the Twin Cities' Heiruspecs, the Breakestra out of L.A.--
    have actually brought new elements to the form and elevated its standards. But they're the exception: Truth
    is, most rhythm sections lack the heavyweight punch to contend with an 808's bionic beats, and jammy
    arrangements can give too much slack to hip-hop's streamlined urgency.  Without inspired songcraft and a
    novel approach, even the best MC will get swept out to a sea of watered-down funk.</p><p>
    
    With their second LP, Oakland's Crown City Rockers bring a surprisingly fresh, well-rounded sound that
    reiterates just how good live hip-hop can be when done right.  Without copping a single note, they give a nod
    to The Roots' <i>Do You Want More?!!!??!</i> days, easily tempering organic, jazzy dynamics with concrete
    beats and streetwise production.  Rather than taking the classic <i>Illadelph</i> bebop approach,
    <i>Earthtones</i> looks to the mid-70s soul-jazz of Donald Byrd and Lonnie Liston Smith for inspiration.
    Most prominent are the textured keyboards of Kat Ouano, applied equally with ballsy aggression for a banging
    club feel (""Fortitude"") and deft understatement for smoother meditations (""Fate"", ""No Sense"").  By balancing keys,
    bass, drums, and dense, MPC-generated breaks, producers Headnotic and Woodstock arrive at a flawless balance
    of instrumental spontaneity and programmed precision.</p><p>
    
    But the real star here is MC Rashaan Ahmad.  In the few years that Crown City Rockers have existed, they've
    undergone a name change, lost a key member, and released an underdeveloped debut album.  Ahmad has clearly
    evolved with the band, working through adversity, sharpening his skills, and shaping his on-the-mike persona.
    With <i>Earthtones</i> he emerges as one of the West Coast's premiere MCs, his flow effortless and vocabulary
    expansive.  He brings an everyman context to his rhymes, making the mundane dramatic with a subtle righteousness
    and around-the-way likability.  He comes downright heroic on ""Another Day"", the album's first single, rapping,
    ""Rhyme writing, pressure's on/ I wanna move to the desert, play guitar songs/ Wanna move away from the city,
    crime and fear/ But I know the world needs me here.""  ""Heat"" lives up to its name, Ahmad's scathing delivery
    hammering over a heavy breakbeat workout and a flurry of horns and <i>Superfly</i>-style strings.</p><p>
    
    On an album full of well-considered positivity, only the haterrific ""Simple"", stands out as a misstep--
    its sultry vocal sample and languid SoCat beat aren't quite up to the task of salvaging its bratty content.
    That, however, is just carping-- there isn't much to not like here.  With this one exception, the album
    stays on track start to finish, peppering Ahmad's verbal calisthenics with occasional instrumental workouts
    that make for an absorbing ebb and flow.  Combining ingredients as natural as they are effective, <i>Earthtones</i>
    is a great example of hard work made to look easy.</p></div>"|1773.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1773-earthtones/|7.7|Jonathan Zwickel

Now|1283.0|Steve Earle|['Rock']|0.0|0.0|0.0|['Artemis']|2004-08-30 00:00:00|2004|2016-06-11 21:09:53.583657|"<div class=""contents dropcap"" data-reactid="".2dto6a8a3gg.1.6:0.1.0.$2650/=1$2650.0.3.2.0.1.0.1""><p>Hey, Steve, when does the revolution start?  The title of Steve Earle's 12th album, silly as it is, could be
    seen as a nudge against Earle's previous release, the controversy magnet <i>Jerusalem</i>.  His highest-profile
    record in ages, if not his highest-selling, it contained the O'Reilly-baiting ""John Walker's Blues"",
    an explication of the American Taliban's motives that was vilified for having the audacity to humanize the
    enemy, which Fox pundits and Nashville DJs saw as matter-of-factly treasonous.</p><p>
    
    There's little on <i>The Revolution Starts... Now</i> that's likely to ruffle as many feathers as that song--
    i.e., nothing quite so revolutionary-- although two early tracks try their damnedest.  ""Rich Man's War"" draws
    similarities between an American soldier named Jimmy and an Iraqi insurgent named Ali, both of whom Earle
    describes as ""just another poor boy off to fight a rich man's war.""  Anyone with an American flag license
    plate holder is going to find parallels like these at least disagreeable and at most offensive (although
    Earle may have a better chance of reaching swing listeners than many dissenting acts).  Like ""John Walker's
    Blues"","" the song works hard to make both Jimmy and Ali seem sympathetic, and while the effort is laudable,
    the result is less than compelling.</p><p>
    
    Faring far worse, both politically and artistically, is ""Warrior"", a spoken-word song full of purple-prose
    lyrics along the lines of, ""Your faithful retainer stands resolute/ To serve his liege lord without recompense/
    Perchance to fall and perish namelessly.""  Rather than being merely unrevolutionary, it sounds more like an
    embarrassment.  It doesn't help that the song is sandwiched by a forgettable trucker anthem (""Home to Houston"")
    and a story-song (""The Gringo's Tale"") that takes forever to set up and then falls apart with a disappointing
    anticlimax that sounds as calculated as a stump speech.</p><p>
    
    Ironic considering its title, <i>The Revolution Starts... Now</i> is halfway over before it picks up with
    the one-two punch of ""Condi Condi"" and ""F the CC"".  The latter rocks the album's catchiest shout-out and
    is stage-ready for an audience pumping fists and singing along with, ""Fuck the FCC/ Fuck the CIA/ Fuck the
    FBI/ Living in the motherfuckin' USA.""  As it finally breaks down into a Ramones-style spellalong, the song
    becomes the most righteously defiant track on the entire album.</p><p>
    
    Earle sings ""Condi Condi"", a tongue-in-cheek-and-in-other-places ode to our current national security adviser,
    with <i>Daily Show</i>-esque straight-faced aplomb, and it should have fans lowering their pumping fists to
    cover their mouths as they chuckle over lines like, ""Skank for me, Condi.""  While neither is as outright
    hilarious as Eric Idle's ""FCC Song"", both songs are a much-needed laugh amid all this election-year
    seriousness, and like a tent pole, they prop up an otherwise sagging album.</p><p>
    
    ""Comin' Around"", a duet with Emmylou Harris, and ""I Thought You Should Know"" rein in the politics in favor
    of more personal matters.  While the songs may seem out of place on an album bearing this title, Earle lets
    them remind his listeners-- as if they need reminding-- that life continues during wartime, more or less
    the same as before.  Heartache and happiness, dread and disappointment aren't exclusive to political anxiety,
    and these songs make the album sound less like a manifesto than a document of a year spent watching the
    dead-heat elections and going about your business.</p><p>
    
    Good as some of these songs are-- and the entire album is better than Nicholson Baker's similarly anti-war
    novel <i>Checkpoint</i>-- they're not quite enough to foment a revolution, and Earle closes the album with
    a lengthy reprise of the title track, which creates a bookend effect without actually building to anything
    specific.  He's always been a deeply political musician, a radical in a genre whose stock-in-trade these
    days seems to be tradition.  His ideology informs just about all of his albums to some degree, but politics
    as an overt subject may not be his forte, as <i>The Revolution</i> attests.</p></div>"|2650.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2650-the-revolution-starts-now/|6.8|Stephen M. Deusner

Good for them.  In that
    spirit, I'll cut short my obligatory introduction and bring you straight to the Edinburgh group's lovelorn,
    unfortunately still-beating heart, exposed by the oh-so-unadorned production:</p><p>
<i>""Love is a verb and a noun as well<br/>
    You find it in the dictionary under 'L'""</i></p><p>
    
    That little witticism comes from ""Love Is an Arrow"", written and sung by Riley Briggs.  Based on one photo,
    Briggs looks like a young Anthony Michael Hall, though his vocals chart a fairly standard indie course,
    borrowing from Neil Young (""A Friend Like You""), Ben Gibbard (""What You Do"") and plain-spoken sensitive
    guys everywhere.</p><p>
    
    Listen, some of my best friends are plain-spoken sensitive guys.  Some of my favorite albums consist of
    campfire singalongs by bands with modest acoustic guitar chops, cute names and still-cuter accents.  But
    those lyrics!  No band that would sing such words deserves the easily made comparisons to fellow Scots
    Belle &amp; Sebastian or even Camera Obscura, let alone those earnest Aussies, The Lucksmiths.  (Compare them
    to twee progenitors like The Pastels or Talulah Gosh and you owe me your cardigan.)  Of course, with a
    moniker nipped from a Scottish vacation destination, Aberfeldy practically beg for such name-dropping.
    But there's no need to encourage them.</p><p>
    
    Throughout the record, Briggs shows a predisposition toward bungling the old English teachers' motto: show,
    not tell.  This may be the result of a medical condition, like dyslexia, in which case we should hold our
    snark.  Still, it seems like this guy can't open his mouth without saying nothing.  ""So sad you're leaving,""
    he sings on ""Out of Love""; ""I'm so lonely now she's gone,"" he adds on ""Tie One On"", which teems with such
    vivid storytelling.  He goes on to rhyme ""sacred"" with ""wasted"" and ""reasons"" with ""leaving"" until somewhere
    the editor of a rhyming dictionary loses her job.</p><p>
    
    As is so often the case, Aberfeldy are at their best when they stumble beyond trite infantilism.  First
    single ""Vegetarian Restaurant"" lopes along with winning ""Tangled Up in Blue"" guitar strums, accented with
    subtle fiddles and lovely boy/girl harmonies.  What Briggs is seemingly aiming at on the album is a cheerful,
    unpretentious look at the everyday; here, he finally makes the everyday interesting.  ""I like the way that
    you dance when you're in the kitchen,"" he says, and I'm willing to see where the dance takes him.  Then he
    proclaims, ""Sometimes I can't believe you're even human,"" and I duck for cover.  Speaking of aliens,
    ""Heliopolis by Night"" is the record's next-strongest track (and incidentally, its <i>second</i> single),
    a whimsical spaceship song complete with nose-held vocals.  It's not perfect, but it's unique.</p><p>
    
    So yeah, <em>Young Forever</em> was recorded on one microphone.  And yeah, that means the warm acoustic pop
    heats up my headphones like a veritable heliopolis.  I can't help but root for an album that begins ""I love
    everyone,"" because the last thing the indie world needs is another batch of sullen, well-dressed scenesters.
    Yet, as in any relationship, just because you love someone doesn't mean they'll love you back.  ""There is
    nothing in the world as beautiful as you,"" Gibbs tells us in a tender moment.  He probably means it.  Good
    for him.  Even if he doesn't, I hope it gets him laid.</p></div>"|1.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1-young-forever/|3.4|Marc Hogan

    with extra features, usually in the form of some multimedia content on the disc, like a video for the lead
    single, or a ""making of"" rockumentary.  It's a good way to get people interested in actually buying the
    physical record when they could probably get it for free, though a lot of times you have to question whether
    or not the extra content even took any effort to compile.</p><p>
    Spain's Migala and the Acuarela Discos label have apparently figured out the whole ""value-added"" concept, as
    they've gone and included a whole DVD with <i>La Increíble Aventura</i>, the band's fifth album (counting
    <i>Restos de un Incendio</i>, which reworked a number of their old songs for U.S. release).  The disc contains
    a distinct video for every song on the album, including the untitled 50-second interlude track.  They range
    from beautiful and evocative to just plain puzzling, but watching them greatly alters one's perception of
    the album, as they flesh out and occasionally offer counterpoint to the moody songs Migala have cooked up
    here.</p><p>
    From the start, it's clear that this is Migala's darkest album, and its mostly instrumental format separates
    it even further from the band's past output.  At first, it seems the band is building to some sort of political
    statement, titling the opening song ""El Imperio de Mal"" (""The Evil Empire""), but as the tribal drumming and
    chanting of the intro peels back, they insert not a sample of some American politician, but of Darth Vader
    calling Obi-Wan Kenobi to his death.  This subversion of the music's melancholy tone and the soaring passion
    of the band's playing occurs several times over the course of the album, and even more often on the DVD-- the
    video for ""El Imperio"" features a stop-motion kitchen in the grip of a stroboscopic poltergeist and a coffee
    pot lifting its lid in unison with James Earl Jones' Vaderisms.</p><p>
    With its blaring guitars and cathartic rush of rhythm, ""El Imperio"" is actually one of the album's highlights,
    and the two vocal tracks, sandwiched together mid-album make for a sublime central plateau.  ""Your Star, Strangled""
    is gentler than its title, as Abel Hernandez's mellow baritone mixes with hushed harmonica, violin and slide
    guitar in an arresting nocturnal swirl, while ""El Gran Miercoles"" opens with a long, hushed intro of searching
    guitars and crashing waves.  The video for the song is a grainy 8mm vacation video filmed on a Mediterranean
    beach, and that hazy recollection is easy to read in the music, as Hernandez whispers lines about the sand
    beneath his feet while the song grows quieter and quieter, finally giving way to a sample of the waves
    before the band picks up the baton Godspeed You Black Emperor! dropped on <i>Yanqui U.X.O.</i> and runs
    with it, a wash of guitars droning triumphantly.</p><p>
    The vocal tracks are something of a double-edged sword for the album as a whole, though, because their quality
    leaves you wishing for a few more, despite the pleasantness of instrumentals like the propulsive ""Sonnenwende"".
    The instrumentals have an overall consistency of tone and approach that causes them to bleed together somewhat;
    the videos perhaps do the most to lend them emotional variety with their footage of slow-motion fireworks,
    brightly lit carnival rides, flamenco dancers and, er, leather-jacketed guys in tiger masks fighting kung-fu-style
    on a mountain.  <i>La Increíble Aventura</i> doesn't quite equal the sheer power and range of the band's
    best albums (2001's <i>Arde</i>, in particular), but it's a powerful statement nonetheless, capturing one of
    Spain's greatest exports at their darkest and most ferocious.</p></div>"|5280.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5280-la-increible-aventura/|7.8|Joe Tangari

I think it's safe to speculate that     former Screaming Trees vocalist Mark Lanegan has spent his share of time on a barstool, between the pages     of the Black Sparrow Press.</p>
<p>But Lanegan is no Chinaski-come-lately, and he's got the voice to prove it.  As     scratchy as a three-day beard yet as supple and pliable as moccasin leather, Lanegan's voice has evolved     into a remarkable instrument, one that couldn't have been earned by easy living.  It's a voice that redeems     him a lot of sins, which is fortuitous because on <i>Bubblegum</i> his songs weave precariously between     heartfelt depictions of the seedy life and hardboiled cliche.</p>
<p>On previous solo albums, like 1998's <i>Scraps at Midnight</i> or 2001's masterful <i>Field Songs</i>,     Lanegan explored various pre-rock forms like blues, gospel and country to mesmerizing effect.  But his     recent cameo with Queens of the Stone Age seems to have revived his tooth for the harder stuff, so with     the help of guests like Greg Dulli, Dean Ween, Stone Agers Josh Homme and Nick Oliveri, and, yes, Izzy     friggin' Stradlin, <i>Bubblegum</i> features a partial return to Lanegan's grungier days of yore.  The     seamy din generated by this revolving ensemble provides a well-matched backdrop for the relentless     parade of petty violence, drug deals gone sour, and squalid love affairs portrayed in these songs.</p>
<p>That's not to say that the whole thing comes off perfectly.  Noisier tracks like ""Can't Come Down"" or the     clanking ""Methamphetamine Blues"" sound undigested and vaguely dated-- almost as though they were written     for Girls Against Boys' <i>Freak*On*Ica</i> album, which is about as succinct a definition of ""misfire"" as     you could want.  ""Methamphetamine Blues"" is particularly rough, as Lanegan briefly goes Ian Astbury on us,     calling out to his female back-up singers, ""Rollin' children, keep on rollin'.""  (They respond by calling     him ""daddy."")  I keep waiting for him to belt out, ""C'mon li'l sister!"" here, but alas, he leaves me hanging.</p>
<p>Fortunately, these occasional clunkers are more than outnumbered by the album's highlights, which include a     pair of smoldering duets with PJ Harvey-- ""Hit the City"" and ""Come to Me""-- either of which could slip     unnoticed as a bonus track onto <i>Uh Huh Her</i>.  It's also hard to not be delighted by ""Sideways in     Reverse"" and ""Driving Death Valley Blues"", Lanegan's most bare-knuckled rockers since the demise of his     former band.  Additionally, he has few peers, particularly in his age bracket, when it comes to tackling     moody, blues-infused numbers like the opening ""When Your Number Isn't Up"" or the Tom Waits-ish ""Like Little     Willie John"".</p>
<p>Throughout <i>Bubblegum</i>, Lanegan proves himself adroit at navigating the back alleys of Babylon, but     after the record's umpteenth reference to loaded shotguns, '73 Buicks, and goin' cold turkey, one can't help     but think he might eventually want to take a stab at some new material.  So far, his voice has proven to be     well-suited for whatever use he has put it to; hopefully next time he strays a little further afield to     better stretch its limits.</p></div>"|4679.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4679-bubblegum-with-mark-lanegan-band/|7.2|Matthew Murphy

    common image of the label's entire roster uniting around a bonfire, or heading out for some kind of musical
    picnic, with a four-track recorder along to capture the event.  By now, these types of releases are expected
    several times a year from the label, with one caveat: The communal nature of these all-for-one projects
    consistently traps too many ideas in too tight a space.</p><p>
    
    Though certain K artists have been able to combine each member's contributions into a cohesive, visionary
    whole (The Microphones, Yume Bitsu), most have been unable to straddle the line between preserving tight-knit
    relationships with fellow ""family"" members and creating a piece of work that stands alone.  And while Kyle
    Field fares better than most on his sixth album as Little Wings, the K aesthetic still detracts.  At their
    heart, these youthful folk songs are spare and gentle, but frequently, multiple instruments are stacked
    atop them, and their clamor cuts into the songs' simplistic intentions.  ""Sing Wide"", for example, lopes
    along a static-laced bassline and stark acoustic guitar part before the sound of shaky, lunatic-fringe
    background voices overrides its jailed boom and distracts from the track's aspiring message.</p><p>
    
    Elsewhere, ""Uncle Kyle Says"" fails in its attempt at bemused charm and winds up corny and unhinged.  Limber
    with Field's sandman lessons to his nieces and nephews, its overwrought cuteness has the effect of studio
    downtime committed to tape.  All ramshackle frolic and are-we-rolling spontaneity, the song breaks apart
    the restful ease of the songs placed around it.  You can practically hear the K collective urging Field to
    leave it on the album, half-lark and misplaced signifier.</p><p>
    
    Yet, when Field manages to sneak off into the woods and shed himself of his labelmates, his basic folk
    arrangements rival the best of field-bedded acts like Iron &amp; Wine and Vetiver.  Opener ""Everybody"" could
    smooth the scar tissue of the most hardened cynic; its campfire acoustic guitars crackle under Field's
    voice, easing listeners into the album with its clean, immediate warmth.  ""So What?"" is a lonely piano
    ballad dissolving at the seams.  Sagging with melancholy and spitfire remorse, it continually threatens to
    fall apart, and acts as a breather at the album's midpoint.</p><p>
    
    Closer ""Darkened Car"" circles back to the album's hymnal beginnings.  Recorded in a hushed, closeted space,
    Field strips the song bare to acoustic guitar and one background voice.  The ideal endpoint for an album so
    reliant on evanescence, it's almost a shame there's audible evidence of this recording.  Could they only
    have faded into the empty walls and spider-cracked windows of a foreclosed house, Field's wistful lines,
    ""In a darkened car, you're only who you say you are,"" might have found symbiotic expression.</p><p>
    
    With August at full burn, the summer melds into <i>Magic Wand</i>'s sunstroke imagery, and its shaded
    daydream descends to its obvious birthing, issued from stankheat and cicada cries.  So, yes, Magic Wand

    mouth moving maniacally.  The skyline of the city behind is aflame as hordes of victims and refugees of
    the last days of capitalism mill and surge to escape some unknown terror.  Suddenly, a great leader, our
    savior, morphs into a giant bald eagle, snapping and chewing as he devours his supplicants in snatches.
    The sky darkens.  And then a vacuous-looking man slides into view, mouthing along to some utterly benign,
    meaningless and clumsy lyrics.  This is no ""vision""-- it's just another stupid music video for another
    stupid band.  Watching MTV these days sort of gives you the feeling that some bands are trying <i>way</i>
    too hard.</p><p>
    
    One of those bands is Hope of the States, who have received rapturous press in the UK, with critics rolling
    out heavy names as reference points-- Godspeed! You Black Emperor, Radiohead, Mogwai, Manic Street Preachers.
    Oh, and Muse, which seems appropriate because Hope of the States make big-budget music mostly in that vein.
    These are summer-blockbuster songs, overdriven and overproduced simply because they can be, with little-to-no
    actual substance behind the heavy-effects bluescreen.  Hope of the States waste no time getting to the point
    on <i>The Lost Riots</i>, their musical <i>ID4</i>: The opening instrumental ""The Black Amnesias"" begins with
    a solitary, maudlin, plucked guitar line and escalates slowly, pausing dramatically here and there until it
    explodes into an immense epic rock-opera piece, complete with wailing violins and high-diving crescendos.
    It is exquisitely horrible.</p><p>
<i>The Lost Riots</i>, like the aforementioned music video, plays on terrifying, portentous imagery throughout.
    Ruins and riots and fires and chaos are littered and strewn across the songs.  An ever-present shadowy enemy
    seems to straddle the mess, but even when picking through the concrete debris and digging for scraps below
    the surface, the clues and signs crumble away in your fingers.  It's impossible to determine whom Hope of
    the States are railing against: George Bush and the U.S.?  The West in general?  Capitalism?  But I guess
    it's important that they're pissed off about something.  Yeah.  It's important to have fire.  It gives you
    something to write an album about.  But after removing the immense weight of the music, there's an emptiness
    to the songs at their core.  And strangely, singer Sam Herlihy admits as much when he claims on ""Me Ves y
    Sufres"" that, ""I used to think I had something to say/ But my dumb ideologies gave me away.""</p><p>
    
    Nonetheless, <i>The Lost Riots</i> contains a few impressive moments.  Single ""The Red the White the Black
    the Blue"" is an abrasive rallying cry backed with spiraling pianos and Godspeed guitars.  ""Black Dollar Bills""
    is even better, meshing a soft piano lullaby with a total post-rock meltdown.  But these two passable tracks
    can't forgive the rest of the whole, on which Hope of the States are merely shadowboxing.  Until they focus
    more accurately on their targets, this band's moments of greatness will be fleeting, weighted down and
    muffled by the roar of empty noise-- a B-52, payload spent.</p></div>"|3990.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3990-the-lost-riots/|5.7|Natalie Moore

The ethos of charging
    only $6 for concerts, selling CDs for a flat $12, and never hawking any merchandise you can wear does not
    guarantee worthwhile music.  It just so happens, however, that their sound reiterates why punk rock still
    matters.  The answer lies in their albums, whose radical expansion of punk's defining characteristics
    confused as many punk purists as it enraptured, and their concerts, which underscored the unusual guitar
    tunings that sounded like ships crashing in the night and saw Ian MacKaye and Guy Picciotto barking as if
    just inches away from riot-cop mace-sprayers.</p><p>
    Earlier this year, bassist Joe Lally began the Fugazi Live Series label to release the band's archived live
    recordings, which document every concert they've played for the past 17 years.  Each cassette or DAT that
    passed quality control is now being burned to CDR and packaged in a jewel box with generic cover art that
    shows the band playing for flood reservoirs of people.  And, exhibiting a unique sense of posterity, the
    band has opted to leave the raw recordings untreated-- all wrong notes, tape hiss, missed cues and microphone
    cutouts are fully intact.</p><p>
<i>9-3-87 Washington, DC</i>-- just one of 20 volumes the band is selling exclusively at the Fugazi Live
    Series website-- captures Fugazi's public debut in September 1987 at the Wilson Center, a D.C. community
    center for teens.  Caught by a cassette deck with narcoleptic magnets, it showcases a band still trying to
    find itself, and hoping that at least someone else digs it.  Case in point is their slog-through of the
    Pointillist-funk number ""Furniture"", where MacKaye pleads the audience, ""Bear with me, please! ...This is
    the last part and after that we'll stop!""  Yet, even in this embryonic stage, Fugazi still concocted punk
    rock that crossed its arms and glared at the hardcore pep rallies that took over cities across the board
    during the late-80s.  That night, the trio (Picciotto wasn't onboard until several months later) played a
    hybrid of thrash-funk and midtempo blues which sounded content to sit alone on parking-space barriers
    outside the hardcore clubs, thinking, while other groups' two-minute testosterone fits raged nearby.</p><p>
    Positive Force D.C. activist Mark Anderson introduces the band; what follows is a snapshot of American punk
    standing at a crossroads.  Here, MacKaye &amp; Co. walk in a careful pace along a war-torn street, stepping over
    shattered glass, bullet casings and scattered propaganda leaflets selling visions of Reagan's City on the
    Hill.  The guerilla war that hardcore long waged against the empire in America's suburbs and skid rows was
    at a lull, with infighting and exhaustion setting in.  On this street that Fugazi treaded, major-label A&amp;R;
    scouts or carpetbaggers loitered in the local veterans' halls, recruiting the disillusioned with brochures
    featuring the smiling faces of Hüsker Dü and The Replacements and obscuring memories of fallen heroes Black
    Flag and the Dead Kennedys.</p><p>
    Fugazi's ""Song #1"", then, was a rallying cry of a whole other sort, announcing in a bullhorn: ""Song #1 is
    not a fuck you song/ I'll save that thought until later on/ You want to know if there's something wrong?/
    It's nothing.""  They continue: ""Life is what you want it to be so don't get tangled up trying to be free.../
    It's nothing.""  Fugazi here recall the European existentialists who cursed the language and sciences that
    led their countrymen to the Cold War, as aspects of ""nothingness.""  And these critiques reoccur in the
    songs ""Furniture"", ""Merchandise"" and ""Word"", where MacKaye lectures, ""The world has got you down/ Everybody
    treats you like shit/ What's the answer?/ What was that word again?/ ...The word is 'change.'""  It's difficult
    to imagine the crowd's facial reactions as harDCore's own hero told them that all their scenester posturing
    and territorial pissing was useless.</p><p>
    Fugazi's confidence in their musicianship spurts in ""Word"", as they march through a pogoing conversation
    between bass and guitar, and then slow it down to a dub space-out.  Elsewhere, Lally delivers a deft bass
    solo for a Mashed Potato dance rhythm on ""Furniture"", while the anti-suicide jaunt ""Turn Off Your Guns""
    remains among the band's poppiest moments to date.  The only negative is that the setlist is confined in
    a narrow palette with chords and rhythms that the band would seemingly repeatedly recycle until turning a
    sharp left on 1995's <i>Red Medicine</i>.  On the other hand, this document not only contains great historical
    value, but also elicits the excitement of hearing Fugazi realize where freedom-- and the rigor to maintain
    it-- can take them.</p></div>"|3243.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3243-fugazi-live-series-vol-1-september-3rd-1987/|8.4|Cameron Macdonald

And on their self-titled
    Bulb debut, they offer a collection of rambling honky-tonk that exists refreshingly out-of-frame, eager
    to rollick in the genre's bleary, heartbroken roots, but curious enough about the clang and call of the
    city to work in plenty of amplification and screechy organ amidst their banjos, fiddles, and pedal steel.
    Don't say ""alt-country""-- it makes me picture J. Mascis sporting Kiefer Sutherland's moustache from <i>The
    Cowboy Way</i>.  But you're welcome to order another Genesee and stretch out on the old church pew in the
    corner.</p><p>
    
    The band is the brainchild of Papa Crazee (ex-Oneida), who, when last heard from, had cut up his hand in a
    rather grisly table saw accident.  He resurfaces here backed by a gaggle of players, including a supporting
    vocalist with a lovely voice.  Her name is unclear, as are most of the details surrounding Oakley Hall--
    Bulb's press materials are more about suggestion than fact.  But that emphasis works like a charm, since
    the album's better without qualification.  Both its breaded steak country stomps and the occasional, quieter
    passages drift over the tenements like the wispy aroma of a peach pie spiked with Wild Turkey.</p><p>
    
    ""Feel This Way"" drops into gear with a nod to the 70s trucker idiom, its gang vocals chiming over a greasy
    backbeat worthy of a song about self-defeatist sex.  ""Color the Shade"" fades in on the monotone sustain of
    an organ (a B3, maybe), and as its tone warbles louder, it reflects Oneida's dark psyche prowess and their
    fractured approach to genre-spattered indie.  But here, the organ goes quiet, and instead gives way to a
    bassline reminiscent of ""Sittin' on the Dock of the Bay"", as well as strummed acoustics and a series of
    distant fiddle fills.  Crazee and his female counterpart harmonize on lines like, ""Saw a color the shade of
    you/ Chased it down a one way street before I knew/ Reds just made me mad/ Blues just made me sad/ And
    yellows remind me of other fellows/ That you screwed.""  The last line is nearly lost in a great burst of
    squelch electric guitar, another nod to the present that keeps Oakley Hall closer to operators like Acetone
    than anything on the Lost Highway's shoulder.</p><p>
    
    Oakley Hall are neither ironic nor revivalist, but recordings like this don't work without an appreciation
    for traditionalism.  Just ask Ween, who recorded <i>12 Golden Country Greats</i> with a bunch of crack
    Nashville studio cats.  To that end, Oakley Hall keeps ""Foolish Heart"" on a red-and-white gingham keel not
    far from your average roadhouse, and ""5 Sided Die"" is well-executed, if straightforward roots-rocker.  These
    tracks don't have the intangibles of <i>Oakley Hall</i>'s better moments-- the ones that glint like tiny
    diamonds scattered in peanut shavings-- but they're probably necessary for an album enamored of the
    relationship between city wolf and country wolf.</p><p>
    
    The album really shines in its second half, when the maze-walking traveler of its cover finally sets foot
    on the flaming world in the center.  ""End Time Evangelist"" is a slurred gothic rumination calling to the
    Handsome Family from a grimy diner's corner table, while ""You Wouldn't Believe What I've Been Up To (Since
    You've Been Gone)"" puts the female vocals front and center for a hilariously morbid letter to a departed
    lover.  ""I take a nap in a hot drawn bath,"" she sings absentmindedly over gentle chords, ""with the radio
    under my arm...""  That hyper-distorted organ returns late in the album, too, this time for the rowdy ""Ridin'
    the Dog"".</p><p>
    
    And then, the record ends, plaintively, with the 7-minute-plus epic ""Tuscaloosa"".  Papa Crazee's voice
    cracks on the hiccups as he wanders through life with a heavy, totally crushed-out heart.  He warns his
    woman away from him as a fiddle fades in sadly; he knows the resulting sparks would light them both in the
    fires of damnation.  The song's extended instrumental outro will ring true and heartfelt with the <i>O
    Brother</i> crowd (as most of Oakley Hall's material likely would), but this band never tries to follow a
    framework, and often hurls grapeshot at strangers looking for one.  Indeed, at the end of the day, <i>Oakley
    Hall</i> is just a great basement album, a backroom favorite made to heal the rifts in city girls' country
    hearts.</p></div>"|6098.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6098-oakley-hall/|8.5|Johnny Loftus

That's Dennis Lyxzén's yawp on the third
    track of <i>Armed Love</i>, his internationally noisy and somewhat conspiratorial unit's third full-length,
    and their first to emerge from behind the beard of Rick Rubin.  It's the old story-- boy meets girl but
    forgets to tell her about the Molotov cocktails in his kitchen sink, only to see her visage reflected in
    the fire of the office he just bombed.  Her dad's, as it would naturally turn out.  But then, the first rule
    of <i>Fight Club</i> is that you don't talk about <i>Fight Club</i>, so what's a partisan to do?  Write an
    album that puts the catchy before the concertina wire, hell-raising before the consciousness-raising, and
    hope you can explain the politics later.  At this latter notion, Serj Tankian only snorts cynically, and
    The (International) Noise Conspiracy's Warped Tour stage manager taps his watch with a shake of the head.
    But the band might be on to something truer than activism and louder than bombs.  They're onto a reinvention
    of that trusty hippy mantra.  They're rebuilding the love aesthetic for a fucked-up era, and matching it to
    their leather and Converse.</p><p>
<i>Armed Love</i> has a great title going for it, and a batch of tensile tracks built handily for sharp-elbow
    jiving and maybe even some fist-pump jabbing.  It sinks wildly into wily, clever crossbreeds of late-60s
    proto-punk, organ-driven soul grease, and a succulent trusty jelly of ""Hey!""s, ""Whoo Whoo!""s, and-- what's
    this?-- sax solos?  Well, the Huey Lewis quality of the latter is forgiven 'cause they're Swedish.  Overall,
    the album is a decent economy piece with as much bottom-end punch as the perpetually underrated Division of
    Laura Lee's recent <i>Das Not Compute</i>.  Indeed, ""Black Mask"" (""Need somethin' that can turn me on,
    YEAH!"") and ""A Small Demand"" are like long-nosed, more intelligently rhythmic versions of Jet's strutting,
    shit-eating pap.  And ""The Way I Feel About You"" is unabashedly upbeat, its crackling electric guitar meeting
    the B3 halfway across the stage and flirting with the bouncy Motown bottom-end that's ripe for doing the
    mash potato.</p><p>
    Wait, wait.  Isn't this band supposed to be challenging the bourgeoisie in our bathrooms with glinty knives,
    ruminating in liner notes on social responsibility and <i>The Anarchist's Cookbook</i>, and generally rousing
    the rabble in what's usually referred to these days as ""the punk spirit?""  Was that powder keg of vigor lost
    on the way to Rubin's studio and the American Recordings contract?  Well, not lost, exactly.  They've still
    got Revolution in their eyes.  But it's pretty clear that, for this album anyway, the (I)NC wants to make us
    hook up before we act up.  Move our hearts, they're saying, and our minds will follow.</p><p>
    The famously no-bullshit Rubin has certainly aided the Conspiracy in the Noise department.  The album's a
    solid slice of Burning Heart label revivalism. It's not innovative, but it's deliberate and economic, with
    no filler and an inviting dose of Sly Stone-derived soul. Still, anyone looking for an overt political
    statement might be disappointed, since <i>Armed Love</i> favors moment-shifting sketches over world-changing
    schematics.  ""It's finally coming/ The changing weather/ That we've been waiting for,"" goes ""This Side of
    Heaven"", and Lyxzén sings about ""tasting the sensation"" over the chorus' keening keys and tumbling percussion.
    He's probably talking about getting the word out, raising awareness, all that.  But he could just as easily
    be selling fine chocolates.  ""Communist Moon"", too, could be a celebration of young revolutionaries joining
    in the fight against tyranny.  But it might also be an invitation for a totally bitchin' after-hours warehouse
    party.</p><p>
    After shouldering the political burden for these past few years, maybe Lyxzén and his mates are tired of
    having to talk treatise with groupies instead of showing them the way to the tour bus.  To this end, there's
    ""Like a Landslide"".  Coming late in the album, it's a rousing, thick-bodied rocker with both organ and horn
    section add-ons, building to a chorus that wouldn't be out of place on a Paul Revere &amp; The Raiders record.
    But its lyrics seem to dream for a time when togetherness can be just that, not a strategy meeting in some
    dingy basement.  ""We're gonna move like a movement,"" the song's gang vocal climax asserts, and it's a moment
    when the crux of <i>Armed Love</i> walks in clear view.  The (International) Noise Conspiracy (and probably
    Rubin, too) want love, not war.  The solution to our collective social ills is in the pants of your neighbor,
    and finding that is way more fun than a first date fashioning political effigies.</p></div>"|4112.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4112-armed-love/|7.0|Johnny Loftus

    know little about Japanese urban life but what Blockbuster Video teaches them.  So what might they envision
    when listening to DJ Krush's collision of meditative, traditional Japanese folk and bass-heavy hip-hop?
    The, like, coolest soundtrack for a yakuza flick, that's what.  Tracks that sync programmed percussion to
    the melodic elements of koto strings and shakuhachi flutes tend to end up as stock music for film scenes in
    which Yankee detectives with $100-haircuts enter a Chinatown with steam-billowing gutters whenever Hollywood
    television has to fulfill its token-Asian quota for the season.  In a post-Wu-Tang world, that is possibly
    the lucrative fate of  Krush's eighth album, <i>Jaku</i>.</p><p>
    
    Nonetheless, <i>Jaku</i> still deserves respect for its cross-pollination of the arcane and the futuristic,
    where Krush guides you through his native Tokyo's neon forests, candlelit Buddhist temples, and the Harajuku
    neighborhood where teenagers flaunt Western-twisted fashions and rap in their native tongue.  Since the late
    80s, Krush has been credited with injecting hip-hop's trademark rhythmic minimalism with the Japanese artistic
    sensibilities of loose spacing and evoking the strongest impact with the slightest gesture.  Such endeavors
    are best heard on his classic Mo'Wax joints <i>Strictly Turntablized</i> and <i>Meiso</i>, to which much
    so-called ""trip-hop"" seems uninspired in comparison.</p><p>
    
    The new record furthers Krush's descent into black silk-draped symphonics with live Japanese instruments.
    Contrary to what the album title suggests (it's Japanese for ""tranquility""), most tracks are hexed by
    tension.  The opener, ""Still Island"", sets that mood with string orchestrations and Shuuzan Morita's
    snaking shakuhachi melodies.  The following ""Road to Nowhere"" strolls through a crimson-moonlit garden
    with a methanol-smoked bassline that hobbles along with a sprung-ankle of a beat.</p><p>
    
    Krush is at his best here when he focuses more on the beat than the frequently over-saturated layers of
    strings that, at times, approach John Williams-caliber schmaltz: ""Transitions"" skitters in a time-lapse
    motion with dub rim-shots and cello blurts, while Krush's duet with DJ Tatsuki in ""Deck-athron"" grows eight
    legs out of a tumbling beat with some brilliant turntable-pitch tomfuckery.  Other fine stitch-work is found
    in ""Passage""'s kick drums, which break holes in roofs for samples of rain to leak in, and the hustling
    taiko-crunk beat of ""Univearth"".</p><p>
<i>Jaku</i>'s two guest vocalists-- underground hip-hop stalwarts Mr. Lif and Aesop Rock-- manage to save
    additional face for the record, breaking through the difficult challenge of translating Krush's amorphous
    mire into lyrical narratives.  Lif wins the prize for his smooth, airborne surveillance of American Babylon
    in ""Nosferatu"", while Aesop's stream-of-consciousness exhale on ""Kill Switch"" is a swank noise of clever
    phrases, poetic flashcards and split references, even if they're essentially about nothing in particular.
    Still, the album's best narration is unspoken.  On ""Song 2"", Krush stages what sounds like a dinnertime
    conversation about coming home with pink slips that day-- complete with interruptions, awkward pauses and
    tangents-- using only shakuhachi flutes and a kalimba.  Indeed, though his genre may have long passed its
    prime, Krush's use of space and texture remain not just formidable, but remarkably relevant.</p></div>"|2366.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2366-jaku/|7.3|Cameron Macdonald

Thanks for being cable TV's top purveyor of instantly gratifying (albeit
    non-pornographic) infotainment.  But since you saw fit to release <em>I Love the 90s</em> just four years
    into the nominally fraught Aughts, did you really have to focus so often on the ugliness of that dearly
    departed meta-decade?  Everybody already knew Hootie sucked.  Now that our once-reviled teen pop stars
    have given way to posturing post-grungers, Blink-182 imitators (!) and even lamer teen-pop stars, we long
    for the halcyon days when Jerry was master of his domain and a quirky Seattle band sat alone in a boggy
    marsh.  To wit: a million rock critics' lazy political puns praising the endearingly unpretentious return
    of that quirky Seattle band, The Presidents of the United States of America.</p><p>
    
    The passing of a decade raises questions for any pop act, but especially a group that reached double-platinum
    prominence in 1995 for its relentlessly childish brand of rock.  I first heard ""Lump"" when I was younger than
    a critic should admit, watching MTV at my parents' then-home in Tennessee-- just the second of the six states
    I've called home.  Back then, the band's eight glorious strings and nonsensical lyrics instantly won over my
    unrefined sensibilities.  ""Do you have any idea what it takes to rock?"" Chris Ballew sings on the band's
    sophomore effort, <em>II</em>.  Quite frankly, I didn't.  Would ""Peaches"" sound as sweet in 2004?  Could any
    new album live up to nostalgia?</p><p>
    
    On <em>Love Everybody</em>, the Presidents don't fully answer such questions.  They stick mostly to their old
    formula of catchy hooks and gleeful goofiness, and it mostly works.  On the title track, cheesy ""Mach 5""
    synths and choppy singing sound like Bellew's signing up with this decade's new new-wavers-- appropriately,
    given the Buggles cover on <em>Pure Frosting</em>.  But then again, his banana-fana-fo-fark cadences could
    just as easily be aping ""The Name Game"".  Later, ""Drool at You"" proves the band still has a gift for
    entertainingly bizarre lyrics: ""I want to lick your lamb chops dry/ So please excuse me while I hump the
    sky.""  They do toss in the occasional surprise, like the gloriously melodic ""Vestina"", which matches the
    laid-back pop of Guster's ""Ramona"" with a Britt Daniel-style vocal.</p><p>
    
    Armed with steely indie contrarianism, part of me was ready to skewer this long-overdue release by one of
    my old favorite bands.  After all, where were the hypesters and hipsters for <em>Freaked Out and Small</em>,
    the 2000 release that's so overlooked most writers call <em>Love Everybody</em> their third album?  Seattle
    radio hit ""Some Postman"" didn't help quash my darker impulses.  Granted, its hook is as infectious as
    anything the group has ever done.  But isn't that the chord progression from Eve 6's ""Inside Out""?  Close
    enough.  Moreover, the new album suffers the same propensity for filler that marred <em>II</em>.  ""Shortwave""
    and bland ""Clean Machine"" will join clunkers like ""Bath of Fire"" and ""Lip"" down the memory hole.</p><p>
    
    For all the Presidents' success in conjuring up the Ben Fold Five fuzz and Dead Milkmen whimsy of records
    past, the best track here sounds the least like their previous work.  That's ""Jennifer's Jacket"", a mostly
    acoustic ditty destined to be a preschool favorite.  ""She's got safety pins and strings holding it
    together,"" Ballew intones.  ""She can only wear her jacket in warm weather.""  Ballew somehow achieves an
    understated beauty while sounding more like Kermit than he did on the debut's ""Froggie"".  When the inevitable
    electric guitars kick in for a blissful, slightly off-key coda, one thing becomes clear: Whether or not they
    ever record another ""Lump"", The Presidents of the United States of America should never be misunderestimated.
    There, was that too subtle to fill my political pun quota?</p></div>"|6459.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6459-love-everybody/|6.5|Marc Hogan

    the Land</i>, to alter America's pop landscape.  Those prognosticators were correct: The album (which, fact
    fans, debuted at #1 in the same week that Radiohead's <i>OK Computer</i> bowed at #21) was a significant
    modern rock signpost, albeit not for the expected reasons.  At the time, The Prodigy had been billed-- along
    with the Chemical Brothers, Orbital, and Underworld-- as the leaders of the mainstream media's regretfully
    named ""electronica"" movement, a moment in which electronic dance music was going to finally crossover to MTV
    and radio in the U.S.</p><p>
    However, instead of inspiring you and your band to trade in your guitars for turntables,
    The Prodigy-- along with unlikely and otherwise unrelated contemporaries such as Korn, Nine Inch Nails, and
    Rage Against the Machine-- laid the groundwork for the string of mostly limp rap-rock/nu-metal bands that
    dominated modern rock throughout the late 1990s and into the new millennium. In retrospect, The Prodigy may
    not have become America's Great Electronic Hopes but ""Firestarter"" could be the world's greatest nu-metal
    single, a rousing anthem for the Mook Era that was unfortunately taken to heart at Woodstock '99, the
    abandoned festival that served as rap-rock's peak in popularity and its cultural nadir.</p><p>
<i>OK Computer</i>, ""electronica,"" Rage Against the Machine, Woodstock '99-- it may seem like ancient history,
    but that divide is the uphill battle The Prodigy face after a seven-year gab between records.  The good news
    is that calling the band ""they"" is more misleading now than it has been in recent years: The Prodigy's fourth
    album, <i>Always Outnumbered, Never Outgunned</i>, is mostly the work of musical linchpin Liam Howlett. Dancer
    Leeroy Thornhill left the group years ago, and neither Maxim Reality nor Keith Flint is featured here.  Flint's
    bleating on The Prodigy's 2002 comeback single ""Baby's Got a Temper""-- a cringe-worthy attempt at provocation
    (it's an ode to ""date-rape drug"" Rohypnol) that is thankfully not included-- may have been his final bow with
    the group.</p><p>
    Instead, vocals are provided by Kool Keith, Princess Superstar, and Juliette Lewis (among others), a roster
    that hints that the seven-year wait between records is less a result of going back to the drawing board as
    it is trying to coax a finished product from years-old ideas.  (One could add Liam Gallagher to that list of
    past-their-sell-date vocalists, but as Howlett's brother-in-law his appearance could be as much a familial
    decision as a musical one.)  Of the guests, only an underutilized Twista lends the album an air of timeliness.</p><p>
    Even more disappointingly, <i>Always Outgunned</i> is a mess of unfocused energy and uncomfortably irrelevant
    sonics, an odd mix of cartoonish immediacy and tired youth-cult ideas that would be the perfect soundtrack to
    <i>Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie: The Movie</i>.  The results are even more regrettable because they're coming
    from Howlett, whose string of singles and first two albums with The Prodigy are still crucial and enthralling.</p><p>
    Howlett's run of solid singles does remain intact with ""Girls"", a delicious red herring of electro and breakbeats
    that stands head, shoulders and torso above the rest of the album.  It leads into Princess Superstar collab
    ""Memphis Bells"" and ""Get Up Get Off"", the next closest things to album highlights.  The latter features the
    yeoman-like Twista, who wisely slows his cadence rather than being tempted to race alongside BPMs which--
    although hardly pummeling-- are much higher than, say, a Kanye West or R. Kelly production.</p><p>
    ""Hotride""-- one of two Lewis collaborations-- is a heavy-handed re-imagination of The Fifth Dimension's ""Up,
    Up &amp; Away"" (no, really) that aims for sexual but simply isn't sexy.  Howlett also reaches back into the 1960s
    on ""Phoenix"", which liberally samples of The Shocking Blue's ""Love Buzz"", a vain, lifeless attempt to rub
    shoulders with the current wave of retro 60s garage rock.  It's perhaps the record's most telling moment:
    long-time innovator Howlett aligning himself with the most necrophiliac elements of contemporary rock.  The
    record's ungainly, knuckle-dragging nu-metal trappings overshadow any other pleasant sonic accoutrements--
    the bassline from ""Thriller"" that loops throughout much of ""The Way It Is"" or the playful, subtle beats of
    ""Memphis Bells"".</p><p>
    ""Your time is running out,"" Liam Gallagher sneers on album closer ""Shoot Down"", and it's unfortunately a
    fair warning for The Prodigy themselves.  For a record that presumably took seven years to create, <i>Always
    Outnumbered</i> sounds unsurprisingly outdated but oddly lazy.  Perhaps if Howlett officially disbands The
    Prodigy he can rediscover freedom and inspiration recording under his own name or another moniker, but if
    this ""it goes to 11"" take on rap-rock is all he's managed to digest and engage with during his absence,
    it's possible he needn't bother.</p></div>"|6486.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6486-always-outnumbered-never-outgunned/|3.9|Scott Plagenhoef

    heartbeat and breath, environment, repetition, the progression of time-- with such breadth and subtlety
    that it seems impossible such transformative music should fit on the small physical object of a CD.  Heavily
    influenced by John Cage's musical theories and personal encouragement, Feldman outpaced his mentor in
    successfully counteracting the theoretical rigidity popular among many 20th century composers.  While
    Cage's music, like Marcel Duchamp's toilet on the wall, could still eschew aesthetics in favor of ideological
    polemics, Feldman always remained concerned that his pieces would speak for themselves a priori of any
    extramusical conceit.  Unimpressed with the compositional systems of the serialists or minimalists, as well
    as traditional scales, tunings and forms, Feldman's music is both deeply emotional and the antithesis of
    ""dramatic,"" relying on no trope to alight the far reaches of our inner worlds.</p><p>
    
    John Zorn's label Tzadik, most prominently carrying Zorn's own releases and a host of abrasive Japanese
    noise/electronic artists, has released what it claims to be ""the definitive recording"" of Feldman's infinitely
    nuanced 1981 composition <i>Patterns in a Chromatic Field</i>.  They've pulled it off, with an engaged and
    well-captured performance from pianist Aleck Karis and cellist Charles Curtis, as well as liner notes that,
    through quotes from Feldman's own writing, introduce listeners to his mature theoretical outlook.</p><p>
    
    To those
    familiar with Feldman's general style, 1981's <i>Patterns in a Chromatic Field</i> may seem unusually busy.
    The composer is best known for his interest in the hazes of notes sustained after being struck (some pieces
    call for every sound to be allowed its full decay) as well as his use of chance operations within set parameters.
    <i>Patterns</i> is relatively rhythmic and almost fully notated, yet still imparts what Feldman called his
    compositional ""subservience"" to pure sound.  The hushed instruments weave a web of intertwining figures,
    quieter parts allowing ambient noise of the surrounding world to enter into their musical environment.</p><p>
<i>Patterns</i> is driven by the communication that develops between the work's two inhabitants, piano and
    cello.  The piece begins with the impression of being thrust upon something in progress, as though hearing
    the muted sounds of a couple arguing in the next room.  The cello whines in looped patterns, while the piano
    drops weighted clusters along the pitch spectrum, soon segueing into stillness.  Subsequent rhythmic sections
    recall the cadences of Morse code, the instruments stabbing at unity in their intersections and misses.  In
    other instances, they'll engage in long passages of cause and effect, the piano a child fascinated that its
    repeated actions produce the cello's consistent result.  In this way, though the piece shifts from one musical
    cell to the next without provocation, its progression never feels aimless.  Its only predictable movement is
    in the tempering of any extreme with its contrast, creating a space in the meeting of opposites rather than
    the logic of linearity.</p><p>
    
    Feldman's music has been called, by respectable critics, ""boring.""  The most pared-down exercises in his
    theories can indeed take a large effort of will to enjoy, casting their atonal meditative glow at the expense
    of the modern attention span.  But despite its 80-minute length, <i>Patterns in a Chromatic Field</i> takes
    little work to become entranced with; while one must take the initial leap of investing one's trust and
    concentration in Feldman's unique sensibilities, its moments of crystalline beauty are readily apparent.
    The piece maintains interest, yet fully realizes Feldman's goal of disassociating pitches from one another.
    Told in minor seconds and augmented fourths, the piano's thick knots of sound never feel dissonant or
    abrasive-- simply removed entirely from the game of functional harmony.</p><p>
    
    Curtis' haunting cello work
    counteracts any lingering hint of academic sterility in Feldman's composition, penetrating deeply with its
    airy, sustained notes, and almost brutally clean tone (Feldman deemed vibrato a trick for covering up
    inaccurate musicianship).  Karis, meanwhile, manages to retain control over the piano at even the scarcest
    volumes, and the musicians' interaction is complete and focused, if seemingly weary in later stages of the
    piece.</p><p>
    
    The tableau in which Feldman is most fondly remembered by friends and students consists of him sitting quietly
    at the piano, letting loose gentle clusters of notes until each faded entirely, with a cigar hanging from his
    mouth and the ash gradually collecting on his lap.  He grew from an argumentative pupil into a teacher known
    for his patience and thoughtfulness, channeling John Cage's propensity to find great power in stillness as
    both a composer and a man.  And though Feldman would have probably scoffed at the Romantic concept of music
    as direct communication from artist to listener, one can't help but feel that as <i>Patterns in a Chromatic
    Field</i> hangs in the air, it has imparted a piece of the man's quiet, sincere spirit.</p></div>"|3027.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3027-patterns-in-a-chromatic-field/|8.6|Liam Singer

    in a hotel room decorated circa 1973, just before he headed off to take some stage with one of the numerous
    bands he tours with, be it the reconstituted Big Star, the remnants of The Posies, or R.E.M.  The liners are
    sprinkled with out-of-focus shots of unidentified cities taken from high-rise windows, presumably in rented
    rooms.  To say that Stringfellow lives a mobile, busy musical life is an understatement-- he produces, does
    session work, tours as both a side and front man, and occasionally records a solo record like this one,
    which was written on three continents and recorded in four separate studios.</p><p>
    
    Stringfellow and longtime partner Jon Auer were wide-eyed fans of the guitar-pop vanguard when they inaugurated
    The Posies in the late 80s, and by the time they were dropped by DGC in 1997, they were fully immersed in
    both the band and the genre (good buddies with Alex Chilton, Peter Buck and Scott McCaughey), and unable to
    fully put The Posies to rest even after officially breaking up.  Stringfellow's first solo album, 1997's
    <i>This Sounds Like Goodbye</i> was an uncharacteristically experimental and homespun album, a sort of
    exorcism of ideas, but his 2001 follow-up effort, <i>Touched</i>, was a well-developed album of sophisticated,
    classic pop.  <i>Soft Commands</i> builds directly on that progression with a batch of songs guaranteed to
    be huge hits as soon as we're all sucked into a giant time warp and plunked back down in 1974.</p><p>
    
    The arrangements this time out are much more ambitious, with small orchestras darkening the corners of the
    songs and lending a baroque, stately aura to the album.  Even ""For Your Sake"", one of two tracks without
    outside collaborators, sounds huge, with mile-deep synths, fuzz bass accents and nervous rhythms backing
    Stringfellow's lithium-smooth tenor-- the melody is a collection of woven phrases that challenge the meter
    and highlight the fragmentary nature of the lyrics.  ""Let Me Do"" doesn't exactly conjure the Senegal locale
    it was written in, instead fleshing out a simple declaration of romantic intent with opulent horn and string
    charts.</p><p>
    
    Stringfellow takes his music subtly in dozens of different, sometimes bold directions on <i>Soft Commands</i>,
    dropping reggae and ska-inflected verses on ""You Become the Dawn"", a blue-eyed soul confection with a big,
    horn-draped chorus and a strange chant interlude featuring massed vocals and organ.  It's followed by a
    throwaway dub instrumental, which is about the only point on the album in which Stringfellow takes his
    musical curiosity a bit too far.  Elsewhere, ""Cyclone Graves"", with its refrain of, ""I hope you never go
    blind,"" conjures the soft-rock mastery of Todd Rundgren's <i>Something/Anything</i>, while opener ""You Drew""
    makes a convincing case for the legacy of Jackson Browne with its graceful melody and anthemic scope.  ""When
    U Find Someone"" rises from humble verses to an expansive, Wilsonian chorus packed with harmonies, kettle
    drums and theremin, establishing itself as the album's early highlight.</p><p>
    
    The album closes with the comparatively spare ""Death of a City"", primarily featuring Stringfellow and his
    piano, though he layers himself into a massive choir at points while strings flit about in the background,
    adding counterpoint to his vocals.  ""You go out late and look for the stars/ But all you see is orange on
    the clouds,"" he sings, summing up the futility of stargazing in the city, and you get the impression that
    he's weary of urban life, even as he feeds off of it.  For an album recorded in so many places and incorporating
    so many states of mind, <i>Soft Commands</i> is remarkably cohesive, and a forceful confirmation of Stringfellow's
    ability to stand on his own as an artist worthy of respect and a listen from any true fan of classic pop.</p></div>"|7536.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7536-soft-commands/|7.7|Joe Tangari

He's only a skeleton.""</p><p>
    
    Even back in 1984, when D. Boon first sang those lyrics from Watt's ""One Reporter's Opinion"" on <i>Double
    Nickels on the Dime</i>, it sounded like an inside joke.  By then it was already evident that Watt was one
    of punk rock's biggest and most self-reflective romantics.  From Minutemen classics like ""Tour Spiel"" and
    the monumental ""History Lesson - Part II"", straight on through the fIREHOSE years and his busy but erratic
    solo career, there's been little about his working class hometown San Pedro, flannel, piss bottles, or
    jamming econo that our beloved bass-wielding Ulysses hasn't found romantic.</p><p>
    
    All that nearly came to an end in 2000, when Watt suffered a burst abscess in his perineum, an affliction
    even more gruesome than it sounds.  This horrendous episode very nearly rendered the world Watt-less, but
    he has since thankfully recovered, and now offers a not-entirely-unromantic account of this brush with death
    on his self-described punk opera, <i>Secondman's Middle Stand</i>.</p><p>
    
    Watt has never been one to crib pages from someone else's rulebook, but <i>Middle Stand</i> is an idiosyncratic
    work even by his standards.  Constructed loosely on Dante's <i>Divine Comedy</i>, the album bases three songs
    apiece on his illness (""Inferno""), treatment (""Purgatorio"") and recovery (""Paradiso"").  The instrumental line-up
    is kept light and lean, with Watt on vocals and ""thud staff,"" the busy limbs of Jerry Trebotic on drums,
    Pete Mazich on organ and frequent background vocals from Petra Haden.</p><p>
    
    It's that organ that's going to prove most nettlesome to punk-bred listeners, as it's difficult to disassociate
    Mazich's ornate, proggy Hammond B3 stylizations from just the sort of pompous arena rock that prompted punk's
    invention in the first place.  But once you convince yourself that Mazich is not, in fact, about to break
    into Kansas' ""Point of No Return"", you should be able to appreciate the broad array of textures that the
    instrument brings to Watt's preferred power trio format.</p><p>
    
    With his trusty thunderbroom functioning as his Virgil, Watt doesn't flinch as he begins his tour of the
    underworld.  ""Abandon all hope!"" command the background singers on the opener ""Boiling Blazes"" while the
    drums and organ roil nauseously.  ""No!"" Watt screams back defiantly.  ""I'm going to make it through this
    hellride.""</p><p>
    
    Things do get awfully hellish in the early going, and Watt spares us few gory details on tracks like the
    surprisingly peppy, ""Puked to High Heaven"", the self-explanatory ""Pissbags and Tubings"", and the driving,
    Deep Purplish ""Bursted Man"" which finds Watt trapped inside an infernal fever dream.  ""I see that thermometer
    in your mouth/ It looks more like a fuse/ Send that mercury to the top/ Split the glass and splatter his
    bulkhead!""  Yikes.</p><p>
    
    Throughout the album, Watt delivers his most emotive vocal performance on record, sounding at times like a
    cross between a diabolical Gregg Allman and the muttering derelict who nobody wants to sit next to on the
    bus.  Unfortunately his frenzied delivery, rapid-fire lyrics and the live-in-the-studio production quality
    often have his vocals getting trampled under the hooves of the marauding bass and organ.  But his bass work
    is as powerful and nonchalantly virtuosic as ever, with his omnivorous playing style serving as both
    propulsive rhythmic force and melodic color-bearer.</p><p>
    
    And it'd take a hard heart indeed to not smile when Watt, after enduring all his myriad hardships, triumphantly
    sails into ""The Angel's Gate"", the celebratory track that introduces the ""Paradiso"" section.  (""The Angel's
    Gate"" is also the name of the harbor at San Pedro.)  When you hear him describe the simple,
    never-to-be-taken-for-granted pleasures of being able to resume bicycling, kayaking and music-making on
    ""Pluckin', Pedalin', Paddlin'"", you'll hear a man who has withstood a brutal ordeal with his boundless
    romanticism intact.  And though this album requires its listeners to go through some arduous passages,
    you'll find yourself hoping to hear this Secondman making new stands for a long time to come.</p></div>"|8589.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8589-the-secondmans-middle-stand/|7.5|Matthew Murphy

    CBGB's amateur-night punks to indulging my melancholic needs with the more ""refined"" strains of The Smiths,
    Joy Division, The Cure, et al.  At the time, the solipsistic zeitgeist wallowed in overdramatic giddiness
    like running down a street in the rain, feeling misunderstood, shaking my head no-no-no to ""Boys Don't Cry"",
    and milking a sense of the sublime (even if ill-defined) within my own gut-wrenching awkwardness.  I was a
    cross between a 16-year-old Thurston Moore and a member of A Flock of Seagulls.</p><p>
    
    That was a decade ago, but despite limited contact with the youngsters, I assume the I-wear-black-on-the-outside
    initiation period rings true for a new breed of suburbanites armed with Thursday, Dashboard Confessional, and
    Suicide Girls.  And Lord knows If I had a time machine, The pAper chAse would've been plenty of fuel for my
    crocodile tears: So yeah, hand me a hanky because hearts really do turn weird colors and no, she doesn't owe
    you a goddamn thing...</p><p>
    
    Despite epic production (think Sunny Day Real Estate aiming for Wagner), novelistic twists, and admirable
    chutzpah on <i>God Bless Your Black Heart</i>, The pAper chAse's lavishly curated third full-length, it's
    difficult to take every last pity party sentiment seriously.  Still, John Congleton's breakdown is less
    grating than the detritus of most emo and post-emo yowlers, and his dual roll as main songwriter and
    atmospheric engineer (he's also turned knobs for 90 Day Men and Explosions in the Sky, among others),
    offers him the micro-managing ability to one-up the average screamer by setting his carefully narrated
    denouement in what feels like a diorama that houses Nick Cave's book <i>And the Ass Saw the Angel</i> as
    narrated by some imaginary post-punk version of the bald guy from President's of the United States of
    America vomiting gothic-lite bile onto a dark oak table.</p><p>
    
    Tangentially somewhere between Dismemberment Plan
    geek and Cursive angst, there's a circus parade of violent outbursts, murky characters named ""queen bee"" and
    ""buttercup,"" white slaves, a pair of sideburns that reek of sex, and even some goddamn fat babies.  At the
    end of Congleton's imagistic lyrical marathon, it's up to the listener to piece together the narrative and
    figure out, really, what he's talking about.</p><p>
    
    Congleton layers his revenge fantasies atop aggressive shouting, dingy strings, cabaret piano, ""broken heart""
    samples, and mathy guitar interjections-- all to create a dense, herky-jerky post-post-post not unlike Coral's
    <i>Pillow Talk</i> or the aforementioned Cursive's hyper-divorce jam <i>Domestica</i>.  But where <i>Domestica</i>
    at times felt like legitimate hurt, The pAper chAse have a problem wading beyond bleating theatrics.  And
    where Cursive's vocalist, Tim Kasher, proves adept at varying his accusatory attack, Congleton projects a
    disregard for variation, rarely coming down from his high-end hysterical cowpoke snarl.  Opting for song
    titles that match his over-the-top sermonizing (""Abby, You're Going to Burn for What You've Done to Me"",
    ""One Day He Went Out for Milk and Never Came Home"", ""Now, We Just Slowly Circle the Draining Fishbowl""),
    stations him at full throttle, even when the music's a mere whisper.</p><p>
    
    There's not a thing wrong with fire and brimstone dashed with piss and vinegar, but before the album reaches
    its halfway point, Congleton's shouty boy/girl accusations have sunken into a sing-song pattern that beckons
    sleep like the gentle nudge of an air-conditioner's hum.  When presenting words and emotions this ""extreme,""
    it often helps to house it in a more stoic structure-- say the less trill slashing of Swans.  In this sense,
    the strongest portions of <i>God Bless Your Black Heart</i> are those closest to monotonous silence: jingle
    bells, the aftershock of a sinewy guitar, pleasing percussion/piano build-ups, noir interludes, hollowed
    parlor ambiance, the creaky violin outro of ""The Sinking Ship, The Grand Applause"", and the gaps in ""A War
    Is Coming"", a near-industrial snippet.  Bassist Bobby Weaver and drummer Aryn Dalton provide an especially
    powerful rhythm section-- think a Shellac ballet.  Sean Kirkpatrick contributes well-timed piano and synth
    lines that fill out the sound admirably (at one point I swear I can feel the haze of a neo-Gregorian chant),
    and Congleton's cathartic guitar parts wrap around his high-end decibels like a Columbian necktie.</p><p>
    
    Ultimately, <i>God Bless Your Black Heart</i>'s seemingly endless feast of rants and threats (i.e. ""I'll see
    your head up on a pole,"" ""Your doctors and lawyers can't save your ass,"" etc.) would imply that for Congleton
    to issue a restraining order against his bad self might not be a bad idea.  Sometimes erstwhile obsessiveness
    can lead to revelation, but beyond the fancy engineering, I don't see much of that here.</p><p>
    
    I'm not suggesting that The pAper chAse opt for dull-as-dirt Don Caballero instrumentals when it's obvious
    the band's ability to make-or-break rests on Congleton's shoulders and overwrought mind, but <i>God Bless
    Your Black Heart</i> really would benefit from a muted falsetto here or a tiny mumble there.  You get a
    sense of that spaciousness over the album's last three tracks and it's completely beautiful: If the ballast
    leveled out more regularly and allowed breathing room for the nonverbal, these multi-layered atmospheres
    would ineluctably stand up and speak for themselves with less insistent wheezing.  If I weren't so broke,
    I might even chip in for the guy's therapy to see it happen.</p></div>"|6550.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6550-god-bless-your-black-heart/|6.4|Brandon Stosuy

    have had to confront.  While they've often kept a finger on the club music button through remixes and various
    associations with the dance community, the Mouse on Mars method has always involved finding ways to knock
    the loops out of joint and upset the sort of internalized expectations that come from a lifetime of music
    listening. The element of surprise is crucial to their aesthetic, even though the change-ups are often subtle,
    which means serious attention to detail is a must. If they've taken longer to record and release albums than
    their contemporaries, it's because of this need to micromanage. Mouse on Mars on record are fussy and
    exacting.</p><p>
    
    Their full-length portfolio shows a similar inability to leave well enough alone.  Mouse on Mars aren't in
    the business of repeating themselves, and even now, eight albums deep, it's difficult to describe one Mouse
    on Mars full-length by comparing it to another.  Certain qualities overlap and there is a distinctive ""sound,""
    but each album picks a handful of ideas and explores them to varying depths.  The next one then picks up
    somewhere else and goes.</p><p>
    
    2001's <i>Idiology</i> was unique because ideas were so numerous. Each track seemed to point to a possible
    new direction, and it seemed as if the next album could be anything from a screamo noisefest to an electro
    prog opera. You'd think we would have learned by now; it turns out that the threads running through the
    long-awaited new album <i>Radical Connector</i> are not found anywhere on <i>Idiology</i>.  This is Mouse
    on Mars' most conventional album, with vocals on every track (by drummer Dodo Nkishi and Sonig fellow
    traveler Niobe), and it's also their most predictable in structure. Each song builds an internally consistent
    songworld and is content with its boundaries. If you're a fan of Mouse on Mars' more experimental side
    (hand up here behind the keyboard) it helps to approach <i>Radical Connector</i> on its own terms.</p><p>
    
    Though it is indeed pop, <i>Radical Connector</i> has an unusual sound.  Nkishi and Niobe have strong voices
    even untreated, but their vocals are vocoded, chopped, and phased to seem as unnatural as possible while generally
    avoiding robotic cliches.  Several tracks with Nkishi on lead feature an intentionally thick and sludgy low
    end, with the bass and drums merging into a lunging, leering, lumbering beast.  And though heightened
    danceability has been a key selling point of this record, most tracks are a half-step slow.</p><p>
    
    ""Wipe That Sound"", for example, is nimble on its face with excellent ""oo-way oo-way"" disco background vox,
    a command to ""kick the can"" (do they play that in Germany?), and a gurgling acid bassline, but there's no
    way the plodding tempo is going to fill a dancefloor. Same goes for ""Mine Is in Yours"", probably the purest
    song on the album, with a simple chord structure whose catchiness becomes apparent when the electronics lay
    out and a ringing electric guitar takes over-- unique and excellent, but not dance music by any stretch.</p><p>
    
    The best rhythms are left for Niobe.  On two of her four tracks, she assumes the role of a distant and aloof
    diva, intoning cryptic lyrics (""When the boats go round/ Turn on back to a spiral"") behind several layers of
    processing. ""Send Me Shivers"" fits the tech-house template, with a steady chug of a rhythm hypnotic and groovy
    enough to earn its 6 minutes.  The rhythmic accents are pure Mouse on Mars playfulness, however, with two
    stabs every other bar sounding like pistons from a Dr. Seuss machine.</p><p>
    
    ""Evoke an Object"" is comparatively sleek and sexy, with a metallic sheen and a persistent glow of distortion,
    and though the beat goes on for almost 9 minutes and threatens to go into full-bore house several times, it
    always maintains a hint of off balance herky-jerkiness.  ""Spaceship"" is an altogether different animal, a
    prelude of political lyrics (""The inexact inquiry/ Profitable madness/ Society/ The abstract variety"") over
    chaotic drum hits and wind-up noises that slowly gather like a storm before erupting into deeply goofy and
    great funk hinging on a rapid cut-up of the song's title.  Niobe proves to be as sure a fit with Mouse on
    Mars' current sound as Laetitia Sadier was in the late 90s.</p><p>
    
    Though reference points like Daft Punk and Prince have rightly been thrown around, <i>Radical Connector</i>
    is in fact a strange album that doesn't sound like much else. Subversion is still here, but this time it
    comes in the form of texture, most of which is purely electronic in origin. There is something fundamentally
    <em>ugly</em> about the sound of <i>Radical Connector</i>, despite its song-oriented tendencies, but it's a
    quality present for contrast and complexity, and not as a statement on its own. The tension resulting from
    opposing forces continues to fuel for Mouse on Mars' fire, even when they're experimenting in the realm of
    pop.</p></div>"|5467.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5467-radical-connector/|8.1|Mark Richardson

    Is Talking Heads</i>, recommends other albums by the New York four-piece.  The list includes each of the
    band's studio albums, plus Rhino's four-disc box set <i>Once in a Lifetime</i>; perhaps conspicuous in its
    absence is that <i>other</i> live Talking Heads album, the far more popular and legendary <i>Stop Making
    Sense</i>.</p><p>
    It may not have been a confrontational omission, but the soundtrack to Jonathan Demme's Talking Heads concert
    film has long overshadowed <i>The Name of This Band</i>-- so much so that fans have long doubted that this
    earlier (and superior) live album would ever make it to compact disc.  Thankfully, however, Rhino has now
    not only reissued <i>The Name of This Band</i>, but has also taken a cue from the recent ""Special Edition""
    of <i>Stop Making Sense</i> by adding 13 tracks which weren't on the original version.</p><p>
    Part of the charm and power of <i>Stop Making Sense</i> the film is that it almost purely translates the
    live experience of a rock show audience rather than the experience of a touring band. There is no backstage
    fly-on-the-wall stuff, no dressing room preparations, on-the-bus interviews, caterers, hotel clerks or road
    managers. Rather, it's the snapshot of one live document with the camera playing the role of a punter,
    trained completely on the band in an attempt to recreate the experience of attending the show. It works so
    well that it's almost jarring when the camera finally closes in on audience members dancing in the aisles
    during the show's finale.</p><p>
    Musically, this approach is a bit limiting.  As powerful as Talking Heads were at the time, <i>Stop Making
    Sense</i> still functions as a live document of one band at one moment in time (well, not technically-- the
    film was actually recorded over three nights).  For a group such as this, who paid attention to the musical
    world around them, deftly and quickly folding outside influences as seemingly disparate as disco, afrobeat,
    funk and new wave into their already unique sound, <i>The Name of This Band</i>'s approach-- collecting
    various live performances over a four-year period-- is more revelatory and rewarding.  It functions as both
    a timeline in which a listener can trace the band's development and definitive proof that some of their
    supposed great departures-- particularly an accomplished and complex rhythm section-- were there from the
    onset.</p><p>
    The result is both the best career-spanning snapshot of and single-purchase introduction to Talking Heads--
    odd accolades for a live record-- and a treat for longtime fans.  The record's title refers to band leader
    David Byrne's dry, cheeky, no-nonsense stage patter in the band's early days, the years documented on the
    set's first disc.  ""This song is called 'New Feeling' and that's what it's about,"" Byrne begins, leading the
    four-piece group with both his animated, acrobatic vocal tics and affectations and the band's nervous,
    twitchy music.</p><p>
    All bugged eyes and neurosis, Byrne spits and churns his way through the best tracks from
    the band's first three albums.  His oft-criticized, stream-of-consciousness language (best illustrated by
    the ""Busy Doin' Nothin'""-like driving directions and matter-of-fact descriptions of the benefits of his
    apartment building and favorite federal laws in ""Don't Worry About the Government"") ground the band's more
    aggressive, robust playing music.  At times, Byrne gets a little punchy as well, injecting anger and bemusement
    into ""I'm Not in Love"" and adding a bitter tone to ""The Big Country"", transforming it from the hazy thoughts
    of an airplane traveler to a more combative rumination on the urban/rural divide.  It would be a candidate
    for the official anthem of the mythical Blue States if the so-called culture wars and other right-wing
    chicanery continue to drive their regrettable wedge into the country.</p><p>
    When required, however, Byrne can craft an expressive lyrics, as indicated by the literate detail of tracks
    such as ""Psycho Killer"", ""Life During Wartime"" and ""Found a Job"".  And on an early version of ""Electricity
    (Drugs)""-- one of three tracks first released on a rare Warner promo release-- the band is sleepy and drony,
    countering the lyrical claims that ""I'm charged up.""  That track is also one of only three that is repeated
    on both discs, although on Disc 2, it's in as the more familiar ""Drugs (Electricity)"".</p><p>
    The second disc borrows a page from <i>Stop Making Sense</i>'s playbook and recreates the entire set from
    stops along the band's <i>Remain in Light</i> tour, including a handful of tracks from the much-bootlegged
    February 1981 performance at Tokyo's Nakano Sun Palace.  Expanded to a 10-piece band that included Adrian
    Belew on guitar and Bernie Worrell on keyboards, the bulk of Disc 2's material gives its studio versions a
    run for the money. Belew's nuanced guitar work, more confident contributions from the core members, and the
    added rhythmic dimension and heft are frequently jawdropping, but the loose beats and a playful Byrne keep
    claims of muso nonsense at arm's length.</p><p>
    The set itself is ordered nearly chronologically, which neatly and accidentally conforms to the logic of the
    album's running order.  Within the set, the band builds the rhythmic density of their tracks, kicking off
    with a quartet of songs from their first two albums (including second appearances by ""Psycho Killer"" and
    ""Stay Hungry""), before the funk-influenced ""Cities"" and African rhythms of ""I Zimbra"".  Those two fractured,
    beat-heavy and offbeat tracks guide the audience into the final two-thirds of the set, which is mostly built
    from the polyrhythmic <i>Remain in Light</i>.  Along the way, a melodic ""Animals""-- perhaps the set's weakest
    track in its studio version-- easily surpasses the original, led by a gorgeous harmonic middle section.</p><p>
    Last week, Rhino also released an 18-track <i>Best of Talking Heads</i> set.  Spanning the band's entire
    11-year career, it's well-selected considering its considerable limitations and is arguably more inclusive
    than <i>The Name of This Band</i>, but it is also unnecessary as anything other than a grab bag of familiar
    radio hits.  This live album, on the other hand, is not simply a fans-only document or a curio or a means
    of padding the discography or exploiting fans.  In many ways, it's the best one-stop document of what made
    Talking Heads one of the post-punk era's most dynamic and urgent bands, and a succinct argument for the
    merits of synthesizing rock with emerging, potentially oppositional sounds.  The latter is a lesson that
    will hopefully be learned by today's rock artists.</p></div>"|8266.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8266-the-name-of-this-band-is-talking-heads/|9.2|Scott Plagenhoef

    Sparta, and Taking Back Sunday in the mainstream niche occupied by bands who've planed away the rougher
    edges of screamo (or ""post-hardcore,"" if you like) and conflated edgy indie deportment with radio-ready
    pop dynamics, catchy adrenaline-soaked melodies, and a healthy dose of youth culture lifestyle branding
    (you know-- cute boys, great hair, sensitive yet <em>hard</em>, punk rock as corporate-backed package tour
    and soundtrack for extreme sports).  Often, these kinds of traits pose problems for rock critics, but I'm
    not going to sling a dour screed that calls for a return to fatuous indie ethics.  This is a diagnosis,
    not a lament.</p><p>
    
    In terms of creative trajectory, Engine Down have traversed a remarkably tidy arc, with a foreseeable terminus
    toward which they're decidedly aimed (it will be marked by full-on major label support and promotion, MTV
    rotation, and frequent soundtrack placement).  The progression has been accomplished with precisely measured
    gestures of smoothing and softening.  To wit:</p><p>
    
    Engine Down's debut LP for Lovitt Records, <em>Under the Pretense of Present Tense</em>, was prototypical,
    screamy post-hardcore (to a tee-- the superficially abstruse yet intrinsically meaningless syntax of its
    title is characteristic of the micro-genre). It was an exercise in stark opposites and crisp corners, with
    its pronounced loud/soft instrumental binary and Keely Davis' whisper-to-a-scream vocals.  While pretty
    standard stuff, and no more worthy of mainstream attention than spiritual brethren like Four Hundred Years,
    its sharp melodic sense and inchoate cello arrangements augured evolutions to come.</p><p>
    
    It required two records for Engine Down to bridge the gap between the indie-screamo of <em>Under the Pretense</em>
    and the radio-hardcore of this new album; they were the roughly coequal Lovitt releases <em>To Bury Within the
    Sound</em> and <em>Demure</em>. Both of these albums were solid, if slightly strange due to their transitional
    state, as Engine Down got busy with the chisel and began hewing the sharp corners from their sound.  Davis'
    reedy (yet bell-clear and resonant) vocals rubbed rather oddly against the still lo-fi (if more ambitious,
    thanks to J. Robbins) production-- the songs weren't quite the easy-to-swallow capsules they would become,
    but neither were they the quadrangular slabs of the band's debut, and the amorphous shapes were difficult
    to quantify.  The albums retained post-hardcore trappings, but were more melodic, moodier, poppier, screamless,
    slower, subtler in terms of volume and tempo shifts, and anchored more centrally around the piano and string
    arrangements.  While these records were not of the same caliber as this, their self-titled Lookout! debut,
    their ambition made it easy for anyone with a little intuition to see a departure like this mounting on the
    horizon.</p><p>
    
    And so we arrive at <em>Engine Down</em>, wherein the quantum leap the band was clearly straining toward on
    their previous two records is somewhat achieved.  Via a confluence of experience, ambition and glossy
    production, Engine Down have arrived at a palatable music that, with a little more refinement and promotional
    support, could cement their place in the mainstream cultural canon.  Indeed, the production is going to be
    the deal-breaker for Engine Down fans, and if you're usually biased against vaguely hardcore bands who put
    extra coats of lacquer on music that you feel should be raw and untamed, I'd suggest dropping the rating
    above by a full point.  By the same token, if you feel music is well-served by a high production value and
    view recording techniques as an integral component (Flaming Lips and late Modest Mouse fans, here's looking
    at you), you may do well to boost the rating into the low eights.</p><p>
    
    Because on this record (for which they've
    left Lovitt for the somewhat larger Lookout!, which one assumes to be a stepping stone toward Interscope or
    Epic), Engine Down have employed producer Brian McTernan (Thrice, Hot Water Music, et al.) to achieve starker
    sound separation, richer tones, and their most dark and rumbling atmospheres to date.  The upgrade is most
    apparent in Davis' vocals, which no longer cut through the arrangements like a dorsal fin, but nestle deeply
    into their terrain-- instead of being nasal and keening, they're lower, more variegated and shaded, and seem
    summoned from the diaphragm rather than torn from the lungs.</p><p>
    
    The band is easily recognizable-- Cornbread Compton's primal and syncopated percussion, Davis' vocal theatrics,
    Jason Wood's metronomic bass, and Jonathan Fuller's winnowing minor-key guitar dirges are all intact-- but
    recognizable in the way you recognize a childhood friend upon reconnecting with them in adulthood. Paradoxically,
    in perfecting a music that should resonate in teenaged breasts across the land, Engine Down have grown up.</p><p>
    
    All the earmarks of the new Engine Down are distilled in the opening track, ""Rogue"".  It's leaner, more
    propulsive and snarling than anything they've heretofore produced.  Davis' now-restrained vocals dart amid
    a swirl of feedback and unremitting, distorted bass, climbing a ladder of intensity toward the explosive
    chorus.  The staccato bursts and lilting, plaintive vocals of ""And Done"" recall Sunny Day Real Estate's
    more expansive moments.  ""Cover"" unfolds with relentless intensity as Davis glissades over meaty power
    chords and tricked-out guitar scribbles with an undeniable vocal authority.  Such aggressive fare is
    juxtaposed by morose torch songs like ""In Turn"", which wafts an ominous arpeggio over swelling strings and
    Davis' gentle vocals, as the arrangement ramifies in a crescendo of mounting pageantry. </p><p>
    
    ""Etcetera"" is a haunting chamber-song of night sounds and smoldering piano-man emoting, which, of course,
    gradually builds into a spine-shivering guitar climax that puts the record to rest. Its tone is consummately
    elegiac and mournful. Given Engine Down's history and implicit future trajectory, it's hard not to perceive
    ""Etcetera"" as a literal elegy, instead of a figurative critical construct: a requiem for the band they were,
    which must be interred and memorialized before they can embrace the band they clearly want to become. </p></div>"|2789.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2789-engine-down/|7.7|Brian Howe

Since he's fictional, I call him as I wish: Marshall.  Well, Marshall has a few hang-ups,
    one of which is Barsuk Records.  He can't forgive them for unveiling Death Cab's white-collared weeping on
    the world.  He curses their blue-eyed histrionics in a well-lubed monologue.  The age-old frailty, thy name
    is Gibbard diatribe.  Marshall un-surprised me earlier this week when I put on one of Barsuk's latest releases
    and he started sputtering again.  Goth is the new glam; it's our generation's adopted grunge; c'est le nouveau
    garage.  That Marshall.  He's so coy when alliterative.</p><p>
    
    But he's right.  On their second release, <i>Battery</i>, the Seattle quartet Aveo has Phil Ek manning
    the boards again, and the results, while perhaps more wide-sprung, sound all-too familiar.  Time,
    that ever-degrading barometer for pop music, has caught up with them.  In 2001, their Brit-derived
    goth-punk was just gaining a foothold and still felt like a novel reinvention; now, its dreary slog is as
    commonplace as three-chord punk after the millennium's turn.</p><p>
    
    Still, if the timing is a bit suspect (and, remember:  this is their second album), technically, Aveo prove
    sure-handed purveyors of sounds never far gone from pop.  Woking, Surrey and all of its punchdrunk-Who-punk
    of the late 70s is ably represented, just as surely as those indie-darlings The Smiths and The Cure.  Cranky
    guitars grind against the sedate echolalia of these harmonies, and they occasionally manage to enfold you in
    prickly gossamer.  When it works (""The Idiot on the Bike""), rudeboys and marble-eyed teens in thick-eyeliner
    exist in a tense, unshown turmoil where the chords laid out for each join without dissent.</p><p>
    
    But most of the time, their discord seems falsely summoned, as though choreographed for a fight scene where
    fists sweep three feet of air and never smack chin.  Marshall calls it Chicken Little Fright.  He might say
    that music this oppressive needs room to suffocate itself.  On <i>Battery</i>, Aveo poke just enough holes
    through their thick guitars and smoky atmospheres to let in unwanted air.  You're never stifled or left to
    gasp, and so when the dense, grimy textures they're creating fail, you hear only their Cleaveresque veneer.</p><p>
    
    The album's centerpiece, ""Fistfights with Mr. G"", offers the ideal illustration of these pitfalls.  After
    building a candlewaxed ballad up from the ground, lead singer William Wilson uncurls the line, ""I'll take
    him with one kick between his bony thighs.""  Marshall and I exchange a giggle.  Actually, we keep rewinding
    the song to that point and joining in with our <i>Fraggle Rock</i> falsettos.  The song's labyrinthine
    guitar work and pulsing keyboards crumble underneath this odd disjunction between hymnal sentience and
    kick-in-the-craw lyricism.  It's somewhat like Frank Zappa fronting Joy Division, ""Mudshark"" grunted out
    atop ""Disorder"".  Confusion settles in, but here it has no recourse to the musical buzzword of the last
    two years: irony.  Instead, it's impotent with cheap fuck-the-man irreverence, and ""Mr. G"" lays down limp
    and stringbeaned atop the song's now-lost transcendence.</p><p>
    
    As <i>Battery</i> spins through its final waltz, Marshall contemplates the pulp of his thumbflesh.   He
    says the whorls remind him of a cartographical system still undiscovered.  It's obvious that Aveo, with
    its tardy amalgam of Cure-rock, has him rethinking Barsuk.  It's not enough to forgive them for Gibbard's
    gum-toothed melancholy, but it may prove a serviceable distraction.  Anything to quell his monomania.</p></div>"|387.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/387-battery/|6.0|Derek Miller

    up: There hasn't been a more influential multimedia reacharound since Grand Royal.  I'm talking about the
    uberhip, post-nihilist <i>Vice</i> empire.  Birthed as a hilariously/repulsively degenerate magazine, <i>Vice</i>
    now embodies a film and TV production company, clothing line, and inevitable record label, presumably spawned
    as a funnel for all the musical effluvium snagged up by the magazine's cultural colander. Perhaps feeling
    underrepresented by the tongue-in-cheek electrofunk duo Chromeo (half-comprised of a <i>Vice</i> mag staffer),
    those cute ex-Canadians have gone and snagged themselves a jangly guitar duo to balance the roster.</p><p>
    
    Vietnam's debut EP arrived at my door with no press info, no web info, and no prelude.  The Polaroid images
    on the cover could've been taken from the magazine's recent ""Party Issue""-- two shaggy dudes with big mustaches
    offhandedly flicking off the photographer.  It's a delicious, Zen-like feeling, not knowing what to expect
    and expecting nothing.  If there's one thing I've learned from years of reading <i>Vice</i>, it's that
    inconsistency is the norm.</p><p>
    
    I'm wrestling the urge to sum up this EP with a smarmy, shit-eating donkey punch, a far cry from the usual
    upstanding intellectualism this humble weblication is known for.  Taboo, yes, but in homage to the muse I'm
    just gonna say fuck it and swing away, because one lyrical quotation from vocalist/guitarist Michael William,
    sung through his nose <i>exactly</i> like an exaggerated Jason Pierce, says it all: ""It makes... No diiiifference... To meeee...""</p><p>
    
    William and guitarist/vocalist Joshua Garrett so perfectly embody the witty, fuck-if-I-care ambivalence that
    spikes the copy of <i>Vice</i> magazine that I'm almost waiting for a chime to tell me to turn the page.  Over
    the course of five songs, William and Garrett take turns shamelessly aping the sacred cool of their space-rock
    forebears (especially Spacemen 3), accompanying their admittedly soulful vocal mimicry on guitars and bass.
    I'd love to describe this music without comparison, but Vietnam is so self-consciously imitative they practically
    beg for a bullet list.</p><p>
    
    Starting with a mellow guitar strum pulled straight from ""Heroin""'s reverent intro, the album burrows into
    Velvets melodrama with ""Too Tired"" and continues straight into the 10-minute anti-anthem of ""Makes No
    Difference"".  Both here-- and later on with the overlong ""Apocalypse""-- William's Dylan-esque drawl is
    disquieting, since the delivery is transparent but the words debased (ex. ""As you're lying there; you pull
    your fuckin' cock so you can prove you're not dead"").  Musically, though, ""Makes No Difference"" is all VU,
    stretching out over an opiated tambourine pulse that keeps time against a languid, droning guitar that
    eventually crashes into a heavy reverbed climax.  Here, Sterling Morrison and J. Spaceman lock horns in a
    hopeless, epic battle of influence.  But those lyrics, again, just scream postured detachment-- ""'Cuz baby,
    this is my life/ And everything else, man, it makes no difference/ To me.""</p><p>
    
    Garrett takes a turn on the mic with ""Princess"", his lifted Lou Reed photorealism perfectly affecting glam
    trash lyrics like, ""Well, you see she laid up in bed/ Eightballs dance through her head.""  The talent with
    these guys lies in the dead-on pantomiming of their heroes, and their ability to do it with ridiculous
    sincerity.  Which is somewhat respectable given the accuracy of the shot, and is a novelty for the first
    couple spins.  Gauge your interest by your tolerance for rock 'n' roll voyeurism, self-loathing, and Lower
    East Side style checking.</p><p>
    
    Like an average experience with <i>Vice</i>, whether you love this stuff, laugh at it, or loathe it naturally
    depends on how many beers have lubed your motor.  For that reason I'd say seeing Vietnam in a crowded,
    low-ceilinged bar with a bottle in hand would yield a much fuller experience than listening to the album
    in your living room.  As of this writing I'm putting down PBR #3, and that five-point-oh rating is starting
    to feel a little harsh.</p></div>"|8535.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8535-the-concretes-always-grayer-on-the-other-side-of-the-street-ep/|5.0|Jonathan Zwickel

    release on RCA.  This explains why you haven't been able to find the
    little bastard for years, but the good kids at Velvel know what's up;
    They've reissued this 1971 album (and are filling in the gaps for
    everything up until 1984).  <i>Muswell Hillbillies</i> may very well be the
    best Kinks album you never heard, a scathing but witty take on urban
    renewal.  No, it's not quite a concept album, more like an idea album--
    a buncha songs that are a bit downbeat in theme but lively in execution.</p><p>
    
    What's a Muswell Hillbilly?  Well, Muswell Hill was a community in
    England that the Davies family had to move to after their neighborhood
    in North London was razed and gentrified.  You do the math, kiddo.</p><p>
<i>Muswell Hillbillies</i> features Ray Davies at his whipcracking best,
    rolling out lyrics like ""The milkman's a spy and the grocer keeps
    on following me/ And the woman next door's an undercover for the KGB.""
    It's a pretty simple sound, and one that's more folk and country based
    than any album they'd ever done.  A wonderful brass band turns up on two
    of the album's best tracks ""Acute Schizophrenia Paranoia Blues"" and
    ""Alcohol"" (oh, there's a good combination). ""Here Comes the People In
    Gray"" is a bluesy stomp about a man whose house is being torn down by
    the city.  ""Oklahoma USA"" is a pretty ballad about living in a fantasy
    world ""with Shirley Jones and Gordon McRae.""  But other than the insidiously
    catchy chorus of ""Have A Cuppa Tea"" (you may
    be driven to murder if you listen to it too long), I can't find much
    to complain about with these <i>Hillbillies</i>.</p></div>"|4458.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4458-muswell-hillbillies/|8.9|Jason Josephes

Then, without warning, he
    hits upon just the right supporting cast, and strings together an impressive streak of victories.  After a
    historic three-peat, he briefly walks away from the spotlight and his team, only to return amid new surroundings,
    having discarded his classic squad in favor of new, younger collaborators.  With this new lineup, the player
    profits off his star power for another long stretch, occasionally offering up fleeting glimpses of his prior
    greatness, but mostly overstaying his welcome, whittling his adoring public down to a small core of blindly
    loyal fans.</p><p>
    To call Robert Pollard the Michael Jordan of indie rock is a wince-inducing comparison if ever there was
    one, but it's hard to ignore the parallel lines on a slow decline.  Correspondingly, it makes sense to treat
    the release of what has been declared the final Guided by Voices album like an athlete's number-retiring
    ceremony, with Pollard's Daltrey-fringe jacket being lifted to the rafters and a bronze statue of the
    singer in mid-kick unveiled outside Pitchfork HQ while we all sing ""Game of Pricks"".  Despite the piñata
    status of the Pollardverse over the last decade, where every rookie staffer was given a practice thwack at
    the latest tossed-off GBV side project, the majority of us can't help but feel a little sad to see the
    group's credits roll.</p><p>
    It must be noted, however, that the band's death was not a sudden one.  The romanticized mythology of
    Guided by Voices in the mid-90s may have been one of the greatest tales of indie lore: A gang of bored
    Midwestern middle-agers, fueled by ethanol, gather nightly for basement recording sessions, and in doing
    so happen to lay down some of the greatest pop anthems ever poorly recorded.  No author could've dreamt up
    a more ridiculous cast, with a mic-swinging frontman sweating five songs a day and leading an amateur band
    full of impossibly wonderful names like Tobin Sprout, Mitch Mitchell, and Greg Demos.</p><p>
    But with <i>Under the Bushes Under the Stars</i> closing out that incarnation's three-album summit, Pollard
    chose to molt and start anew, dismissing the ""Dayton lineup"" and replacing them with the snakeskin-boot
    professionalism of Cobra Verde.  From that point on, GBV was all but synonymous with The Robert Pollard
    Experience, a vehicle for Bob to choose whatever personnel he calculated most likely to achieve his new
    dreams of crossover radio success.  In the inane court of sellout justice, one could probably throw the
    book at Uncle Bob, but far more distressing was that he seemed to misplace most of the group's strengths
    amidst an ever-growing pile of side project detritus.</p><p>
<i>Half Smiles of the Decomposed</i>, like the preceding <i>Earthquake Glue</i>, finds Pollard aiming the
    bow of the GBV ship back towards some semblance of what made their fuzzy early days memorable.  While the
    lo-fi sound Guided by Voices perfected has long since become a lazy fashion statement of slapdash indie
    bands, Pollard's anthems always sounded paradoxically hollow drenched in stadium production, and
    <i>Half Smiles</i> settles upon a more comfortable mid-fi compromise that reflects virtually none of
    ex-producer Ric Ocasek's syrupy brightness.</p><p>
    What continues to elude Pollard's memory, unfortunately, is the economy of arrangement that used to set his
    music apart, melodic viruses that promptly deposited their hook-filled DNA before immediately perishing.
    Even the shortest songs on <i>Half Smiles</i> (""Girls of Wild Strawberries"", ""Gonna Never Have to Die"")
    would be the GBV equivalent of a side-long suite on older LPs, their 2-minute runtimes inflated by such
    routine features as second verses and chorus repetitions.  Unsurprisingly, these shorter songs are also the
    best-- ""Girls"" a bright acoustic march, ""Gonna Never"" a tattling sing-along laced with startling synth.
    ""Closets of Henry"", meanwhile, proves that Pollard will never lose the ability to trigger the fist-pump
    reflex, contracting listeners' biceps with mere drum rolls and ohhhh's.</p><p>
    Yet lyrically, Pollard continues to move in a more literal and reflective direction, resuming recent albums'
    obsessions with deconstructing his much-beloved World's Rockingest Alcoholic persona.  If opening his band's
    final statement with a song called ""Everyone Thinks I'm a Raincloud"" and chanting ""for far too looooong""
    over the closing fadeout doesn't give you a snapshot of Bob's current attitude, look no further than the
    ominous crawl of ""Sleepover Jack"", as dark a song as can be found in the swollen GBV discog.  Sounding every
    wrinkle of his nearly 50 years, Pollard sounds knocked around by the song's slapping, incessant guitar riffs,
    sighing, \x93I know/ You're gonna fuck up my makeup/ You're gonna make up my fuckup.""</p><p>
    Every GBV release (yes, even <i>Do the Collapse</i>) since their heyday has had a pocketful of bright spots,
    though, and the mediocre filler that rounds out <i>Half Smiles</i>' lineup is, sadly, par for the band's
    late-era course.  Slow, limp songs like ""Window of My World"" and ""Tour Guide at the Winston Churchhill
    Memorial"" can't come close to even the outtakes (<i>Suitcase</i>) of the outtakes (<i>King Shit and the
    Golden Boys</i>) from the band's classic lineup, and album-sequencing-freak Pollard continues to neglect
    the sort of 10-second fragment interludes that used to suture their ADD-stricken albums into cohesion.</p><p>
    And so the rock star dreams of Dayton's most prolific grade-school teacher reach their exhausted conclusion,
    the suitably bombastic career-ender ""Huffman Prairie Flying Field"" slyly announcing, ""If that's what you
    want to hear/ Then that's what I will sell you.""  That may be exactly what we're about to get in the
    post-GBV era, as Pollard mentions in a recent interview that his next release will be a double-album
    (shock!) of forgotten tracks from his shoebox archives.  While retiring the name of GBV may be no more
    than a symbolic move, it's possible that leaving behind the franchise, its expectations, and its faded
    momentum is just the thing to relight a flame in the man of 10,000 songs.</p></div>"|3599.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3599-half-smiles-of-the-decomposed/|7.0|Rob Mitchum

    don't, they make them up.  The objective interpretation of reporting isn't so far off the subjective work
    of discussing music; certainly the demand for information is the same, and if one favors hard facts above
    plain fiction, it's only by a small margin.  I could have presented a story about how Japan's DILL (Yuji
    Inoue) was apparently unaware that his static-y music-- spliced, cut and pasted like the best turn-of-the-millennium
    electronica-- was at least three years too late to make a difference, and it might very well have been good
    journalism.  There are plenty of musical examples to support that claim, not least of which are covered in
    Pitchfork reviews of Autechre, Squarepusher, Aphex Twin, Plaid and Hecker.  But sometimes, it's worth missing
    the obvious in favor of catching something better.</p><p>
<i>WYHIWYG</i>'s details are minute but endearing.  DILL's music seems complicated in its construction, but
    comes out flawed instead of ""glitch,"" live instead of quantized, and modern instead of post-modern.  The
    cuts and actual glitches are often reminiscent of considerably colder efforts by Autechre or Markus Popp,
    though are less experiments in electronically controlled chaos than the carvings and angles of sharp,
    ambitious ambient music.  Inoue uses cello, piano and soft female vocals modestly, placing them strategically
    throughout the album's 37-minute program; he uses enough organic source material that the songs seem only
    just out of reach for a particularly precise chamber pop ensemble.  In fact, the minimalist arrangements
    often exploit so few elements that I'm reminded of his cousins in Onkyo, who approach improvisation with
    the same knack for naturalism and understatement.  Inoue's music is a lot closer to Brian Eno's classically
    informed ambience than Otomo Yoshihide's space-age free improvisation, but is just as Spartan and strangely
    attractive.</p><p>
    The tracks with vocals stand out immediately; Inoue has a knack for supporting clear, seductive melodies
    with restless, jittery glitch.  The brief ""Tena"" features the rounded, vocoder-affected alto of Akiko Sasaki
    over a minimal bassline and collage-style backdrop.  Radio static comes and goes, and on the second verse I
    can hear bits of Eastern percussion, a falling siren and near atonal synthesizer clips.  Yet, despite
    potential overcrowding, the track feels barely there.  ""Up Down to There"" is similarly, deceptively busy,
    but uses its glitched pitter-patter to form the hint of a beat.  A looped succession of sine waves introduces
    a two-chord progression and simple synth melody that wouldn't sound out of place on one of the Cluster/Eno
    records.  However, the cut-up vocals about 6 minutes in remind me of Prefuse 73, or some such practitioner
    of digital-age voice design.  The song also makes the case that Björk should have listened to DILL prior to
    recording the vocally obsessed <i>Medulla</i>.</p><p>
    The anatomies of the individual tracks should interest fans of that good old dead IDM, especially those who
    felt its apex was Autechre's <i>Confield</i>.  DILL's beats favor seemingly random successions of hi-hat and
    bass drum, and nary a backbeat within earshot.  ""Onpotts"", with still more ingeniously manipulated vocal,
    pipes in a soft, jazzy shuffle (not schaffel, Cologners), and the shoegazed ""Won Noefte Jam"" features live
    drumming and a melancholy vocal duet.  However, Inoue is hardly content to while away into gray bliss,
    opting to rinse the beat under his software and letting the singer carry the tune over a single-note-obsessed
    guitar.  Dozens of things like this happen on each track on <i>WYHIWYG</i>, and in the hands of a lesser
    artist, could easily overwhelm the senses.  DILL is more interested in revealing things few people notice,
    and in the process, creates something obviously beautiful.</p></div>"|2567.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2567-wyhiwyg/|8.4|Dominique Leone

    mesmerized awe.  Both reactions are surprisingly extreme, because The Shaggs' catalog, collected in its
    entirety on this rehashing of a 1988 Rounder compilation, has always struck me as awkward and poignant,
    with subtle hints of tragedy lurking beneath the music's surface.</p><p>
    
    The Shaggs' backstory is legendary: Sometime circa 1968, the Wiggin sisters Dot, Betty, and Helen, at the
    insistence of their enigmatic, overbearing father Austin Wiggin, Jr., formed a family pop band, presumably
    to fulfill one of dad's vicarious fantasies.  Only one year after devoting their energies toward music
    lessons (they were home-schooled to help maintain musical focus), the Wiggins entered a cheap recording
    studio and emerged with <i>Philosophy of the World</i>, which amazingly became one of the great obscure
    gems of all time after its NRBQ-backed re-release in the 1980s.</p><p>
    
    If their initial popularity was contingent on chance, The Shaggs' longevity is no fluke-- their music is
    brutally honest and has always been primarily informed by adolescent guilt (""I learned my lesson never to
    roam""), an open love of innocuous pop (""my companion is my radio""), shame (""sometimes I feel bottled up
    inside""), and a profound sense of obligation to family.  ""Who Are Parents"" posits that kids who ""do things
    their own way [and] don't know what life really means,"" and that strict adherence to ""certain rules,"" though
    seemingly ""cruel,"" is the family ideal.</p><p>
    
    Discussions of the Wiggins' dexterity as pop musicians are usually relegated to the two extremes of The
    Shaggs spectrum: Their complete lack of traditional musical sense is either uproarious or somehow transcendent
    in its crudeness.  The uniform complexity of The Shaggs' songs, and the fortitude of their nascent musicianship,
    is often overlooked.  The 2001 tribute album to The Shaggs emphasizes just how tenuous and complicated their
    compositions really are; most of the artists perform their chosen covers with the reluctance and reserve of
    a sight-reading community theater pianist.</p><p>
    
    And who could blame them?  There is no discernible meter or chord structure to follow, and The Shaggs'
    melodies are pretty much constructed at random, becoming a series of bastardized scale exercises.  But
    this isn't a simple case of lead singer Dot making up the tune as she pleases.  Her sister Betty unfailingly
    sings every arbitrary note in unison.  Whether this was the result of constant practice (another disconcerting
    hint at the likely atmosphere of ""jam sessions"" in the Wiggin household) or some kind of psychic sibling
    intuition is anyone's guess.</p><p>
    
    The Shaggs' later material, which consists entirely of the mid-70s LP <i>Shaggs' Own Thing</i>, falls back
    on amateurish bubblegum country, underscoring the singularity and starkness of their debut.  But even this
    comparatively mediocre record packs a subversive punch.  The title track, a duet between father Wiggin and
    eldest brother Robert, is particularly disturbing-- in the song, Austin catches another man (his son)
    ""sneakin' out"" with his girl and ""doin' it"" with her.  I guess no one in the recording booth interrupted to
    explain the Oedipal implications to the (presumably) oblivious parties involved.</p><p>
    
    Most who have heard The Shaggs know where they stand.  To those who think the music is ""hilarious,"" this
    compilation isn't essential, but will certainly provide more fodder for easy mocking; to those who worship
    every note the band ever recorded, you almost certainly own this album already in one of its previous
    incarnations, and are advised to wait it out for the <i>Philosophy of the World</i> five-disc deluxe box
    set, which includes the complete unedited session tapes and a 300-page booklet of assorted Foot Foot
    sketches.</p></div>"|7088.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7088-the-shaggs/|6.7|David Moore

    suffering countless accusations of stealing The Strokes' shtick (despite the fact that they formed years
    before The Strokes and generally embrace a pre-Velvet Underground aesthetic), the members of one of New
    York's most consistently underrated garage-rock revival groups are understandably fed up with their relative
    obscurity.  For <i>Alive &amp; Amplified</i>, the band has scrubbed off the caked-on Detroit grime of <i>Electric
    Sweat</i> and hit the studio with hot-shit production team The Matrix, whose recent Extreme Makeover work
    with Liz Phair understandably led to suspicion among many of the band's devotees.  The resulting album is
    a glossy, well-polished document of a band reluctantly selling its soul in the name of wider exposure.</p><p>
    
    The real problem here is that The Matrix crew has absolutely nothing to offer the band, whose raucous and
    refreshingly genuine <i>Nuggets</i> fetishizing arguably reached its apex on their previous release.  Where
    Jim Diamond's bare-bones production allowed the band space to develop their self-contained energy in concise
    bursts of inspired proto-punk homage, The Matrix's luster robs Suzuki's music of its greasy authenticity.</p><p>
    
    To say that the album is over-produced is an understatement; you could bounce a quarter off of most of these
    songs.  Sammy James, Jr.'s vocals have been unwisely pushed to the forefront of the mix, accentuating his
    lyrical awkwardness, while James and Graham Tyler's dual guitar attack has been dissected and isolated,
    leading to a markedly sterile sound.  In the past, each element of the band's sound blended harmoniously
    in a melange of mod and classic rock influences, but this album is covered in the thick fingerprints of
    The Matrix team's calculated, high-end sheen.</p><p>
    
    Opener ""Primitive Condition"" immediately finds the band in uncharacteristically clumsy form.  The song's
    generic country-fried guitar hook is forced and uninspired, while James offers perhaps his most insipid
    lyrics to date, cribbing from The Bloodhound Gang's notebook with lines like, ""Let's get in a primitive
    position/ We're just fancy animals with hands/ And animal glands.""  The track, like much of the album, is
    overwhelmed by derivative classic rock bloat, and the lean, muscular sound of their unabashed early Who
    reverence is sorely missed.</p><p>
    
    ""Alive &amp; Amplified"", the album's first single, sounds specifically constructed for mass consumption, and
    the song, with its tired 70s dinosaur rock replication and overbearing chorus, insinuates itself with the
    subtlety of a battering ram.  ""Legal High"" is so watered-down and ineffectual that it would feel at home
    next to a Vines track, while ""Loose n' Juicy"" and ""Hot Sugar"" achieve a level of unremarkable blues-rock
    plagiarism worthy of The Blues Brothers.  The album's few high points, such as they are, hint at the band's
    former glory-- ""New York Girls"" just barely touches bases with The New York Dolls, and ""Sometimes Somethin'""
    is an effective imitation of overwrought Stones balladry, though it sounds out of place after the frantic
    and humorless ""Shake That Bush Again"".</p><p>
    
    Stories of the grueling recording process that spawned <i>Alive &amp; Amplified</i> provide some insight into
    the album's general blandness: James has said that 90% of what The Matrix presented sounded like ""someone
    else's multi-platinum hit.""  Half of that sounds about right; this certainly doesn't sound like The Mooney
    Suzuki, even if it does sound strikingly similar to every other ""garage"" cash-in band on the market.  But
    the chances of this album going platinum are about the same as The Mooney Suzuki providing music for a video
    game soundtra-- oh, right.  Hell, I suppose stranger things have happened.</p></div>"|5419.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5419-alive-amplified/|5.0|David Moore

    They're trying to evoke an era when every band rocked asses and arenas, groupies were nubile and plentiful,
    guitars blasted through walls, and solos lasted all night.  But it's all so much rose-colored hindsight, a
    fantasy by musicians too young to have experienced the glory days firsthand and therefore condemned to
    recreate it with only a few scribbled notes and hazy childhood memories.</p><p>
    
    The Datsuns attempted to revive the classic rock era on their self-titled debut album in 2002, but the
    results sounded messy and anonymous, devoid of humor and personality.  While its title would seem to
    suggest some of sort of Wilco-like transformation, the band's follow-up, <i>Outta Sight/Outta Mind</i>,
    instead offers more of the same; it's a considerable improvement over the original-- perhaps due to
    production by Led Zeppelin's John Paul Jones-- but that's not saying much. If their debut was Paleolithic
    in its riffs and sexual politics, then <i>Outta Sight/Outta Mind</i> is merely Mesolithic.  Something closer
    to late Neolithic would be nice.</p><p>
    
    While The Datsuns' sound is slightly harder and heavier than their garage-rock contemporaries, the band is
    still confined to the genre's constricted song format.  Instead of indulging in long, screeching guitar solos
    or groove-driven noise freakouts, they adhere pretty closely to the verse/chorus/verse/chorus/bridge/solo/chorus/finale
    template throughout <i>Outta Sight/Outta Mind</i>.  This self-imposed constraint hems in other tendencies:
    Christian Datsun is a capable guitar player, but his solos feel compacted and listless when confined to
    three-minute songs.  They could be powerhouse showcases for his fretwork, but usually they just sound
    obligatory.</p><p>
    
    It doesn't help that The Datsuns' pop-length tracks tend to substitute mindless misogyny and awkward phrasings
    for hooks and meaningful lyrics.  Like The Darkness, Dolf Datsun tries to inject his lyrics with an undercurrent
    of adolescent sexuality, but without Justin Hawkins' self-awareness and sense of goofy fun, the subtext quickly
    becomes the text.  ""Girl's Best Friend"" refers to Dolf's dick.  It's too easy to guess what ""Cherry Lane"" is
    about.  Here's a hint: ""A boy is a boy/ But a girl is a child,"" Dolf sings, ""They mustn't be broken, they
    mustn't be harmed.""  I'm not saying rock music should ever have to adhere to political correctness, but
    by now, this is pure cliche-- irony without a punchline.</p><p>
    
    Which is too bad, as The Datsuns show new promise on tracks like the lamenting ""What I've Lost"".  But their
    caveman take on 70s nostalgia-- simultaneously misguided and entirely too obvious-- renders them mostly
    forgettable and entirely ineffectual.  The Donnas sound more depraved and dangerous, and even Jet has better
    hooks.  This one will soon live up to its title.</p></div>"|11716.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11716-outta-sightoutta-mind/|4.0|Stephen M. Deusner

It does nothing to transport
    you, but if all else fails, it keeps you alive.  When Clinic splashed down with their self-titled EP six years
    ago, they seemed capable of so much, and indeed, they accomplished a lot in two years, cranking out three
    excellent EPs and a debut full-length, <i>Internal Wrangler</i>, whose brilliance hasn't dimmed one iota
    with age.  Yet, two albums and four years later, they seem content simply to keep their head above water.</p><p>
    
    So much acclaim early on can be difficult for a band to cope with, and even before <i>Internal Wrangler</i>
    had officially reached U.S. shores, our speculative media culture was already trying to figure out how
    Clinic could possibly follow such a touchstone.  The band were all over John Peel's show, praised from
    all quarters, and asked to open for Radiohead, and their surgical scrubs schtick-- initially a joke
    that helped them garner early attention-- became a sort of straitjacket: They were even booed once at a
    London gig for appearing onstage in street clothes when the scrubs were stolen prior to showtime.</p><p>
    
    To Clinic's credit, their sophomore album, <i>Walking with Thee</i>, strived for progression.  Its restraint,
    however, also diluted much of what had made the band so exciting and perfect in the first place.  They no
    longer delved into those erratic, two-minute interjections and enthusiastic experiments that had lent
    <i>Internal Wrangler</i> its schizophrenic unpredictability, and without that exuberant exploration, even
    <i>Walking with Thee</i>'s finest moments felt cold and studied.  The madcap infectiousness that had so
    thrilled listeners originally had been extinguished-- and along with it, much of their unhinged, unfiltered
    energy.</p><p>
<i>Walking with Thee</i> was often described as falling about halfway between what Clinic had been and what
    Clinic could be.  The same could be said for <i>Winchester Cathedral</i>.  Clarinet and melodica again lead
    the charge, and Ade Blackburn's voice is frustratingly suppressed throughout, forcing his trademark alphabet
    soup under an impenetrable wave of surf guitar.  But the disc does open promisingly, with a quickening EKG
    pulse that flatlines under metal chimes, guitars bursting in, and Blackburn churning out near-unintelligible
    lyrics through clenched teeth.  As the drums stomp and the melodica wails, the music could be recognized as
    no other band than Clinic, and in an instant, it becomes crystal clear that the band have created an utterly
    unique sound for themselves.</p><p>
    
    Each of the next three songs, however, is built on a similar template.  Two of these do throw in some minor
    variations-- a Peter Hook-ish bassline on ""Anne"", or a piano line beneath ""Circle of Fifths""-- but the
    album's first single, ""The Magician"", is essentially ""The Return of the Return of Evil Bill"".  The band
    glides with rhythmic ease through all of this, yet no one song stands apart from the others, and before
    long, the album hits a wall: ""Vertical Takeoff from Egypt"", a grinding and boring instrumental, leaves off
    the band's signature spring reverb, feeling totally out of synch with the rest of the record.  Later, the
    album closes with another instrumental, ""Fingers"", which feels like an unfinished vocal track slathered with
    clarinet and noisy guitar outbursts to cover for its lack of emotional center.</p><p>
    
    The downplaying of Blackburn's vocals is another element detracting from <i>Winchester Cathedral</i>'s
    emotional gravity.  On ""The Second Line"", he made complete gibberish sound inexplicably fresh, even
    transcendent, but mixed beneath the barrage of instrumentation, none of his prior character or personality
    shows through.  The only songs that truly move the album's plot forward come during the album's last quarter:
    The haunting ballad ""Falstaff"" makes a worthy successor to past Clinic slow-songs ""Goodnight Georgie"" and
    ""Porno""-- its velvety doo-wop harmonies and wet guitars waltz in a sea of reverb while plaintive clarinet
    offers a fragile counterpoint to Blackburn's intense refrain.  The grotesque Eastern European rock of
    ""August"", meanwhile, is a radical step forward, even incorporating Klezmer overtones.  On these two short
    tracks, we're given a glimpse at what could be a very promising direction for the band.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, the surrounding material shows the band reverting to a by-now very comfortable sound, seeming
    to indicate that, at least for now, they have put their evolution as a band on the backburner to pursue safer
    attributes like maturation and continuity, which means that the album finds Clinic stuck in the same transitional
    territory of <i>Walking with Thee</i>.  <i>Winchester Cathedral</i> is not a bad album, and removed from
    context, most of its songs stand alone well.  Still, one can't shake the feeling that formula is what's
    really at the heart of the record, and in light of the promise shown by their debut, that lack of fervor
    and off-the-cuff adventurousness is a difficult shortcoming to ignore.</p></div>"|1515.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1515-winchester-cathedral/|6.9|Joe Tangari

    hardcore, industrial, avant-garde, revolutionary, crazy, fuckin' crazy.  Like the works of any successful
    composer, they are what you make of them.  Theirs is also music you're likely to respond differently to
    each time you hear it, and by that I don't mean that sometimes you'll find yourself passively reaching for
    it, while others you simply won't be in the mood; Yellow Swans have a more intense effect on your emotions
    and impulses.</p><p>
    
    At best, I feel at home inside their music, like these songs were written specifically for me and I can kick
    my feet up, let down my manners, and generally be part of them.  That's a profound feeling.  Equally profound
    is how much I can hate this record at times.  Feeling alienated and utterly worn down after the first track,
    ""Police Eternity"", I've often thrown in the towel and vowed never to hear it again.  But my inner masochist
    always find some excuse to return, and I've generally found the album more enjoyable with each subsequent
    listen.</p><p>
    
    Yellow Swans are almost too adept for the type of music they play: Shrill, anarchic, noise-laden, and largely
    improvised, their aural base-jumping in theory embodies the spirit of deliberate improvisers like Glenn Branca
    and Sachiko M, but in practice identifies more closely with the stridency of Wolf Eyes and Merzbow.  If you
    must, yes, this is some heady shit. In fact, <i>Bring the Neon War Home</i> is often dauntingly noisy.
    Propelled by a duly menacing industrial beat, ""Police Eternity"" opens things on an unambiguous note, all
    ring-modulated guitar peals spiraling off like a video game laser gone haywire, mammoth glaciers of feedback
    plodding insistently forward, and unintelligible vocal yowling.  But as with all five tracks on this collection,
    there's a pinioning melodic undercurrent, faint but insistent, that I believe is what makes Yellow Swans so
    compelling.</p><p>
    
    ""Police Eternity"" is easily the most confrontational (and thus potentially off-putting) track on <i>Neon War</i>.
    Clocking in at just over four minutes, it's almost a condensed version of the album as a whole, melding
    spacious textures, propulsive industrial beats, and grating feedback in one tumescent package.  Other songs
    branch off down these individual tributaries: ""High on the Mountain of Love"" is an avalanche of sound;
    unwieldy and arrhythmic, the only thing certain about it is its persistent, all-encompassing forward
    momentum.  Elsewhere, ""Neon War"" is the most melodically top-heavy, riffing for 13 minutes atop a pounding
    beat, barely audible bassline, and quaking, gradually decomposing guitar loop.  The untitled closing track,
    meanwhile, is a hushed, ruinous skeleton of the music of which it lies in wake, vaster, more imagistic, and
    even delicate by Yellow Swans' standards.</p><p>
    
    The thing at once so intimidating and admirable about Yellow Swans is how they eschew the reductive ""anybody
    could do that"" branding foisted upon many noise and improv acts.  As entropic and abrasive as their compositions
    can wax, there's an unflagging virtuosity to them that at once demands attention and punishes the listener
    for getting too close.  Like Branca's monolithic ""Lesson No. 2"", Yellow Swans are staggeringly deliberate;
    their patience and acute attention to detail allow them to pack a beguilingly huge wallop, and <i>Bring the
    Neon War Home</i> prevails on density, not girth.</p></div>"|8909.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8909-bring-the-neon-war-home/|8.3|Sam Ubl

Exercises in Surprise|4451.0|The Vandermark Five|[]|0.0|0.0|0.0|['Atavistic']|2004-08-22 00:00:00|2004|2016-06-11 21:10:10.983176|"<div class=""contents dropcap"" data-reactid="".g1i9hmjym8.1.6:0.1.0.$8398/=1$8398.0.3.2.0.1.0.1""><p>The academic establishment's gradual acceptance of jazz as a valid, complex art has produced a legion of
    white guys in turtlenecks, intent on the nerdification of what had been an inherently pre-cognitive form
    of expression.  Theory, however, tends to oppose creation, and jazz today is often either a painfully
    intellectual or quaintly nostalgic affair, leaving few modern performers that aim both for visceral impact
    and musical progress.</p><p>
    
    That aim at the visceral is what makes The Vandermark Five, a quintet of white guys in
    turtlenecks, so unexpectedly refreshing.  The avant-jazz scene is filled with those who wish to expand its
    sonic palette, or redefine the term ""jazz"" entirely within a world of samples and post-modern jumble.  It's
    a rare group that purposefully and successfully advances the movement into modernity within the confines of
    a fairly standard ensemble, and the fact that traditionalists have questioned V5's ""legitimacy"" only strengthens
    their position.  A listener will find something immediately gripping about their newest recording, <i>Elements
    of Style... Exercises in Surprise</i>: It's the sound of solid compositions filtered through unpretentious,
    energetic performing.</p><p>
    
    Though Ken Vandermark's playing bears the stamp of Sun Ra's influence, it contains none of the great
    spaceman's studio experimentation; while his style is sometimes compared to John Zorn's, one doesn't get
    the same sense that Vandermark's out to prove anything.  His failure to indulge the time-honored Jazz
    tradition of honing persona and mystique may end up cementing him within the sidenotes, but it allows his
    playing to come across as sincere, egoless, and confident-- an important vibe to transmit in such obtuse
    musical territory.</p><p>
    
    Confidence is an audible quality in any improvisational performance, but perhaps none
    more so than free jazz.  It might seem anti-intuitive to attribute the success of a braying, squeaking solo
    to nearly imperceptible subtleties, but it's the performer's intense vision and forward momentum that can
    give the music its force, or render it aseptic.  From the first freakout of opener ""Outside Ticket [for
    John Gilmore]"", the listener is ready to place trust in Vandermark and his tight ensemble, rendered nearly
    telepathic in their musical communication from years of live performance.</p><p>
    
    Vandermark's compositions strike a balance between surface-level impact and deeper complexity.  In one of
    the album's most solid tracks, ""Knock Yourself Out [for Jean-Michel Basquiat]"", drummer Tim Daisy and bassist
    Kent Kessler work in tandem to constantly shift the downbeat, and flow from solid groove to controlled chaos
    in a heartbeat.  Vandermark, Jeb Bishop and Dave Rempis begin with a straight ahead funky octave hook, moving
    quickly to far-out territory and back again; each return to the theme increasingly explores the polyrhythms
    inherent in phasing or inverting it, and each departure becomes more abstract and minimal.  Their juxtaposition
    of such a standard hook with their wild soloing could be seen as humorous or sardonic, but the passion with
    which it's all presented instead draws a connecting line from past to present.  In ""Telefon [for Glenn Gould]"",
    the quintet leaps from frenetic swing to microtonal drone and then back again, a structure of calm in the
    center of a storm that paints an image of the great Bach pianist Gould sitting in Zen bliss as counterpoint
    lines flow from his fingertips into the surrounding air.  The pieces here are all dedicated to various
    artists who have pushed their forms forward while remaining cognizant of those who've preceded them,
    reflecting V5's general preoccupation with their own place in jazz's linear history.</p><p>
    
    Just as V5's freedom within convention stands as a testament to their musicality, however, it's also what
    holds them in place.  While the jazz greats can be spoken of in their ""phases"" and ""periods,"" it's not clear
    that Vandermark is headed anywhere in particular.  Despite the success of these compositions and energy
    present in the recording, <i>Elements of Style</i> would add little to the collection of one who owns V5's
    previous output.  This pressing of the album includes a disc of Vandermark's arrangements of songs by the
    great Rahsaan Roland Kirk, famous for playing several saxophones simultaneously.  Vandermark's arrangements
    are skillful, and an admirable attempt to focus attention on Kirk's music, rather than the man's defining
    gimmick.  Ultimately, though, the recording feels dull-- while the pieces seem like they'd be excellent
    live, the disc is not an engaging listen following the unhinged joy apparent in the first.</p><p>
    
    Ken Vandermark is in a tough position, attempting to hone a modern style that delivers satisfaction to the
    audience-- to feel good about himself both as an artist and as a performer.  He's managed to find a successful
    balance of both, though his overall consistency is approaching stasis, and one hopes that he's getting ready
    to mix things up or forge some new territory.  Still, <i>Elements of Style... Exercises in Surprise</i> is
    a great album, and about as accessible as free-jazz can be.  Full of energy and purpose, its should offer
    any music lover a refreshing oasis of excellent musicianship.</p></div>"|8398.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8398-elements-of-style-exercises-in-surprise/|7.8|Liam Singer

Both as a solo
    artist and in collaboration with such like-minded cohorts as Simon Wickham-Smith and Acid Mothers Temple's
    Makoto Kawabata, the prolific Youngs has always made highly personalized music that forges improbable links
    between traditional folk, musique concrete and avant-garde electronic minimalism.  His back catalog is a
    maze of lane changes and about-faces, so it should come as no surprise that <i>River Through Howling Sky</i>
    manages to simultaneously be a continuation of his past as well as a new departure.</p><p>
    
    This is Youngs' fifth solo release on Jagjaguwar in five years, and it finds him turning away from the
    fingerpicked acoustic guitars and pastoral folk melodies that helped leaven the experimentation of 2002's
    <i>May</i> and 2003's <i>Airs of the Ear</i>.  Instead, Youngs casts the listener into a vast, inhospitable
    landscape here, occupied by little but his keening voice, violent stabs of electric guitar, and tottering
    percussion that follows along reluctantly behind him like a thirsty burro.  This skeletal mixture combined
    with his almost ritualistic use of repetition and epic song lengths make this perhaps the most intense,
    comfortless work of his career.</p><p>
    
    His guitar is the most immediately arresting element of ""Fountain of Light"", the 8-minute opening track that
    quickly establishes the album's parameters.  Utilizing a torrent of piercing, boundlessly sustained single
    notes, Youngs' playing here is highly reminiscent of <i>Moonyean</i>-era Loren MazzaCane Connors.  Like
    Connors, Youngs is able to conjure up a universe of solitary desperation with incredible efficiency, sending
    wave after wave of distressed pleas skyward like signal flares.</p><p>
    
    This guitar onslaught stands in jarring contrast to Youngs' vocals.  His voice is as pure and sweet as a
    field of Highland clover, and in the past he has (at least occasionally) used it on the type of tunes that
    you might expect to hear hummed by a shepherd.  But on <i>River Through Howling Sky</i>, his vocals are
    unmoored and wandering, following the open-ended melodic structures of songs like ""Blossom"" or the marathon
    ""Red Cloud Singular"" up countless false peaks and through endless blind canyons.  When on the latter he
    gradually intones, ""I see a river/ I see where it flows/ I see infinity,"" it's with a sense of impending
    mortality rather than joyful discovery, especially with those ominous guitar thunderheads looming above
    him.</p><p>
    
    Listening to <i>River Through Howling Sky</i> straight through in its entirety can be an exhausting experience,
    but if one approaches it in the proper frame of mind, it can also be a rewarding one.  It's certainly not the
    record to put on if you're in the mood for pure entertainment, but if you're a listener who enjoys the
    occasional glimpse of a talented artist doing some strenuous off-map spiritual exploring, Youngs has again
    outfitted you for an adventure.  And it's an expedition made even more harrowing when you realize that your
    guide has no more idea where he's going than you do.</p></div>"|8842.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8842-river-through-howling-sky/|6.9|Matthew Murphy

    <em>Free the Bees</em> apes its antecedents would be to shamelessly ape Pitchfork alum Brent DiCrescenzo.  Yet
    half-baked imitation, no matter how conceptually apt, is a recipe for mediocrity.</p><p>
    
    That's probably news to The Bees, whom you may have known as A Band of Bees on their debut, <em>Sunshine Hit
    Me</em>.  Back then, the group was a duo, recording in a shed, and improbably following their Beta Band-like
    flights of electropop fancy into tropicalia and even reggae.  This time out, The Bees hunkered down in Abbey
    Road, with four new members and major-label backing.  ""These are the ghosts I've made,"" sings Paul Butler on
    the opening track, but it sounds more like the studios' ghosts made him.</p><p>
    
    Had I written my concept review, you'd be reading about how Inspector Pinot Grigio of Interpol (the agency,
    not the band, natch) apprehended master masterpiece-forger Rolf Otterloo, the man behind high-profile fake
    Van Goghs, Gaugins, Mondrians and one work by Xu Beihong for a museum in Beijing.  The only difference
    between a fake and an original work of art is in people's perception of them, the old copycat would say.
    The Inspector would bristle behind his martial mustache.</p><p>
    
    Yet no amount of reverb-drenched vocals, acid-flashback harmonies or Hammond organs can prevent The Bees
    from being a bunch of blokes from the Isle of Wight who happen to have better record collections than
    songwriting abilities.  Listen: The White Stripes didn't become famous because they sounded like Led
    Zeppelin; they became famous because they wrote great songs.  The Bees move from what amounts to The
    Creation and Skip Bifferty covers to the Rufus Thomas impression that is ""Chicken Payback"" without ever
    developing a personality.  There's something offensive about a band that cops the pose of unadorned 60s
    garage-rock and calls that an album.  I expect affected earnestness from MTV emo bands, not the group that
    recorded ""Binnal Bay"".</p><p>
    
    ""It's fake authenticity,"" the Inspector would declare.  ""It's like all the architects imitating Greek
    friezes and columns in <em>The Fountainhead</em>, while Howard Roark went out and made true heroic buildings
    that actually belonged to his time.  This one's a pretty love song, though... The Temptations meet The
    Penguins.""</p><p>
    
    ""It's called 'I Love You',"" Otterloo would reply, stooping over his antediluvian record player.  ""Here,
    let me play you the single, 'Wash in the Rain'.""</p><p>
    
    ""They're so busy citing appropriately hip reference points that they don't have time to come up with
    memorable lyrics or melodies,"" the Inspector would retort, oblivious to the awkward unreality of the
    middle-aged European detective as rock-music scholar. ""'Try and I fail, and sometimes I even succeed'?
    Is this what passes for cleverness nowadays?  Then again, at least they're not Ocean Colour Scene.""</p><p>
    
    There would be no struggle as the Inspector gently applied the handcuffs to his old nemesis.  The strains
    of what sounded like the opening bars of ""Ticket to Ride"" would still be jangling from the battered old
    record player as the album spun to its last track.</p><p>
    
    ""Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery,"" I would tell Editor-in-Chief Ryan Schreiber via e-mail, and
    he would fire back some terse reply that sewed up the whole ridiculous conceit.</p></div>"|1124.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1124-free-the-bees/|4.9|Marc Hogan

Razorlight are Britain's latest
    response to garage-rock's attempted world takeover (The Libertines were the first), and they hope to win
    your love by borrowing tricks from some of your favorite artists-- including The Strokes, Television, Lou
    Reed, and even Bruce Springsteen.</p><p>
    
    Certainly, the burden of the past is always a bitch, but saying that
    Razorlight wear their influences on their sleeves is perhaps giving them too much credit.  The band simply
    doesn't possess the energy or conviction to qualify their songs as mimicries, let alone exculpate their
    sinful lack of identity-- the notion of developing a ""Razorlight sound"" may not have even crossed their
    minds yet, and might possibly never.  At nearly every turn of their flaccid debut, <i>Up All Night</i>,
    Razorlight squander the ideas they've snatched up from other, more talented acts, then somehow find even
    <i>more</i> ways to ruin already perfectly uninteresting songs.</p><p>
    
    The tacked-on piano prelude to ""Leave Me Alone"" gives way to the song's main riff, a thick guitar grind
    that's doubled on bass and chipped away by the hi-hat 16ths of now ex-drummer Christian Smith-Pancorvo.
    The energy level is passable, but falls a few notches with every ""Marquee Moon"" breakdown the band invokes,
    until the song ends with barely a whimper.  ""Which Way Is Out"" further encourages Television comparisons--
    the tenor of the verse's guitar catcalls are so similar to, again, ""Marquee Moon"" that one has to wonder
    if it's the only Television song Razorlight has ever heard.  The song nosedives when its wonderwall of
    plastic distortion kicks in at the chorus.</p><p>
    
    Maybe it's another ""if you can't beat' em, steal their schtick"" sort of schtick, but Razorlight really hit
    up The Strokes for ideas on a number of tracks.  Even their song titles are curiously Strokes-like (""Leave
    Me Alone"", ""Which Way Is Out"", ""Get It and Go"", ""Up All Night"").  The opening guitar twitches on ""Stumble
    and Fall"" came right off <i>Room on Fire</i>'s ""Automatic Stop"", while ""Rip It Up"" would be an expert
    <i>Is This It</i> forgery were the lyrics not so asinine: ""Hey Girl! Get on the dance floor! Rip it up!
    That's what it's there for!""</p><p>
    
    Ultimately, though, it's Razorlight frontman Johnny Borrell who decimates <i>Up All Night</i>.  The poor
    guy's all over the place, admirably (but stupidly) attempting to match a song's stolen vibe by impersonating
    the affectations of its respective frontman.  He's virtually never believable: The Casablancan ""and uhh's""
    and ""ah well uh's"" on ""Rock 'n' Roll Lies"" sound particularly empty.  When he's not desperately trying to
    emote (""Vice"") or to intimidate (""Get It and Go""), Borrell seems most natural on the kiddie-punk breakdown
    of ""Dalston"" and the ""Maneater"" tribute ""Golden Touch"".  Neither song is particularly great, but Borrell's
    delivery on each is at least partially convincing.  Of course, even at their best, Razorlight refuse to

    by death.  In addition to Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination at the Lorraine Motel, Elvis croaked at
    Graceland; Al Jackson Jr. was murdered in his home; Otis Redding died in a plane crash; David Prater died
    in a car crash; Stax went under and was torn down; Chris Bell drove into a telephone pole off Poplar Avenue;
    Jeff Buckley drowned in the Wolf River.  Ineluctable tragedy has seeped into Memphis' mythology and mindset,
    as pervasive as muddled civic government, and it bubbles out through the city's music.</p><p>
    
    Not many Memphis musicians understand this municipal obsession with mortality as well as Greg Cartwright,
    who fronted the 90s noise-rock trio The Oblivians until the group disbanded in 1997.  Afterwards, he formed
    the Reigning Sound with three other local musicians, releasing <i>Break Up Break Down</i> and <i>Time Bomb
    High School</i>, two full-to-bursting albums of jarring garage-rock that transcended the genre through its
    impossibly deep knowledge of local and national pop and soul.  On their new album, <i>Too Much Guitar</i>,
    the Reigning Sound make it clear that they would be playing the same songs with or without that genre's
    recent revival.</p><p>
    
    Not that the garage-rock trend has been especially good to the band.  After <i>Time Bomb High School</i>,
    the Reigning Sound were on the verge of breaking up, held together by the power of a dozen or so new songs
    and the promise of studio time.  Guitarist/keyboard player Alex Greene left in 2003, which left Cartwright,
    bassist Jeremy Scott, and drummer Greg Roberson, the latter two forming a tight-as-ever rhythm section
    reminiscent of their Stax forebears.  Splitting time between Memphis and North Carolina and recording
    several tracks in Cartwright's now-closed Legba Records store, they brought in a few local musicians--
    including Alicja Trout and Jay Rensley of Lost Sounds-- to create an album full of stomping backbeats,
    scorching guitars and soulful melodies.</p><p>
    
    On the opener, ""We Repel Each Other"", the band promise to live up (or down) to the album's cheekily
    self-critical title: Cartwright's voice is buried beneath piles of guitar noise, as if he's singing from
    six feet under.  It's an odd tactic: Cartwright is blessed with an amazing voice for the music he plays,
    able to convey defeat and defiance, hangdog sadness and poisoned disdain, all in the same breath.  At
    points on <i>Too Much Guitar</i>, he's barely audible-- although you hear more of him with each listen.
    However, the album's messy production exponentially increases its raw spontaneity and desperate urgency.</p><p>
    
    Not surprisingly, death informs much of the record, which directly equates love and loss.  Songs like ""If
    You Can't Give Me Everything"" and ""I'll Cry"" lament the end of a relationship as if performing an exorcism.
    Even when a song celebrates romance-- such as the cover of Sam &amp; Dave's ""You Got Me Hummin'""-- fear always
    countervails happiness and contentment, making these songs seem restless and gloomily resigned to love's
    futility.  Or, as Cartwright sings on ""Funny Thing"", ""Love is a funny thing/ You don't know it's real 'til
    it's caused you pain.""</p><p>
    
    Sometimes death is very literal, as on ""Drowning"", which begins ominously: ""I went walking the other day/
    Under the bridge to Arkansas.""  He promises to tell us what he saw, but only mentions that the sparkle in
    her eyes died.  On one of the album's standouts, ""Let Yourself Go"", Cartwright sings, ""Keep your feelings
    inside/ All your thoughts of suicide/ Oh, let yourself go.""  He's not promoting death, but exhorting listeners
    to ""live your life like the end is near.""  Cartwright seems to be heeding that advice: Despite being so
    recently in the throes of their own demise, the Reigning Sound sound lively and vital as ever.</p></div>"|6922.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6922-too-much-guitar/|8.3|Stephen M. Deusner

    Jewelled Antler collective, and I'm sorry to say I haven't always been up to the task.  The loose-knit
    collective of sonic improvisers maintains such an active schedule of shape-shifting and bandname-changing
    that it's virtually impossible for the casual observer to tail their every move.</p><p>
    
    Two of the few Jewelled Antler constants, however, are members Loren Chasse and Glenn Donaldson.  Indeed,
    one or both of them is involved with virtually every Antler act you may have stumbled across, be it Thuja,
    Skygreen Leopards, Dead Raven Choir, Hala Strana, The Child Readers, Glassine, Ivytree, Birdtree, The
    Franciscan Hobbies, Tomes, Coelacanth, Silvery Branches, or any number of other projects.  When the two
    walk the earth as a duo, however, they call themselves The Blithe Sons, and the numinous, abstract folk
    field recordings they create are quite worth the stumble.</p><p>
<i>Arm of the Starfish</i> is The Blithe Sons' second album on Family Vineyard, although like many Jewelled
    Antler projects, they do have a hard-to-trace back catalog of CD-Rs, lathe-cut EPs and, one presumes,
    countless songs etched directly onto the bark of birch trees.  As you might guess from songs like ""Sun
    Anemone"" or ""Foam"", this record finds the Sons wandering seaside, recording outdoors as they go.  (You
    know you're listening to a Jewelled Antler act when you see that album title and you at least briefly
    consider the possibility that the musicians just might be plucking the amplified arms of a starfish.  I
    can't say for certain that they aren't.)  But the coastal setting is crucial to note because, as has
    previously been the case with many Antler records, what is being played is less important than where it's
    being played.</p><p>
    
    The Blithe Sons are hardly the first artists to look to the seas for creative illumination, but most
    sand-and-surf-inspired music has tended to focus on the activities of humans: sailing, surfing, bikini-watching,
    pirating, etc.  The Sons instead focus on the natural world, and seem to intend for their music to become
    just another feature of the coastal landscape with the waves and the wind blending in as essential accompaniment.
    Though that may sound like the dippiest of new age propositions on paper, the two play together with such
    imagination and intuitive ease that the results are rarely less than captivating.</p><p>
    
    It isn't always easy to say exactly what instruments the Sons actually are using: The opening track,
    ""Sparkling Diatoms"", begins with jingling percussion and loosely stretched waves of drone, perhaps created
    by harmonium and/or wood flutes.  On other cuts, more identifiable threads of acoustic guitar, dulcimer,
    banjo and Donaldson's mysterious vocal utterings bubble to the surface, and then slide back under the gently
    crashing surf.  The album culminates with the 17-minute ""Sea-Glass"", an ever-shifting epic of quiet delicacy
    that should have even the most landlocked listener washing the salt out of his hair.</p><p>
    
    If you've been bewildered or put off by the unwieldy Jewelled Antler discography in the past, <i>The Arms
    of the Starfish</i> is an excellent place to make your approach.  It contains all of the elements of
    off-handed beauty and shared discovery that exemplify the best of the collective's work.  And if you're
    a Jewelled Antler completist, here's another prize for your already-groaning shelves.  And my hat is off
    to you.</p></div>"|802.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/802-arm-of-the-starfish/|7.8|Matthew Murphy

    a ""wet"" room, before a cooing female voice sings a few bars and a field recording bridge serves as a ramp
    up to a grand second half.  Suddenly, a rapid double-time Casio beat and sampled bottom of double bass
    folds in, eventually carrying with it a joyous melody swinging on a synthesized trumpet.  It's like a
    toned-down version of Max Tundra's ""Cakes"", and it's one of those moments where you forget completely who
    you're listening to, or how the music is being made.  You just feel happy at this thing that sounds so good
    in such a fresh way.</p><p>
    So it goes through much of <i>Meguro</i>, the first album from this 21-year old kid from Tokyo.  Traditional
    instruments mingle easily with electronics, and the usual boundaries associated with these tools breaks down.
    Wada is a student of jazz guitar and classical piano, which might explain why his eclectic blend of sounds
    and approaches is seamless.  Four Tet and the first Manitoba album are reference points, but Meguro's music
    is more placid than either while remaining unpredictable.  These songs don't seem hemmed in by genre; they
    go where they need to go.</p><p>
    That said, the overall tone of <i>Meguro</i> is certainly pastoral, and roughly half the record could be
    accurately termed ambient.  ""3am Cityscape"" is the title of the first track, and it's a telling opening
    image.  As the track drifts along in the bubbly post-Gas haze, it's not hard to imagine the kind of slow
    pan across a skyline Sofia Coppola so loved in <i>Lost in Translation</i>.  Whenever synths are present,
    they're fluffed up like pillows, all soft edges and thick texture, so even on ""Modern Architecture"" when
    an uptempo, bass-heavy beat enters halfway through, that the chords still suggest contemplation and stillness.
    ""6pm Cityscape"" leaves no doubt as to when Wada comes alive; its warm, dubby techno seems much more beginning
    than end.</p><p>
    When he tones down the blissout, Wada fuses genres and incorporates pop melodies.  ""Space and Shadow"" uses
    conga drums to impart a Latin feel, though when the full beat comes in, it proves too hectic to be danceable.
    The title track resembles Nobukazu Takemura during his Child's View phase, with descending piano chords,
    kiddie drums, and a clarinet calling the tune.  Unfortunately, the most obvious weakness of <i>Meguro</i>
    is something else Wada shares with Takemura: He has a knack for letting his tracks go too long, repeating
    ideas after he's already made his point.  There's not quite enough here to warrant the record's 72-minute
    runtime.  Still, Wada is young and editing is a learned skill.  On the evidence here, we should remain
    attentive to wherever he goes next.</p></div>"|8779.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8779-meguro/|7.1|Mark Richardson

It's the mid-90s, and the major labels (there
    were six back then!) are marching their A&amp;R; armies through the suburbs of America, scooping up every band with
    a couple of guitars and a serviceable melody in search of the next ""alternative"" sensation, thereby ensuring
    well-stocked cutout bins for decades to come.  Epic plucks the Velvet Crush from their Providence basement,
    and they go on to record their finest album, <i>Teenage Symphonies to God</i>, for the label in 1994,
    releasing it on Creation in the UK.  Epic brought the Crush their best chance at a real hit, but it was
    a match that couldn't last, and they were dropped as the alternative boom collapsed and gave way to the
    recorded frustrations of ambiguously irked rap-metal meatheads.</p><p>
    Crush principals Paul Chastain and Ric Menck regrouped in 1998 to revive the band, but fell flat with <i>Heavy
    Changes</i>, an album that unsuccessfully attempted to deny their pop prowess and cast the band as ballsy
    rock 'n' rollers.  They seemed to realize their misstep, though, as 1999's <i>Free Expression</i> was an
    expertly crafted, refined tribute to the guitar pop of the 60s and 70s, and last year's <i>Soft Sounds</i>
    continued that arc by presenting the duo as older, wiser balladeers.  So I guess that basically makes
    <i>Stereo Blues</i> a midlife crisis record, a reactionary oh-my-god-we-don't-rock-anymore retreat to their
    basement days to rummage for the spark and fire they once possessed.  It's not a flop on the level of <i>Heavy
    Changes</i>, but it's still a fool's gambit, as their last two records have proven their facility for crisp
    pop sophistication, and this one merely proves that they went in the right direction when they gave up
    rough-edged rock abandon.</p><p>
    One of the album's principle plagues is the near total lack of low-end-- all that unsupported treble gets
    tiresome after a while.  There's a bass hiding in there, peeking out from behind the overdriven rhythm
    guitars and ponderously formless solos like a shy mammal trying not to be seen.  This is most egregiously
    apparent on ""The Connection"", a plodding 7-minute dinosaur whose melody I can't remember and whose strangely
    polite freakout coda ought to come with a bottle of Motrin.  These ponderous guitar noodlings turn up all
    over the place, ruining ""Son of Ray"" (is that a reference to ""Sister Ray""?), and intruding on several
    otherwise strong tracks.  It mystifies me why people as obviously talented as Menck and Chastain would
    insist on being so tuneless in the name of ""rocking.""  Gentlemen, please, if shitting on a fretboard is
    your idea of rock music, kindly return to stately balladeering and reminding me why I liked Big Star.</p><p>
    Dammit, though, it's really not all bad.  These guys can't help writing a fantastic melody, and they do it
    quite a few times here, kicking out a picture-perfect anthem for 1993 in ""Fall Awake"", its sweet,
    double-tracked vocals overcoming bombastic drums and a chorus guitar riff that interjects in a manner far
    too reminiscent of the little doodles in Creed's ""Higher"" for comfort.  ""I Want You Now"" rocks for real,
    building on a concise, <i>Incesticide</i>-worthy riff and a choppy verse melody for just under two minutes
    of spiky pop bliss that wisely crunches to a halt before any ass-ugly guitar solo can kill the momentum.
    ""California Incline"" isn't so lucky, but it's still pretty marvelous, retreating from an opening squeal of
    feedback into an easy groove full of loose strumming and clean, harmonious guitar-- it builds to a spot-on
    chorus, too, before taking off into one of the album's more passable jams.</p><p>
    Even the good stuff can't wash away the dross, though, and there's too much of it here to make this album
    recommendable to anyone but a Menck/Chastain completist (they do exist).  <i>Free Expression</i>, a record
    that plays to all of their strengths, was just reissued last year, and in lieu of the out-of-print <i>Teenage
    Symphonies</i>, that's the one to get.  It seems likely that this is just a passing phase for the band, but
    here's hoping they turn it down for the next and just return to what they do best.</p></div>"|8512.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8512-stereo-blues/|6.4|Joe Tangari

Remember <em>Jackass: The Movie</em>?  You and a couple of buddies
    snuck in with a six-pack of Miller High Life after passing around a bong named Captain Jack, and for 87
    blessed minutes, you almost believed bungee-cord wedgies and unabashed homoeroticism were the pinnacle
    of comedic history. But the next morning, in the cold glare of a Chicago November, you weren't exactly
    pining for a sequel.</p><p>
    
    Actually, maybe that wasn't you. Anyway, the comparison is unfair, because The Hidden Cameras, led by
    sugarcoated pervert Joel Gibb, are infinitely more amusing than anything Steve-O could jam up his rectum.
    <em>The Smell of Our Own</em>, the band's Rough Trade debut, was a subversively catchy accomplishment, full
    of lavish pop and explicit homosexuality.  Their latest, <em>Mississauga Goddamn</em>, is a fading echo of
    the original, and while that's way better than a new Johnny Knoxville vehicle, it still feels like the
    season <em>South Park</em> stopped surprising and all your friends switched back to <em>Simpsons</em> reruns
    on Wednesday nights.</p><p>
    
    Named for a dam in Gibb's suburban Ontario hometown, the new record confirms the young maestro's knack for
    bright AM pop melodies.  Saccharine love songs like ""We Oh We"" or ""Builds the Bone"" could almost be mistaken
    for that Bread single you once got on a mixtape from a high school crush.  Fortunately, Gibb still can
    barely let a song go by without a graphic description of gay lovin', giving even the schmaltziest moments
    a gleeful dissonance.  Like this line from ""That's When the Ceremony Starts"": ""I drank from the wine that
    came from inside/ The heart of his meat and the splurge of his sweet.""</p><p>
    
    Lingering beneath the album's sunny exterior is Gibb's unease over his Mississauga upbringing.  When doubling
    as sexual innuendoes, these images subtly rebuke pious bread-breakers who would condemn his lifestyle.  Equally
    clever is Gibb's tack of cloaking explicit lyrics in perky arrangements to which those same churches might
    take very kindly.  The depth of his resentment finally leaches out through the lyrics of the title track,
    a languid shuffle drenched in <em>Pet Sounds</em> strings and harmonies.  ""I'm wearing my disguise/ Until I
    rid my life of Mississauga Goddam,"" Gibb admits.</p><p>
    
    At their best, Gibb and his ever-expanding cast of accompanists stitch together a disguise as beautiful as
    a Technicolor dreamcoat.  But despite the strength of ""Music Is My Boyfriend"" and lush single ""The Fear Is
    On"", I continually find myself humming songs from the debut instead.  ""Ban Marriage"" was truly brilliant:
    a hook-filled pop ditty about the silliness of marriage, at a time when the issue of marriage was particularly
    close to the hearts of many.  And ""Golden Streams""-- well, it remains the loveliest tune ever recorded about
    peeing on one's partner.  In their stead, Gibb drops repetitive stinkers like ""B Boy"" or ""I Want Another
    Enema"".  I'll get back to you on the <em>Jackass</em> sequel, but according to IMDB, it went straight to
    video.</p></div>"|3854.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3854-mississauga-goddam/|5.8|Marc Hogan

    a bumbling, typically incoherent Ol' Dirty Bastard invites the listener to follow him and the gang ""back to
    '79.""  Inspectah Deck then spits one of the group's most memorable verses (""I bomb atomically...""), inaugurating
    a nearly 6-minute string of relentless wordplay featuring nearly every Wu member in top form.  While the Wu
    solo records of the last seven years have occasionally been retrograde, none of it has been expressly retro
    in sound or spirit.  In fact, since 1997, the group has mired in stasis, presiding over an uneven spate of
    generally lackluster solo albums and a pair of underwhelming group efforts; ODB's call has been taken in
    vain.</p><p>
    There were periodic beacons of hope, but nothing that ever materialized into broader success for the group.
    GZA's excellent 2002 release, <i>Legend of the Liquid Sword</i>, eulogized its roots in both NYC and the
    Far East with sly mainstream appeal and poignant autobiographical lyrics, reverently pushing the envelope
    forward like no Clansman since Raekwon on <i>Only Built 4 Cuban Linx</i>.  But other members' stabs at
    innovation have either been too far-flung for mainstream ears or too uneven to make a lasting impression.
    Ghostface's caustic, free-flown verses have been reliably ferocious, but even his 2000 classic <i>Supreme
    Clientele</i> was too blowhard to fit in alongside fellow members' more group-minded efforts.  Method Man
    has declined, RZA has branched out in non-hip-hop endeavors, and Ol' Dirty has simply embarrassed.</p><p>
    None of this has boded well for the marginal ninth member of the Clan, Masta Killa, whose presence in the
    group has been enigmatic at best.  Adding to the inauspiciousness is the fact that <i>No Said Date</i>, his
    inaugural solo endeavor, marks something of a milestone for Wu Tang: Masta is the last Clan member to count
    a solo album to his credit.  From his diminutive (though deceptively strong) performances on group issues
    such as 2001's <i>Iron Flag</i>, there was little basis from which to expect anything, one way or the other,
    from Masta-- which is why his stealing the spotlight with the most fully formed Wu solo effort this year
    comes as such a surprise.</p><p>
<i>No Said Date</i> is by no means an entirely new outing; many of its tracks have been cocooned for several
    years, patiently ripening in the <i>36 Chambers</i>' dankest crevasses, and <i>No Said Date</i>'s opportune
    release-- in the smack-dab middle of a disconcertingly weak year for Wu-- makes its anachronous vibe all the
    more vital.  That these songs sound pungently old fashioned is no mistake: RZA's production is markedly
    pared-down from more mainstream-minded Wu solo material, and Masta's verses benefit from this unpretentiousness.</p><p>
    The record succeeds on modesty, not reticence; Masta is a rapper's rapper, forsaking high-flown gimmicks for
    Spartan flows and carefully considered rhymes. His accent isn't as instantly identifiable as RZA's or Method
    Man's, but Masta's bulwark is rote verbal skill, the kind often shunned for higher targets like aesthetic
    appeal, production novelty, and uncouth humor.  <i>No Said Date</i> packs those elements as well, but in a
    subtle, refined manner that never upstages the album's focal point: its lyrics.</p><p>
    While devotees may hear this as a back-to-basics approach for Wu Tang (Masta himself has even vowed to
    ""[bring] back that original Wu-Tang sound""), <i>No Said Date</i> owns its share of decisively forward-looking
    tracks: ""Digi-Warfare"", with its housey electronics and lusty vocal intonations, could be mistaken for a
    Basement Jaxx remix, while ""The Future"" literally teleports decades yonder, handing the mic over to a trio
    of pre-teen MCs, whose breathless verses rival Ghostface among Clan members in their horrific violence.
    (Its instrumental track is also one of <i>No Said Date</i>'s tightest, though several songs vie for that
    title.)</p><p>
    That ""The Future"" is considered a skit in the liner notes is a testament to the record's depth.
    Masta wisely eschews tedious humor sketches, typically taking a more serious bent.  But unlike his
    contemporaries who make up the so-called conscientious school (Talib and Dilated Peoples are guilty), his
    gravity is never dogmatic.  The title track derives most of its weightiness from a determined beat that
    samples strings from OutKast's ""Skrew It On the Bar-B"", while ""School"" features fluid, appropriately
    self-conscious lyrics (""Banging on the lunchroom table, I used to speculate/ And watch some of the MC
    greats throw verses back and forth/ I didn't have the heart to step forth"") over a particularly austere
    beat.</p><p>
    Though explicitly old-school in approach, Wu-Tang could never have sounded this tight and direct 11 years
    ago on <i>36 Chambers</i>; the technological just wasn't there.  But Masta Killa has delivered one the
    most urgent, straightforward Wu releases since the group's debut over a decade ago.  Maybe it's just
    refreshing to hear a Clansman whose head hasn't grown swollen yet, but the man at the top of the Wu food
    chain in 2004 happens to be the group's quietest.  Hopefully, Masta's fellow members will take his queue.</p></div>"|5605.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5605-no-said-date/|8.3|Sam Ubl

    that builds upon their legacy by appending their own specific sensibility to it. It's prudent to note that
    these echoes are not usually the result of blatant imitation; rather, they're born from a genuine love and
    admiration for a work that inflamed the imaginations of so many people.</p><p>
    
    All art is some permutation of, or comment upon, the art its creator has internalized; what's crucial is
    that something is added to the mix. Without the Pixies' ascendancy, we wouldn't have the Nirvana we know.
    The same goes for Mclusky, who impressed their own distinct thumbprint and range of other influences on the
    Pixies' style.  And we probably wouldn't have Pidgeon's excellent marriage of boy/girl singing, shredded
    screaming, indie-pop, and blistering thrashcore-- the mansion they've built upon the foundation the Pixies
    laid by assimilating their <em>own</em> influences into a unique style.</p><p>
    
    San Francisco's Pidgeon concoct the unruly, melodic cacophony of their debut, <em>From Gutter w/Love</em>,
    with three vocalists (a female singer, a male screamer/singer, and a male screamer), three guitars, bass
    and drums.  The opening song on their debut, ""The Second One"", proves the accuracy of their self-proclaimed
    Cardigans/Motorhead/Pixies triangulation with its simmering drums and deep, piston-like bass, crisp shifts
    in volume and intensity, growling guitars that feint and leap, and a breathy, contagious vocal melody
    sporadically shattered by black metal shrieks-- indie pop injected with dangerous, illegal drugs and
    mutating uncontrollably.</p><p>
    
    ""Strelnikov"" weaves singer Valerie Iwamasa's dulcet upper-register through a
    flurry of spacious, contrapuntal guitar arpeggios and dense segments of puissant thrash.  The staid
    ""Powerful"" begins with an ominous, cyclical guitar figure and spare reverb before expanding into a tangle
    of chugging, staccato Kim Dealisms, followed by the propulsive, <em>Surfer Rosa</em>-ish anthem ""Down"".  The
    triple-negative pep-pill ""Ain't Nothing Can't"" and the woozy string bends of ""Fallout"" are akin to The
    Wrens' haywire, seasick pop techniques, and the bastard ska of ""Sty"" is riddled with prolix, rapid-fire
    ranting that complements the euphonious pop vocals that it jostles against elsewhere on the record. </p><p>
    
    Truly new ideas are rare.  New combinations of old ones are a more realistic benchmark of quality.  When
    one band sounds just like another band, it's natural for us to balk.  But when a band sounds like a hybrid
    of several bands, filtered through their own specific lens, it seems fair to say they only sound like
    themselves.  If Pidgeon sticks around long enough to build a body of work and cement themselves in enough
    minds to be reference-worthy, some years down the road, I may find myself referring to them to describe a
    new band that has imbibed their aesthetic.  It's not just pop that will eat itself; art, in general, is a
    cannibal.  Dig in. </p></div>"|11807.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11807-from-gutter-wlove/|8.0|Brian Howe

    guitarist Jimmy Lavalle's incarnation as The Album Leaf, and other members' involvement in The Locust,
    they've shared bills with the varied likes of !!!, Mouse on Mars, and GBV.  <i>Spine and Sensory</i> was
    their debut LP, originally recorded in 1999, but out of print for several years.  It's been re-released with
    a badly needed new mastering job and three bonus tracks.  The timing might seem a little odd (has the range
    of nostalgia already been conflated to the five year mark?), but the folks at Better Looking must have
    figured that it'll ride the current wave of uplifting post-rock a la Mogwai and Explosions in the Sky, as
    well as guitarist Lavalle's growing success as The Album Leaf, to find a greater audience.</p><p>
    
    Thanks to several years of nonstop touring, Tristeza enjoyed a fair amount of attention relatively soon
    after their formation in 1997.  But they've had their detractors; their sophomore release, <i>Dream Signals
    in Full Circles</i>, was slammed by some-- including Pitchfork-- for being too ""new age.""  Tristeza's
    attempt to inject their scene with some positive frequencies has been as happy to me as it is distasteful
    to those who need their beauty twisted, and given the more recent directions of instrumental rock, such a
    sound might land on friendlier ears these days.</p><p>
<i>Spine and Sensory</i>, however, only hints at the deeper listening to come from Tristeza.  The first two
    tracks are fairly standard pieces of instrumental rock, beginning with interweaving counterpoint guitar
    lines and some synth, adding interest to the texture.  ""RMS 2000"" is where the sonic exploration begins,
    as delayed percussion, feedback drones, and reverbed organs announce themselves in the mix.  After some
    more mid-tempo builds, ""Memphis Emphasis"" quickens the pace with a tight staccato pulse.  The album sags
    a little in its third quarter, but the beautiful piano/synth flute piece ""Cinematography"" provides a textural
    surprise toward the end of the album, and foretells the gentle, sweeping nature of their forthcoming work.</p><p>
    
    Criticisms of ""too repetitive"" have plagued Lavalle's music through its incarnations.  Though the songs of
    <i>Spine</i> are constantly shifting and building, the intentional lack of memorable melody can forcefully
    relegate them to the background of one's attention.  Still, Tristeza should be approached on their own
    terms; their music is about movement, not of the dancing kind, but the spiraling, racing and blooming that
    instrumental rock can evoke.  Without any member rising to the forefront, Tristeza are able to work as a
    true ensemble, creating thick textural structures that gesture toward the expansiveness of ambient music
    while retaining more standard forms.</p><p>
<i>Spine and Sensory</i> was and remains a sincere effort to inject the decidedly emotionless lines of
    math-rock with some color, without resorting to the aggressive crescendos of their counterparts.  It's not
    uniformly gripping, but contains enough moments of beauty and interest to be worthwhile.  The tracks of
    <i>Spine and Sensory</i> explore a variety of rhythmic and timbrel contrasts, each managing to set itself
    apart in a genre that is often plagued by formulaic, indistinguishable pieces.  The new age stigma is thrown
    around quite readily if a band employs atmospherics toward any means other than the melancholy or foreboding,
    and Tristeza, despite their name's translation, are decidedly uplifting.  But even if the idea of warm pads
    and chimes still gives you chills, this record strikes a balance not found in their later work that should
    appeal to all.</p></div>"|8166.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8166-spine-and-sensory/|7.4|Liam Singer

    jagged polyphonic hubbub of their native New York.  By folding blunted hip-hop bounce into the boiling
    rhythms of drum 'n' bass, they've cranked up a wicked urban aesthetic that moonwalks the line between
    slick b-boy breaks and dark club kid tech.  2002's <i>Subway Series</i> was a peak achievement, and its
    dubby spaciousness and jazzy rush drew major label acts to the duo's fine-tuned production skills.  Two
    years later, Ming + FS return with a stylistic balancing act that just doesn't cut as deep.</p><p>
    
    It's a tough position to be in: Clearly, the band's sound is relevant (at least to the Madison Avenue
    tastemakers at Nissan and Victoria's Secret), but can it appeal to both underground beat hounds and Must
    See TV trendoids?  Ming + FS seem at a loss for an answer this time around-- <i>Back to One</i> settles for
    an ambiguous middle ground.  Given their tendency towards kitchen sink hybridization, it was only a matter
    of time before they either broke through with a truly definitive work or slumped into a tepid rekindling of
    their earlier fire.</p><p>
    
    Which isn't to say <i>Back to One</i> is all tired rehash.  Even when they reach back into the hip-hop
    lexicon, as with the witty, all-too-brief beatboxed breakbeat of ""Draw"", the duo exude a fresh playfulness.
    And when they slow to a sticky, bubbly thump on ""50FT Mole Man"", they build a warm, voluptuous ambiance,
    but unfortunately can't maintain it.  Repeat appearances by MC Napoleon Solo add a modicum of character;
    his gruff, uncomplicated rhymes are functional and his voice malleable enough to bend to Ming + FS's
    shifting beatscapes.</p><p>
    
    It's telling that they rely on his vocals on half the tracks-- I've always been more
    partial to the group's instrumentals, but the boom-bip of the smoldering ""Starts Somewhere"" and organ-led
    break of ""Skills and Grace"", despite some innovative samples, is built to be rapped over.  The pinnacle of
    this more supportive production technique is ""2092"", a supremely funky, De La Soulful track that eschews
    the drum 'n' bass for a scratch-laden summer joint that doubles as the album's highlight.</p><p>
    
    But Ming + FS's predictable foray into electro-fried breaks comes as a disappointment.  Opener ""Fish Eyes""
    waxes reverb over a bone-crunching, vaguely exotic beat, while the freakish adolescent vocals on ""Big Little
    Jeffrey"" are plain unsettling.  Closer ""Nadia"" digs into stuttering IDM territory in the midst of what could
    be a shimmering, silky groove; a more cohesive finale would've strengthened the album's overall impact.</p><p>
    
    In the midst of an economic slump, getting paid hardly invites the blow to an artist's integrity it once
    did.  It's hard to blame Ming + FS for digging into what are probably high-paying commercial jobs over the
    monkish dedication and forward-thinking creativity necessary to produce work as enthralling as their previous
    albums.  Sadly for their fans, every time they do so, the music is bound to suffer.</p></div>"|5305.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5305-back-to-one/|6.8|Jonathan Zwickel

Apparently,
    I had asked him for the new Panda Bear LP instead, as he had no idea what I was talking about.</p><p>
    
    ""No, I ain't got it.  You want 213 instead?""</p><p>
    
    ""Prince Po?"" I pressed.  ""From Organized Konfusion.""</p><p>
    
    ""You mean Prince Paul?""</p><p>
    
    ""No, dude.""</p><p>
    
    ""No dice, then.  You want Nina Sky?""</p><p>
    
    And the Prince Po international parade of anonymity marches on.  Organized Konfusion was more slept on than
    Trina, and while Pharoahe Monch went on to get the fuck up, Simon said Prince Poetry would have to wait in
    the basement while the other children played in the yard.   But seven years on from <i>The Equinox</i>,
    Po's bouncing ball of justice may have arrived in the form of his Lex Records debut.  From Po's opening
    volley (""Grind like the Clipse, flow like The Beatles"") to his closing pathos, this ""freshman"" release is
    the white pair of gloves for Po to usher in a promising era of <i>The Slickness</i>.</p><p>
    
    While Anticon beatmaker Jel's tag on the opening track might hint at Anticon-esque abstruse nonsense, ""Hello""
    is an accessible pacecar for Po's solo debut.  Legato strings tease the listener for a half-minute before Po
    steps up and recites the Virgin Megastore's $9.99 rock section: ""My ghetto <i>Synchronicity</i> officially
    eludes The Police/ They bes terrified of my mystery/ Got 'em walking on the moon/ When they Hootie blowing
    'fficially parties/ It's like The Clash when they mention me.""</p><p>
    
    Aside from illuminating his knowledge of a canon outside the hip-hop sphere, Po's deft wordplay demonstrates
    his growth since Organized Konfusion's <i>Stress</i>.  Like Monche, Po abandoned the sing-songy early 90s
    flow for a semi-rhythmic machine gun style, allowing him more longitude.  On the emotional ""Be Easy"", Po
    spits soul-baring honesty: ""Major cutbacks, blacks go first.../ So many crooked cops pull cards and they
    hate spades.""</p><p>
    
    More importantly, Po never loses touch with hip-hop's carnal side.  On the ""Across 110th Street"" mock-up
    ""Love Thang"" rocks a soul-stuffed sample that probably got my mom and pops to hit the sack.  Danger Mouse
    makes the bed while Po fluffs the pillows: ""Baby, I'll sop up your biscuits with this gravy straight out
    the pot/ Hot how you want it.""  Meanwhile, UK beat chemist Richard X delivers the hottest track here in the
    form of ""Hold Dat"", a 16-bit skyscraping car chase.  (Sorry DJs, it's only on the CD.)</p><p>
    
    Oddly, the album's title track falters.  The Atlanta Braves woh-oh'ing bores and disrupts the album's
    otherwise flow.  Furthermore, <i>The Slickness</i> does suffer from a slight case of guest bloat.  MF
    Doom simply outshines on ""Social Distortion"" with lines like, ""Wrote this humdinger with a dislocated
    bling finger,"" and, ""Drag 'em backstage like the tiger did Siegfried""; J-Zone, Raekwon, and even Jemini's
    appearances frequently show up the main attraction as well.</p><p>
    
    Still, <i>The Slickness</i> excels at balance.  Like Doom's <i>Vaudeville Villain</i> and Danger Mouse's
    <i>Grey Album</i>, Po &amp; Co.'s non-denominational approach lets the album dance between straightforward
    beat-knocking and esoteric soul to please the hip-hop head and the indie rockers alike.  Despite a handful
    of occasional blunders, Po helms an excellent release.</p></div>"|6547.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6547-the-slickness/|7.9|Jamin Warren

Temporal     distance hews away their ambiguities until they fall into orderly, narrative rank and file.  In our collective memory of historical     events, some players are canonized, others are diminished, and the process that separates them often seems arbitrary.  With punk rock,     this process of selective forgetting has at least one discernible component-- the most heralded old punk bands are the ones that     mainstream rock critics ordained as the movement's standard-bearers.  Most of us remember The Sex Pistols, The Clash, X, The Germs,     The Ramones, Wire, The Fall, and Black Flag.  But how many remember Crime?  What about The Adverts?  What about The Homosexuals?</p>
<p>Perhaps The Homosexuals, who evolved from a band called The Rejects, were never in the right place at the right time.  But this seems     unlikely, considering that The Rejects were opening The Roxy for The Damned, The Jam and Wire in the late '70s, which is pretty prime     in terms of the punk zeitgeist. Perhaps their name scared away cultural dilettantes slumming for a more mannered radical idiom, but     this is also improbable: The Sex Pistols didn't seem to have much trouble cementing their legacy.  Perhaps The Ramones' tri-chord     sing-alongs were just more memorable than The Homosexuals' adventurous, eclectic song structures (and ""Gabba gabba hey"" does stick in     the brain a bit more than ""Ivory elbows/ Deny shads edge""). Nevertheless, in our current climate of rampant historical salvaging, it     seems likely that every shooting star in the fleeting firestorm that was punk will be plucked from the obscuring swarm and bronzed for     posterity.  The Homosexuals are the latest to come (back) down the pike, clothed in new fire: reissued, remastered, repackaged, and     finally, remembered.</p>
<p>The triple-disc <i>Astral Glamour</i> clocks in at a whopping 81 tracks, and documents every salvageable     mote of music The Homosexuals committed to tape or vinyl from 1977 to 1984, including multiple versions of     many tracks (guitar mixes, vocal mixes, live versions, instrumentals).  Most of the first disc's songs     appeared on the posthumous 1984 <i>Homosexuals LP</i> and <i>The Homosexuals' CD</i> reissue that was     released earlier this year.  So it's the second and third discs that will get exhaustive collectors all     hot and bothered-- they're brimming with tracks restored from decaying LPs and an ultra-rare tape of which     10 known copies exist, plus demos, singles, unreleased tracks and alternate versions unavailable anywhere     else.  Handsomely packaged in a gate-fold case with a 32-page booklet of photos, posters, lyrics, and     commentary, <i>Astral Glamour</i> might be the collection by which the best punk band that no one heard     finally get their due.</p>
<p>The Homosexuals epitomize the British post-punk style of the late '70s (why didn't Rough Trade pick this     up?), combining the brainy word collages and winding guitars of Scritti Politti with the manic energy and     bizarre flourishes of The Pop Group.  Even remastered, <i>Astral Glamour</i> raises shitty production to     an artform, and the tinny guitars one associates with old punk records achieve effects of depth, texture     and distortion that are startling.  But what really distinguishes The Homosexuals from their numerous peers     is the remarkable diversity of their output, which maintains its vigor and cohesive mien while exploring     different methods of construction and tone: ramshackle pop, mangled dub, rock shredding, garage funk,     Afrobeat, and gutter psychedelia.</p>
<p>""My Night Out"" blasts off with chaotic guitars and babbling, affected vocals reminiscent of The Pop Group's     ""We Are All Prostitutes"", before collapsing into a streamlined pop/punk anthem.  The title track evokes     <i>Entertainment!</i>-era Gang of Four, with its melodic bass licks and trash-funk guitars.  ""Hearts in     Exile"" has a squalid grandeur as it moves in and out of the speakers, a ghostly, vanishing version of the     Psychedelic Furs' sweeping paranoia.  ""You're Not Moving the Way You're Supposed To"" reworks New Age     Steppers-style ragga-punk with plinking harmonics and euphoric rock breakdowns.  The twinkling piano and     amorphous atmosphere of ""Nursery Chymes"" predict The Walkmen 25 years before their advent, just as ""In     Search of the Perfect Baby"" seems to auger the disturbed and dilapidated opulence of Frog Eyes.  The     complete songs are strung together with wispy motes of ephemera, such as the fractured dub of ""Symbols     I Love"" or the electric stutter and flux of ""Black Noise"", which rolls into the twangy, laddering funk     of ""Ants on Parade"".  Taken alone, any song on <i>Astral Glamour</i> is engaging.  Taken together, in all     their multiplicity and ambition, they cohere into a monstrous and shambling mutant before which one just     collapses slack-jawed and cowers.</p>
<p>As David Berman put it, ""Punk rock died when the first kid said/ 'Punk's not dead.'""  Maybe so, but as limb     after limb is plucked from the wreckage, it's leaving behind one exquisite corpse.  The three-plus hours of     material ranging over <i>Astral Glamour</i> unites The Homosexuals' fragmentary oeuvre to reveal them as     punk visionaries who were at least as questing, untamed, and ultimately <i>listenable</i> as any of their     more renowned contemporaries.  This is the sound of history revising itself toward perfection.</p></div>"|3975.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3975-astral-glamour-box-set/|8.0|Brian Howe

For my
    parents' generation, it's hard to think of a better one than the Radio Flyer wagon.  These simple red-and-white
    carts with oversized black rubber wheels are as emblematic of suburban childhood in the 40s and 50s as ICBMs
    were to the Cold War, and almost anyone who grew up in the postwar era remembers their ubiquity fondly-- they
    actually outsold Ford station wagons for a number of years.</p><p>
    
    The Radio Flyer of my generation might be the Casio keyboard.  I can remember getting one when I was a kid
    that had maybe three octaves and about 10 or 12 sounds along with classic preset rhythms they called ""rhumba""
    and ""bossa nova.""  My brother and I spent plenty of time parlaying that keyboard into extended sessions of
    annoyance for my parents, and I'll never get over how amazing we thought it was when we were young that you
    could get these little demos playing on it and then speed them up or slow them down at will.  I remember a
    specific instance when the keyboard's batteries were dying, but still had enough juice in them to produce a
    sputtering, vaguely piano-ish sound when you hit the keys.  Just a few months ago, I rediscovered a brief
    recording that I'd made of this phenomenon on a boombox, and it sounds oddly poignant, this wandering
    quasi-melody of wavering and decaying notes.</p><p>
    
    Whatever spoke to me about the sound of that failing machine years ago apparently also captivated Parts &amp;
    Labor's Dan Friel as he worked on <i>Sunburned</i>, his second solo EP and his first to see proper release
    on a label.  He opens the disc with a track called ""Dead Batteries"", a song literally built on a foundation
    of an old Casio struggling to play a rhythm preset with the power provided by nearly expended C batteries.
    The effect is a twitching, crackling foundation for his laser-toned guitar to slice through that perfectly
    sets the tone for this intriguing, challenging disc.</p><p>
    
    Friel has slowly been making a name for himself in Brooklyn not only with Parts &amp; Labor, who last year split
    a full-length with rising avant-garde star Tyondai Braxton (now a member of Battles alongside ex-Don Caballero
    guitarist Ian Williams), but also with his bit parts in ensembles helmed by Damo Suzuki and Glenn Branca.
    In his spare time, he records with an intentionally limited setup, working to coax the best music he can
    from an array of electronics like remote-controlled car joysticks and walkie talkies.  The squealing, dense
    textures he builds from those sounds form the bulk of this record, and he interacts with them with his
    electric guitar, pouring on layer after layer of his distinctly hued drones and distorted overtone series
    until the wall of sounds is complete.</p><p>
    
    The music he ends up with sounds like little else out there, a heaving mass of static beats, monolithic
    distortion, and bending, diving tones.  Most of the modulating squeals that cut through songs like ""Tractorcalls""
    are created by amplifying the signals of the remote controls, which produce a surprisingly wide array of
    pitches as the trigger is manipulated.  Some of the clusters this technique creates are harsh and dissonant,
    while others are strikingly melodic.  Friel creates a manic beat and descending harmony with his keyboard on
    ""b2bs"", making what could be best described as drill 'n' bass with a Motown chord progression.  The beat on
    closer ""Quitting"", created by looping various pitches of static from his guitar pedals, is far less traditional,
    but functions well as a backdrop for his nasty guitar improvisation, which sounds like a doo-wop group made
    of fluorescent lights.</p><p>
    
    The queasy, noisy beat of the song nicely brings the EP full circle to its beginnings, emphasizing the disc's
    overall sense of cohesion and singular purpose.  I hesitate to throw out the word ""experimental"" in most cases,
    but here I think it's warranted, as Friel's music is quite explicitly designed to test the sonic possibilities
    of a set group of objects and explore as much of that ground as is reasonably possible on an EP.  In that,
    he succeeds beautifully, crafting a unique and uncompromising sound that ultimately transcends its limitations.</p></div>"|3319.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3319-sunburn/|7.9|Joe Tangari

    Frusciante and trusty pal Josh Klinghoffer banged out the guitar and drum tracks, coloring them with keys, subtle electronics and
    rudimentary yet powerful studio twiddles (backmasking is the new Pro Tools), then adding vocal tracks streaked with his usual naked
    emotion.</p><p>
<i>Shadows Collide</i>'s alloy of rue and hope is still evident here, both in the arrangements and in
    lyrics like, ""Laughter's an ugly friend of mine/ We shared the best and worst of times,"" which he sings
    over the skeletal Velvets lilt of ""Unchanging"".  Frusciante's solo career will probably always be more
    about self-therapy than gaining a foothold in the marketplace.  But as another impressive portion of his
    potent '04 output, <i>Will to Death</i>'s immediacy and quality should quiet the critics-- particularly
    those who pegged his early solo records as the work of a narcotics pain-train washout.</p><p>
    
    After a satisfactory opener, <i>Death</i> detonates the stuttering synthesized lead riff and splashing cymbals
    of ""An Exercise"".  A stylistic peer to <i>Shadows Collide</i>'s ""Carvel"", the cut comes from Frusciante's
    Pete Yorn place, that piece of his id with a love for beard-rock and pearl-snap buttons.  But soon we're
    into the meat of the album, with the simplistic 60s guitar/drum strum and stereo separation of ""Time Runs
    Out"" and the epic ""Loss"".  Heavily reverbed vocals wash over starkly live-sounding drums and guitar; the
    song surges to a raucous movement of intertwined solos, one warm and one damaged in squelch.  That's a
    dynamic Frusciante seems to have resigned himself to, both in life and music-- he's always on the run from
    the darkness, but still believes in the comforting light ahead.</p><p>
    
    There's a bit of Bill Callahan in that duality-- the longings to be forgiven for sins you were nevertheless
    happy to commit-- and in <i>Will to Death</i>'s instrumentation:  The wind effects and dirge piano of ""Mirror""
    set up lyrics grappling with bad decisions, delivered through a flanging howl of mixing board effects.  The
    broken man ruminations of ""The Days Have Turned"" are made stronger by the closeness of the vocal in our ear,
    the cold wall of hesitation between Frusciante and the quietly hopeful guitar chords.  It could be a suicide
    note read aloud as <i>Californication</i>'s ""Scar Tissue"" plays through a tinny AM in the background.  There
    are no push-up bras here, not even the memory of hedonism: ""I've stabbed life in the back,"" Frusciante sings.
    ""I'm awaiting life as another man"".</p><p>
    
    Still, <i>Will to Death</i>'s purples never blotch out the better days completely.  Perhaps due to the
    album's quick recording schedule, it's guided by a plain-faced grace, best exemplified by the comforting
    Cat Stevens quality of the aforementioned ""Time Runs Out"" and the introspective instrumental ""Helical"",
    on which tiny, watery chords ring and whisper between amp fuzz and guitar pick scratch.  The album closes
    with its title track.  With another understated jangle tickling the left ear, Frusciante reiterates his
    philosophy in melody in the right-- ""The will to death is what keeps me alive""-- and this time the twin
    solos are happier than silent sunlight.</p></div>"|3234.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3234-the-will-to-death/|7.4|Johnny Loftus

Well, neither am I, though in due course, all of us will
    be one day.  The experimental French prog band are one of the last sure-thing revivals from the 70s yet to
    get their due among the general hipster faction.  I don't know why; you'd think people would be looting
    retirement communities just to get their hands on something in a made-up language, sporting guys in black
    with gold medallions and Fender Rhodes pianos.  You know, the whole Sigur Rós fiasco led me to believe odd
    was in, and with Magma you don't even have to sit through 12 minutes of introductory bullshit before getting
    to the next chord.  Well, okay, sometimes you do.</p><p>
    But enough of that, I'll just show my hand and proclaim my enduring fascination and fandom of Magma.  Some
    things transcend my reputation as a relatively normal person, and this is one of them.  I had the screensaver,
    for fuck's sake.  Of course, it's nice to know I'm not alone.  Take British trio Guapo: with <i>Five Suns</i>,
    they appear to have fashioned an entire album in homage to a single Magma song.  Playing lengthy, minimal
    experimental prog featuring buzzsaw bass, insistently busy drums and that old Rhodes, their music is often
    at the mercy of the infamous ""De Futura"", a track that Chicago's Flying Luttenbachers also felt the need to
    sacrifice virgins to over the last several years.</p><p>
    As an added bonus for non-believers, Guapo also share an affinity for aggressive, near-chaotic expansion
    with bands like Lightning Bolt and Hella.  In all cases, the bass/guitar and drums provide a rock-solid
    base of rhythm under which explosive noise and endlessly repetitive thematic development ends up as
    oppressive rock fury and all-around punch in the neck.  Where Guapo differ is in their preference for
    large-scale symphonic forms and love of sinister, dreadful moments of calm between outbursts.  They offer
    an inventive, if not necessarily strikingly original update on the Magma template.</p><p>
    The five-part title suite begins with the clang of a gong and spooky Rhodes figures-- and if I didn't know
    any better I'd double-check to make sure I hadn't accidentally slipped in one of the Mahavishnu records.
    The extended introduction gives way to a fistful of fury via a three-note figure from bassist Matt Thompson
    that does remind me a little of the Luttenbachers' pound.  However, very soon the band launches a martial,
    tightly wound synth-led melody that practically telegraphs their debt to Magma.  Everything from the simple,
    crushing drumming to slightly goofy synth patches and even down to the specific bass tone crib from ""De
    Futura"", but that's okay.  I get the feeling Guapo really are taking that ball and running with it rather
    than being content to wallow in its glory-- plus it's instrumental, so you're spared from having to sing
    about Orks.</p><p>
    The five parts of <i>Five Suns</i> take up most of the album, though ""Mictlan"" and the relatively calm
    ""Topan"" outline variations in their style.  The former fooled me into thinking they'd reconsidered their
    idea of sonic pummeling by beginning with a long, hypnotic synth drone.  However, 40 seconds in, the
    pummeling returns in the form of minor chord, bottom-heavy acrobatics.  Guapo usually keep their ideas
    concise, so if you don't happen to dig what's going on at any given time, it's likely to change before
    you even know what's happened.</p><p>
    In a perfect world, maybe the band wouldn't be quite so reminiscent of another band, though in truth they're
    probably not running into a lot of people protesting Magma-thievery at gigs.  As far as newer bands in this
    vein, I prefer the Luttenbachers and Lightning Bolt, or even another Cuneiform-sponsored band from the late
    90s, Happy Family.  Still, if you ever want a bit more bite in your instrumental post-rock, Guapo have you
    covered.  Hamatai!</p></div>"|3631.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3631-five-suns/|6.9|Dominique Leone

I Am Dull Grass: A Tribute to the Music of Will Oldham|0.0|Various Artists|[]|0.0|0.0|0.0|['Tract']|2004-08-16 00:00:00|2004|2016-06-11 21:10:23.716125|"<div class=""contents dropcap"" data-reactid="".1g0m1p7e2o0.1.6:0.1.0.$5978/=1$5978.0.3.2.0.1.0.1""><p>In early 2004, Will Oldham released a tribute album to himself, the sprawling and divisive <i>Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy Sings Greatest Palace
    Music</i>.  Oldham's history of shape-shifting (his aliases to date include Palace, Palace Music, Palace Songs, Palace Brothers, Will
    Oldham, Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy, and the simplified Bonny Billy) has always encouraged a certain amount of stylistic diversity, allowing
    him the freedom to craft new homes for his thin, defeated yelps and quasi-absurdist prose.  Sometimes, his goods are framed in full-band
    noise (Palace Music's <i>Viva Last Blues</i>); other times, they're spare and minimal (Palace Brothers' spectacular <i>Days in the Wake</i>).
    Still, <i>Greatest Palace Music</i> saw Oldham's tendency towards reinvention circle in on itself, the ultimate expression of meta-reflection:
    Oldham performing his older material under the guise of his contemporary alter-ego, with a crowd of Nashville session musicians adding
    sickly sax solos and slide guitar.</p><p>
    
    Just months later, Tract Records has released a slightly more conventional tribute record: <i>I Am a Cold Rock.  I Am a Dull Grass.</i>
    features covers of classic Oldham cuts voiced by prominent indie artists (Iron &amp; Wine, Calexico, Pinetop Seven, Sorry About Dresden,
    Scout Niblett, and Adrian Crowley appear) and a slew of lesser-known Oldham admirers who were hand-picked from the label's open call
    for submissions.  And since most of this two-disc collection's material playfully imitates Oldham's trademark spare-and-acoustic style,
    it seems likely to introduce fans of the Oldham aesthetic to some impressive new voices, including Jeffrey Luck Lucas and Diana Darby.</p><p>
    
    Of course, it's the more recognizable names that triumph.  Calexico's take on <i>Days in the Wake</i>'s ""I Send My Love to You"" is a
    stunning reanimation.  Its lilting pedal steel, violin, light percussion, and boy/girl harmonies puff up Oldham's vocals-and-guitar
    lament, adding heft and gently smoothing over all of Oldham's scaly admissions-- a cool hand brushing bits of hair from a sticky brow.
    Fundamentally, Calexico's approach is not really so different from what Oldham himself attempted on <i>Greatest Palace Music</i>: harsh,
    abrasive intensity traded for a soft, layered beauty.  Iron &amp; Wine's cover of ""We All, Us Three, Will Ride"" builds on the <i>Viva Last
    Blues</i> cut with gently shaken handheld percussion, and Sam Beam's hushed, melodic vocals smoothing out Oldham's Appalachian crackle.</p><p>
    
    In true Oldham spirit, however, the safest contributions to <i>I Am a Cold Rock</i> are also the greatest missteps-- Pale Horse and
    Rider's studied ""Work Hard/Play Hard"" follows the Palace version too closely, ultimately missing the dirt-road recklessness that made
    the original so jarring and addictive.  Likewise, Rivulets' melancholy strumming gives ""You Will Miss Me When I Burn"" a markedly
    suburban feel, with vocalist Nathan Amundson's plaintive perfect pitch evoking none of the stewing emotion of the <i>Days in the Wake</i>
    original.</p><p>
    
    The unexpected cohesiveness of <i>I Am a Cold Rock</i>-- which, however inadvertently, strips away all accoutrements, lineup changes,
    and other superficial fixes-- reveals Oldham as a surprisingly consistent songwriter, despite all his coy tricks and outfit-changes.
    In the past, Oldham's skills have always been at least partially obscured by the tenuousness of his vocals, the sparseness of his
    arrangements, and the full-wank sprawl of his bandmates.  <i>I Am a Cold Rock</i>, like <i>Greatest Palace Music</i>, isolates and
    highlights Oldham-as-scribe, dragging his compositions into new, unbroken light.</p></div>"|5978.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5978-i-am-a-cold-rock-i-am-dull-grass-a-tribute-to-the-music-of-will-oldham/|7.8|Amanda Petrusich

Often, the longer an album's treasures take to reveal themselves, the
    longer they take to wear thin.  But a record can look good both from afar <i>and</i> under the microscope, as evidenced by Scottish
    collective Half Cousin's <i>The Function Room</i>.  The album presents a trove of pleasantries off the bat, but its subtler treats
    are revealed only after a set of glaring entreaties-- that sludgy bass stomp that opens its first single, ""Country Cassette"", those
    affable acoustic guitar melodies, and a charming lo-fi aesthetic.</p><p>
<i>The Function Room</i> takes the found-sound aesthetic to a whole other level: Here, the band seems to have taken whatever random
    parts were lying around and made music from them (""Country Cassette"" even enlists a sink as percussion).  It's treacherous territory,
    to be sure, but Half Cousin pull it off convincingly, faltering only in the rare moments that they sacrifice melody to spotlight
    quirky instrumentation.
    Delightfully oddball without the heavy-handedness that often accompanies that rep, Half Cousin are capable rockers as well.  ""Canned
    Laughter"" brings together the best of both worlds, scattering piecemeal effects and flourishes around a core of bawdy live drums; key
    are the deftly manipulated feedback swells-- part of the multi-tracked guitar part out of which the band builds a sundry but insistent
    rhythm.  Exemplary of the record as a whole, the song is filled with subtle sweeps and jaunts throughout: tracks discreetly disappearing
    from one ear and reappearing in the other, multiple sounds strung linear to form a singular melody, and various other affectations
    pulled from a hefty sack of tricks.</p><p>
    Half Cousin haul their sack reliably throughout <i>The Function Room</i>.  Yes, these tracks are robust with melody and can rend hearts
    as readily as any of the artists on Devendra Banhart's contempo folk exposé <i>Golden Apples of the Sun</i>, but the band's greatest
    asset is their ability to pull sudden turns and drop non-sequiturs without ever inhibiting the flow of the album or jarring its fetching
    aesthetic.  A stolid, Joyce-ian read-over, spoken in thickest Scottish drawl, turns the downtrodden ""Mrs. Pilling"" even soggier before
    a radiant electric guitar and ascending vocal melody carry the song down a markedly sunnier path.  Meanwhile, more straightforward folk
    tracks like ""Hindsight"" and ""Blue Ruin"" evoke the usual canonical suspects (Nick Drake, Leonard Cohen, Bert Jansch) while owing a
    substantial debt to a diverse array of modern artists (Beta Band, Beck, and Skygreen Leopards all come to mind).</p><p>
    The album closes on a self-conscious note with a dirgeful, if rote, cover of The Beatles' ""Girl"".  Half Cousin meet the song halfway,
    retaining its melody and structure while razing its originally unexotic instrumentation and replacing it with a kitchen sink-full of
    accordions, theremins, clarinets, and pedal organs. A daunting track for any band to tackle, Half Cousin make the audacious choice to
    render it verbatim, succeeding in ways even The Beatles didn't, strikingly capturing and enhancing the psychedelic torpor of the
    original with novel instrumentation and a downcast, lugubrious performance.  Under the auspices of a lesser band, the move might seem
    gimmicky or apologetic, but Half Cousin turn in a motley effort of incidental genius-- a modus operandi the band fit quite nicely.</p></div>"|3989.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3989-the-function-room/|8.1|Sam Ubl

Heedless of genre, era, and trend, the Trio have
    patiently spun their creaking, cinematic yarns over the course of four enigmatic albums.  By absorbing a variety of nearly forgotten,
    worldly styles-- flamenco, post-bop, Eastern European waltz, tango, gypsy folk, bluegrass-- they've come to occupy a singular niche
    that might be described as cozy if it weren't so haunting.  <i>Book of Silk</i> is perhaps their most evocative work, a sepia-toned,
    still-life dream that whispers with secretive, mournful passion.</p><p>
    No doubt the tragic death of guitarist Mark Orton's wife just before the album was recorded cast a shadow of lament over the sessions:
    whereas Tin Hat Trio previously winked at old-world forms as novelty, <i>Book of Silk</i> shudders with an almost morbid mortal
    understanding. Like the most compelling human dramas, it's precisely that lurking sense of sweet sorrow that raises this album into
    rarefied heights.</p><p>
    Added to the core trio of Orton, accordionist/pianist Rob Burger, and violinist Carla Kihlstedt are longtime Björk harpist Zeena Parkins
    and tuba player Bryan Smith.  Both played with Tin Hat on their last release, <i>The Rodeo Eroded</i>, but here their roles are expanded,
    enlarging the overall sound on opposite ends of the tonal spectrum.  Smith's rich tuba bass is especially significant throughout the
    album. Though softened into a rumbling smudge, its almost subliminal frump provides droning, sober ballast against the album's chiming
    strings.  The eerie ""Compay"", for instance, tiptoes along with stifled paranoia, Smith's tuba anchoring an ascending trill repeated in
    unison on piano and violin.  ""Things That Might Have Been"" is a gritty, countrified reel that's both ponderous and delicate, and a rare
    recorded meeting of accordion, dobro and tuba-- a true feat of rusty, broken-down ambiance given the latter instrument's usually jolly
    marching-band clownishness.</p><p>
    Pinned onto concise arrangements, and unburdened by longwinded solos or standard structure, most of these songs are powerful and pure
    in their linearity.  ""Elliot Carter Family"" and ""Light Black from Pole to Pole"" stray into abstract Kronos Quartet territory, but slow
    burners like the gorgeous ""Lauren's Lullaby"" and heartrending opener ""The Longest Night""-- both clearly informed by deep loss and
    deeper love-- are painfully vivid.  By no means is the album a bleak downer, though; the band paints with a full palette of emotions.
    Kihlstedt's oily violin scats like a French street corner chanson on ""The Clandestine Adventures of Ms. Merz"", while Orton's jazzy
    picking warms up ""Hotel Aurora"" and his banjo twang throughout the syncopated swing of ""Same Shirt, Different Day"" borders on front
    porch funk.</p><p>
    My initial feeling was that with no composition longer than five minutes, these musical vignettes are almost too brief to make an
    impression. But the album clocks in at just over 50 minutes total, pretty much the golden number in terms of sustaining a mood and
    holding interest. To the band's credit, this is a great album in the old-fashioned sense, a gripping and contiguous work meant to be
    pondered as a whole. Maybe that's not the best marketing angle given the current single-for-hire downloading zeitgeist, but I don't
    think they care. Given their boldly updated antiquation, Tin Hat Trio might be channeling their music from another age.</p></div>"|8265.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8265-book-of-silk/|7.8|Jonathan Zwickel

Genre figurehead Larry Tee and his people spent lots of money and column inches
    convincing a percentage of articulated punters in urban centers that this hiccup of electro, techno, and lipstick-punk ethos would be
    vital for the next three minutes, or at least cooler to namedrop than Digital Hardcore.  The tarted-up viral marketing campaign worked--
    did the ""Electroclash Tour"" roll through your town?-- but the artfully coifed style union ran into some trouble when its various entities
    started trying to capitalize: The brightest sparks of a hipster movement aren't supposed to simmer; they should flare up nicely, but then
    explode into pretty slow-motion confetti, as final proof of the fad's premeditative, finite life.  Crashing and burning, though, doesn't
    get you paid, and that's where Electroclash finds itself faltering.</p><p>
    
    Spalding Rockwell consists of ML and Nikki, two leggy gamines with a knack for Nagel and cheeky sleaze electro ditties like 2002's
    ""White Cotton Panties"".  The band's singles had their bits of good-natured debauchery, no question-- and <i>Kate</i>, the duo's dull
    cash-in full-length, makes electroclash's furious endorsement of the moment seem like pure genius.  Unfortunately, when confronted with
    manufacturing a body for their inflated pretty heads, Spalding Rockwell stumble badly on their 10-foot stilettos.</p><p>
<i>Kate</i> is astoundingly vacuous as a standalone album.  When it's not blatantly reconstituting the stippled rhythms and brazen,
    sex-fueled vocal chants of electroclash, it gathers from a musical gene pool that seems pretty typical.  There are tepid My Life with
    the Thrill Kill Kult rampage yammers (""Masha""), melodic references to Nine Inch Nails' ""Closer"" (""Nina""), and retreads of Fannypack-style
    neo-electro (""Naughty""); ""Boy"" sounds like Peaches covering a Raveonettes song.  Over ""Karahi""'s introductory beats, either ML or Nikki
    blurts, ""You should give me everything that I want in this life, because I'm that good looking.""  The song then unfolds around a sleazy,
    distorted drum track, sinister synth figure, and the repeated lyric, ""Pills, pills, pills, pills.""  Taken with the opening declaration,
    we're probably supposed to consider ""Karahi""-- all two minutes of it-- as a jaded meditation on the dangers and decadence of the glitterati
    lifestyle.  Instead, it just suggests Murray Head as a horny recreational drug user.  A little flesh, a little history, and suddenly
    you're working at a Quizno's.</p><p>
    
    In its fleeting moments of resonance, <i>Kate</i> might pass as background ambience for after-hours meat-packing facilities, or as
    music for the Derelicte campaign-- rock guitar-addled opener ""Ingrid"" is a passable sister to Miss Kittin's totally shit-hot
    ""Professional Distortion"", and ""Bad Bad Thing"", a fully realized version of Spalding Rockwell's normally sputtering come-on does
    give off a haughty coolness.  Just like the scene that birthed them, ML and Nikki love coasting on horizontal action and druggy
    naughtiness.  But while stink-puddle sex on a chainlink fence has its place, it's definitely not gonna last all night. (These are
    Manolo Blahniks, after all.)  And Spalding Rockwell never give us anything besides a bump (see: ""Cocaine""), which means <i>Kate</i>'s
    highs are momentary at best.  Like licking an East Village toilet seat, the whole thing just seems like a dumb idea in the morning.</p></div>"|7776.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7776-kate/|3.0|Johnny Loftus

Of one doctrine is the Matmos/Oval/Mouse on
    Mars school, based around clicks, squelches and skips, in which musicians struggle to merge our fleshy, imperfect world with that of
    bent circuitry and drum machines.  On the other side are those such as Autechre and Richard Devine, who program crystal-clear computer
    assaults directly into the listener's brain, with no patience for human warmth or error.  While the first are an elusive breed of
    rarefied souls with mild artistic aspirations, the second are the kids who once survived on <i>Mortal Kombat</i>, Jolt Cola, and <i>Dune</i>,
    all grown up and ready to overload your conscious mind.  And if, at the moment, electro-acoustician Fennesz and musique-concrete
    practitioners The Books are at one end of the scale, Canada's Aaron Funk (aka Venetian Snares) is providing the counterbalance.</p><p>
    
    Venetian Snares' slightly menacing persona, drill 'n' bass onslaughts, and use of pizzicato string melodies all add up to, yes, a
    strong affinity with godfather Aphex Twin.  But aurally, Venetian Snares equally occupies the soundscape of Autechre, creating mathematical
    spaces of sleek synth tones that show no trace of human intervention.  This is more apparent than ever on <i>Huge Chrome Cylinder Box
    Unfolding</i>, Venetian Snares' second LP release this year following <i>The Chocolate Wheelchair Album</i>.  Focused and consistent,
    <i>Cylinder Box</i> accentuates Venetian Snares' most accessible side.  It's relatively gentle and melodic, and takes few forays into
    the abstract.  Here, he's created his most sterile universe-- the computer generated spaceships pictured on the insert belie an
    environment lacking in the real voices or acoustic interludes that have occasionally humanized his quantized breakbeats in the past.</p><p>
    
    The untouchable machinery of the album almost positions it as a piece of pure sound sculpture, but for the numerous complex beats and
    catchy melodies that keep it engaging.  The drums veer away from the snare-heavy sound on which Funk built his reputation, to more
    metallic tones and sci-fi laser effects.  The stereo panning in ""Ion Divoy"" is an especially memorable piece of production, and ""Vida""
    is a standout track, ending in a cannon of pixelated bells and smooth syncopated pulsing.  ""LI2CO3"" is another surprisingly pretty one,
    nearly Venetian Snares-lite.  But there's still plenty of hardcore Funk present, and subtle pieces of scattered candy for the attentive
    listener.  The album's fault lies in its lack of overall variation, which makes it nearly impossible to take in one sitting, despite
    the predictable ambient breaks.</p><p>
    
    Funk's other recent release, <i>Horse and Goat</i> is a six-song EP inspired by its own cover art, which features-- in an attempt to
    shock the burgeoning soccer mom IDM listenership-- a Trevor Brown painting of a naked little girl helplessly surrounded by mutated
    children's-turned-sex toys.  It's to be assumed by the ringtone modulated child's voice in the title track, and the deconstructed
    speak 'n' spells elsewhere (also present on <i>Cylinder Box</i>) that Funk is trying to say something about society's perversion of
    childhood; then again, it's hard to read too much into the work of a man whose stated goal is to make music that's ""fucked up.""

Of one doctrine is the Matmos/Oval/Mouse on
    Mars school, based around clicks, squelches and skips, in which musicians struggle to merge our fleshy, imperfect world with that of
    bent circuitry and drum machines.  On the other side are those such as Autechre and Richard Devine, who program crystal-clear computer
    assaults directly into the listener's brain, with no patience for human warmth or error.  While the first are an elusive breed of
    rarefied souls with mild artistic aspirations, the second are the kids who once survived on <i>Mortal Kombat</i>, Jolt Cola, and <i>Dune</i>,
    all grown up and ready to overload your conscious mind.  And if, at the moment, electro-acoustician Fennesz and musique-concrete
    practitioners The Books are at one end of the scale, Canada's Aaron Funk (aka Venetian Snares) is providing the counterbalance.</p><p>
    
    Venetian Snares' slightly menacing persona, drill 'n' bass onslaughts, and use of pizzicato string melodies all add up to, yes, a
    strong affinity with godfather Aphex Twin.  But aurally, Venetian Snares equally occupies the soundscape of Autechre, creating mathematical
    spaces of sleek synth tones that show no trace of human intervention.  This is more apparent than ever on <i>Huge Chrome Cylinder Box
    Unfolding</i>, Venetian Snares' second LP release this year following <i>The Chocolate Wheelchair Album</i>.  Focused and consistent,
    <i>Cylinder Box</i> accentuates Venetian Snares' most accessible side.  It's relatively gentle and melodic, and takes few forays into
    the abstract.  Here, he's created his most sterile universe-- the computer generated spaceships pictured on the insert belie an
    environment lacking in the real voices or acoustic interludes that have occasionally humanized his quantized breakbeats in the past.</p><p>
    
    The untouchable machinery of the album almost positions it as a piece of pure sound sculpture, but for the numerous complex beats and
    catchy melodies that keep it engaging.  The drums veer away from the snare-heavy sound on which Funk built his reputation, to more
    metallic tones and sci-fi laser effects.  The stereo panning in ""Ion Divoy"" is an especially memorable piece of production, and ""Vida""
    is a standout track, ending in a cannon of pixelated bells and smooth syncopated pulsing.  ""LI2CO3"" is another surprisingly pretty one,
    nearly Venetian Snares-lite.  But there's still plenty of hardcore Funk present, and subtle pieces of scattered candy for the attentive
    listener.  The album's fault lies in its lack of overall variation, which makes it nearly impossible to take in one sitting, despite
    the predictable ambient breaks.</p><p>
    
    Funk's other recent release, <i>Horse and Goat</i> is a six-song EP inspired by its own cover art, which features-- in an attempt to
    shock the burgeoning soccer mom IDM listenership-- a Trevor Brown painting of a naked little girl helplessly surrounded by mutated
    children's-turned-sex toys.  It's to be assumed by the ringtone modulated child's voice in the title track, and the deconstructed
    speak 'n' spells elsewhere (also present on <i>Cylinder Box</i>) that Funk is trying to say something about society's perversion of
    childhood; then again, it's hard to read too much into the work of a man whose stated goal is to make music that's ""fucked up.""
    Regardless, <i>Horse and Goat</i> is both more abstract and varied than <i>Cylinder Box</i>, but also less appealing.  There are

    misfires rubbed against tight hooks and unexpected outbursts.  Though their scattered but affecting indie pop has always borne the seeds
    of promise, their records have never quite lived up to the potential they've hinted at, leaving one to wonder what a stronger focus and
    better production could do for the band.</p><p>
    
    Their last disc, 2002's <i>The Execution of All Things</i>, was a major step up from the lo-fi pop and alt-country leanings of their
    first albums.  But as the band moves on to <i>More Adventurous</i>, their first album backed by a major label, you can hear them polish
    their act: Sennett's vocals are cut entirely, save for one track (""Ripchord""); the funny interludes are yanked; the jolts from urgent
    pop/rock to campfire singalongs are sunk into the valley of adult-alternative; and while the occasional swear words remain, they're no
    longer proudly shouted out.</p><p>
    
    With all this change, <i>More Adventurous</i> places its bets on one thing: Jenny Lewis' voice.  As pure as chilled spring water,
    and as cute and yearning as a hormone-stroked teenager, Lewis' crisp alto shines on every track.  From country to new-wave, ballads to
    throwdowns, she makes the album her showcase, and while the rest of the band-- which includes drummer Jason Boesel and bassist Pierre de
    Reeder-- does yeoman's work in her service, they all seem to understand that those pipes are what's going to garner real recognition.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, the songs (and especially the lyrics) don't give Lewis the support she deserves.  <i>More Adventurous</i> opens with
    its weakest number, ""It's a Hit"", whose painfully awful lyrics criticize the President by comparing him to a monkey that throws its
    own feces.  Compared to subtler anti-GOP songs like The Fiery Furnaces' ""We Got Back the Plague"", it neatly illustrates the gap between
    satire and pure griping.  Elsewhere, the storytelling of the other-woman song ""Does He Love You?"" is too blunt and lacks poetry.  And
    even though Lewis belts ""I Never"" like an authentic, blue-collar country diva, the song runs out of words, leaving her to repeat ""never""
    up to 27 times in a row.  The song's false ending is also awkwardly executed, as it comes to a total halt, and then pauses long enough
    before returning that when Sennett's guitar finally comes back blazing, you have to check that it's still the same song.</p><p>
    
    But even with these weak spots, Rilo Kiley's music has become attractively consistent.  They display an increased maturity on the expertly
    honed and highly accessible acoustic ballads ""Absence of God"" and ""More Adventurous"", where Lewis' lilting expressiveness has replaced the
    sassy accent and almost conversational tone she used to employ.  If those are too sedate, ""Portions for Foxes"" and ""Love and War
    (11/11/46)"" all but steal the album: the guitars spike and roar, and Lewis stops worrying about ripping her best dress.  Sure, the
    anything-goes stew on <i>Execution</i> produced better results.  But Jenny Lewis has a voice that deserves to swoon in front of a rock
    band on one track and a string section on the next.  And while productions like these tend to underscore the band's weaknesses, they're
    also taking Rilo Kiley in the right direction.</p></div>"|6789.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6789-more-adventurous/|6.7|Chris Dahlen

""Transatlanticism"" isn't
    just the title of a Death Cab record; psychedelia can be prayerful without white-robed choirs.  These are the lessons of The Earlies'
    debut album, <i>These Were the Earlies</i>, a deliriously ambitious record packed with neo-psych lullabies and swooning choruses.</p><p>
    The record, which was compiled from a handful of selections off the band's first five EPs (hence the title), sets its sights eight
    miles high with opener ""In the Beginning"", which boasts hymn-like harmonies that recall the Beach Boys' <i>Smile</i> opener, ""Our
    Prayer"".  But this isn't a teenage symphony to God: The Earlies just want to be taken home-- wherever that may be.  Forgive them for
    not being too clear on where home is: Half the band is from West Texas, while the other hails from Manchester, England. The result
    is music that crosses borders as easily as its performers.</p><p>
    One caveat: The Earlies aren't ""making everything new,"" as a man's voice intones during a collage-based, <em>Willy Wonka</em>-worthy
    freakout in ""One of Us Is Dead"".  Their sound is filtered through the influence of countless indie psych-pop groups, most notably
    Mercury Rev.  Think big, sweeping production, replete with bassoons and choirlike harmonies, and of course, the frail vocals of a
    stoned-sounding naïf.  But whereas other recent up-and-comers (I won't name names if it's okay with The Polyphonic Spree) lack
    variety, and too closely ape their influences, The Earlies don't tie themselves to one particular sound: Sleepier tracks like ""Slow
    Man's Dream"" and ""Low"" manage to resemble the lunar chillout of Air or Manitoba, and set the band apart from their acid-friendly
    peers.</p><p>
    With perverse abandon, The Earlies luxuriate in enough music history to make even the most bullshit-averse scribe reluctantly bust out
    his ""meta"" prefix.  There's ""A Day in the Life"" in the news-reading of ""One of Us Is Dead"".  There's ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" in
    ""Bring It Back Again"" (""O can you see by the early light"").  Even album standout ""The Devil's Country"" has a brass section just a few
    neighing saxamophones away from the USC marching band's ""Iron Man"", as singer Brandon Carr announces, ""Your march in time is just a
    shot away,"" like a man searching for not just home, but shelter.  Additionally, if the title of ""Wayward Song"" makes you think of
    Kansas, you're in luck-- amid a floating piano ballad buoyed by ""I Got You Babe"" strings and computerized belches, Carr tells a son
    to ""carry on.""  Yes, fucking Kansas!</p><p>
    Nevertheless, The Earlies' ample cleverness gives them personality, and their sumptuous soundscapes offer a reason to keep pushing
    play.  Even when their lyrics are banal (""It's all right, my baby"" from ""Morning Wind""), the music rarely fails to provide more twists
    than an M. Night Shyamalan ending.  The album follows moments of quiet melancholy with frenetic orchestral crescendos, spiraling vocal
    harmonies, atonal noise and whatever else is handy.  Sure, The Earlies could stand to employ their kitchen sink a bit more judiciously,
    but for the most part, they reach their lofty goals.</p><p>
    In the tradition of mind-expanding music since Syd Barrett, however, <em>These Were The Earlies</em> poses more questions than answers.
    The narrator never finds his home (though Carr repeats ""take me home"" so often amid the escalating swirl and whoosh of ""Morning Wind""
    that it becomes more chant than hook).  In the closing track, ""Dead Birds"", he reprises the opening song's call to Mother Mary, but
    discovers only that ""time is free for the man who sleeps inside the glow,"" whatever the hell that means.  Given the band's transatlantic
    proclivities, though, I'm guessing home is Atlantis.  Or a water bong.  Whichever is closer.</p></div>"|2907.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2907-these-were-the-earlies/|7.9|Marc Hogan

    but I'm not convinced. Maslen, with the support of a new label, continues to distance herself from the image impressed upon her as the
    resident woman at Ninja Tune, and on her fourth album as Neotropic, she makes a concerted effort to tear down cumbersome and arbitrary
    gender and genre barriers that potentially obstruct her growth as an artist.</p><p>
<i>White Rabbits</i> is a sprawling and personal work that further develops Maslen's advances in electronic-influenced acoustic
    experimentation, until now best evidenced on her previous release, 2001's <i>La Prochaine Fois</i>.  The album is also one in which
    Maslen continues her refusal to be conscious of gender in her work. She exhibits an active rejection of her assumed ""responsibility""
    as a marginalized female voice in electronic music by remaining uncompromisingly gender-neutral; gender, for her, is essentially a
    non-issue. On non-instrumental tracks, her lyrical statements are willfully obscure, and the recurring lyrical themes are separation
    and release from a stifling relationship, which pretty well sums up her perception of the ""femininity"" in her own music. Maslen, now
    as always, wants nothing to do with image pigeonholing, and on <i>White Rabbits</i> she takes another crucial step toward total
    liberation as an unclassifiable musician and composer.</p><p>
    What's most interesting about this statement of liberation is its construction. Maslen's composition model initially embraces an
    almost optimistic openness, but grows increasingly paranoid over the course of the album. This regression toward containment results
    in a type of inverse catharsis. Opener ""New Cross"" is a leisurely, bittersweet piece that melds faint electronic flourishes and muted
    distortion with relaxed live drum accompaniment and a soothing guitar melody. ""Inch Inch"" infuses a gentle piano line with clipped
    bursts of stuttering noise, but remains grounded in acoustic orchestration until the melody crawls to a halt. The predominantly acoustic
    façade begins to crack in ""Magpies"", a nervous, vaguely trip-hop instrumental, and shatters completely on the subsequent track, ""Odity
    Round-a-Heights"", which is built upon creepy ambient atmospherics and what sounds like a pirated recording of a German submarine radio
    played backward.</p><p>
    The systematic introversion continues-- dissonant strings, eerie harmonica and flute lines, and foreboding glockenspiel melodies transform
    the role of acoustic instruments in the album from a source of grounding and comfort to part of the disquieting symphony.  Finally, the
    increasingly claustrophobic environment implodes entirely on closing track ""If We Were Trees"", a stark piano-driven piece that concludes
    the album with uneasy resignation.  Maslen, her voice tired and ambivalent, sings, ""Isn't it time we called it a day?""</p><p>
    Despite many hints of potential evolutionary strands Neotropic might choose to follow in the future (including a bonus track, which
    reveals the ensemble's adeptness at collaborative, free-form post-rock exploration), it is possible that the level of discourse on
    Riz Maslen's musical career will never completely move away from a narrow discussion of gender.  But it is comforting to know that
    Maslen is unburdened by her ""place"" in electronic music.  <i>White Rabbits</i> showcases an artist at the top of her form, remaking
    her image on her own terms, and refusing to allow her music to be affected by anything other than the limitations of her own creativity.</p></div>"|5747.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5747-white-rabbits/|7.7|David Moore

    a decade now, he's recorded under the plural moniker The Bruces.  He began recording in the 1990s, during
    brief tenures playing with Vic Chesnutt and Lambchop, but didn't manage to secure a record deal until the
    Athens-friendly (but Austin-based) Misra label saw fit to issue his spotty 2002 full-length <i>The War of
    The Bruces</i>.  Two years later, he's returned with <i>The Shining Path</i> (presumably named for the
    Peruvian communist movement, although he makes no mention of it).</p><p>
    
    McManus possesses a high, piercing voice, slightly off-key and unsettlingly off-kilter.  It's precise and
    gelid in a way that sounds detached, which gives his songs a chilly quality appropriate to the overcast
    skies and wintry scenes that illustrate his music.  And though his is neither a polarizing nor a necessarily
    unique voice, it seems never to settle down into predictability.  Likewise, his music may be quiet, but is
    rarely ever soft.</p><p>
    
    Alternately coldly confrontational (""What Do You Know About Home"") and warmly friendly (""Sleepwalking""),
    McManus has intuitively attuned his voice to the dulcimer, banjo, and rattling percussion that color <i>The
    Shining Path</i>'s 10 songs; perhaps it's due to his former experience as a sideman, or to the fact that he
    plays almost every instrument on the album (there are only four non-Bruces listed in the credits). Sonically,
    <i>The Shining Path</i> is subtly eclectic, making good use of a few backup singers as well as a chorus of
    bom-bom-bahs on ""Fine Solutions"".  ""Sleepwalking"" hinges on a nearly arrhythmic flamenco guitar interlude,
    and the wind chime of instruments on ""Pilot Light"" and the acoustic guitars like icicles melting on ""Far
    East Sweet"" anchor McManus' airy vocals to the ground.</p><p>
    
    Despite admitting that ""I've got the wrong tongue for such a long sound,"" McManus' songwriting voice is
    keenly acclimated to the world around him-- both the natural and the manmade-- and his tensile, barely
    dissonant vocals lend gloomy gravity to his songs about insects in the bug zapper (""The Electric Halo"")
    and about the detachment of living away from home (""Beautiful Slanted Northern Light""). But even home
    presents a distinct dreariness: On the intimately domestic ""Pilot Light"", his furnace goes out, ""so I
    ignite the pilot light on my four-burner stovetop/ Heat my house with the oven door hanging wide open.""
    Similarly, most of the songs evoke loneliness and isolation, in lines like, ""And fallen stars they're
    all shooting something/ Then they turn into snow/ On your TV screen,"" which unravel a progression of
    images that descend from the skies and into your room.</p><p>
    
    About halfway through <i>The Shining Path</i>, however, the songs begin to meander in and out of focus,
    the album begins to sag and slow, and the spell threatens to break.  The nearly vocal-less ""My Nerviosa""
    makes a nice interlude between the halves, but is too structureless to be so long on an album that is
    itself so short.  It doesn't help that the brief ""What Do You Know About Home"" feels faint and only
    half-developed.</p><p>
    
    But this <i>Path</i> does finally lead to the somber title track, on which McManus steels himself against
    the departure of a lover.  As if summoning the last of his resolve, he manages to sound hopeful: ""If I
    had a compass I would turn the world around/ And make the sun arc the sky in your favor.""  Of course, every
    silver lining has a dark cloud, and <i>The Shining Path</i> ends with McManus, his voice for once steady
    and solid, lamenting, ""I think I lost your road.""</p></div>"|978.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/978-the-shining-path/|7.3|Stephen M. Deusner

    on Conor Oberst's brand new record label, Team Love.  Which, I'm sorry; but calling a label that curates
    earnest and emotionally naked pop music ""Team Love"" is kind of like giving birth to a chubby kid and naming
    it ""Lardo.""  It ain't gonna to help their chances on the playground any, if you get my drift.</p><p>
    
    But in an era of stymied passion and cynical detachment, when many bands hide their emo urges under a bushel
    of aggressive guitar and abstruse non sequitur, Oberst's baldly maudlin sentimentality seems almost <em>punk</em>
    by comparison, as it unapologetically violates accepted mores of good taste.  Is suburban mawkishness the new
    radicalism?  The <em>avant</em> to the slickly cosmopolitan <em>garde</em> of Interpol, TV on the Radio, The
    Stills and The Strokes?  The American mystery deepens by degrees.</p><p>
    
    In addition to gelling with Oberst's unabashed my-angst-is-bigger-than-your-angst aesthetic, Team Love makes
    literal sense: Tilly &amp; The Wall is a chance for old friends to get together and relive their halcyon days of
    teenage romance, early adventures with booze and heavy-petting, and starry, night-stalking urgency.  Consequently,
    affection, tenderness and shared history ooze from the record's seams like homely yet structurally indispensable
    grout.</p><p>
    
    Tilly &amp; The Wall's roots lie in a band called Park Ave., which was one of the always-prolific Oberst's
    pre-Bright Eyes efforts.  Park Ave. played saccharine, pointedly amateurish, yet relentlessly infectious
    sing-along pop, with a ""My locker is stuck again!"" lyrical purview that made sense, considering that its
    authors were actually living through such amplified teenage crises at the time, rather than exploiting
    them for forced pathos (*cough* Dashboard Confessional *cough*).  Park Ave. also included Tilly &amp; The
    Wall's Jaime Williams and Neely Jenkins, and their output, while just a hair above the Langley Schools Music
    Project in terms of musicianship, was ridiculously infectious, and revealed a songwriting acuity that was
    drastically disproportionate to its members' nominal experience. </p><p>
    
    As such, those of you familiar with Park Ave. are already tacitly familiar with Tilly &amp; The Wall-- they
    sound, essentially, like a grown-up Park Ave., with tighter arrangements, more focused songwriting, glossier
    production and a tap-dancing percussionist.  I'll pause for a moment while you internalize that last bit.</p><p>
    
    It's true.  Most songs on <em>Wild Like Children</em> can be summed up as [band X] with a tap-dancer: Belle
    &amp; Sebastian with a tap-dancer; Son, Ambulance with a tap-dancer; Rilo Kiley with a tap-dancer; Bright Eyes
    with a tap-dancer; and, on certain rollicking piano-driven numbers, Billy Joel... with a tap-dancer.  This
    similitude is neither surprising nor a slight to the band; pop music is more about familiarity and heritage
    than novelty.  Wheels that spin on the well-oiled bearings of eternally enticing melodies don't require
    reinvention; leave that to the deconstructionists, academics and post-music provocateurs.</p><p>
    
    Brimming with co-ed harmonies, jangly acoustic guitars and lambent keyboards, Tilly &amp; The Wall forgo a
    drummer and allow Jaime Williams' tap-dancing to provide the rhythmic chassis.  While this may sound like a
    despicable throwaway gimmick upon first impression, it actually makes a great deal of intuitive sense, and
    seems so completely natural that one becomes kind of astonished that the tap-dancer-as-percussionist isn't
    more common.  Williams hoofs out striated, staccato clusters that would be impossible to replicate on drums,
    and lends the clattering pop songs a crisp and martial demeanor that buoys them up above the traditional
    indie-pop maneuvers they otherwise employ.</p><p>
    
    Of course, indie pop has always gotten by on swooning melodies, and without them the conceit would fall flat,
    but Tilly &amp; The Wall rise to the occasion with a collection of thoroughly hummable nursery rhyme airs.  <em>Wild
    Like Children</em> opens with ""Fell Down the Stairs"", which is consummately Park Ave., with its prolix male/female
    narrative of teenage trepidation (""They got lost as they were taking off each others' clothes""), galloping
    acoustic guitar, tinkling bells and theatrical a cappella breakdown.  ""Nights of the Living Dead"" puts David
    Dondero doppelganger Derek Pressnall's vocals front-and-center for a quickening ode to the possibilities of
    a closed-down nighttime world, borne along on a tide of staticky, surging guitar, with sudden exclamations
    leaping from the darkly glittering current like fantastic fish.  The wistful, gently unfolding ballad ""Let
    It Rain"" would have nestled snugly on the Son, Ambulance/Bright Eyes split release <em>Oh Holy Fools</em>,
    with a transparent lyrical simplicity that echoes its spare arrangement: ""I thought you'd come and go/ I
    never thought you would stay/ And I'm sorry if I tried to push you away.""</p><p>
    
    In the final, unlisted track on Jawbreaker's <em>Dear You</em>, Blake Schwarzenbach broadcast this petition
    into the skeptical, dead-eyed cosmos: ""Show me the raw stuff of youth.""  Nearly a decade later, Tilly &amp; The
    Wall have answered with an album that harnesses this fiery anima with the highest imaginable fidelity.  It's
    remarkable how little signal degradation has occurred, considering that the band members are professional-class
    citizens (two of them retired from public school teaching to devote more time to Tilly) in their mid-twenties.
    Often, grown folk singing about teenaged problems comes across as exploitative and off-putting (*cough* Papa
    Roach *cough*-- sorry, I must be coming down with something).  But Tilly &amp; The Wall split their time so
    equally between youth's heartaches and unmatchable joys that it seems a heartfelt and sophisticated
    coming-of-age document, despite the fact that ""sophisticated"" is usually antithetical to such ingenuous
    musical roman a clef.</p></div>"|8264.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8264-wild-like-children/|7.5|Brian Howe

Nobody cares that Pharrell pumps beats
    into a calculator and gets cookie-cutter club knockers.  Nobody blinks when Juvenile chants, ""Uhh, I like
    it like that, she workin' that back, I don't know how to act.""  Not a soul wept when The Roots brought the
    blatantly unfinished ""Don't Say Nuttin'"" to mega-producer Scott Storch and he dubbed the track dynamite.</p><p>
    
    But the purist in me harkens back to a time long ago-- the early 90s-- when ""underground hip-hop"" was only
    fledgling phrase, and groups like De La and Tribe headed a Native Tongues army, preaching truth and beats
    for all.  Eschewing the decadent values and gang-banging personas of their hip-hop peers, these Golden Age
    warriors wed themselves to Afrocentricity and musical ingenuity.  So after a five-year hiatus, when New
    Rochelle natives Brand Nubian decide to release another LP, I expect the trio to build on their reputation
    as remnants of one of the best eras in hip-hop.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, <i>Fire in the Hole</i> fails to invoke any effective nostalgia as it phlegmatically wanders
    through 12 solid but unexciting tracks.  After 1998's stellar <i>Foundation</i>, Sadat X and Grand Puba left
    the group in search of solo success, but only found acclaim rapping on other people's tracks.  Meanwhile,
    Lord Jamar made the challenging jump from rapper to inmate on HBO's <i>Oz</i>.  As a result, Brand Nubian
    has been a name without a body and <i>Fire in the Hole</i> fails to capture the synergy that the group once
    possessed.</p><p>
    
    Six years later, Brand Nubian just sounds tired.  Listen to the much-hyped single ""Who Wanna Be a Star?""
    and you've heard the whole album: The eternally idiosyncratic Sadat X drops crazy shit on the chorus (""And
    all the broads, yeah, ultimate head!"") while Puba and Jamar push honest but unpolished verses against
    well-worn underground hip-hop motifs.  ""Always Mine"" echoes the album's laziness: a standard soul reworking
    and mediocre flows (""We first met in junior high/ I was so shy, you were so fly"").  Meanwhile, ""Got a Knot""
    is straight from the <i>Mario Paint</i> beatmaking kit with its jarring blips and obnoxious MIDI rock guitar.</p><p>
    
    While <i>Fire in the Hole</i> may not spark a comeback, it does reveal glimpses of Brand Nubian's former
    potential as potent, emoting MCs.  ""Where Are You Now"" crackles with summery keys and reveals Brand Nubian's
    vulnerability as they retell of all the women that have done them wrong.  ""Just Don't Learn"" projects the
    desolation and nihilism of the ghetto through Brand Nubian's sobering experiences.  Sadat X laments: ""I
    wish I had a dollar for every funeral parlor I been to/ I've been friends to a lot of dead niggas.""  These
    two tracks, however, hardly salvage an otherwise average release.  While Brand Nubian may boast positivity,
    they're missing the quality.  If Nas is right, sleep is the cousin of death, and Brand Nubian's career is
    certainly napping.</p></div>"|1123.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1123-fire-in-the-hole/|6.5|Jamin Warren

I blow my nose and-- nearly always-- examine the tissue.</i></p>
<p>Claire was smart and had a borderline unhealthy obsession with Elvis Presley.  She was beautiful to boot--     clear olive-complexion, auburn hair, brown eyes, corn-fed figure-- and I knew that no mere courting ritual     could attract her to my sphere of awkward hellos and pudgy exterior.  No, for her I had to think of something     extravagant, something slightly self-deprecating but all-in-all a massive feat of wit and humility.  Thus     was birthed into the world by my 16-year-old hands the weighty and indulgent ""List of 250 Reasons NOT to     Go Out with Andrew Bryant"".  My reasoning was two-fold; (1) the sheer phenomenal length of such a list     would express to her my devotion and attention to detail, or lack of anything better to do, and (2) it     would plant the adoring seeds of refutation in her mind.  For every step I took away from her, she would     take three towards me, and for a brief period of my life I was Casanova, hand-in-hand with the complex and     stunning belle of only my best dreams.</p>
<p><i>153. I break glass in deserted parking lots because I know that it is both a gorgeous display and a     necessary one.</i></p>
<p>As I lay on my sofa watching the revolutions of their recent self-titled vinyl only release dwindle to     center, it strikes me that Gang Gang Dance (GGD) perform a similar transparently self-absorbed trick on     their listening public as I did with the divine Miss C: They divulge a slew of seemingly unconnected and     oft disturbing images in a successful attempt at shepherding the skeptics to their flock.  Like my own     situation, though, the group does so in a seemingly uphill battle of their own creation.  Judging them     merely by the gatefold-cover of this document-- and given the group's roots in the now-hot Brooklyn     indie-folk scene, shared by mates Excepter, Animal Collective, and Mouthus-- one might presume a safe     knowledge of what is contained betwixt cut-out photographs of skulls, literature, and band members seemingly     hard at work perfecting their sound.  Before even setting the needle to the groove, I had an inkling that     Brian De Graw and Tim De Wit would bring the abrasive and frankly weird sound of former band Cranium to     the record, outfitted with the Chrome-by-way-of-Appalachia noise of Jackie-O alum Josh Diamond.  I also     took for granted that vocalist Lizzi Bougatsos would yield a lysergic feminine insight to this boys-only     genre of reinvented folk, yielding what would at best sound like a distorted Carter Family backed by the     No Neck Blues Band.</p>
<p>Speakers charged, the first sound I heard was one emanating from my own throat-- the acidic choking back     of my false assumptions.</p>
<p>Side A, entitled ""Kentucky"", begins with the gathering of aberrant tones produced by the sly reed of a dense     and distorted flute.  This eventually cascades into a true rhythm outfitted by a smattering of crude percussive     techniques typified by other groups in the same musical vein such as neighbors to the North, Sunburned Hand     of the Man.  Unlike their brethren, though, GGD manage to keep a decidedly optimistic tone throughout the     introduction, an interesting parallel to the operatic dirge of the band's increasingly lilting vocals.     Throughout this exercise, guitar lines weave in and out of the periphery falling ultimately to a sturdy     deep pulse and a vocal orgy of guttural wrenches and cries.</p>
<p>This menagerie continues unabated until a bastard collection of sinusoidal tones washes on the banks of     one of the album's few distinct ""tracks,"" ""Rugs of Prayer"".  As a woodpecker promenade erects the scaffolding     that will hold the weight of the track, a grumbling beat slowly builds, increasing in both rate and complexity.     Guitar and synthesizer punch holes in the whining collection of drones, culminating in a grinding halt of     munching jaw sounds, creating a startling bleak atmosphere that simultaneously breathes of its own accord     and places its hungry fingers around your throat.  A chilling song, it fittingly closes the first side on     a note of anticipation as to whether this experience will provide an ending with any hint of what one could     recognize as ""happy.""</p>
<p><i>49. One can not overestimate the stupidity of this statement: ""If you can make it in New York, you can     make it anywhere.""</i></p>
<p>The B-side continues GGD's dangerous and exhilarating flirtation with all things lining the sordid underbelly     of popular music, beginning with the vocal piece ""The Thread"".  Over an occasionally dropped beat, one does     not deem to doubt the sincerity of Liz's plainly spoken plea, ""The things they say to you/ What are they     worth?"" as skittering electronically derived percussion builds to match her vocal intensity.</p>
<p>As is often the case on the album, unbridled fury is duly followed by a resting valley of contemplative     instrumentation as the track slowly fades into a ping-ponging rest, another beat to serve as a future     musical base.  Atop this mesh, a volatile hi-hat eventually enters, creating a dialogue that results in     a short-lived loop of intense synth-stepping heralding the album's theatrical climax and instrumental     denouement.</p>
<p>The final track-- as far as I can tell from the confusing liner-notes-- features most prominently the     talents of former bandmate Nathan Maddox who unfortunately passed away in 2002, the victim of a chance     encounter with a lightning bolt atop his girlfriend's apartment in Chinatown.  Beginning on a zenith of     buzzing bees droning into ever-shifting registers, a compelling series of chimes and a shifting rhythm     map out a gamelan-style ascending scale that lends a foreign atmosphere to the nearly indecipherable     lyrics.  To this mixture, Nate adds a serious chant that stirs the music into a renewed fervor, as the     once-steady drone becomes a feverish roar.  The beautiful mess layers itself into a syncopating infinity     shortly before a series of distorted vocals signal a timely rest and the end of the album-- an effect as     breath-taking as the first time I listened to <i>Tago Mago</i>, excited and slightly disturbed.</p>
<p><i>207. Fat-Elvis should justly be considered as sexy as young-Elvis.</i></p>
<p>Some records you fall in love with in their entirety.  Only with time and effort do you begin to discover     the subtle intricacies and details that lend to a fuller, richer interpretation of the whole.  Gang Gang     Dance succeed in back-loading this theory, forcing the listener to dedicate themselves piece-meal in the     full understanding of this creation-- falling in love in ""stages,"" if you will.  Either way, patient     music-lovers will discover that, whether they're enamored by the forest or the trees, this is a record     more than worthy of their full attention.</p></div>"|3647.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3647-gang-gang-dance/|8.6|Andrew Bryant

    seducing fashionable nerds onto the dancefloor in record droves.  And with the parallel surge of interest in
    the early 80s New York scenes, it's a good time to discover Konk, an act that was born out of jazz, early
    hip-hop, and disco to create a fusion (certainly a dangerous word) of the better kind.  Led by saxophonist
    Dana Vlcek, Konk channeled sounds ranging from the alien hooks of P-funk to the stilted grooves of krautrock
    through early-80s technology.  Of course, a band with such a period-specific sound risks seems more silly
    than relevant 20 years later, but happily, Konk is both at once.  It's cheesy, for sure, but if you dig
    good times, then <i>The Sound of Konk</i>-- a collection of their singles and LPs (such as <i>Yo!</i> and
    <i>Jams</i>)-- is ready for action.</p><p>
    Like post-punk reference-point the Talking Heads, Konk apply the rhythms and melodies of Latin music within
    funk's staccato pulse.  But while the Talking Heads' experimentation is contained in song forms, Konk
    maintain a funk-sprawl ideology in a system that foretells acid-jazz-- a slew of solos and sections
    announce themselves unprovoked over shifting grooves, creating non-linear yet highly organized multi-part
    jams.  With several layers of live and electronic percussion, Konk compel movement.  You don't need to
    dance to enjoy the music, but Konk won't likely do much for you if you're sitting still-- driving, running,
    cooking, or partying are all recommended Konk-enhanced activities.</p><p>
    Konk's integration of live instrumentation and electronic manipulation remains impressive, combining synthesized
    sounds that are still imperfect enough to sound human with musicians of precise virtuosity.  While Konk is
    often lumped with fellow downtown experimentalists Glenn Branca (with whose ensemble Konk shared members)
    or ESG, the strongest link there is a shared interest in the deconstruction and reformation of musical
    elements, especially in live performance.  Simultaneously, Konk shares just as much common ground with the
    proto-techno of The Art of Noise or Yello.  Like these acts, plenty of gated snare drums and <i>Max
    Headroom</i>-style vocal manipulation keep the mood of Konk gleefully rooted in the 1980s, but Konk's
    timeless horn section and airtight basslines save them from the fate of becoming a technological artifact.</p><p>
<i>The Sound of Konk</i> begins with one of Konk's most conventional tracks, instrumental ""Baby Dee"" (the
    bonus live version includes some excellent Kurtis Blow-style MCing).  Delayed female vocals intertwine with
    a robotic male chorus in ""What U Want"", before the song lets loose a prolonged rhythmic breakdown of drums
    and synth bass.  ""Love Attack"" begins with a monologue highlighting various dangers of an oncoming love
    attack-- such as when ""some girls think a kiss is a contract""-- segueing into a vocoded chant that could
    be taken from one of Señor Coconut's Kraftwerk covers.  ""Soka La Moka"" breaks up the relative rhythmic
    homogeneity of the album with a tumbling bongo beat and klezmer horns.  To today's ears, <i>The Sound of
    Konk</i> combines true dance pleasure and experimentation with the humor of the groovy whiteboy sound
    embodied/parodied by Gary Wilson.</p><p>
    Should Konk be given credit for the accidents of history, accruing value like a fine wine as their once
    cutting-edge technology matures into bootylicious kitsch?  Should a band be adored for the same criteria
    that could be used to criticize them?  Maybe not, but in the words of Shirley Bassey via Propellerheads,
    ""Why ask your head?  It's your hips that are swinging.""  Beneath Konk's dated sound is some, well, intelligent
    dance music, and given the current popularity of !!!, or live/electronic hybrids like VHS or Beta, Soul Jazz
    chose the right time to unleash <i>The Sound of Konk</i> upon a funk-hungry land.</p></div>"|4583.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4583-the-sound-of-konk/|7.9|Liam Singer

One of the cavities was in a semi-impacted,
    difficult-to-reach wisdom tooth, so my dentist had to use the ""slow drill.""  Since the RPMs are lower on
    this particular drill, a significantly larger amount of force has to be applied to carve out a hole for the
    filling.  (I asked him about the slow drill later; he told me that in the early days of mechanical dentistry,
    when these drills were the only game in town, the job required a large amount of upper body strength.)  When
    my dentist got serious and leaned into his instrument, the sensation was completely overwhelming.  I was
    numb from Novocain, but my skull felt like a Ford Festiva doing 50 on rims down a dirt road.  The physical
    trauma of the moment was so shocking I didn't have time to formulate a reaction beyond ""Wow!""</p><p>
    And the sound!  The sound was like... well, it was a lot like ""Stoocha Acid Zlook"", the 21-minute centerpiece
    from Hecker's <i>Sun Pandämonium</i>.  I know, Andy Beta already mentioned dentistry in his Pitchfork review
    of that album, but nothing else in common experience comes close to describing the sensation of that particular
    record.  You gotta talk about the dentist when you talk Hecker; it's the perfect reference point.  Hecker's
    goals for his music lie in the physical.  He's trying to ""move"" the listener, alright-- move him out of his
    seat and into some sort of duck-and-cover position.</p><p>
<i>PV Trecks</i> is less in-your-face than <i>Sun Pandämonium</i>, but it's no less abstract, and it affirms
    that Hecker is an odd throwback to a different era.  It's all done digitally (the lone credit here is ""computer"")
    and I'm certain his setup is completely cutting-edge, but his music seems a tribute to the sounds coming out
    of the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center in the early 60s.  The goal then was a new kind of composition
    using a new kind of sound, and the rules were still being formulated.  Much of this music existed in part to
    present previously unknown timbres as ends in themselves.  This sort of ""pure"" electronic music is no more
    accessible now than it was back in the day.</p><p>
    And so it is with Hecker.  He uses familiar tones such as sine waves, pink noise and primitive blips, and
    then bends, twists and overlaps them to achieve visceral effects.  His music is strangely devoid of any
    sort of ""organic"" quality; all sounds are birthed from a calculating motherboard inside the guts of a
    machine, and when they emerge from speakers, we know immediately that they've lived all previous days as
    1s and 0s.  The sounds are not referential, that seems very important.</p><p>
<i>PV Trecks</i> consists of 33 tracks totaling 34 minutes.  A number of cuts are less than 30 seconds
    (you would be well advised not to buy it by the track), just a few squiggles, some chirps that turn quickly
    into grinding noises, and then it's over.  Unlike <i>Sun Pandämonium</i>, there's nothing epic or particularly
    intimidating here; some of the sketches have a certain playfulness, while others contain chunks of silence.
    A few pieces go for balls-out noise (""Ciz-Glemp 2"" is particularly intense), but nothing is sustained.
    Perhaps unsurprisingly, Hecker's music, when stripped of <i>Sun Pandämonium</i>'s thrilling sense of sonic
    assault, gets boring after a while.  There seems to be a complex underlying structure here, which might be
    fun to decode for the same reason people get wrapped up in jigsaw puzzles.  But as music, <i>PV Trecks</i>
    never manages to cross over from the realm of pure idea.</p></div>"|3794.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3794-pv-trecks/|5.8|Mark Richardson

At
    the dawn of the 80s, urban America was an incubator of newborn aesthetics where burgeoning new genres were
    feverishly built up and broken down night after night.  1979 had seen the infamous ""Disco Demolition""
    promotion at the White Sox's Comiskey Park; after a pile of dance records was ignited in center field,
    Chicago's rampant rock 'n' roll faithful erupted into a riot and forced a forfeit to the Tigers.  In
    Detroit, an intrepid radio DJ named Electrifying Mojo flouted conventional genre restraints five hours a
    night, backing up Prince with Kraftwerk and Parliament with Tangerine Dream, while voracious listeners
    like Derrick May and Juan Atkins were drawing the blueprints of techno.  Merely mentioning the names of
    New York's seminal clubs of the era-- CBGB, Studio 54, Paradise Garage, The Roxy-- evokes reveries of
    legendary hedonism and unbridled creativity, and their impact on current music runs deep.</p><p>
    Since our collective cultural hindsight seems permanently set on a two-decade span, recent interest in the
    glory days of urban music has left few worthy artifacts undiscovered.  With Death Comet Crew, however,
    Troubleman has dusted off a priceless electro gem.  Along with bands like ESG and Liquid Liquid, DCC was
    a major part of Manhattan's early 80s downtown arts scene, brazenly fusing disco, punk, techno and hip-hop
    for dancefloor experimentalists and would-be B-boys.  Comprised of drummer/producer Stuart Argabright,
    guitarist Michael Diekmann, bassist/guitarist/keyboardist Shinichi Shimokawa, DJ High Priest, and MC/grafitti
    writer Rammellzee on occasional vocals, DCC was drawn together intermittently for shows and recording
    sessions in '83 and '84.  <i>This is Riphop</i> draws material from several performances and session dates
    during that period.</p><p>
    The band's aggressively schizoid personality is split in more ways than one.  Originally named Arena Sex
    Death (my personal favorite), then Death Star Crew (George Lucas took exception to that one), Death Comet
    Crew arrived at a crucial intersection of styles and created a patchwork of malevolent Frankenstein funk
    that has influenced a generation of DJs and producers.  With live electronic drums and drawn-out sound
    collage sampling, they demolished the rigid breakbeat-and-loop structure that had dominated hip-hop to
    that point.  Huge, overmiked bass drums and frantic effects-laden guitar presage The Bomb Squad's dense
    wall of noize that fortified Public Enemy.  High Priest's booming, stream-of-conscious dialog samples set
    the stage for DJ Shadow's cinematic hip-hop.  A seething, experimental darkness permeates the album,
    recalling Dälek and Kid606.</p><p>
    The most telling indicators of the album's old-school origins are Rammellzee's simplified delivery and a
    shoestring production feel to live tracks like the scratch pastiche of ""Amphipet"" and the new, new wave of
    ""A King Wave Passes"".  These quirks, though, are more endearing than inhibiting-- after all, this hypnotic,
    next-level shit was actually made back before Pro Tools existed, and Rammellzee's sing-song flow blows
    emotional buoyancy into this weighty effort.  MF Doom, in fact, owes a clear debt to his style, as well as
    DCC's overall dirty, ragged sound.</p><p>
    Songs show up in complementary pairs: Psycho-sampling ""America"" and ""America 2"" bookend the album; ""Interior
    Street"" is sparse and skeletal while the hazy ""Exterior Street"" takes its lead from Shimokawa's rolling bass
    and keys.  ""Funky Dream Two"" and ""Funky Dream One"" both bounce along on the same comedic vocal sample, but
    ""Two"" is cavernous where ""One"" is brittle.  Even with the current gush of electro and dance-punk into the
    indiestream, DCC easily trumps !!! and Tussle if by no other virtue than they did it first-- and Nic Offer
    is no Rammellzee.</p><p>
    Today, Tussle's sweaty, percussive dancehall punk is DCC's closest kin.  Stuart Argabright remixed their
    ""Don't Stop"" for an EP early last year, and I'm betting that set the wheels in motion to get this album
    compiled.  Death Comet Crew also reunited for a much-hyped gig in October 2003 at NYC's Knitting Factory,
    and are reportedly working on a new release.  There couldn't be a better time for their return-- now that
    we can hear it, their legacy is loud and clear.</p></div>"|2569.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2569-this-is-riphop/|8.8|Jonathan Zwickel

Careening in just a few short years
    from imminent explosion, to reviled novelty, to just another banal indie staple, its artists have had
    precious little time to reconnoiter and derive a cogent statement of intent.  Lacking a true flagship
    work, there seems a persistent air of illegitimacy about the genre, and so its artists' vision of DIY is
    viewed with less credibility than punk's or hip-hop's.  But it takes at least as much skill to program
    powerful beats and create dynamic textures from celluloid as it does to bash guitars and drums into
    anti-music oblivion.  And while lap-pop may not yet have any sort of unifying relevance, the technology
    ain't going anywhere; someone, somewhere, will eventually get around to writing the masterpiece that
    albums like The Notwist's <i>Neon Golden</i> and Ms. John Soda's <i>No P. or D.</i> fell just short of.</p><p>

    Octet, runs an outsized gamut of styles.  If lap-pop hasn't yet found its chef d'oeuvre, this effort is
    sufficiently above average to keep connoisseurs of the stuff engaged and sated.  For now, albums like this---
    congenial and well-crafted, yet poorly defined-- provide the par for course.  And that's okay.</p><p>
<i>Cash and Carry Songs</i> dabbles in divergent styles, failing to hunker down and commandeer its own.  A
    sense of Múm-meets-big-beat runs throughout, posing an interesting textural dynamic. Check the spaced
    harpsichords and rock-steady beat of opener ""Hey Bonus""; the combination lays a throbbing, motorik
    groundwork while simultaneously casting light from above. Not 10 minutes yonder lie the lubed-up, housey
    electronics of ""Sneakers &amp; Thong"", and further still the glaring rhythmic drones of ""Trackball of Fire"".
    It's obvious Francois Goujon and Benjamin Morando know their way around a Reason interface, and the
    finesse with which they build a distinct instrumental foundation for each track is admirable.</p><p>
    Octet are at their best when they involve vocals, rather than milking tedious atmospherics, such as on the
    beatific but droning ""Anti-Camp Policy"".  The aforementioned ""Hey Bonus"" is especially strong, despite its
    forgettable lyrics.  In such a cordial context, where psych-pop meets spliced vocals and a house beat, it's
    easy to overlook a chorus of, ""Wasting my time/ Losing my mind.""  In fact, during some of <i>Cash and Carry
    Songs</i>' more placid instrumentals, such unexceptional vocal flourishes are sorely missed.  ""Kino Cat
    Leng"" is just a tad too blip-happy for a song without the telltale trademarks of IDM's more successful
    composers.</p><p>
    Guesting on a couple of tracks is M83 vocalist Suzanne Thoma, whose robustly demure pipes are a perfect
    complement to Octet's slick yet too often dainty orchestrations.  ""Blind Repetition"" is further aided by
    some deftly interwoven bass clarinet swells; lacking a steady beat, it's <i>Cash and Carry Songs</i>'
    closest encounter with ambient, and incidentally, one of its most sophisticated moments (something the duo
    might want to note on subsequent efforts).  On the opposite end of the spectrum, ""Feels Good to Give Up""
    successfully approximates the hip-hop-tinged female vocal pop so prevalent in the American mainstream
    these days, while Peaches cohort Taylor Saavy's vocal embellishments recall Octet's countrymen Phoenix.</p><p>
    But what hinders this collection, and lap-pop in general, is a vacuous lack of identity.  It has taken
    other forms of electronic composition up to 30 years to successfully invoke the ghosts in the machine,
    and most strains are still learning.  On that timeline, lap-pop has barely begun its ABC's.  Still, for
    a young genre with grandiose ambitions, Octet are a promising act who might one day turn exemplary.</p></div>"|6097.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6097-cash-and-carry-songs/|7.5|Sam Ubl

And the station will proceed to skim the sonic surface of the Reagan
    Era, wrapping the lunchbreaks of sedan drivers in a comforting Pier Connection poultice of Human League and
    ""Hungry Like the Wolf"".  Though there's always the occasional stab into the decade's deeper layers (""Here's
    a gem from Chris Rea!""), a large chunk of the population's 80s memories would fit on disc one of your average
    Rhino retrospective.  I Am the World Trade Center take a different tack.  They're as enamored of the decade
    as A Flock of Seagulls (who, incidentally, are still touring), but their memories live on in the rhythms of
    import singles and the tiny circuits of a 21st century hard drive.  And if they spend a lot of time reveling,
    they do try to reinvent, as well.</p><p>
<i>The Cover Up</i>, I Am the World Trade Center's third album, tends to prefer detached whirs to direct
    references-- and that detachment drips all over Amy Dykes' every syllable.  ""If you're looking for a good
    time/ Call me tonight,"" she throatily coos in opener ""No Expectations"".  She's the unattainable 80s video
    vixen, pushing away Peter Godwin every time he gets close enough to smell the Chanel.  Behind her, bandmate
    Dan Gellar's pulsing electro/disco bassline is punctuated with snare triggers and the occasional keyboard
    tinkle, which lends an authentic feel more akin to those flashy plastic times past than to present-day
    revivalism.  And yet, it's all built with point-and-click Powerbook know-how.</p><p>
    
    World Trade Center rock this dynamic well throughout <i>The Cover Up</i>, even as their songs eventually
    begin to blend into a pleasant haze of burbles and Debbie Harry poses.  It's essentially a one-trick sound,
    but here, they do a better job of adapting it to their post-dated needs than they did on previous albums:
    ""Love Tragedy"" summarizes the disintegration of Dykes' and Gellar's romance to the cool and twittering
    underpinnings of <i>Substance</i>-era New Order, while ""Follow Me"" leaves more space in its arrangement--
    with some tweaking, it could be a Trans Am-worthy mainframe freakout.  <i>The Cover Up</i> also offers a
    cover of The Jam's ""Going Underground"", which nicely breaks up the album's fizzy beats with some electric
    guitar cranks and warm organ chirping.</p><p>
    
    Guitars figure into ""Different Stories"", too-- an elastic wah-wah tone suggestive of early Britpop married
    to the clicky synth percussion of their beloved bygone era.  It's the kind of thing I wish World Trade
    Center had further experimented with on <i>The Cover Up</i>; employing elements not typically associated
    with their retro revisitations is a better way to make this sound live in the present.  To their credit,
    the duo do seem to grasp this notion:  On the title track, they occasionally drop out the incessant clicky
    beat, and work in keyboard sounds that, at the very least, weren't included with most ROM packs back in
    the day.  Still, while they could stand an infusion of variety, I Am the World Trade Center's version of
    nostalgia still sounds fresher today than most of what's endlessly replayed on Nostalgia FM.  They're
    accessing what it sounded like to be cool back then-- not just popular.</p></div>"|4041.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4041-the-cover-up/|7.2|Johnny Loftus

Yet suburban white teens,
    the core of hip-hop's buyer base, draw their experiences with the state-sponsored segregation and degradation
    of the ghetto from their iPods and Discmans on their way to school.  Hip-hop album liner notes and the pages
    of <i>XXL</i> serve as a proxy for those who can't face the ghetto first-hand.  So when a fresh MC dons the
    griot's cloak and translates his world for public consumption, the gap that once separated millions of the
    Black and Latino poor, and their scores of campaigners and admirers, is lifted-- if only for a momentary spin
    of the vinyl.</p><p>
    
    As the last member of the legendary J.U.I.C.E. crew, Masta Ace's ability to translate his life into hip-hop
    should come as no surprise.  15 years of paddling in the backwater of the rap industry (and utterly smoking
    Boogieman on ""Acknowledge"" along the way) has given Ace the fatherly insight of a veteran.  While 2001's
    <i>Disposable Arts</i> brought Ace a new generation that was weaned on ""Sittin' on Chrome"", <i>A Long Hot
    Summer</i> is a lesson for tykes who don't remember when MC were cultural messengers.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, <i>A Long Hot Summer</i> starts slowly.  In fact, when you cop this album, do yourself a
    favor and skip the first five tracks.  One of the many hip-hop traditions that Ace continues here is
    inconsistency, and it's unfortunate that the worst work on the album arrives first.  Chicago's Dug Infinite
    offers up a yawner in ""Big City"" and Ace comes off lazy, like he let Urban Outfitters' <i>Hip-Hoptionary</i>
    ghostwrite his verses: ""This ain't America, is it?/ It don't take much for the cops to pay you a visit/ But
    do what you gotta do, fuck them laws/ Life is a test, you better up them scores.""  Even 9th Wonder's patented
    soul sounds awkward on ""Good Ol' Love"", with Ace again delivering mediocre phrases like the ironic, ""Y'all
    think I'm washed up like I got in the tub.""</p><p>
    
    Despite its unpolished beginning, the album bounces back with ""Beautiful"".  Producer Koolade's elegant claps
    and weeping keys set the perfect backdrop for Ace to paint Brooklyn with a golden veneer.  For the first
    time on <i>A Long Hot Summer</i>, Masta Ace invokes the honesty that made <i>Disposable Arts</i> so likeable:
    ""The most beautifulest thing ever/ And it's here to bring terror to the bling-era/ You can feel it in your
    inna'/ It's like Grandma's house, Thanksgiving Dinner.""  On ""F.A.Y."", Ace immediately counterposes his romance with
    Brooklyn with the disdain and nihilism of a struggling MC, as he and Strick provide a laundry list of
    complaints about their inequitable conditions from tax collectors and sheisty label execs to sloppy
    girlfriends who fart in their sleep: ""To all you mean creditors and magazine editors/ Same ones that debted
    us and put niggas ahead of us/ I'm a mad dog who sits in the dark/ I'm fixin' to bark, watching 106 &amp; Park.""</p><p>
    
    Moreover, Ace does establish his ability as a capable MC.  In a late attempt to counteract the average flows
    on the album's opening, Ace parades his lyrical feathers on ""Soap and Soda"".  (Check: ""I just got home as
    the Sunkist the sky,"" or, ""I just grab my wife and we lay and Snuggle/ We talk about how one day we gonna
    sail on the Tide and get Wisked away."")</p><p>
    
    Surprisingly, the bane of random play (aka the skits) pulls the album together thematically.  Rather than
    wasting time with phone calls from friends or snippets of orgiastic female moans, Ace weaves the story of
    his relationship with the fictional hustler Fats Belvedere.  The contrast of Masta Ace's dedication with
    Fats' unscrupulous money-chasing provides a glimpse of Ace within his Brooklyn context.  While Fats may
    earn more money than Ace could earn in a lifetime, it's Ace's devotion to the art that Fats respects and
    ultimately what strengthens their friendship.  In spite of the a world pitted against both of them, they
    find solace in hip-hop's bosom.  (A legitimate motif on a hip-hop album?  Tell De La Soul.  Holy shit.)</p><p>
<i>A Long Hot Summer</i> merely extrapolates from Fats and Ace's relationship as Ace speaks with an earnestness
    and conviction about his life that gives his work credibility.  As the album title and the cover both suggest
    through their allusions to Spike Lee's Brooklyn of <i>Do the Right Thing</i>, Ace both complicates and
    develops his character and hometown as sites of hope and confliction.</p></div>"|5604.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5604-a-long-hot-summer/|7.1|Jamin Warren

    be the last in a long line of British bands who've grown tired of miming Radiohead and now simply aim for
    the much more imitable sound of Coldplay.  I say ""last"" because Keane's debut album, <i>Hopes and Fears</i>,
    is so miserably and calculatedly maudlin that it almost seems capable of killing the trend started by Travis
    and passed like a relay baton to Starsailor and, eventually, Snow Patrol.  Coldplaya-hatas will loathe Keane;
    most others will just be insulted.  Inexplicably, the band was recently shortlisted for the Mercury Prize.</p><p>
    Keane consists of three well-meaning guys from East Sussex: drummer Richard Hughes, pianist Tim Oxley-Rice,
    and singer Tom Chaplin.  With this limited instrumental setup, Keane ought to sound like either some bizarro-world
    version of Ben Folds Five or that pick-up band that played your cousin's wedding.  Whether those options
    would be better than what they <i>actually</i> sound like is up for debate.</p><p>
    Oxley-Rice does attempt to salvage the wreck by channeling U2 circa-""New Year's Day"".  His piano forms the
    main melodies, and combines with Hughes' drumwork to form a technically competent rhythm section.  The
    almost minimalist approach of these two could potentially have served as the foundation for a mildly
    compelling-- or at least passable-- album, one closer in spirit to the chilled-out ambience of this album's
    only not-horrible track, ""Untitled 1"".  The problem is Chaplin, who sings as though he's trying to talk you
    down from a ledge (and failing), belting out tunes with all the bombastic earnestness of James Walsh and
    Fran Healy combined, but no sense of subtlety or melody.</p><p>
    Every song on <i>Hopes and Fears</i> soars, as if winging a gossamer wind to scale the heights of heaven
    and touch the cloudy hand of God.  Across the span of 11 tracks, there are maybe 13 triumph-of-the-human-spirit
    choruses, each trying to out-uplift the previous.  ""Bend and Break"" is particularly egregious: ""If only I
    don't bend and break,"" Chaplin wails as the chorus swells to bursting, ""I'll meet you on the other side/
    I'll meet you in the light.""</p><p>
    Silly as the lyrics are, they might have more impact if every other song on <i>Hopes and Fears</i> didn't
    work the same melodramatic, soft-verse/loud-chorus template with the predictability of a bad xFC-metal band
    (or if Chaplin didn't repeat more or less the same sentiment each time). Writing such dramatic melodies
    undeniably takes talent, but putting so many of them back to back takes not only a penchant for repetitious
    banality, but a particularly rampant egotism: Not since <i>All That You Can't Leave Behind</i> has a band
    tried quite so hard to change your life.</p><p>
    It's strange, then, that Chaplin puts his own life squarely at the center of these songs-- both vocally and
    lyrically-- rarely affording consideration to anyone else, even his bandmates.  There are other people in
    these songs, but like Hughes and Oxley-Rice, they're only present as a framework for his projectile vocals,
    and to reflect his morally superior intentions or ideas about friendship, music and love.  In addition to
    nebulous notions of life and love and hazy references to ""change"" and ""the light,"" Chaplin peppers his songs
    with vague pronouns-- she, you, and it-- but I predominates.  And when he's not condescending (""I don't know
    you and I don't want you till the moment your eyes open""), he's engaging in a kind of self-centered therapy
    (""Everybody's changing and I don't feel the same"") that wears increasingly thin from the moment <i>Hopes
    and Fears</i> begins.</p><p>
    That line from ""Everybody's Changing"" is telling: For all their elitist pomposity, Keane are just bandwagon-jumpers,
    without an original thought-- or even a trace of charisma-- to save their rep.  My hope is that they'll fade
    unceremoniously into obscurity; my fear is that they'll breed still more Coldplay knockoffs, eventually
    saturating Stateside department store P.A.s with all their bloodless sobbing.  On some level, I'm optimistic
    that Keane's eighth-wave mimicry could signal the end of this particular brand of copycatting; on another, I
    know that it simply points to a future in which upstart British bands aim to sound just like Franz Ferdinand
    instead.</p></div>"|4581.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4581-hopes-and-fears/|2.8|Stephen M. Deusner

    the Second City with Los Angeles, whose sprawl at the time of the highway's establishment was just an
    abbreviated teaser for the megalopolis the city has since spawned.  Even though it only traversed a limited
    band of the country, Rte 66 was America's highway in a lot of respects, entering our popular song canon in
    the title of a standard, and bridging the open spaces of the West.  There's no question that Rte 66 was an
    engine of entrepreneurship, as every town along its course offered something to the weary traveler-- in a
    sense, the road is symbolic of the golden age of local charm in this country, before Mobil bought every
    Charlie's Gas 'n' Go in sight and when The Thing? was as much an attraction as a Six Flags is today.</p><p>
    
    Rte 66 is, of course, just another ghost wandering through America's memory now (its old side road, US Rte
    666, was recently assigned a new number by the Feds in a final act of indignity), but there are still outposts
    of that older, stranger, more charming America around drawing a curious trickle of people bored with canned
    amusement.  Pensacola's Jim White strikes me as perhaps one of those people-- the man's own story fits in
    well with the inherent transience of American road life, and his music feeds off of the Pentecostal television
    programs he took in when he was young.  White didn't get himself into a recording studio until his 40s, and
    by that time he had already spent time as a fashion model in Milan and mangled his hand in a bandsaw accident--
    and that's when he wasn't surfing for a living.</p><p>
    
    White's music is singular, constantly fluctuating between various non-genres that mostly begin with post-,
    neo- or alt-.  You can hear the white gospel of his youth dripping forward through Joe Henry's modern
    production, the record's lustrous sheen at once incongruous and oddly apropos for White's hushed poetics.
    There's an ambitious scope to this album as it traverses funky swamp folk, whispered electric ballads and
    humid country jazz, in the process conjuring that leftfield America of insane castle builders, toilet seat
    artists, Wall Drug and mystery spots as much as he captures Sunday evenings on the front porch and bluegrass
    concerts in the town square.  And yet, the unvarnished fenceposts and unpaved roads of White's Americana are
    strangely modern, informed by the glow of Mercury Rev and Sparklehorse and Harry Smith's anthology in equal
    measure.</p><p>
    
    White has enough guest musicians on this, his third album, to populate any number of small towns, and the
    likes of Bill Frisell, Aimee Mann, and M. Ward bring a varied array of voices and capabilities to the
    proceedings.  ""Combing My Hair in a Brand New Style"" is noir funk stewing gospel backing vocals in heavy
    wah pedal and muted trumpet, while ""That Girl from Brownsville, Texas"" is a whispered prayer that opens
    with a challenge to the being who might answer it: ""God, if you ain't smilin' on me/ Then you ain't no friend
    of mine.""  The song's two-tiered chorus is beautiful and fragile, as White sets up the drifting, countrified
    declaration, ""All I'm trying to do is plant those seeds of love/ With that girl from Brownsville, Texas,""
    with a seesawing melody over brushed snares and steel guitar.</p><p>
    
    On the back of the promo, someone at Luaka Bop (or maybe White himself?) wrote, ""These songs rise up out
    of a landscape of Pensacola steeples.  They haunt you out.  They know where you live at.""  That's about as
    apt a description as you might get without a minute-by-minute account of when the banjo comes in and where
    the mile-thick horn section rises up like a neon vacancy sign on the side of the interstate.  These
    meandering piles of modern synthesizers, female backing vocals, melodicas and religiously conflicted
    narratives have a way of getting inside your head, and there's something about the way White whispers,
    ""You can't waste the whole damn day,"" on ""Objects in Motion"" that just sticks with you.  In the song, he
    first finds a suitcase full of unsent love letters floating in a river, and later discovers the body of
    the girl who wrote them ""adrift beneath the surface of the cool, brown water.""</p><p>
    
    Even as White lapses into sentimentality on ""Phone Booth in Heaven"", there's a gravity to it that pulls you
    back into his head and makes it real.  And there's also the fact that you won't hear another record like it
    this year, possibly ever-- all the comparisons that can be made to Tom Waits, Lambchop, Grandaddy and Vic
    Chesnutt will only tell a small part of the story.  What all these disparate elements that White pulls
    together add up to is White's alone, a style with no real name, American as barbecue sauce on apple pie.</p></div>"|8657.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8657-drill-a-hole-in-that-substrate-and-tell-me-what-you-see/|8.1|Joe Tangari

    by retro-futurists on a budget.  His music, beyond his electro-acoustic works as part of the duo Klangkrieg,
    reflects an admiration for turn-of-the-80s German electronic music of Kraftwerk, Der Plan, Palais Schaumburg
    and the ""Neue Deutsche Welle"" (or ""German New Wave"").  He even uses similar equipment, eschewing the laptops
    and software that seem practically required in most modern electronica.  Kubin's brand of pop is loopy, yet
    straight-faced, as if ""irony"" is the furthest thing from his mind even as seriously old-school organs and
    drum machines suggest kitsch.  He's worked with fellow serious-artist-come-future-pop-practitioner Asmus
    Tietchens, and like him, places melody and traditional song structure at least as high as digital sound and
    beat manipulation.  For that reason, his music might seem quaint to people used to something more abstract.
    Then again, given his preferences for absurd imagery (google for photos of him performing in a space suit
    or dressed as a 19th Century European military officer), ""quaint"" might not be the best word for him.</p><p>
<i>Matki Wandalki</i> is Kubin's third full-length CD (including last year's <i>Tetchy Teenage Tapes</i>
    release featuring material from the early 80s begun at the ripe old age of 11), and is an almost flawless
    collection of compact, buoyant electro-pop.  It's a bit on the demented side, with bizarre synthesizer sounds,
    painstakingly tweaked in much the same manner as his influences did before the dawn of the digital age.  In
    fact, Kubin also has a background in video art, including films and even producing his own comic book, and
    this album reflects a skewed innocence; his songs (usually instrumental) are bouncy and immediately endearing,
    even as they sound better suited for some lost Richard Elfman or David Lynch short than a kiddee matinee.</p><p>
    ""Lumière Belge"" is, at over six minutes, one of the longer tracks on the album, yet like most of Kubin's
    music, seems effortlessly compact.  Furthermore, despite being produced entirely by an array of analog
    synthesizers and other proto-robotic equipment, nothing about it seems necessarily tied to the idea of
    ""electronic"" music.  That is, its faux-spy movie strains and driving rhythm could just as easily been
    arranged for a surf-rock band, or Nelson Riddle's orchestra.  Kubin, like his true ancestors Raymond Scott,
    Mort Garson and Bruce Haack, approaches electronic music as a means rather than an end, and succeeds in
    pure songcraft where most of his more overtly experimental peers fail.  ""Hissi Hissi"" is a micro-symphony
    of simple, yet typically infectious melodies.  The goofy 60s organ that carries the tune, and its ancient
    sci-fi cousins that flesh out the rest of the arrangement, is both cute and strange-- and never obscures
    the efficiency and ingenuity of Kubin's arrangement.</p><p>
    Occasionally, as on the title track and ""Hit Me, Provider"" (one of two songs featuring his vocals), Kubin
    draws upon the clipped, stylish German techno similar to that of Ellen Allien and the Bpitch roster, though
    decidedly less concerned with the dancefloor than spaz for its own sake.  Apparently, Kubin's idea of dance
    music is winding up his drum machine as fast as it will go, and setting his synths to stun (check the laser
    beam melody on ""Hit Me"", and dare yourself to turn it up).  Of course, style isn't really his game, as the
    Lionel Richie cover will attest, but part of the charm of <i>Matki Wandalki</i> is that it exists so
    completely in a world of its own that it's beside the point to draw comparisons to contemporary scenes.
    Kubin is one of the few true originals in music, electronica or otherwise, and he's at his best here.</p></div>"|4582.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4582-matki-wandalki/|8.1|Dominique Leone

    creative effort's lasting worth; we judge artists by what they've contributed to the ideological advancement
    of a genre, leading us to dismiss that which seems derivative.  Then again, no movement or scene can exist
    without prominent imitators.  Take the show <i>Survivor</i>.  Sure, America was captivated by the wacky
    day-to-day exploits of Richard, Rudy, and the gang, but it's the show's multitude of lesser imitators that
    have led ""reality TV"" as a whole to topple the sitcom and sit atop the throne of nighttime entertainment
    supreme.  So it goes in the music world.  Hip-hop could never have existed as a movement had anyone given
    pioneers like Grandmaster Flash too much creative breathing space.  It's imitation that turns the fancies
    of a few into the parameters of a genre.</p><p>
    
    From Passage's first entrance on his solo release, <i>The Forcefield Kids</i>, in which he bursts out with
    rapid-fire free association and triplet rhythms tumbling into suspended tones, the influence of fellow
    Anticon artists Doseone, Why?, and Sole is apparent.  As a member of original outfit Restiform Bodies,
    Passage's MCing has generally maintained a level tone, trading off lyrical bursts with musical interludes.
    Here, his nearly constant narration slips from conversational speech to distorted rant, bratty child to
    British dignitary, all territories previously explored by other Anticon MCs.  The striking affinity with
    Clouddead in Passage's sudden acoustic guitar sections and nasal harmonies is hard to ignore.  But whether
    Passage exists as their peer, or as the first in a generation of imitators, is up for debate, and it's a
    matter of taste whether the similarities turn you off or get you psyched for the hip-hop revolution.</p><p>
    
    Anticon has always flirted heavily with the term hip-hop, and though its artists and critics both balk at
    the genre label outright, few deny its influence.  Apart from Passage's singsong MCing, the most hip-hop
    aspect of his music is the prominence of the collage.  Everything about <i>The Forcefield Kids</i>, from
    music to lyrics to cover art, delivers a jumbled mess of conjoined ideas, where anything is up for grabs
    and genre divisions are defied as readily as sentence structure.  Passage programs his sawtooth synths over
    minimal drum machine snares or breakbeat bursts, placing him on the aggressive end of Anticon's output.
    The stark contrasts of images and styles combined with the musical assault give the impression of Passage
    as an ADD-addled teen in a room full of keyboards and samplers, letting loose the ravings of his sugar-soaked
    subconscious.</p><p>
    
    These impressions are reinforced in Passage's lyrics.  Though he explores similar absurdist/surrealist realms
    as Doseone, Passage's jumbles of thoughts and impressions tend to be less linearly coherent in phrasing, and
    more reminiscent of beat poetry, as he addresses general topics through the course of each song.  Delivered
    with a proclamatory urgency, the streams of free association contain fantastical imagery mixed with the
    sneer of teenage nihilism-- apocalyptic prophesies (""Emergency broadcast's a grim infomercial, but listen
    closely for the great big, final school cancellation""), rebellion against the modern world (""We watch saints
    of popularity, rain thin snack on their hollow legs"") and misogynistic tendencies (""Women are funny, they're
    almost like people"").  Though he offers many clever phrases and striking images (""DaVinci twists the valves
    to move the gasses round in Reagan's chest""), he just as often comes across as intentionally cryptic.</p><p>
<i>The Forcefield Kids</i> is a good album, and comes close to being something better.  Anticon is quickly
    growing from a collection of artists into a style all its own, and Passage is still in a position of
    opportunity to expand it.  He seems to be staking out his territory as the Nintendo-damaged suburban youth
    of Anticon's roster, but while everything's in place for his character to flourish, his delivery is still
    incomplete in development.  Passage's future releases that will determine whether he's a parameter-shifting
    performer of Anticon, or just a forgotten sidenote.</p></div>"|6546.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6546-the-forcefield-kids/|6.6|Liam Singer

    things written in America's bathroom stalls.  In Utah, I was treated to a prolonged ode regarding Outkast's
    Andre 3000; in Missouri, a piece of political discourse ranging from an intricate dissection of John Kerry's
    foreign policy record to ""nuke 'em all.""  And on a women's stall in an Iowa bar (I'm not a perv, the men's
    was being used), I found that someone had scrawled a line from Neutral Milk hotel's ""Song Against Sex"":
    ""Don't take those pills your boyfriend gave you, you're too wonderful to die.""</p><p>
    
    That Neutral Milk Hotel have become stall-quotable is emblematic of the place they occupy in the hearts of
    their fans.  Everybody has music that encapsulates their past, and for an increasing number of listeners,
    it's the music of the more established independent labels-- Merge, Sub Pop, Matador, or K-- that helped
    them discover a world of indie culture and define an identity during their formative years.</p><p>
    
    Neutral Milk Hotel's ""Song Against Sex"" is the first song on Merge's 15th year compilation <i>Old Enough 2
    Know Better</i>, a massive 3xCD set offering both a look at the label's long run and a collection of new
    tracks.  The cover art, by David Horvath, features a happy world of wee little counterparts to Radiohead's
    fierce, sobbing creatures, reflecting the general sentiment of the label's condensed sound.  Being given a
    chance to hear so many Merge artists in once place, I was struck by how noticeably friendly the aesthetic
    is-- positivity courses through this collection's veins.  And though Merge's niche was built on the
    fundamental indie pop sound, hints of backward-looking folk and country also pepper the collection, making
    the label seem equally a refuge for singer/songwriters born in the wrong decade.</p><p>
<i>Old Enough</i> abides by the same format as most compilations of its type, aiming to give newcomers a
    representative overview of the label's span, introduce casual acquaintances to more obscure artists in the
    roster, and give devoted fans something new.  The first two discs comprise the retrospective, filled with
    popular songs that haven't been too played-out over the years-- usually solid tracks off artists' more
    overlooked albums, such as ""Long Vermont Roads"" from The Magnetic Fields' <i>The Charm of the Highway Strip</i>.
    Disc One is a little more raw, featuring the likes of Buzzcocks' ""Jerk"" and Polvo's excellent ""Tragic Carpet
    Ride"", while the second showcases subdued sounds in the varied orchestration of The Ladybug Transistor or
    singalong pop of The Essex Green.  It takes us in no particular order from Versus, Spoon, and, of course,
    Superchunk, to the new generation of acts like M. Ward and Destroyer, who are now filling the void left by
    the since-disbanded groups on which the label built its rep.</p><p>
    
    As excellent as the retrospective is, fans and obsessive completists alike will be purchasing this collection
    mainly for Disc Three: 19 tracks of various rarities and unreleased songs.  The contributions are almost
    uniformly excellent, and nobody ought to be disappointed.  M. Ward's ""One More Goodbye"" is, as you might
    expect, a jangly piece of pretty and wistful folk, while Spoon covers Yo La Tengo's ""Decora"" in a markedly
    Spoony style of call-and-response guitar and bass.  The disc also indicates the expanding variety of
    influences represented in Merge's sound-- Richard Bruckner's orchestral country ballad ""Dogwood"" provides
    a striking interlude, as does Crooked Fingers' Spanish ballad ""La Maleta Fea"".</p><p>
    
    Though it's probably not the mix that any one person would compile, this collection comes as close as such
    an effort can to pleasing all of the people all of the time (especially at the price of one CD).  As the
    joke of the title <i>Old Enough 2 Know Better</i> is borne in mixing a wizened grumble with IM-speak, so
    does the compilation manage to evoke simultaneous nostalgia, discovery, and excitement for the future.
    Still, it does strike me as just a little scary to think that 30 years from now, the oldies stations might
    be playing the Merge catalog for a bunch of black-clad grandparents with star tattoos and vintage-vintage
    cowboy shirts, driving down the road and scrawling Neutral Milk Hotel lyrics in rest stops and bars as
    they see fit.</p></div>"|1931.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1931-old-enough-2-know-better/|8.1|Liam Singer

    says the All-Music Guide.  That seems reasonable, although I suspect Brian Eno might take issue with the
    notion that his music is somehow unconcerned with composition.  As with most musical definitions (and music
    itself), perception is key; if it seems as if the composer was unconcerned with traditional methods of
    writing music, it becomes helpful to think of the music being similarly ""unconcerned.""</p><p>
    
    Of course, that definition isn't helpful.  Is ambient ""spacious?""  Not if you're in the way of one of Toshi
    Nakamura's hyper-compact sine waves.  Is it electronic?  Not if you listen to one of those old Ligeti
    micro-polyphonal pieces-- or if you stick your head out of a window and listen to the wind and people and
    cars.  Is it concerned with sonic texture?  Absolutely, just as Britney Spears' producers are on ""Toxic"".
    Is it unconcerned with songwriting?  I suppose that depends on whether or not the composers are writing
    ""songs""-- and still more on whether or not you hear them as songs, or care one way or the other.  Eno helped
    invent something, but it wasn't a form of music.  At best, it was a form of music journalism, and a
    shortsighted one at that.</p><p>
<i>The Equatorial Stars</i> is the third collaboration between Eno and Fripp, and the first in almost 30
    years.  Both men made their names not as experimental music technicians and academics, but as well-mannered
    revolutionaries in two of the most important bands of the 1970s.  Eno's Roxy Music and Fripp's King Crimson--
    however far apart their eventual fanbases grew-- were, at one time, two sides of the same coin.  They offered
    ""art"" (with a small ""a"") music to people who'd grown up believing Art (with a big one) had no place in rock
    'n' roll.  They offered art to a culture shown the finer things in life by The Beatles, Andy Warhol and J.D.
    Salinger, one that would fall in love with the notion that the only way to move on was to destroy the past
    and its idols.  Fripp and Eno were not punks in usual sense, but they understood the best way to generate
    interest at the time was to ignore the past-- especially the immediate past.</p><p>
    
    That said, their actual, physical innovations were few.  ""Frippertronics,"" the recording method invented on
    1973's <i>No Pussyfooting</i>, involved a tape-loop system wherein a single reel of tape is physically joined
    together at the ends and then run continuously between the outermost reels of two adjacent decks, the first
    of which records incoming sound and the second of which plays it back.  Eno demonstrated this to Fripp, and
    the first recorded result was ""The Heavenly Music Corporation"" from <i>No Pussyfooting</i>-- it is indeed
    the ""spacious, electronic"" music described in the All-Music Guide.  Fripp took some pride in the unorthodox
    nature of this piece, and to his and Eno's credit, it didn't really sound like anything that had come before
    it.  Whether or not that constitutes a new genre is debatable-- especially because few (if any) other musicians
    have done much else with Frippertronics.  Even Eno's ambient records, sharing much with earlier efforts by
    Germany's Cluster and Tangerine Dream, don't sound like his collaborations with Fripp.</p><p>
    
    Nor does <i>The Equatorial Stars</i> sound like <i>No Pussyfooting</i> or the pair's 1975 follow-up
    <i>Evening Star</i>.  On the surface, it does nearly equal their effuse beauty, with airy synthesizer
    textures and hints of melody.  However, its use of Frippertronics is subtler, and I don't hear the
    Zen-like simplicity of, say, Eno's <i>Music for Airports</i>, or the classical deconstruction of his
    <i>Discreet Music</i>.  Instead, I hear cloudy, vague music, as if the pair invested too much in their
    own reviews over the years, believing ambience required a lack of planning or composition.  Yet, I also
    hear an alien beauty, and real grace, the kind that only comes after years of succeeding, failing and
    succeeding again.  And these pieces reveal themselves not when you are preoccupied-- allowing the
    ""unobtrusive"" to fill in spaces where you need them, ignoring them elsewhere-- but when you let them
    actively pilot daydreams.  If ambient is supposed to be passive music, Fripp and Eno make something
    different.  Perhaps passive/aggressive ambience, where we're given the impression that our minds could
    wander, but in reality we're being directed into varying degrees of mysticism.</p><p>
    
    The faintly glitchy ""Meissa"" (each song is named for a star) is melancholy and wet.  Fripp's guitar outlines
    fragmented melodies, strung together only by the reverb that bathes the arrangement.  He wanders into the
    lowest register of his instrument, only to wind his way upward again with the lackadaisical trajectory of
    a raindrop on glass, following the path of least resistance.  He also sounds more straightforwardly pretty
    than I've heard from him in decades; recent bouts of metal fetishism with King Crimson haven't affected his
    ability to craft delicate, assured lines.</p><p>
    
    Eno's job is to provide the transparently lush backdrop, as he does better than practically anyone in the
    world.  Here (and on the erotic impressionism of ""Lyra""), he uses dim rhythmic elements, such as a loop of
    Fripp playing arpeggios, or a stuttering harmonic pinch, to simulate movement while major-chord synth drone
    hardens like skin on a dead pond, too far in the distance to suggest stasis.  Yet when Eno provides straight
    beats, as on ""Altair"", he threatens to turn the music into New Age.  Fripp's atonal chord clusters that rise
    like breaking surf aren't enough to obscure the tentative, colorless funk beat and his own chicken scratch
    strum (a first?).</p><p>
    
    Several pieces are entirely devoid of rhythm, and are similar to the post-Eno/Cluster sound design of The
    Hafler Trio and Richard Chartier.  ""Ankaa"" mixes sparse solo lines from Fripp with blurred, spacey synth
    textures and the occasional ebb of deep, bassy pull.  ""Terebellum"" is less lush, but more engaging if only
    because it favors higher tones and more overt dissonance-- compare with The Hafler Trio's <i>Normally</i>
    from this year for a study in extended tension.  Eno's production is warmer than that of his younger,
    digitally trained descendents, and surprisingly consistent with his 70s efforts.  I'd argue it is also
    less imaginatively detailed, but with this music, that isn't so much a crime as artistic license.  Ultimately,
    <i>The Equatorial Stars</i> is direct, engaging and modestly unsettling.  No context required.</p></div>"|3318.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3318-the-equatorial-stars/|7.8|Dominique Leone

    student in ornithology, a pursuit that seems to inform and almost define his music.  For instance, a
    shearwater is a type of bird that flies close to the water's surface, and its namesake band plays songs
    that skim immense emotions and often push towards soaring climaxes.  Fittingly, Shearwater's third album
    is entitled <i>Winged Life</i>, which refers to a William Blake verse but could easily title Meiburg's
    biography.</p><p>
    Former Kingfisher frontman Meiburg co-founded the band with Okkervil River's Will Sheff in 1999 and released
    the starkly atmospheric <i>The Dissolving Room</i> in 2001.  For 2002's <i>Everybody Makes Mistakes</i>,
    they added bassist Kim Burke and percussionist Thor Harris.  <i>Winged Life</i> boasts an even more lush,
    orchestrated sound that incorporates banjo, pedal steel, violin, and programmed percussion.  Its
    music is not quite as quirky as Okkervil River, although its songs are similarly hymnlike.  It's only a
    few shades lighter than the pitch-dark Americana of Pinetop Seven, although Meiburg and Sheff, like Darren
    Richards, approach lyrics with a storyteller's eye, allowing the music to bring out the tone of the words.</p><p>
    Taking to heart Joan Didion's assertion that ""we tell ourselves stories in order to live,"" Meiburg and Sheff
    write story-songs that feel like life-or-death situations even though they usually only document life's
    incessant mundanities-- no big events, just gentle realizations.  Sheff especially is more interested in
    missed opportunities and crippling inaction than in actual events: On the standout ""A Makeover"", he sings
    about a man who undergoes a conversion, only to revert to his old self disappointingly quickly: ""And in
    three weeks his new leaf has rubbed away and it feels just like an average day.""</p><p>
    On the somber ""Wedding Bells Are Breaking Up That Old Gang of Mine"", Meiburg ponders the loss of rambunctious
    youth among himself and his friends.  But he never comes across as indulgent or whiny, just a bit awkward and
    sadly wistful as he realizes, ""I'm the only one, at the top of my lungs, who's still singing sweet adelines.""
    He addresses a similar lament in ""The World in 1984"".  In two concise scenes, one with his WWII veteran
    grandfather and another with his mother, he realizes how much has changed in 20 years and how much has been
    lost, but as his mother tells him, ""Kid, you're lucky to be alive.""  Meiburg and Sheff may share songwriting
    credits and singing duties, but moments like these, along with the avian themes, prove that Shearwater pursues
    Meiburg's vision like a homing pigeon.</p><p>
    Unfortunately, not all these story-songs carry the emotional impact Shearwater grasp for, sometimes proving
    too hollow-boned to bear the weight. On ""My Good Deed"", a man leaves his lover, thinking he knows what's
    best for her; it's a scenario that's either classic or clichéd, depending on your point of view, but for
    a recent example, the book and movie <i>The Notebook</i> hinges creakily on the same predicament.  It's the
    music that saves the song: ""My Good Deed"" fades out with an open-air coda rich with thick organ and ascending
    bells.</p><p>
    When the lyrics begin to drag, Shearwater-- especially Harris and Burke-- redeem the album with a lush sound
    full of gentle surprises-- like the pop-song chorus of ""(I've Got a) Right to Cry"" and the ascending guitar
    lines on ""St. Mary's Walk""-- that nicely compliment Meiburg's fluttery vocals.  Such flourishes make <i>Winged
    Life</i> more than just an Okkervil River side project (as previous efforts arguably were); Shearwater's years
    of dedication and hard work have established them as a solid group in their own right.</p></div>"|7103.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7103-winged-life/|7.5|Stephen M. Deusner

Those bands just aren't trying hard enough: Michigan's
    Volebeats have just released a new full-length to make the wait for their official follow-up to 2000's
    <i>Mosquito Spiral</i> a little more bearable for fans.  Comprised of a few rarities, some new studio tracks
    and six broadly ranging covers, <i>Country Favorites</i> really only lives up to the first half of its title.
    Still, the originals are mostly strong, and a few of the covers work surprisingly well when recast as
    old-time country pop tunes.  The old-time specification is important for The Volebeats-- their brand of
    country harks back to the genre's golden age in the 1950s and 60s, with none of the nauseating sheen or
    gimmicky lyrics of contemporary countrypolitan material.</p><p>
    
    The record opens with a take on the 13th Floor Elevators' ""I Had to Tell You"", tastefully arranged with
    steel guitar and Jeff Oakes' natural twang.  For a country band with well-known indie rock sensibilities,
    this isn't really a surprising choice, and their interpretation of the York Brothers' ""Hamtramck Mama""
    (named for the Michigan town in which the band formed) is also a natural.  On their other covers, The
    Volebeats reach outside their core sound, taking a lovely stroll through Abba's ""Knowing Me, Knowing You"",
    which is full of heavily reverberating and lower register guitar lines straight out of an old trucker ballad.
    They also make what could have been a ridiculous cover of Slayer's ""Die by the Sword"" somewhat credible,
    slowing it way down and turning it into a sort of Camper Van Beethoven tribute.</p><p>
    
    Serge Gainsbourg's ""Manon"" doesn't fare quite as well in its C&amp;W; surroundings as most of the other covers--
    French with a twang just doesn't really sound right-- but The Volebeats hold their own on a heavily condensed
    version of Funkadelic's ""Maggot Brain"".  It's difficult to imagine anyone approaching the sheer cathartic
    power of the original's blistering Eddie Hazel guitar solo, but The Volebeats' woven pedal steel and big,
    ringing electrics manage to pay surprising respect.  It's a radical reinterpretation of the raw source
    material and a mournful, irony-free outpouring that serves as the emotional crux of the disc.</p><p>
    
    The Volebeats have three well-developed songwriters (Matthew Smith, Jeff Oakes and Bob McCreedy)-- each of
    whom has a very distinct style-- which always bodes well for their original material.  Oakes' ""One I Love""
    is a classic big-reverb country shuffle: His twangy tenor subtly harmonizes with guest Erika Hoffmann and
    the guitar twangs with that huge Angelo Badalamenti sound. Bob McCreedy gets three songs in this batch, the
    best of which is ""Hold On"", with its swaying chorus, swinging bassline and Byrdsy solos.  His other two
    contributions, ""318"" and ""Too Much Love"", don't really get going until their respective choruses, with the
    arid ""318"" actually sounding a bit out of place amidst the disc's wide-open sound.</p><p>
    
    Smith's songs are the truly odd ducks, though.  His best writing has a timeless melancholy and a melodic
    sensibility straight out of the songwriting factories of the 1960s, and his voice has a twang-free smoothness
    that sounds great floating in the reverb of ""Standing Next to You"" with the swelling steel guitar.  Smith's
    songs are so well tailored to his voice that it seems odd that Oakes sings his other song, ""Almost Crying"".
    I could hear Outrageous Cherry, Smith's other band, making this ballad devastating, but here it's not quite
    as powerful as it could be.</p><p>
    
    On the whole, <i>Country Favorites</i> is an effective grab bag, but don't expect the coherence of an album--
    that's something for which Volebeats fans are going to have to wait.  For now, those fans will want to get
    their hands on this, while others will reap greater rewards checking out The Volebeats' best proper albums--
    <i>Up North</i>, <i>The Sky and the Ocean</i> or <i>Mosquito Spiral</i>, the latter exploring their pop
    tendencies more fully than any of their other releases.</p></div>"|8534.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8534-country-favorites/|6.9|Joe Tangari

Forget
    the closed-circuits and dishes that only catch electromagnetic rain with proper positioning and decoders;
    radio is powerful because, with the right kind of tuner, you always can connect with somebody, somewhere.
    Shortwave radio has an even more remarkable omnipresence.  It works by reflecting between the
    ionosphere and the earth's surface, allowing signals to travel over curved surfaces and bounce from
    continent to continent, and its band is filled with unfamiliar voices and music from the world over.</p><p>
    
    Shortwave radio hams speak of the unexplained phenomenon of ""numbers stations.""  These mysterious broadcasts
    contain seemingly random chunks of repeating data-- usually a lone voice reading a string of numbers or
    letters, but sometimes it's simply electronic tones or bits of music.  It is generally understood (though
    never formerly acknowledged) that numbers stations are encrypted messages broadcast by various governments
    for some unknown purpose-- most likely espionage.  They may be instructions to undercover agents in the
    field (the CIA, MOSSAD, KGB, and so on), and involve commands encoded and decoded according to an understood
    key.</p><p>
<i>The Conet Project</i> is a collection of numbers stations recordings first issued in the late 90s and
    now officially back in print.  Its blip of mainstream notoriety came when Wilco sampled a track from the
    set (a woman's voice intoning ""yankee... hotel... foxtrot..."") for the closing moments of ""Poor Places"",
    providing the title for Wilco's best-known album.  <i>The Conet Project</i> is an unusual collection to
    say the least.  It's extremely long (four discs), expensive, and contains insanely thorough documentation--
    the 70-page booklet assumes a working knowledge of cryptography lingo, and explains why shortwave is such
    a secure and efficient medium for exchange of encrypted information.  Of course, something about preserving
    this stuff on CD seems anachronistic in light of current technology-- people trade numbers stations recordings
    by CD-R and share them online-- but if the jury is out on <i>The Conet Project</i> as a commercial product,
    there is certainly much here to enjoy.</p><p>
    
    First, even when stripped of the important political context, these CDs are interesting on a purely textural
    level.  Anyone inured to the sonic pleasures of imperfect technology will find a lot to love in these extremely
    low fidelity recordings, which were packed tightly to travel halfway around the world and remain intelligible
    on the receiving end.  Voices sound pinched and claustrophobic forced into the narrow band of the medium,
    and each sound carries with a layer of distortion.  A slight but delicious warble is constantly present,
    an effect more pronounced when music or electronic tones (great primitive synth sounds abound) take over
    the voices.  And every broadcast is carried along on a thick shag carpet of hum, buzz and crackle.  If you
    enjoy listening to recordings from the first 15 years of the space program-- those stony all-American voices
    amid all that static, each transmission punctuated with the electronic beep-- then <i>The Conet Project</i>
    has obvious appeal.</p><p>
    
    And then there are the voices.  Steve Reich is inspired by the musicality of human speech (""Come Out"",
    ""It's Gonna Rain"", ""Different Trains""), and <i>The Conet Project</i> provides a lot of raw material.
    There are dozens of them here, in as many tongues as you can imagine, working through sequences of numbers
    and letters with heavy repetition.  Some of the broadcasts are either tape loops or some kind of triggered
    sample, others seem to be read ""live.""  The cumulative effect is hypnotic.</p><p>
    
    Once you've absorbed the sound and let the imagined content of these broadcasts sink in, <i>The Conet
    Project</i> moves from interesting to fascinating.  Remember why these broadcasts allegedly exist: to
    instruct people to do harm.  Even if espionage is in service of an ultimate good, the details of the
    enterprise involve deception, betrayal, and occasionally, violence.  Knowing that these unnervingly
    dispassionate voices, reading endless streams of random numbers aloud, carry within them ""plain text""
    messages about assassination, terrorism-- you name it-- is creepy, voyeuristic and exhilarating.  It's
    an unblinking call for conspiracy, the paranoia of the Cold War boiled down to its essence.  This is the
    station tuned in by Bobby Fisher's silver fillings when he's having one of his ""bad days,"" and that's
    what the boys from Wilco heard.  That voice in ""Poor Places"" is the black box inside the crashing plane,
    holding the clues to why things went so desperately wrong.</p></div>"|2051.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2051-the-conet-project/|8.0|Mark Richardson

    2001, three of its members-- Jim Ward, Paul Hinojos and Tony Hajjar-- apparently still had some seething
    rhetoric to spew.  So they recruited Belknap bassist Matt Miller and formed Sparta, a band whose anxious,
    epic guitar rock maintains ATDI's twitchy prog-punk aesthetic while standardizing some of that group's more
    esoteric algorithms for mass consumption and heightened accessibility-- Byzantine art-punk cathedrals with
    wheelchair ramps.</p><p>
    Sparta continue to tread the thin line between ""authentic"" punk (compared to most of what passes for punk
    on the radio, Sparta absolutely rages) and ""commercial"" punk (they're on a major label, receive limited MTV
    exposure, and tour with Incubus) that drives a certain stripe of staunch, conflicted indie purist mad.
    Sparta's sophomore LP, <em>Porcelain</em>, doesn't extend the sound of the band's debut so much as inflate
    it.  <i>Porcelain</i> is grandiose and questing, with scintillating, spacious atmospheres and rangy,
    confident songs that sometimes break the six-minute barrier.  It's ziggurat-rock, decadent and Babylonian.
    But while the band's music has intensified since 2002's <i>Wiretap Scars</i>, the lyrics have retracted
    into frugal, open forms.  These verbal Rorschach blots forgo literal substance in favor of pithy evocation--
    they could be about girls or capitalism or hating school, depending on your interpretation and/or
    psychological needs.</p><p>
    Sparta believes that more is more, but their colossal sound is sleek and streamlined, never sludgy.  Rock
    comes in all shapes and sizes; Sparta's is equivalent to a boulder flung from a catapult-- monolithic and
    daunting, yet swift and aerodynamic.  <em>Porcelain</em> opens with ""Guns of Memorial Park"", an S.O.S. tapped
    out in Morse code echoing urgent, cyclical guitar and alternating, fuzzed-out bass tones. The drums lock
    as if they're literally beating back a standard-bearing army of vocals and guitars that threaten to breach
    the castle keep.  The shout-along chorus and hectic swarm of ""Hiss the Villain"" evoke classic Hüsker Dü with
    a heavy coat of varnish.</p><p>
    ""While Oceana Sleeps"" is a standout.  With its tinkling harmonics, melodic bass, detonating chorus and
    plaintive vocal performance, it recalls (not for the only time on this record) the arctic sonic waters
    sailed by The Appleseed Cast.  ""Lines in Sand"" is made exceptionally lovely by the chaos around it: It's
    a richly detailed, burbling soundscape that cascades in waves of quietude and release-- a nerve-soothing
    Coldplay moment amid the edgier histrionics.</p><p>
    There's one sticking point I've yet to address: Is Sparta <em>emo</em>?  At the Drive-In was often labeled
    as such, but any genre that lays claim to both Pedro the Lion and At the Drive-In obviously has some
    semantic kinks to work out.  ""Emo,"" as a genre signifier, should apply to the stripe of music that can
    make a 12-part harmony sound thin and reedy, with shopworn hardcore progressions arpeggiated into anonymity,
    and lyrics that prey on the malleable emotions of teenagers (pacesetter: New Found Glory).  Sparta, on the
    other hand, sound positively huge: The arrangements are complex and inventive, and the lyrics are too
    oblique to wind up in anyone's slam book.</p><p>
    Besides, most music transmits <i>some</i> sort of emotion
    (like, is Ghostface Killah emo?), and if the term that designates any emotional music has <em>taken on
    negative connotations</em>, as ""emo"" has to some, then one gets the squirmy feeling that we truly have
    entered the much-ballyhooed ""post-human age.""  That, of course, is mere food for thought; <em>Porcelain</em>
    is food for sheer bodily exaltation.  It's an imperative and ornate exhortation to lay open your nerves
    and unabashedly, unapologetically feel.</p></div>"|7405.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7405-porcelain/|7.6|Brian Howe

    any good?<p>
<li> ""no-wave"" (genre): The stunted strand of noise music/performance art where amateurs played fast,
    disjointed jerks of songs with no development, making vulgar and even physical assaults on audiences
    who would've settled for being spat on.  Immortalized as much for how quickly it burned out as for how
    many bands it still influences, no-wave is mostly remembered by a single milestone, <i>No New York</i>,
    produced by Brian Eno, who picked the four bands that had the best names: James Chance &amp; The Contortions,
    Teenage Jesus &amp; The Jerks, Mars, and DNA.<p>
<li> All of DNA's studio tracks and a handful of live ones are here, even the four songs from <i>No New York</i>.
    Everyone refers to <i>No New York</i> as one of the great out-of-print albums, but if you look around, you
    can buy it on CD for about $40.  But that would be really stupid.<p>
<li> Damn, Francis Crick just died.<p>
<li> People joke that if you've heard one DNA song, you've heard them all, but you really need at least two:
    one with keyboardist Robin Lee Crutchfield, and another with his vastly more capable replacement, Pere Ubu
    bassist Tim Wright.<p>
<li> Robin Crutchfield, writing on his website about one of his first gigs, in 1976 at a performance art
    festival: ""I mapped out a perimeter on the Floyd Bennett airfield runway with a stick of chalk and took
    several objects including a toy piano and a blanket with me to live in a self-imposed cage like an asylum
    inmate for the day.  'The Death of Sparrow Hart' was a persona I took on, part bird, part autistic child,
    dancing and sobbing and pecking at the piano, hiding under a blanket and so on.""<p>
<li> The single biggest reason to revisit DNA is noise savant Arto Lindsay.  Lindsay chicken-chokes his guitar,
    splintering notes and shattering chords like windows falling out of a skyscraper.  He cracks his vocals like
    a bullwhip, then garbles his lyrics with the patience of dry heaving.  ""Get out of here/ Go fuck yourself,""
    he moans, then sticks his head back in the bowl.<p>
<li> When a woman suffers a miscarriage, a common cause is genetic damage: The egg and sperm unite but the
    DNA combines incorrectly, causing chromosomal damage that is too severe to allow the fetus to come to
    term.  Children who are born with mental retardation also suffer genetic irregularities, but landed right
    at the threshold where the damage did not prevent them from coming to term.<p>
<li> Going off the tracklist here, Blonde Redhead could've just named themselves Egomaniac's Kiss instead.<p>
<li> Drummer Ikue Mori can't or won't lock in with anybody.  Her frantic cymbal-bashing works better than when
    she tries to keep the beat-- which is fine, since the rhythms are numbing.  As for when she pounds out a
    tribal tattoo, if you were sacrificing your daughter to a volcano and Mori were the best drummer you could
    hire for the ceremony, you'd really feel like an asshole.<p>
<li> Crutchfield on how they got Mori on drums: ""Arto wanted her to be our drummer.  I was reluctant, for a
    number of reasons.  The first was that she had played violin and had no experience on drums.  The second
    was that she didn't own any drums.  The third was that she didn't speak enough English for us to communicate
    and manage to build a 20 minute set of songs in less than 30 days.  And the fourth was that her visa was
    expiring and she was planning to leave the country...  She did have one thing going for her.  She was
    interested in working with us.""<p>
<li> Is it true that no-wave bands couldn't play their instruments?  With the benefit of hindsight, you can
    figure out who had talent and who just had attitude, but no-wave is still remembered as a lost oasis of
    committed, crippling unprofessionalism, of a simpler time when making inept noise with gusto actually
    could shake someone-- except of course, how inept could it be if it's still worth listening to on a
    record, in your living room?<p>
<li> Lindsay and Mori later worked with cult composer and improviser John Zorn, for example in the ""game
    improvisation"" <i>Cobra</i>, where Zorn herded his groups through painfully elaborate rules to produce
    music that sounds even uglier than this stuff.  The nerdification of noise music suggests that for all
    the posturing and the awareness of posturing that surrounded no-wave, the downtown scenesters really lost
    something when it just became ""skronk.""<p>
<li> Lindsay et al had the sense to kill the project instead of developing it.  Arto Lindsay went on to become
    a fine singer and guitarist, and when he isn't playing extreme improv, he records beautiful albums of
    Brazilian pop.<p>
<li> Meanwhile, Mori switched to drum machine.</li></p></li></p></li></p></li></p></li></p></li></p></li></p></li></p></li></p></li></p></li></p></li></p></li></p></li></p></li></p></div>"|2568.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2568-dna-on-dna/|8.1|Chris Dahlen

While the successes of 50 Cent and Joe Budden prove that mixtapes
    are often exceptionally effective means of publicity, these compilations are never held to the same standards
    as full albums.  Poor production, thematic inconsistencies, and shouting DJs (""DJ CLUE-CLUE-CLUE!!  NEW SHIT!!"")
    plague the mixtape medium, and as such, the tapes are better served as public sparring grounds than as
    career-defining releases.</p><p>
    So why bother reviewing the mixtape of Tribe's other member, Consequence, well after his apex on <i>Beats,
    Rhymes, Life</i>?  Well, maybe some of us wanted to know what Kanye West does on the weekends, when he's
    not milling Jesus-faced bling.  In a move reminiscent of the Puff Daddy parasitism of the mid-90s, Kanye
    West has assumed the lucrative tripartite role of rapper, publicist, and/or producer for every artist he
    works with.  He even commissions his artists-in-training for cameo appearances on any other project that
    falls in his lap (check cohort John Legend's background appearances on Jay-Z's ""Encore"", Talib's ""Get-By""
    and Dilated Peoples' ""This Way"").</p><p>
    Kanye West had been a major player on the mix circuit well before the release of his <i>College Dropout</i>
    album early this year, and he still favors the medium for dropping exclusive remixes and one-offs.  It's
    win/win for all involved: West maintains a fresh public façade, and his Kon Man Crew is given the chance
    to shine.  <i>Take 'Em to the Cleaners</i> may be listed as a Consequence release, but Cons plays a far
    smaller role here than that implies.  This is really West's album: He designed the set, assigned the parts,
    and wrote the play.</p><p>
<i>Cleaners</i> opens with Kanye at his kick/snare-popping best on ""So Soulful"", his best off-Rocafella
    production to date.  From its Jackson 5 guitar loop to John Legend's pleasant peripherals to Consequence's
    percolating flow, the track brims with the energy and effervescence of a late-summer classic.  And when
    ""Soulful""'s momentum fades during the two following tracks, Cons and company come back hard with the
    perilously talent-stuffed ""Wack Niggas"", a long-time staple of West's mixtapes that shows the multifaceted
    talents of Kanye, Common, Talib Kweli, and Cons meshing beautifully, throwing punches at fake thugs in
    Chrysler Sebrings over vaudevillian horns and tip-toeing strings.</p><p>
    Especially in contrast to Kanye's solid, idiosyncratic production, Consequence seems wary of his talents.
    It's not that West is relegating Cons to the sidelines; rather, Cons benches himself.  On ""Yard 2 Yard"",
    he cracks: ""Moved from a never-quite-was to an overnight-buzz/ 'Cuz the way I flip a metaphor, nobody
    quite does,"" yet rarely makes any real attempt to support this claim (let alone to establish himself as
    the marquee performer).  Other times, he just embarrasses himself: Check the off-key warbling and questionable
    refrain of ""Trains"": ""You should be my queen/ But the only thing I can do is treat you like a slut.""</p><p>
    Thankfully, Consequence does provide at least a brief glimpse of his ability.  While he only manages to
    trade two stanzas with Little Brother's Big Pooh on the 9th Wonder-produced album highlight ""I See Now"",
    his catcalls are surprisingly slick: ""It's like a college degree when you're following me/ Without the
    entry level job, just a modeling fee.""  Two of the better cuts also prove to be safer territory for
    Consequence, who gives confident performances over a snappy adaptation of Souls of Mischief's ""'93 'Til
    Infinity"" and the Tribe re-release ""The Consequence"", featuring Con's cousin Q-Tip.  Despite this apparent
    identity crisis, however, Consequence legitimately shines against the chirping flutes on ""And You Say"",
    intimating his former glory as ATCQ's junior member.</p><p>
    In the end, these flashes of lyrical finesse are all the more frustrating: Even after an entire Consequence
    album, we still don't know who we're listening to.  <i>Take 'Em to the Cleaners</i> is less of a breakout
    for Kanye's sidekick than a draft of his potential success, and another stitch in Kanye's red bear sweater.
    If and/or when Quence's major label solo debut is ever released (it's been tied up in the record industry's
    Red Tape District for almost a decade), it should be interesting to see if he can prove his height when he's
    not standing on Kanye's shoulders.</p></div>"|1772.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1772-take-em-to-the-cleaners/|7.0|Jamin Warren

Múm: childlike!
    Beguiling, like cute insects with laptops!  And Sigur Rós: Chilling!  Instant transport to the lichen plains
    of their native land!  While all of that's sort of true, Slowblow's departure from the country's musical
    stereotypes does lend their self-titled third album a refreshing air.  Slowblow principals Orri Jònsson
    and Dagur Kàri Petursson largely ditch their peers' electro/acoustic textures in favor of detachedly strummed
    acoustic guitars and gentle, organic percussion.  And their fractured little songs speak in a language we
    understand, rather than hinting at a mystery that lunkheaded yanks like to get all hyperbolic about.</p><p>
    Slowblow aren't above leaning on their pals, of course.  Múm's Kristín Anna Valtysdóttir drifts in with vocals
    here and there, and the album was mixed at Sigur Rós' reportedly very drafty studio.  But while Kristin Anna's
    voice is immediately recognizable, it primarily serves to contrast and complement Dagur Kári's own breathy
    waver.  Opener ""Very Slow Bossanova"" hesitantly ticks along on a rhythm of tin cans, fleshed out by simplistic
    Casiotone, piano, and an electric guitar that softly picks out a hopeful little melody.</p><p>
    There's an inviting casualness to this album-- the liner notes speak proudly of it being recorded ""to tape
    in various living rooms and bathrooms in Reykjavík.""  The results sound like Grandaddy recording on D batteries
    and good old-fashioned manpower in a secluded green pup tent.  It's a long way from Iceland's typical veiled
    swirls of gauzy fog, or Prada turtlenecks pulled over skinny faces.  ""Within Tolerance"" begins tentatively
    before Kristín's familiar accordion bleats a note over a lazy snare drum and sustained acoustic chording.
    More light harmonizing between she and Dagur Kári follows, propelled by the surprisingly effective addition
    of prominent and steady handclaps.  The distorted vocal and crazed fuzz guitar of ""Happiness in Your Face""
    approaches mental-hospital Pixies, featuring a percussion track that sounds like someone pouring out a jar
    of old rusty screws.</p><p>
    ""Phantom of My Organ"", however, is the true standout: Orri's carefully spoken, mildly processed vocals
    suggest Lambchop's Kurt Wagner while a harmonium whirs and knitting needles clack behind a fluttering violin.
    It's one of the few tracks here that does channel Sigur Rós' lucid grandeur, albeit in a much rootsier form--
    a sepia tone lullaby crackling from a vintage radio in one of Slowblow's cozy porta-studio living rooms.
    But this grassroots approach isn't always successful.  Parts of <i>Slowblow</i> sound tossed off, or at
    least unfinished.  ""I Know You Can Smile"", for example, holds plenty of potential, but never rises above
    its polite offhandedness.  Still, despite a handful of small missteps, this quietly fractured release
    remains direct and welcoming, and teems with simple surprises.</p></div>"|7772.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7772-slowblow/|7.0|Johnny Loftus

    ""awesome"" and ""fucking life-changing, man""-- but from their ""dark"" and ""atmospheric"" debut, <i>Young Days</i>,
    I imagine it's something like this: The house cuts the music and four members of Hint Hint come out with
    their heads down, all crying softly, probably about existentialism.  They pick up their instruments, cry
    again, maybe one of them prays, and then they stoically lower their heads again.  Then frontman Peter Quirk
    comes out, limping for no obvious reason, also crying.  He is wearing running mascara that initially looks
    like a pregnant bird has shit all over his face.  He tells the crowd he doesn't care, though, because the
    world is going to end, and there's nothing he can do about it, except whisper about philosophy, which he
    then does.</p><p>
    
    Then, Hint Hint play a self-involved, 50-minute set of the most vapid rock 'n' roll of the year.  I don't
    think there's even a word for this.  Call it what you want, but with each passing minute, <i>Young Days</i>
    further proves that it has no substantial musical core to justify its rotten gild of overwrought angst.
    Hint Hint are so short on ideas, in fact, that they can barely afford more than one chord progression and
    guitar line per song, and must instead rely on star drummer Jason Lajeunesse to change up his beat enough
    to differentiate the verses from the choruses.</p><p>
    
    On opener ""Natural Collegiate"", for which Quirk does a terrible (but presumably his best) John Lydon
    impression, it quickly becomes clear that guitarist Dean Hudson and keyboardist Leona Marrs don't plan
    on moving past their respective Les Savy Fav and Pretty Girls Make Graves mocking.  After some token
    breathing time for this suffocatingly dark song, Lajeunesse overplays his toms in the closing minutes,
    as if to compensate for the song's flatness. ""Senator Blues"" sheds light on Hint Hint's main compositional
    glitch: on <i>Young Days</i>, guitar and keyboard melodies never reach outside the basic notes of the chord,
    and for however much energy is pumped into them, the melodies always feel stagnant.</p><p>
    
    Musically, <i>Young Days</i> is a serious bore, but what sends the record across that thin line to ""painful""
    territory is the conviction with which Hint Hint approaches such terribly uninteresting songs.  Quirk is
    mostly to blame for this-- he just doesn't know when to shut the fuck up.  On ""Same Skies"", he crummily
    evokes Jeremy Enigk, ruining the song's slick sub-bass synth grinds with shameful turns like, ""I'm gonna
    burn your letters when I'm all burnt out,"" and, ""This non-stop feeling, oh, when will it end?!/ It never
    ends.""  On ""A Curse on You, Dear"", Hint Hint rush headlong into Quirk's most laughable line: ""This is a
    relationship I can't deny/ This is a relationship I can't comprise/ With my relationship I won't comply/
    So let it die,"" which is driven home by a tense buildup to the dramatic utterance: ""I'm not afraid to die.""</p><p>
    
    With ""Leviathan"", Hint Hint throw what they must think is the greatest curveball in rock history.  In contrast
    to the surrounding infinite sadness, here, a blistery piano bounce opens what will be Hint Hint's best
    approximation of Paul Simon's ""You Can Call Me Al"".  The song almost works as the breath of fresh air Hint
    Hint seem to have intended it to be, but again, Quirk destroys it, ending the song with all of Kurt Cobain's
    vocal affectations and none of his heart: ""You awaken slowly, my little baby/ And all of us fall dead, we
    can solve that.""  Hint Hint's gesture to ""fun"" is appreciated, especially given <i>Young Days</i>' propensity
    toward heartless melodrama and such half-assed ""serious"" melodies.  Needless to say, ""Leviathan"" simply
    can't outweigh <i>Young Days</i>' guffaws-- and where the song's sad-goes-happy schtick is concerned, even
    Jimmy Eat World rock it better.</p></div>"|3875.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3875-young-days/|3.3|Nick Sylvester

    When an unknown band erupts from anonymity and begins garnering rave reviews in grassroots webzines and
    established glossy print mags alike, cynical consumers, steeped in suspicion of market manipulation and
    mainstream postmodernism, immediately become wary and guarded-- the animal that has been mistreated shying
    away from the friendly hand.  Sometimes, breakout bands have indeed been ""sold"" with ingenious marketing
    pushes and lifestyle branding techniques, but more often, the seemingly abrupt success is the product of
    a long and invisible series of missteps, failures, minor triumphs, and most importantly, years of unheralded
    toil and sweat.  Such is the trajectory of Rogue Wave.</p><p>
    
    In early 2002, the deflating dot-com bubble left musician Zach Schwartz jobless and spiritually bankrupt.
    What he initially perceived as a disaster, however, was a masquerading boon: The layoff led directly to
    his Sub Pop debut.  A member of the Bay Area indie group Desoto Reds at the time, Schwartz left Oakland
    for New York, California's dark mirror, to record a few songs with his friend, producer Bill Racine.  He
    returned to the Bay Area with an entire album.</p><p>
    
    The bicoastal milieu of <em>Out of the Shadow</em> is apparent: It reflects both a lush, sunny ""California
    Dreamin'"" temperament, and Gotham's grimy, melancholic disposition.  That Schwartz wrote and recorded
    <em>Out of the Shadow</em> by himself also seems fitting: It's lonely and remote in the vein of <em>Oh,
    Inverted World</em>, and vividly evokes one man sitting alone amid the finely wrought, baroquely detailed,
    and ultimately imprisoning architecture he's constructed around himself, contemplating his failure to
    include an exit door.</p><p>
    
    Upon returning to California, Schwartz quit Desoto Reds, changed his last name to ""Rogue,"" and placed an
    ad for musicians on Craig's List.  He found drummer/sampler Pat Spurgeon, bassist Sonya Westcott, and
    guitarist/keyboardist Gram Lebron.  By all credible reports, the new quartet almost literally fell in love
    with one another.  Soon, the members had added tactful motes of Moog, thin wires of lap steel, and
    square-shouldered vocal harmonies to Schwartz's tapes.</p><p>
<em>Out of the Shadow</em> opens with ""Every Moment"", a song that begins with channel-switching low-end tones
    and a metallic guitar figure that sounds as though it were run through a ring-modulator-- instrumentation
    that stands in stark opposition to the Brian Wilson-caliber harmonies preparing to break over the arrangement
    like dawn.  A shifting fog traced with refracted light, this nervous jostle of pop standards (bright Byrds
    guitar tones, big balloony drums), set against a backdrop of alien drones, elucidates exactly why Rogue Wave
    are such felicitous label/tourmates for The Shins.</p><p>
    
    The crisp percussion, uproariously strummed acoustic guitar of ""Nourishment Nation"" recalls Yo La Tengo if
    pared down to the most broad and translucent gestures-- particularly when the Ira Kaplan-esque vocal melody
    begins snaking around the amorphous arrangement like scaffolding.  ""Be Kind + Remind"" opens with a guitar
    phrase as ineluctable and hypnotic as anything Windsor for the Derby has produced, and its twittering birds
    lend it the same Emersonian naturalism.  It's also the record's first brush with questionable lyrical choices--
    the ""please be kind and remind"" pun of the chorus seems like forced quirkiness, and strikes a discordant
    aesthetic note.  Despite it, the flashes of bright plumage flitting through the arrangement in the guise
    of tiny whistles and bells enliven the auditory canvas enough to rescue it from the clutches of ignominy.</p><p>
    
    ""Kicking the Heart Out"" is a spare acoustic ballad augmented by chiming harmonics.  It trades the earlier
    songs' more inflated vocals for leaner, darker melodic turns that fully exploit Schwartz's knack for creating
    sonic atmospheres akin to gazing at the natural splendor of The Pacific Ocean on a calendar in a sterile office
    cubicle.  The walking bassline takes it increasingly lower, into the murkier dungeons of consciousness.  Wildly
    incongruous handclaps cement its pristine strangeness.  This is the loudest quiet since Simon &amp; Garfunkel
    turned a facile paradox into a philosophical enigma by aurally evoking ""The Sound of Silence"".</p><p>
    
    Considering <i>Out of the Shadows</i>' backstory and recording sessions, this album may come to embody the
    sound of Rogue Wave in an embryonic stage.  With the band's new members likely to play a larger role in song
    development from here on out, it seems likely that the group could quickly evolve into another entity
    altogether.  Either way, having been plucked from obscurity by Sub Pop, and showing so much potential this
    early on, Rogue Wave seem ordained for long-term success.</p></div>"|6919.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6919-out-of-the-shadow/|7.8|Brian Howe

    burden to carry.  To date, his studio releases have lived up to standard he set by his earliest recordings
    under the Ninja Tune banner, plastering the testosterone-fueled aggression inherent in hard jazz over
    volcanic basslines and finely chopped beats.  Tobin mines subtlety from minor changes in volume and pacing,
    but relies almost exclusively on sheer force to bowl over the listener.  His music is ominous and looming,
    mysterious and cinematic, despite its menace.  Even as 2002's <i>Out from Out Where</i> nodded to the
    Chemical Brothers' big beat/psychedelia pastiche, Luke Vibert's kitchen sink breaks, and the organic jazz
    textures of Roni Size, his DJ sets have always been about shock and awe above shade and nuance.</p><p>
    
    Recorded live in Melbourne, Australia for Ninja Tune's Solid Steel radio series, Tobin's sound here is
    derived purely from a laptop, two pieces of vinyl, and Final Scratch, a software package that allows him
    to mix digital audio files via a turntable interface.  For almost a full hour, Tobin flows through several
    moods in all his ear-splitting, creeped-out, bass-heavy hysteria.  Those moods mainly range from dark to
    darker, but eventually come out the other end of the tunnel with a relatively gentle comedown.</p><p>
    
    In lieu of hiring a full band to recreate his songs, Tobin's tourdates primarily consist of DJ sets like
    this one, and as such, he tends to throw many of his own tracks into the blender.  Song of his like ""Chronic
    Tronic"" and ""Verbal"", which almost come off with a nod and a smile on <i>Out from Out Where</i>, are here
    taken into a back alley and roughed up with jackhammer breaks and chasms of reverb.  The roar and moan work
    well here, tempered by spiraling rhythmic structures, quickly shifting tracks, or clever sampling-- all of
    which Tobin takes advantage of without remorse.</p><p>
    
    A brief LL Cool J quote bleeds into the hip-hop opening of Cherrystones' ""Pressure Cooker"", and a snippet
    of an astronomy lecture evokes a vintage Space Mountain feel at the end Tobin's ""Marine Machines"", before
    diving into the vintage <i>Space Invaders</i> warfare of ""Schmalla"" by Facs &amp; Smythe.  These bright moments
    stab out of the fog and give the listener something to hold on to while Tobin keeps the bass in full force.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, a ponderous midsection mires the maddening pace of the album's first and final thirds.  Here,
    Tobin blends 13 tracks in less than 20 minutes, killing the heightened anxiety by total anesthesia, drumming
    and bassing us into numbness.  Normally known for extended, intricate transitions, the blending of these
    tracks seems forced-- almost clumsy.  The press notes accompanying the album mention that some songs were
    excised from the set in post-production due to lack of legal clearance for samples, and some of these
    transitions lead me to believe that something is literally missing from these segues, as they're so
    uncharacteristically inelegant.</p><p>
    
    Things pick back up during the final third of the record, though, as we find Tobin at his most playful and
    surreal.  His ""Night Life"" is the first downtempo respite of the set, a churning break accompanied by
    Arabesque flute and brass.  Future Prophecies deliver some future-funk breaks with the well-titled ""Deep
    Impact"".  This is soon followed by the shuffle and bounce of Dizzee Rascal's ""Sittin' Here"", in which the
    UK garage star's vocals seethe and bubble with effects (though are almost entirely drowned in what must've
    been a muddy P.A. mix).</p><p>
    
    The last 12 minutes-- a including mashup of three Tobin originals-- offer some innovative peak moments,
    probably leaving the drunken bogan crowd shaken to their Ug Boots.  Here are the schizoid arrangements and
    found-sound samples that makes Tobin's albums so intriguing.  The elephantine bass of ""Proper Hoodidge""
    slowly fades into the breaking cymbals and strings of ""Four Ton Mantis"", which then slides into ""Hey
    Blondie""'s electro synths.  And then comes a truly inspired finale: Tobin drops a majestic, cathartic
    ""Venus in Furs"", slow-breaks style, that despite the low vocal volume closes the album with a heavy-lidded
    sigh.</p><p>
    
    Of course, even with Lou Reed's hermaphroditic voice lightening the set's loafers, <i>Recorded Live</i> is
    overwhelmingly masculine.  In other words, if you're looking for delicate, atmospheric beats you won't find
    them here.  What the disc does contain is a brutish, undeniable muscle that makes it an enthralling and
    abrasive listen.  Best be sure your speakers can handle the workout.</p></div>"|8088.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8088-recorded-live/|7.4|Jonathan Zwickel

Cats, continuing their 4,000
    year passive/aggressive reign, will grow in per capita population, increasingly encroaching on our clean,
    dander-free air.  And given the state of blind sensitivity towards animals these days, it will be too late
    once the remaining masses look up to find a good portion of mankind buried under countless plots of cat hair.
    It's called natural selection, and it's only a matter of time.</p><p>
    
    Once this realization finally hits, one other observation may go forever unnoticed: Behind a fuzzy exterior
    lies a fuzzy interior.  Led by the songwriting team of Christopher O'Brien and Kirk Hellie, Meow Meow tap
    their namesake's yelp with that very truth in mind.  Listeners who experience this album in a veterinarian
    clinic might claim that its music is pop-oriented, with furry edges and touches.  But I believe that those
    pop elements-- like the innocuous mannerisms of the feline species-- belie the music's obviously poisonous
    external coating.</p><p>
    
    The soul of this band is more like Poe's Black Cat than Davis' Garfield.  Kitty apologists will delight in
    Meow Meow's ""sunny disposition,"" though their Californian sense of melody suggests these boys were subjected
    in their youth to some kind of wicked Blue Hawaiian experiment designed to reveal the effects of too much
    sunshine.  The lyrics don't lie.  Lines like, ""Cracked torn and frayed/ I fucked it all up again,"" and song
    titles such as ""Disaffected"" bear this band's standard, while concessions to warm sentiments are just that.
    In fact, the tired trick of lapping desperate, anxious, self-loathing lyrics over a sweetly strung voice
    steers Meow Meow dangerously close to whiny So-Cal pop/punk.  Being more than a one-trick pony, however,
    Meow Meow's lyrics quickly emerge as one component of the whole fuzzy interior/fuzzy exterior sound, and
    cease their service to the Beach Boys' vocal horse-cart.</p><p>
    
    Left with only a saccharine voice and a buried showcase of melodic attentiveness, <i>Snow Gas Bones</i>
    presents an ironically enjoyable sonic portrait of the best of all modern beasts, the domestic housecat.
    It may coo innocently and walk in a soulful gait, but my allergic friends and I know better: The very
    lines of its silhouette predict our primal darkness.  Of course, as delineated by our good friend and
    fellow feline skeptic Baudelaire, if you do it right, there can be beauty in that darkness.  Witness Meow
    Meow's sleepier moments, as on ""Finis"" or in the requisite taped-message-backed-by-treated-keyboards-backed-by-foreboding-ambience
    that closes ""Disaffected"".  ""Amplified Breathing Apparatus"" boasts a great, understated fuzz-organ, loops
    of soft radio noise, equally understated vocals, and vibes helming the transition between verses.</p><p>
    
    Though all the foregoing is as satisfying as <i>Snow Gas Bones</i>' lack of actual filler, there are
    moments when the band can't quite stand on all four legs.  The toy box piano on ""The Killing Kind"" turns
    up the California Effect a tad too high, man: The second track's nakedly anthemic, ""You're my sick fixation!"",
    busts this band's usually subtle approach, and brings them that much closer to mimicking their musical
    ancestry (in an unattractive way).  Oh, but that subtlety, when it-- conspiring with quality production-- fogs your ears with a handful of
    disparate layers, consisting mostly of punishment, it makes you want to pet your punisher.  Or you may
    like cats, I guess, in which case you better just sing along.</p></div>"|5603.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5603-snow-gas-bones/|7.1|Zach Vowell

Over the course of the past 10 years, they've gone from the ramshackle
    country of <i>Hitchhike to Rhome</i> and <i>Wreck Your Life</i> to the messier country-punk of <i>Too Far to
    Care</i> to the pristine pop of <i>Fight Songs</i> and <i>Satellite Rides</i>.  What's impressive is how well
    the band have delivered each of their attempted styles, from Brit Invasion to power-pop to country to punk;
    it's professional range.</p><p>
<i>Drag It Up</i>, however, marks the first time the band's sound has taken a step backwards.  Reversing
    their popward trajectory, the group incorporates more country elements here.  The effect is such that the
    album could fit at any point during their decade-long career-- were it not their weakest effort since their
    1994 debut.  Part of this regression can be attributed to singer and primary songwriter Rhett Miller, who
    seems to be losing his edge.  Perhaps it has something to do with his recent marriage and fatherhood, both
    of which have immense personal rewards but often exert a settling effect on artists who've trafficked in
    damaged goods and sly sexual come-ons.</p><p>
    
    Whatever the cause, he sounds a bit neutered on <i>Drag It Up</i>, having clearly come to terms with his
    own radical impulses.  Aside from ""Won't Be Home"", in which he throws a girl out of his car, Miller declines
    active agency in these songs: He doesn't do things; things simply happen to him.  On ""Bloomington"", he
    describes how ""a girl in pink took a sip of my drink/ And laid down next to me.""  She is the seducer and
    he the seduced: ""This is love, baby, this is love/ The moment she let me, the moment she let me.""  Meanwhile,
    ""Borrowed Bride"", about an affair with a married woman, could be seen as a sequel to <i>Satellite Rides</i>'
    ""Designs on You"" if Miller didn't sing the entire thing in second person.</p><p>
    
    Bassist Murry Hammond gets the best songs-- the surf-guitar epic ""Smokers"" and ""In the Satellite Rides a
    Star"" (which provided their previous album's title)-- and steers the album in a decidedly C&amp;W; direction,
    reminiscent of the band's earlier material.  But as with past albums, the secret weapon here is Ken Bethea,
    who rarely seems to get his due as a guitarist.  Never showy, he infuses ""Smokers"" with its 60s-style bounce
    and takes vocals duties on the endearingly goofy ""Coahuila"".</p><p>
    
    To an extent, if <i>Drag It Up</i> sounds disappointing, it's mostly in relation to previous albums; it's
    hard not to compare these songs to ""Valentine"", ""Book of Poems"", ""Busted Afternoon"", or ""Doreen"".  But
    with a discography this sprawling and diverse, it seems unlikely that, aside from a few initial spins,
    any longtime fan wouldn't reach for the Old 97's other albums before this one.  Of course, it's always
    possible that Miller will receive a renewed burst of confidence or inspiration from here, proving this
    only a temporary dip in quality.  But here, with the band scaling back their sound and reverting to a
    more comfortable form, there's also little indication they won't just peter out entirely.</p></div>"|5966.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5966-drag-it-up/|7.0|Stephen M. Deusner

    himself capable of striking a balance between his thoughtful, inspired songwriting and his equally intricate
    and skillful production techniques.  As owner of San Francisco's Tiny Telephone studios, the former MK Ultra
    frontman no doubt has ample time for sonic explorations behind the mixing board.  However, on <i>Life and
    Death</i>, Vanderslice's bag of production tricks never outshone his greatest strength, songwriting.  With
    the release of his fourth full-length, this year's <i>Cellar Door</i>, it seemed that balance was beginning
    to tip.  While tunes such as ""Pale Horse"" and ""White Plains"" showed Vanderslice was still at the top of his
    songwriting game, some tracks seemed weighed down by his elaborate studio savvy.</p><p>
    
    Already hard at work on a proper follow-up, the increasingly prolific California troubadour is treating
    his fans to a limited-edition disc titled <i>MGM Endings: Cellar Door Remixes</i>.  While the tracks on
    display here are, after all, ""remixes,"" and a certain amount of studio experimentation is to be expected,
    it seems evident that Vanderslice is becoming increasingly interested in bringing his inventive production
    talents to the forefront.  Scott Solter, J.V.'s engineer and right-hand man, is again at the helm for this
    collection of reinterpretations.</p><p>
<i>MGM</i> opens with a remix of <i>Cellar Door</i>'s closing track, ""June July"".  In its new version, here
    sneakily re-titled ""August"", the warm acoustic ballad is stripped of its guitars and vocals leaving only
    booming drums and repetitive string and synthesizer gestures.  That the record begins with an instrumental
    is a harbinger of things to come: Vanderslice's distinct vocals are notably absent from 8 of its 12 tracks.
    However, the second track, ""Bushnell Scope"", better represents what's to follow.  A remix of <i>Cellar Door</i>'s
    ""Up Above the Sea"", ""Bushnell Scope"" features super-compressed bass and layers of huge trash-can-like drums
    typical of the overall sound of <i>MGM</i>.  Like several songs that follow, this track gives the impression
    of meandering experimentation, the song itself taking a backseat to the myriad effects and gear at hand.</p><p>
    
    This sound further reveals itself on ""Lifeboat"", where massive percussive blasts are accompanied by ethereal,
    wordless female vocals.  By the time the compressed drum hits return for the third time, the track has essentially
    worn itself out.  Likewise, layers of reverberating percussion and fuzzy guitars make up the remix of <i>Cellar
    Door</i>'s ""Pale Horse"", here listed as ""Behold a Pale Horse"".  Ultimately, the thundering percussion isn't
    quite enough to sustain the track, as it otherwise fails to develop.</p><p>
    
    Not surprisingly, the <i>MGM</i> remixes are most successful when Vanderslice's emotive tenor is at the
    forefront.  ""Field Guide"", a rumination on escaping demons of the past, features Vanderslice's vocals
    backed by layers of slightly distorted acoustic guitars.  Although the track is a fairly straight-forward
    interpretation of <i>Cellar Door</i>'s ""White Plains"", the warm lo-fi feel, coupled with the stripped down
    arrangement, makes for a satisfying alternative to the original.  The remix of ""Promising Actress"", re-titled
    ""Requiem"", also benefits from vocals.  Here, a consistent background texture evokes scratchy vinyl, and after
    a hollow opening of echoing bells, fuzzy guitars emerge to support Vanderslice's delivery of a condensed
    version of the lyrics.</p><p>
    
    Of course, not all of the instrumental tracks suffer from a lack of vocals: ""Bomb in Reverse"" consists only
    of acoustic guitars, accompanied by intermittent sonic swells.  The tempo is significantly decelerated from
    the original ""My Family Tree"", but Vanderslice's melodic gift is clearly evident in the undulating guitar
    figures, which have no trouble standing on their own.  It's this melodic inventiveness that's most missed
    on this collection.  Over the course of four solo releases, Vanderslice has established himself as one of
    the Pacific Northwest's most imaginative indie pop songwriters.  When combined with his distinctive voice
    and unique songwriting, J.V.'s production skills produce remarkable results, but when the elaborate studio
    arrangements overtake the songs themselves, his talents are often obscured.  For many other artists, this
    wouldn't be cause for concern.  Vanderslice, however, is simply too strong a songwriter to take a backseat
    to production.</p></div>"|8404.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8404-mgm-endings-cellar-door-remixes/|6.0|Andrew Lehman

Their style
    of ambient rock is so uniquely visceral and assuredly sovereign that the band are near impossible to place
    in context.  They're <em>better</em> than context, at once barrenly isolated and cozily insulated.  They
    radiate light when there's nothing to illuminate.  One can picture them performing alone on an infinite
    plane, casting lambent guitar peals into the abyss as the bass throws off cool purple embers.  It's uncanny
    how a band could create such imagistic soundscapes using just guitar, bass and drums, but their method was
    deceptively simple: Recording elementary pop songs at slothful tempos, Galaxie 500 voided the outside world
    simply by using reverb-- lots of it-- to make their songs hugely, panoptically immersive.  Their indolent
    compositions are at once keenly prescient of the slacker rock of the early 1990s, and beholden strictly
    unto themselves.</p><p>
    
    Indeed, in literal terms, the band were, in some ways, all by themselves.  Operating during what was arguably
    a latent period for underground music, the group were unparalleled in style and substance.  Oddly enough,
    they came to typify late-80s college rock, right alongside their Boston brethren the Pixies.  But Galaxie
    500 were always markedly set apart from their peers, enjoying (one imagines) the sort of critical insulation
    brought by a timeless sound and largely posthumous discovery.  This confluence of circumstances, combined
    with some of a decade's most killer riffs, has won the band comparisons to The Velvet Underground.  But as
    with the Velvets, to saddle Galaxie 500 with generous comparisons is unnecessary, and only serves to
    diminish their rare achievements, and undercut the singular impact they've wrought upon independent music.</p><p>
    
    Though 1989's <i>On Fire</i> remains their finest and most fully realized album, uninitiated fans seeking
    to begin an affair with this group would be well advised to seek out three tracks from <i>Uncollected</i>,
    a document of the band's rarest works that was first issued as part of Rykodisc's four-disc <i>Galaxie 500</i>
    box set, and has now been issued as a standalone release.  ""Walking Song"", and the two subsequent tracks,
    comprise the band's 1987 demo tape; they aren't the highlights of this set (much less the band's entire
    catalog), but they are significant, because they illustrate, more vividly than any other selections I can
    think of, the group's rapid learning period and concomitant progression toward one of the most distinctive
    sounds in indie rock's storied history.  In just five years, the trio went from being a slack post-grad pub
    band with minimal playing experience and a dilettante bassist, to progenitors of dream-pop and one of the
    underground's most folkloric and influential acts.</p><p>
    
    Many of these tracks exist outside this collection, among various odds-and-sods EPs and compilations. The
    non-album version of ""Blue Thunder"", pilfered from the 1989 Rough Trade EP of the same name, features a
    yowling saxophone, and, despite the stridency of its accompaniment, is somehow even more sobering than the
    album cut.  Tender and quavering originally, Ralph Carney's tenor sax stands up to the woebegone guitar
    and chilly vocals, providing firmness in the face of heady melancholy.  The contrast only broadens the
    already immense emotional breadth of the song, making it not just one of the most moving songs here, but
    anywhere in the band's repertoire.</p><p>
    
    A guitar band first and foremost, Galaxie 500 also displayed a scholarly and eclectic penchant for covers,
    and <i>Uncollected</i> gathers a handful of these impressions among 11 original works, including a slowcore
    read of The Rutles' ""Cheese &amp; Onions"" and an august live suite showcasing The Beatles' ""Rain"" and Jonathan
    Richman's ""Don't Let Our Youth Go to Waste"".  Suffused with piecemeal effects and lush string swells,
    ""Cheese &amp; Onions"" is more histrionic than the band's traditional understated material, and serves as a
    stellar example of their musicological reach.  The nearly-nine-minute live suite, however, is quintessential
    Galaxie, showing all shades of the group, from ragtag pop troubadours, to cogitating slowcore shamans, to
    towering guitar rock demigods.  Dean Wareham's lavishly reverbed solo at the end of ""Don't Let Our Youth
    Go to Waste"" is one of his most formidable; that it was performed live is a testament to his well-earned,
    yet still largely unrecognized, place in the guitar-god pantheon.</p><p>
    
    While many of these tracks remain true to the band's staple sound, the most interesting cuts are those that
    witness them taking a different, often slightly exploratory bent.  ""Oblivious"" shows a bouncier Galaxie 500,
    sacrificing ambience for a blither interest in straightforward hooks, while ""Song in 3"" stakes a tumbling
    inverted waltz that smacks more directly of the band's relationship with 60s pop.  Elsewhere, ""Walking Song""
    is perhaps the most upbeat example of the group's songwriting, honoring its title with a propulsive drumbeat
    and surf-like breakdown.  The songs most redolent of the band's album cuts-- the jittery ""Them"", ""Summertime""-in-uteri
    ""Final Day"", and the drowsy ""Maracas Song""-- are undoubtedly strong ones, but nevertheless provide somewhat
    pallid stand-ins for classics like ""Fourth of July"", ""When Will You Come Home"", or ""Listen, The Snow Is Falling"".
    These aren't Galaxie 500's best songs, but-- whether covers or not-- they are unmistakably <em>their</em> songs,
    which makes this release an invaluable artifact for devout fans, and a strong selling point for tyros.</p></div>"|3381.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3381-uncollected/|7.2|Sam Ubl

    hills, leaving a ghostly crimson light flickering in and out of picture windows and windshields, and lending
    an eerie glow to the early morning fog.  The inferno seemed a horribly apt fit for the historical moment--
    a kind of purification by fire delivered to a nation choking on official lies, war and joblessness.  Greg
    Graffin and Brett Gurewitz of Bad Religion, the twenty-something year-old L.A. punk band, were paying
    attention; a few weeks later, they went into the studio to record the searing ""Los Angeles Is Burning"", a
    grim celebration of environmental rape and the subsequent payback.</p><p>
    
    That's just one great moment from Bad Religion's <i>The Empire Strikes First, 14 songs that are fresh,
    focused, and absolutely alive in the way that great rock 'n' roll energizes everything it touches.  It's
    been a long road from their early-80s beginnings, but these days, the primary concerns of Graffin and
    Gurewitz are not the band's intricate (and subtle) years-long evolution; they're first and foremost topical
    songwriters focused on domestic chaos and its global manifestation.  Bad Religion is, after all, the outfit
    that, during the first Gulf War in 1991, shared a </i><i>Maximum Rock 'n' Roll</i> split seven-inch with radical
    MIT professor Noam Chomsky, who, like them, is locked into the tense present and dedicated to exposing the
    forces who lie and disguise to deepen and enforce human misery.</p><p>
    
    The truth is that after 20+ years, Bad Religion meet the present day not only unfettered by nostalgia, but
    hardwired into the moment.  Fans take the band's growth and standards for granted.  It's tempting to say--
    though impossible to prove-- that the <i>The Empire Strikes First</i> is a such a terrific album because
    vocalist Graffin and guitarist Gurewitz, the band's most important creative forces, are responding to the
    death, desolation, and destruction of war, and to the concurrent attacks on the Bill of Rights; it seems
    more than just a happy accident that the band has just delivered one of its most charged and inspired
    records in years.</p><p>
    
    Bad Religion's most important elements are intact here: Graffin's voice and politically informed lyrics, and
    Gurewitz's imaginative guitar work and background vocals.  They wouldn't likely contest the suggestion that
    the use of simple elements equates to a formula, but the genius of Graffin and Gurewitz is how they take
    these simple elements and twist them-- unexpected chord changes, short breakdowns, quick drum fills, and
    increasingly sophisticated, sweet-sounding vocal arrangements so rich you could trade them for military
    arms.</p><p>
    
    ""Sinister Rouge"" is a study in contrasts; a wall of cinematic harmonies comes at you like choir practice in
    a cave, while Gurewitz's guitar is so close it could touch you (whether you'd like it to or not).  ""Los
    Angeles Is Burning"" lifts a lesson from the band's own backyard, but ""Let Them Eat War"" is a classic Bad
    Religion anthem.  Graffin spits out a variation on the theme of old-school punk politics locking arms with
    the American worker in order to explain how fighting a war serves the interests of the capitalists who keep
    them down.  You'd think (or I would anyway) that any song with the lyric, ""You never stole from the rich to give to the
    poor/ All he ever gave to them was a war/ And a foreign enemy to deplore,"" should be stopped before it
    kills again.  But don't pull the switch-- the band rocks along at high speed beneath Graffin (and his
    vocal uses the whole scale), while Gurewitz delivers aggressively graceful, ultra-melodic fills, and
    sugary harmonies to glue the chorus together.</p><p>
    
    The irony of it all is that the band's call-and-response vocal arrangements are straight out of a Baptist
    church house, as are the rich harmonies and the reliance on one man-- in this case, Graffin-- to testify
    to (and for) the congregation.  Bad Religion's magic doesn't stem as much from their political lyrics as
    from the airtight arrangements and thick, sweet harmonies that bring the lyrics to you, and interestingly,
    are also the antithesis of the social rebellion the band advocates.  A case could be made (and sometimes I
    make it) that the band resorts to the very things it deplores in order to get across a message, and that
    in the process, they demand a kind of allegiance that a cynic might call unhealthy.  But if Graffin and
    Gurewitz are willing to return to the well to help the innocent climb out, the end certainly justifies
    the means.</p></div>"|522.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/522-the-empire-strikes-first/|8.2|J.H. Tompkins

    litter of side projects and swishy psych-experiments, some bizarrely short-lived (the freshly dismembered
    All Night Radio), and some a little bit more enduring. But regardless of their relative shelf-life, the
    surfboard never seems to fall terribly far from the Beachwood umbrella, and each of the former members'
    post-Sparks projects have been imbued with the same characteristic sun-streaks and slow California ease.</p><p>
    
    The latest record to pop forth from Beachwood Sparks' sandy grave is Mystic Chords of Memory, which features
    Christopher Gunst (also of Strictly Ballroom, The Tyde, and Further) and partner Jen Cohen (of The Aislers
    Set), and was recorded exclusively from inside Gunst and Cohen's shared home.  Acknowledging the duo's
    inherited aesthetic (painfully relaxed), and factoring in the total lack of studio pressure, MCoM's
    subsequent long-player is an unsurprising sprawl of deliciously lulling fuzz.</p><p>
    
    Given their pedigree, it may seem unlikely that Gunst and Cohen could stumble across anything more sleepily
    compelling than the slow, breezy squeals and overwhelming atmospherics that Beachwood Sparks fans so eagerly
    lapped up, but this debut isn't all spineless sighs and gooey waves.  With its soft melodies, sweet vocals,
    and scratchy DIY production, <i>Mystic Chords of Memory</i> is also an overwhelmingly intimate record,
    focused and domestic-- much closer to Elliott Smith than former-benchmarks the Byrds and Buffalo Springfield.</p><p>
    
    The duo's wordy moniker was lifted directly from a phrase in Abraham Lincoln's first inaugural address, a
    lecture delivered in the spring of 1861 and boldly eternalized at the base of Mount Rushmore (the full
    quote, ""The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave, to every living
    heart and hearthstone..."" is etched directly beneath Lincoln's face, fodder for zillions of disposable
    cameras and whirring camcorders every July).  Appropriately, the band's sound is just as archaic as a truly
    striking political speech: Gunst and Cohen blend tinkling bells, melodica, harp, keyboards, bits of samples,
    tinny drums, and strummy guitars, presenting a vaguely contemporary update on the British folk phenomenon
    of the late 1960s-- albeit with more blips.</p><p>
    
    The instrumental ""Soul Through the Bullet Hole"" juxtaposes puttering drums and thick bass with otherworldly
    keys, rubbery guitar, and bubbling samples; the singer/songwriter sap of ""Golden Dome"" is perfectly augmented
    by a careening violin and Cohen's gentle backing harmonies.  Gunst's vocals are lower and less strained than
    on most of Beachwood Sparks' tracks, and the duo's living room tinkering seems to have freed Gunst from the
    knee-jerk nu-psych cawing of his past.  <i>Mystic Chords of Memory</i> is a surprisingly coherent
    re-introduction to Gunst, and his professional coupling with Jen Cohen has proven both a freeing and
    inspired move.  Gunst is carrying on the Beachwood torch, but abandoning the baggage.</p></div>"|5602.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5602-mystic-chords-of-memory/|7.7|Amanda Petrusich

Interestingly, though, Eno's second     solo album, <i>Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy)</i>, failed to place in the pantheon at all.  Strange     that it was left out in the cold, especially as it always held a place in my heart, even if it is (rightfully)     considered a chilly album.  Chalk that up to Eno's early experimentation with drum machines and synthesizer     technology, which propelled those hastily worded (yet still evocative) songs.</p>
<p>Concurrent with Virgin's Eno reissues, Bay Area multi-instrumentalist Doug Hilsinger-- on either whim or     dare-- cut a full-album cover of <i>Taking Tiger Mountain</i>, enlisting his friend Caroleen Beatty to take     the vocal duties.  The disc was never intended to see retail daylight, but at Brian Eno's lecture appearance     at The Long Now Foundation in San Francisco, the duo slipped him a CDR copy of their secret love letter.     And when the man responded with the realization that ""they aren't bad songs after all,"" the album found     its way out.</p>
<p>The most immediately striking thing about this homage is how this so-called Maoist opera is significantly     warmer and more of an even keel than the original.  This is due largely to Hilsinger's insistence on playing     everything on the album with a conscientious shunning of drum machines and keyboards of any sort.  Still, all     the guitar noises mimic the Eno treatments to a tee, which frees up the lyrics themselves to shine under     Beatty's reading.  Having worked with The Mekons' Jon Langford in the past, it's not too surprising that     Beatty's voice evokes Sally Timms' radiance; she deftly replaces Eno's adenoidal, androgynous nasal delivery     with a throatier resonance.</p>
<p>The song titles now read like 50s film marquees from a parallel universe: A     vague plot and character interactions surface on the grainy black-and-white ""Burning Airlines"" and the     near-comedic march of ""Back in Judy's Jungle"".  Who would be cast in the role of ""The Fat Lady of Limbourg""?     You can almost see the lead of ""The Great Pretender"" stagger away from the surrendered shape of Monica on     the sand as if in some tragic end scene, the looping noise crescent as the ocean waves overtake him.</p>
<p>""Third Uncle"" unfortunately gets taken at a reggae shuffle here, undermining the paranoid pace of the original,     and the ecstatic peaks of ""The True Wheel"" are leveled out by Beatty's too-calculated delivery.  As the     title track ebbs away, though, Eno's sentiment holds true: Beneath the cold machines and chin-stroking     theories that weighted the originals down lies more human heart than even its creator ever suspected.</p></div>"|3988.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3988-taking-tiger-mountain-by-strategy-with-caroleen-beatty/|7.6|Andy Beta

    poppy counterpart to the dark, experimental tendencies of Will Cullen Hart's Circulatory System.  The problem
    with this is that they've never been fun, nor particularly interesting.  Drenching their previous releases
    in blindingly bright, caramel-saccharine glee, The Sunshine Fix are psychedelic Fred Penners making clumsy
    attempts at approximating Beatles production-- they even frequently crib Lennon/McCartney tracks note-for-note.</p><p>
<i>Green Imagination</i>, The Sunshine Fix's latest release, convicts Doss and company once more of shamelessly
    aping as many of the Fab Four's post-<i>Help!</i> trademarks as they're likely to get away with.  To their
    credit, however, they occasionally throw a curveball: Careful dusting occasionally reveals the prints of
    Keith Richards' sticky fingers on <i>Green Imagination</i> as well, marking the first time the band has
    ever dared to venture outside the <i>Magical Mystery</i> realm.  In fact, were there any trace of the
    innovation and easy genius these artists routinely exhibited, The Sunshine Fix might actually be onto
    something.  Unfortunately, given the influences they've drawn from, The Sunshine Fix's returns are awfully
    unrewarding.</p><p>
<i>Green Imagination</i> does awkwardly stumble into some redeeming moments, but never without a slog
    through the banal first.  The short opener ""Statues and Glue"" showers itself in yellowed vocal harmonies,
    lulling listeners with its mundane chord progressions, until a simple but powerful bass and drum breakdown
    is introduced, slashed on the offbeat by Doss' upstroke.  ""What Do You Know"" is an abridged version of
    <i>Black Foliage</i>'s ""A Sleepy Company"", trading the latter's devilish string parts and general oddballery
    for flat-out gimmicky flanged guitar lines and scrambled vocals-- but while the call-and-response between
    Doss and his ""What do you know?"" chorus initially cloys, the closing refrain recompenses, as Doss fights
    against ascending vocal harmonies and a children's choir.  Which is maybe what's so frustrating about
    <i>Green Imagination</i>: Doss clearly knows how to craft challenging yet accessible passages, and it's
    a shame he so often settles for compositional truisms.</p><p>
    
    Another hurdle that The Sunshine Fix could stand to clear is their tendency towards pop overload.  When
    Doss fails to find an interesting melody, he seems to think that simply stuffing tracks with an unwieldy
    number of boring ones will solve the problem.  Tracks like ""Extraordinary/Ordinary"" prove just the opposite.
    The falsetto melody that opens this track is maybe the most remarkable parody of Carl Newman's songwriting
    prowess I've heard, and the rest of the song is content to congeal into a mess of flaccid horn bops, guitar
    slides, and wispy harmonies.  Starlight Mints send-up ""Afterglow"" and Rolling Stones town-carnival tribute
    ""Face the Ghost"" make it all the more clear that <i>Green Imagination</i> desperately wants to be loved--
    and obnoxiously so.  Doss' blues affectations, and each track's transparent recourse to some goofy ""we're
    totally fun!"" trope (see: the addition of harmonica and/or ""Twist and Shout""-style chord builds) are, in
    fact, <i>not</i> totally fun, but wholeheartedly infuriating.</p><p>
    
    Let's pass over the John Lennon-does-country sleeper ""Rx"", the TV mini-drama theme ""Enjoy Your Teeth"", and
    ""Runaway Run"" (the latter a possible successor to Beavis and Butthead's ""Lesbian Seagulls"").  Maybe the only
    truly worthwhile track on <i>Green Imagination</i> is the closer, ""Sunday Afternoon"".  The catchy stop/start
    guitar riff initially keeps the short song's energy level high, but soon, some fantastic multi-part vocals
    steal the spotlight: While sweeping guitar lines and oohs/ahhs are pushed to the front of the mix, two
    massively catchy vocal melodies trade fire across the stereo in the background, the tenors on one side,
    the bass on the other.  This production technique would seem to contradict common sense, but it works
    extremely well here-- and if nothing else, it leaves those who can even get through the entirety of
    <i>Green Imagination</i> with a nice consolation prize.</p></div>"|7593.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7593-green-imagination/|3.5|Nick Sylvester

Twenty-foot-tall praying mantises are psychedelic.  Wearing other people's
    glasses is a little psychedelic.  But despite pervasive positioning as a halcyon-era psych-pop masterpiece,
    The Zombies' 1968 pop epic <i>Odessey &amp; Oracle</i> is not so far-out.  Direct, narrative threads and often
    simple songwriting stand in contrast to <i>Oracle</i>'s swirling, ornate cover, crafted by a sense-dulled
    stoner (hence, ""Odessey"").</p><p>
    
    While <i>Odessey and Oracle</i> is definitely one of the great rediscovered works of the psychedelic era--
    an under-appreciated record of beauty and foresight-- albums like Love's <i>Forever Changes</i>, Van Dyke
    Parks' <i>Song Cycle</i>, and even the Beach Boys' <i>Pet Sounds</i>, expanded minds with wider sonic
    palettes and more daring song structures.  The Zombies' four-track recordings subsist on the band's unique
    style and succinct composition: carefully crafted vocal melodies, bold chord changes and winding resolutions,
    all colored by heavenly harmonies and strings.</p><p>
    
    The Zombies released just two proper albums, and, as they broke up immediately after recording <i>Odessey
    and Oracle</i>, had little impact on the pop music of their day.  Time, nostalgia, and perhaps the pop
    critic's penchant for underdogs sewed considerable retroactive gains for our visionaries, who mined the
    subtleties of 60s pop and found hints of melancholy wistfulness buried beneath the more pedestrian, sunny
    harmonies they competed with.</p><p>
    
    The band's biggest hits (""Tell Her No"" and ""She's Not There"", both from the band's eponymous 1964 debut)
    had cynical undertones, a trend that continued on <i>Odessey</i>.  The album's first cut, ""Care of Cell
    44"", strongly recalls the wide-eyed innocence of <i>Pet Sounds</i>' famous ""Wouldn't It Be Nice?"" but for
    the fact that the narrator's lover is, more explicitly, daydreaming in jail.  <i>Odessey</i>'s single,
    ""Time of the Season"", is the album's only stereotypically summer-of-love moment; for the most part, darker
    tones and the dramatic third person feel are ahead of the present-tense late 60s.</p><p>
    
    While it wasn't exactly ""freakout"" music aimed at squares, <i>Odyssey and Oracle</i> is still notable for
    its experimental bend.  The Zombies convinced EMI to let them record it at Abbey Road free of all corporate
    influence (read: no producers), allowing the band to indulge whatever musical fantasies they came up with.
    Some members of the band-- most prominently keyboardist Rod Argent-- would go on to careers in prog-rock,
    and seeds of that genre poke through here.  The first clue is an unhealthy preoccupation with historical
    and literary figures, from the Shakespeare quote in the liner notes, to the Faulkner-derived ""A Rose for
    Emily"", to ""Butcher's Tale (Western Front 1914)""-- inspired by bassist Chris White's WWI obsession-- The
    Zombies wore over-education on their sleeves.  In many ways, <i>Odessey</i> foretells the flowery baroque
    prose of 10-minute prog epics to come.</p><p>
    
    Classicism extends to The Zombies' playing as well; they were formally trained musicians with overt interests
    in ""art music"" and jazz.  More overtly, there's the sectional composition of their songs, apparent in ""Changes"",
    which is most emblematic of the jarring cut-and-paste thematic shifts that separated the fans from the great
    unwashed.</p><p>
    
    This reissue, not to be confused with 1998's 30th anniversary import, is sharply re-mastered and contains
    bonus tracks produced and recorded by various Zombies shortly after their breakup.  The bonus material is
    welcome, offering fascinating distillations of each member's personality, although few listeners will
    probably care much about the archival mono mixes and edits of some tracks.</p><p>
    
    Though it may not represent the sprawling, tripped-out experimentation of their times, The Zombies' unique
    brand of lyric wit and daring arrangement expanded the limits of pop.  <i>Odessey and Oracle</i> stands as
    the band's fully realized statement of intent, the parting shot from one of the few originals in the
    devolving tail-end of the 1960s.</p></div>"|8959.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8959-odessey-and-oracle/|9.3|Liam Singer

Is there a better nickname for David Kilgour?  Maybe there's one only his close friends know,
    but for my money, as a listener, few titles could be more fitting.  For 2\xBD decades now, Kilgour has been to
    New Zealand indie pop the batter who hits .300 every season with 100 RBI, the nightwatchman that never misses
    a shift, the surgeon who never loses a patient.  These things don't make front-page news or win many awards,
    but they're admirable feats all the same, and ultimately, that kind of consistency is a huge accomplishment.
    Kilgour will never make the best album ever, or even the best album of the year, but when he heads into a
    studio with friends-- be they his long-running and hugely influential band The Clean, or just a one-time
    assemblage for a solo record-- the results are always impressively satisfying.</p><p>
    There's something very comfortable about <i>Frozen Orange</i>, Kilgour's sixth album under his given name--
    its sound is welcoming, almost casual, and its contains a fine clutch of compositions.  But while Kilgour's
    work boasts a workmanlike consistency, these songs are still clearly the result of careful craftsmanship.
    There's a tangible ebb and flow to his record, as Kilgour and a crew including Jason Loewenstein, Lambchop's
    Mark Nevers, Clockhammer's Matt Swanson, Alan Haig of The Verlaines and The Chills, and Tony Crow sculpt
    the dynamics of these songs to create an overarching contour for the album.</p><p>
    Songs like ""Everybody's on a Ride"" feel loose and relaxed, but the way the twangy guitar hook is punched
    up to the front of the mix in response to Kilgour's wispy intonation of the title reveals good planning.
    ""Living in Space"" is a sprightly, complex rocker, but its drive never spills over into aggression, and the
    sound is kept clean. In fact, distortion is hard to come by anywhere on <i>Frozen Orange</i>, and the
    raga-inspired instrumentals that dominated much of Kilgour's last album, <i>A Feather in the Engine</i>,
    are nowhere to be found.  This serves the songs well, and gives the album a tone rather akin to the
    underwater world depicted on its cover, tremolo being the main effect present on the guitars.</p><p>
    Also contributing to the album's strength as a complete piece is the deft sequencing.  ""Rolling"" is a great
    closer, with its easy-flowing guitar and piano motifs and Sam Baker's roomy drums bringing things down like
    the last call for beer at a summer deck party.  Its waltz beat also draws the album full circle to opener
    ""The Waltz"", which, true to its title, is a loping, three-to-the-bar tune spilling with spacey guitars and
    drifting vocals.  In between, there's nothing to complain about, as basically everything hits homelike it
    should, from the Caribbean beat of ""Gold in Sound"" to the spacey piano pop of ""G Major 7"".</p><p>
    Hence, Old Reliable.  I feel a little odd implying that Kilgour is old, as he hasn't reached the point of
    complacency or irrelevance that the word implies, but he's been with us for quite some time, and his mark
    looms so large on the New Zealand music scene that it's difficult not to think of him as an elder statesman.
    That said, he's fully earned the tag on <i>Frozen Orange</i>, and anyone looking for unpretentious, laidback
    and solid full-length is hereby invited to check out what's made Kilgour one our most consistent performers
    for 25 years.</p></div>"|4422.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4422-frozen-orange/|7.8|Joe Tangari

From Jeff Tweedy's inauspicious beginnings in Uncle Tupelo,
    to dusty latter day folksters like David Pajo and Will Oldham, the genre has always been haunted by detractors
    who yield the word like incriminating evidence.  If the indie music press shares one thing in common with
    the right-wing media juggernaut, it's its eager defamation of this innocuous onomatopoetic device.  Much
    like ""liberal"" in today's so-called political journalism, twang has come to mean something dirty among the
    critical elite.</p><p>
    
    Aside from the obvious imbecility of the idea that any singular element can be inherently bad in music,
    twang is a relatively harmless quality to vilify.  After all, the last thing one could call Ry Cooder's
    slide guitar meditations is pretentious.  In fact, alt-country was founded in part to counter the sort of
    discreet braggadocio so virulent in underground music.  The Court &amp; Spark certainly belong to this category,
    albeit cast down a somewhat more experimental tributary.  Conceived and reared in San Francisco, the band
    are as indebted to Cooder et al as anyone, and their vast soundscapes evoke untainted portraits of an Ol'
    West less steeped in folklore than shear, elemental love of life.  And yes, their songs twang along with
    the best of 'em; see their tender ""National Lights"", off 2001's <i>Bless You</i>, one of the exemplary
    y'allternative songs of the last few years, for proof.</p><p>
    
    But The Court &amp; Spark are so much more than twang, and it only takes a few bars of ""Invercargill"", the
    opening cut off the group's new EP, <i>Dead Diamond River</i>, for them to reiterate it.  Three years
    removed from their last full-length effort, the California quintet have had sufficient time to explore,
    hone, and expand their sound, and if this concise five-song collection is any indication, their forthcoming
    <i>Witch Season</i> LP should provide a more nuanced companion to the band's erstwhile work.</p><p>
    
    Of course, given the band's rootsy aesthetic, there are the haggard old tricks-- dolorous tempos, heart-rending
    vocal deliveries, and plenty of pedal steel (""Bar the Door, Davy"" even intercepts, verbatim, a riff from The
    Decemberists' ""Clementine"")-- but the band are adventurous enough in their retreads to revere a long lineage
    of forebears while simultaneously taking steps toward an advanced sound.  Aforementioned ""Invercargill""
    dabbles in mesmeric psych-folk atmospherics before performing an abrupt turnabout, dissolving inwardly,
    and emerging with a drowned-out rag that it rides to an anti-climax.  Before long, the amicable ""Lucia""
    cozies up to some bucolic acoustic fingering, and The Court &amp; Spark are back to being their humble old
    selves again.</p><p>
    
    But don't be fooled.  The Court &amp; Spark are a very sophisticated animal, and any intimations at simplicity
    are readily dispelled by the finesse of their arrangements.  What saves songs like ""Lucia"" from succumbing
    to vapidity is a keen sense of dynamics, and a killer knack for arranging familiar instruments.  Throughout
    <i>Dead Diamond River</i>, acoustic guitars, vibraphones, glockenspiels, pedal steels, organs, and analog
    synths intermingle with harmonious fluidity, resulting in a sum much greater than its parts.  You don't
    need to have seen San Francisco to appreciate their visceral orchestrations; like any successfully evocative
    folk music, the portraits the band etch are almost better than the real thing for their fictitiously preserved
    perfection.</p></div>"|1636.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1636-dead-diamond-river-ep/|7.4|Sam Ubl

    people, once a major mining center, but now completely devoid of functioning collieries.  Tourists know it
    for its pier, its outdoor market, and its proximity to lots of rolling north English countryside, while
    dweebs like me know it as the epicenter of Britain's Northern Soul scene, and for turning out The Verve
    and Witness UK (not to mention bubblegummers Kajagoogoo)-- all in all, not a bad chart showing for such a
    small town.  Well, now we can add hooky garage-rock to Wigan's extant mix of Northern Soul, majestic
    psychedelia, fizzy synth-pop, and stately Britannicana, courtesy of Moco.</p><p>
    
    Moco don't bear much resemblance to any of their hometown forebears, with a grimy sound worthy of those old boarded
    mining operations and a vocalist sure to have them labeled a North English Strokes.  I'm not sure vocalist
    Steve Jones' timbrel similarity to Julian Casablancas is intentional, though; he seems to be making an effort
    to distance himself from the comparison with a delivery that's far more engaged and enthusiastic.  However,
    producer Steve Kettle is doing him no favors by wrapping his voice up in Strokesian processing.  Indeed,
    those little numbers up there at the top of the review would be a few ticks higher if Jones had just gotten
    to go off like the Iggy descendant he seems to have lurking in him.</p><p>
    
    For their part, the rest of the band sound like the kind of act that could flatten a crowd in a pub, with a
    canny sense of dynamics and arrangement.  The guitars peel off riffs and drop them in your head's pop
    depository, and the band comes up with some clever turns in the middle of ""Dirty Love"", as the song veers
    into a frenetic march piled with xylophone, ooh-ing backing vox, and trumpet.  The guitar hooks of ""Baby
    When You Die"" have a <i>Rubber Soul</i> quality to them, but the song's highlight is actually its midsection
    build-up and crashing return to the chorus.  Songs are kept quick and to the point, with only one even
    flirting with the four-minute mark, and the album's half-hour total runtime makes it feel like a sugary
    punch in the arm-- it's not quite aggressive enough to knock your teeth out, but neither is it afraid to
    give you a decent bruising.</p><p>
    
    Ultimately, if Moco are to fully realize their potentially high ceiling, they'll have to step out from the
    garage a bit and allow themselves to be exposed as the fire-breathers they are behind the mask-- bassist
    Nick Higham and Simon Misra can bang, and I'd love to hear them shoved a little further in my face.  But
    as it stands, this is all talk for another time, as <i>Out to Go</i>, for all its sonic shortcomings,
    nonetheless sticks mightily to your ribs.</p></div>"|5601.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5601-out-to-go/|7.2|Joe Tangari

Beyond his painterly approach,     he's also taken conceits from John Cage, and strains of imaginary landscapes from shortwave radio, frantic     cartridge music crunch, indeterminacy, patches of 4'33"" non-silence, and prepared guitar strings abound     and commingle in his sound.  It makes him a guitar hero of the queerest sort, as most of today's players     still hesitate to explore such things as pick-ups' electromagnetic fields, or the effect that motor drones,     tongue depressors, and Brillo pads have on detuned strings.  Not until well into the 90s did Rowe even find     a generation of sympathetic ears, or international players with which to surround himself beyond the confines     of his main trio, AMM.</p>
<p>The Erstwhile label has often documented the meeting of elder statesman with younger minds, to startling     and sonically-challenging effect.  So to team him with Christian Fennesz, the gateway guitarist/Powerbook     player known for straddling noise and pop, is an intriguing move, as it could well introduce Rowe to a     slightly larger demographic-- particularly if the two were to incorporate more of Fennesz's shoegazing     ambient washes.  Additionally, it could offset the grumbles that Fennesz merely treaded water for his     follow-up to <i>Endless Summer</i>, rather than take his explorations further out for <i>Venice</i>.</p>
<p>While not their first meeting (both gents appeared alongside Pita, Pimmon, and Oren Ambarchi for 2000's     <i>Afternoon Tea</i>), it is their first performance as a duo.  Unfortunately, with the ferocious crackle     and piercing frequencies that tear open this 2002 live performance in Nantes, France, it appears that     they're headed for decidedly rocky and difficult terrain.  Over the course of this 43-minute excursion,     the topography of the performance more closely resembles that of the music of Keith Rowe's other duos, as     the two favor textures, rumbling drones, and physical crackles, as well as sampled bits of shortwave radio     (a mainstay of most Rowe performances).  Sadly, the most striking feature on display here is a curious     instance of cheap drum machine patter.</p>
<p>Fennesz subsumes himself throughout, reacting more to Rowe and manipulating that input rather than injecting     his poignant melodicism and own talent for sonic landscaping.  Instead of the dynamics of vistas and valleys     that enrich Fennesz's solo work-- which could have brought a refreshing change to the world of electro-acoustic     improv-- the performance remains at a tepid, level plane, settling into a comfortable bed of indistinct noise     that rarely changes, much less suggests the pedigree of the gentlemen at play, and fades away long before the     disc clicks to a close.</p></div>"|6849.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6849-live-at-the-lu-with-christian-fennesz/|6.4|Andy Beta

    Blue Cheer albums, because from here on in, y'all shall be measured against <i>Blue Cathedral</i>, Comets
    on Fire's blistering full-length number three.</p><p>
    
    Hyperbole's a scam-- and most shameful in the voice of a seasoned critic-- but from the initial sawhorse
    pummeling of ""The Bee and the Cracking Egg"" to the last-gasp strains of ""Blue Tomb"", it's clear this intense
    collection commands a sense of largess, as well as some sort of mystically heightened language.  With all
    sincerity, I can report that these sludge denizens have burnt-to-a-crisp every ounce of ashy acidic energy
    currently floating around the hazy rock 'n' roll atmosphere.  Though Ethan Miller and Ben Flashman formed
    Comets on Fire less than five years ago, these hymns feel centuries old: Sometimes bludgeoning, always
    regal, <i>Blue Cathedral</i> is a calcified, hippified holy place.  Begin your pilgrimage...</p><p>
    
    Expanding the multi-textured promise of <i>Field Recordings from the Sun</i>, here Comets throw down even
    more explosive hyperactivity.  Still nodding to Pink Floyd, Iron Butterfly, Led Zeppelin, Hawkwind, and
    the less known sounds of Monoshock, the crew lights out into its own sweaty territory.  With these eight
    tracks, the quintet's completed an impressive transformation from crunchy garage-rock stonemasons cribbing
    tropes to heady, mathy <i>enfant terribles</i> decimating Freakout City, USA.</p><p>
    
    Like <i>Field Recordings</i>, <i>Blue Cathedral</i> was recorded at Louder Studios by The Fucking Champs'
    Tim Green-- so there's really no explanation as to why these sounds are so stadium-sized and crystal clear.
    Better mics?  A new dose of inspiration?  More likely, it's the official addition of Six Organs of Admittance
    raga whiz Ben Chasny on guitar two.  He'd played with the band in the past, but now that he calls himself a
    bona fide Comet, perhaps he's allowing himself a few more aesthetic liberties.  Or maybe, <i>just maybe</i>,
    leaving Santa Cruz for San Francisco and Oakland offered differently processed water and a worthwhile change
    of scenery.  Whatever the case, the Bay Area group's purity of intention and sound is stronger here than on
    any previous offering.</p><p>
    
    Musically, there are a bevy of fierce rockers, occasional saxophone distress signals, blissful chill zones:
    The instrumental, ""Pussy Footin' the Duke"" drifts into a relaxed milky way space probe with regal organ
    breakdowns, tender ebony-and-ivory arpeggios, and a my-guitar-gently-weeps melodic sense.  As such a title
    would suggest, ""Whiskey River"" features gravelly rock vocals and frolicking echoplex that twists and darts
    within an overhauled Southern rock template; it dissolves into the wistful ""Organ"", an anomalously brief,
    melancholic fit of stargazing.  The spiraling asteroids of ""Brotherhood of the Harvest"" performs triumphant
    astronomy-- I can see the metal guys getting teary over its discordant-to-majestic ebbs and flows. The
    knockout punch, ""Blue Bomb"" whips up the most languidly, ecstatic opus of a career built upon such
    outer-realm ecstasy: Lay back and whittle acid-rock and solar boogie-woogie notations on the surface of
    the sun as it expands.</p><p>
    
    Beyond individual tracks, <i>Blue Cathedral</i> is a well-curated whole: The song cycle mixes noise and
    rest with stops on a dime-- in the midst of a sludgy solo, a hook dismantles itself and reforms, turning
    repetition into mantra.  Living up to their evocative name, Comets on Fire's music is loud and harsh, and
    despite that Miller's screamed lyrics are largely indecipherable, <i>Blue Cathedral</i> is surprisingly
    not at all difficult.</p><p>
    
    Avoiding sentimentality and the weight of an overblown intellectual message, this
    hedonistic outing could bring fans of all persuasions together as one tinnitus-toting family: stoners,
    indie rockers, metal heads, classic rock fans, open-minded gutter punks, non-ironic mullet owners, and
    even your older sister will join hands and find some riff or virtuosic accent to hold close to their heart
    and enjoy.  In anticipation of that inspired moment, lift up your warm brews and repeat after me: Here's
    to the hard rock album of the summer and the backyard barbecues it will inspire, and to uncontested tofu
    pups basting alongside all-beef hot dogs, forever and ever, amen.</p></div>"|1563.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1563-blue-cathedral/|8.5|Brandon Stosuy

To me, they represent one of the worst possible manifestations of unfettered personal expression, a noxiously cheeky release of pent-up inhibitions.  I like to think my problem with these groups lies mainly with the material they perform, and isn't just some blind phobia or intrinsic prejudice, but until now, I've never had any solid evidence to back me up.  The Futureheads' self-titled debut not only affirms my journalistic integrity, but justifies what is essentially a totally groundless position.  While not a cappella, per se, The Futureheads are endowed with a gift for gilt vocal harmonies not far removed from that tradition, and they've just made one of my favorite pop records this year.</p><p>  The Futureheads aren't looking to raze any musical foundations; they've simply put their ample vocal talents in a novel context: Their record recalls nothing so much as The Whiffenpoofs and The Lemon Drops of this world, if greatly scuzzed-up and adorned by jangly guitars and ferocious drumwork.  Like 70s post-punks Wire, The Futureheads show little regard for traditional verse/chorus/verse structure.  Rather, they indulge in multi-section pieces that rapidly cover an immense amount of ground.  The album's runtime speaks to how much they accomplish with this method: 14 tracks and a surplus of ideas in 33 fast minutes. What's more, almost the entire first three-quarters of the album is single-ready material, including an actual foray into a cappella (""Danger of the Water"") and the massively anthemic ""Carnival Kids"", one of the truly great songs I've heard in some time.</p><p>  The album opens with a stellar triptych of songs that recalls and even, arguably, surmounts the best work of 70s pop/punk icons The Jam and The A's.  But if tracks such as the blithely anthemic ""Robot"" and the unrepentantly chorus-milking ""A to B"" smack of bands 30 years bygone, The Futureheads manage to incorporate a series of startlingly fresh flourishes into their fast-paced pop: Leadoff track ""Le Garage"" temporarily rides on stuttering martial drumming before resuming its determined stomp; the background vocals alternate between vintage punk shouts and chorused reiterations of the lead vocal line; and a three-second breakdown between the verse and chorus loops an unintelligible distorted phrase like an extended rhythmic fill</p><p>  Indeed, the vocals are the uncontested centerpiece here, evoking a decidedly Anglo brattiness, but the band's angular guitar/drum interplay provides an equally impressive framework, summoning a Gang of Four more interested in delivering sparkling melody.  (Coincidentally, the Four's Andy Gill produced five of the album's tracks.)  Here, The Futureheads prove themselves as tight as Dischord's finest post-punks, with the riffs and hooks necessary to flesh out their raw technical skill.</p><p>  My complaints with this record are small ones, but nevertheless detract-- if just marginally-- from its overall success.  The album is frontloaded to a degree, as is the apparent protocol in these days of quotidian rock parvenus.  For all its shining moments, <em>The Futureheads</em> would have been doubly impressive had the band cut out filler like the admittedly naive ""Stupid and Shallow"" or the melodically lacking ""Trying Not to Think About It"".  Even so, I'm hard-pressed to think of many albums of this stripe from the past few years that aren't similarly spotty, right down to potential classics like <em>Is This It</em> or <em>Mclusky Do Dallas</em>.</p><p>  The Futureheads are at their weakest when they abandon vocal harmonies in favor of a more direct melodic approach; their greatest strength lies in their utilization of voice as a distinct melodic instrument in a loud, often strident context.  Instead of affecting wanting vocals in a stylized atonal mishmash (as unskilled punk and pop/punk vocalists often resort to doing), The Futureheads rely on actual chops and the kind of melodic astuteness usually associated with piano-pop balladeers, and in doing so, they exhibit complete control over their music and intertwining vocal deliveries.  Like a Greg Maddux of pop/punk, the band show an unassuming hand, but the erudite skill with which they deliver what may initially sound like run-of-the-mill concoctions is surprisingly potent and defiantly consistent.</p><p> </p></div>"|3316.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3316-the-futureheads/|8.3|Sam Ubl

    look good, because your niche tastes set you apart, and because your music snobbery won't allow you to enjoy
    anything that's on the radio.  But you probably wish, for the one or two best unknown bands that you've
    discovered, that more people had heard them.  A band like that never leaves behind enough recordings.  They
    put out more home-burned CD-Rs or hand-labeled cassettes than actual CDs, score an indie label deal that
    falls apart one album later, and only make it into the studio by the time that their set has changed three
    times, leaving all the early songs in the dustbin.  You know what the rest of the world is missing, but
    you have no proof.</p><p>
    
    So I'll admit my heart went out to AUM Fidelity's Steven Joerg when he told me that he actually founded his
    label with the hopes of finishing this project, a multi-disc collection of music by Chicago's Shrimp Boat.
    And the final product is the kind of compilation that's better than the sum of its recordings.  In 3 CDs
    (4 if you get a copy with the bonus disc), <i>Something Grand</i> features entirely out-of-print or unreleased
    material, without repeating any of the songs on the two Shrimp Boat records that are still in print.
    (<i>Duende</i> and <i>Cavale</i>, on Bar/None, are both highly recommended, but only offer a snapshot
    band's history.  <i>Something Grand</i> documents the whole story.)</p><p>
    
    Shrimp Boat remain a legend from the start of Chicago's early 90s rock renaissance, flourishing right before
    <i>Billboard</i> put the city on the map as a post-Seattle grunge factory; Shrimp Boat's Brad Wood recorded
    and played with Liz Phair, among others, and Sam Prekop and Eric Claridge went on to form The Sea &amp; Cake,
    which includes John McEntire, who plays with all of the bands that, like them or not, make up the Chicago
    post-rock scene.</p><p>
    
    As the root of all of these influences, Shrimp Boat is better known by reputation than recordings.  The
    three high-minded art school students who formed the band in 1985 proudly didn't know their instruments.
    (That was also a requirement for Wood, a successful recording engineer who had learned the drums after
    the other members dragged him into the band.)  The earliest recordings, which feature the line-up of Ian
    Schneller, Sam Prekop and David Kroll, are acoustic and shambolic, kicking off the set with the tunelessly
    meandering banjo on ""Rocks are Oil"", the hypnotically circular ""Collecting Me"" with Kroll's keening,
    inexpert saxophone, or the midget-army martial drums on ""Only Making Fools"".  The songs sound exactly like
    when your roommate who's learning guitar finds four notes that sound great together and repeats them until
    you're sick, except they're great; and Prekop's slurred vocals distort the lyrics-- which, according to
    the Miles-Davis-box-set-quality liner notes, were mostly made up back then anyway.</p><p>
<i>Something Grand</i> also includes tape collage experiments, most tiresomely on a 12-minute instrumental
    that slouches across Ollie North's Iran-Contra testimony, but these art-school excesses are shunted aside
    by the short and deeply unpretentious songwriting that the band once described as ""Midwestern folk.""  The
    liner notes describe the ""circle dances"" that would spontaneously start at their gigs at Phyllis' Musical
    Inn, where the open-faced friendliness that covered their harsh noise noodling would inspire the crowd to
    dance and stomp together around the bar.  The first disc is full of these pieces, some better than others,
    and many of them come from the barely released cassettes that the band sold at gigs.</p><p>
    
    The earliest Shrimp Boat shows were long, improvised jams that cleared out many pretentious loft parties,
    but by the time they started recording to four-track, they were writing actual songs and assembling actual
    sets.  Discs two and three introduce them as a ""real band,"" through live recordings from clubs and college
    radio sets, and outtakes from their two main long-players.  <i>Duende</i> and <i>Cavale</i> collected the
    strongest of the band's material, and discs two and three of <i>Something Grand</i> admittedly focus on
    outtakes and oddities-- Wood and Joe Vajarsky on sax unwinding with ""I Loves You, Porgy"", or experiments
    with the vocal tracks from ""Limerick"" and ""Oranges"".</p><p>
    
    But this is more than a B-sides collection.  Hearing the band evolve on these albums helps explain the wild
    stylistic leaps from pop to rock to blue-eyed soul on <i>Cavale</i>, and the concerts-- ""Medea Rising"" or
    ""Draught '43"", where the crowd's shouts punctuate the song-- capture the live side of the band.  Shrimp
    Boat became clean and tight, and Prekop's idiosyncratic voice has more confidence, finessing his barks and
    yelps while developing the gaspy credulity and breathy wonder that dominate his style today.</p><p>
    
    The real odds and sods are confined to the bonus disc, which ships with the first 2,000 copies of the set.
    This fourth disc includes a lot of sludgy old recordings and working tapes, as well as some strong,
    straightforward live cuts.  Listening to this material can make you wonder: What if they had simplified
    the jams, streamlined Prekop's emoting and turned into the Dave Matthews Band?  Or dumbed down to dirgey
    rock songs and fallen in line behind Veruca Salt and Red Red Meat to make a small dent on alternative
    radio?  What would Beavis and Butthead have done with a video for ""Free Love Overdrive""?</p><p>
    
    ""Chicago's Shrimp Boat are the best band on the planet,"" gasped <i>CMJ</i> in 1990.  (And you thought
    Pitchfork was hyperbolic.)  But before they could take over, tensions inside the band caused first Brad
    Wood to quit, and then the rest of the members to disband.  The Sea &amp; Cake retains the unironic pleasure
    of Shrimp Boat's material, but refines it to glass-like perfection on their laptop-on-the-beach albums,
    like last year's <i>One Bedroom</i>.  Ian Schneller went on to form Falstaff, and build musical instruments
    under the company name Specimen Products.  Brad Wood now produces records in L.A., and although his early
    work with Liz Phair-- like the barest tracks on <i>Whip-Smart</i>-- evoked some of Shrimp Boat's later,
    hazy afternoon-on-Milwaukee-Avenue laziness, he most recently got acclaim off-Broadway for producing the
    soundtrack to <i>Hedwig and the Angry Inch</i>.  David Kroll quit the band even earlier, to paint, and his
    recent work graces the covers of this set.</p><p>
    
    If this box set were a movie, it would tell your generic coming-of-age story-- except that most bands at
    this level never tell the whole story, except through the occasional bonus demo tracks.  <i>Something Grand</i>
    is more than a scrapbook: It completes the fossil record of a legendary indie rock group, sets the trajectories
    for the guys who learned to make music in this band, and revives four hours of floor-beating, drunkenly
    whirling, homemade Midwestern circle dances.</p></div>"|7770.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7770-something-grand/|8.0|Chris Dahlen

<i>Chilltown</i> opens with an impressive agenda.  Against the dreary MIDI brass and pale keys of ""Home"",
    Sermon drifts from one critique to another, boasting that he's one of the last old heads yet to be snared
    in gilded web of commercial hip-pop: ""You won't hear the bling or the champagne.  Nuttin'/ Won't hear a
    nigga on the microphone frontin'/ And no love songs, I'm not serenadin'/ I'm just narratin' the streets
    on my beat.""  Without naming names, Sermon makes his mission clear: to snatch back hip-hop at any cost.
    Two tracks later, on ""Relentless"", he spits pure fire, volleys another diatribe against the industry, and
    restates his thesis, claiming to ""punish the game for its foul behavior.""</p><p>
    
    What separates Sermon from his pedantic underground counterparts who hopelessly eschew the mainstream with
    an unwavering (and often obnoxious) conviction is that he treats his genre as a fallen and commodified art,
    yet still acknowledges its beauty and potential.  His production credits for headliners like Jay-Z and Ja
    Rule may reek of contradiction but Sermon dissipates any wisp of duplicity with the Judeo-Christian credo:
    Don't hate the player, hate the game.  Filling the Kanye-inhabited space between mainstream and underground,
    Erick Sermon further blurs the line by adopting the timeless ethos of sniping sucka MCs while still opening
    his doors to a polished commercial thump.</p><p>
    
    Besides, you can't hate E-dub; he's just too nice on the mic.  Sermon boasts both his production and rapping
    talents on ""Wit EE's"", rocking against a dancing, wood-percussion club banger and flaunting microphone
    gymnastics with ease.  He dismisses any potential opponent with two 16-bar dynamos, rhyming each one with
    the song's title.  On ""Chillin'"", Sermon, Talib Kweli, and Rah Digga (er, Whip Montez) deliver animated
    verses over sparse, tinkling bleeps and a loitering breakbeat, weaving seamlessly with each alternating
    verse.  Sermon puts his authenticity plainly: ""I sound like me/ You sound like Jay-Z.""</p><p>
    
    No doubt, <i>Chilltown</i> consistently delivers solid hip-hop cuts.  But in comparison to his 2002 release
    <i>React</i>, Sermon's well of creativity might be running dry.  For a producer who's pushed the past decade
    just as much as he's adapted to it, Sermon is starting to show his age.  When he showcases the funk on tracks
    like ""Feel It"", the man can't be touched.  But when he tries his hand at hip-hop soul on ""Do You Know"", he
    can only muster a lazy derivative with Dahlia Anderson doing karaoke Mary J. Blige.  And although Sermon
    splits his time between New York and Atlanta, you wouldn't know it from ""Future Thug"", on which he
    overcompensates with greasy organs and makeshift scratching, only adding to the growing list of listless
    Southern bounce tracks.</p><p>
    
    Still, <i>Chilltown</i> charts more wins than losses, giving us a taste of Sermon's home-cooked, bass-heavy
    goodness.  Although his versatility is peerless, it's scary to thank that E. soon might not have anything
    left to say in the booth or on the boards.  Sermon could easily drop dozens better-than-average releases
    until R. Kelly learns to read, but unless he finds another patent, we can only expect more of the same.
    Sermon's had a long, successful career: If he wants us to remember his best, he'll make <i>Chilltown</i>
    his last.</p></div>"|7769.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7769-chilltown-new-york/|7.4|Jamin Warren

Then kind of lean back, take a bite of food (if     available), and confidently intone, ""I don't get it.""  It's the phrase surest to infuriate somebody who's     spent hours in the basement attempting to pour the contents of their head into a perceptible form.  And     though I used to nod appreciatively for fear of seeming stupid, it's also the way I once felt about a lot     of abstract, texture-based music that was presented to me-- anything from Black Dice and the No-Neck Blues     Band to John Zorn, Stockhausen, and Xenakis.  Without objective criteria like virtuosity, beauty, or     complexity with which to judge its quality, I felt I was missing something that others could hear, some     scale on which to separate works of genius from the incoherent stabs of a musician incapable of anything     else.</p>
<p>Of course, when I succeeded in relaxing and opening my mind to such music, I realized that there really is     an easy scale of quality-- whether or not anything about it makes you want to listen again once it's over.     I came to understand that if the journey created in such works is worth taking again, for any reason, then     its value is determined by your level of interest.  I offer my own revelations to clarify the compliment,     then, when I say that D. Yellow Swans make sprawling, noise-based pieces, half-organized out of improv     sessions, that I'm interested in hearing repeatedly.</p>
<p>D. Yellow Swans, comprised of Gabriel Mindel and Peter Swanson, formed about three years ago in Portland,     Oregon, and have recently relocated to the Bay Area.  Though they began with structured experiments in     aggro punk, they became increasingly interested in the results of their improvisations, and adopted a     freer, textured, drone-driven sound that might just establish them as a jam-band for the Lightning Bolt     set.  Their music still contains elements of punk, but it's punk pried apart and splattered across     15-minute canvasses.</p>
<p>Though they don't shy away from the abrasive, their style channels the psychedelic     sprawl of Yume Bitsu as much as the feedback walls of Thurston Moore (whom they've opened for).  And D.     Yellow Swans are all about uplift.  Their stated goal is attaining ""Freedom, Happiness, Love, and the     sharing and incitement of these feelings in others.  Positivity.  Total Liberation.""  The band's first     proper release will be out soon on the Narnack label, but they've been selling the self-released <i>Duh     Yellow Swans</i> on their recent tours and over the web.</p>
<p>As dissimilar as certain sonic aspects of D. Yellow Swans are to Tortoise and their Thrill Jockey labelmates,     such music shares a common principle of process over material-- that is, the nature of the musical building     blocks they begin with aren't as important as the manner in which they're manipulated.  This focus on evolution     and texture, as well as a struggle to remain open to all musical directions, is what gives the pieces     their sense of coherent expansiveness.  In the music of D. Yellow Swans, disparate, seemingly aimless     musical elements drift together and coalesce into a block of sound.  Seamless transitions usher you from     one place to the next, until you find yourself in an entirely new landscape.  As in Tortoise's ""Djed"",     the context is constantly widened, nothing beyond manipulation or reconsideration.  The two nameless pieces     of <i>Duh</i> are built out of guitars, samples, amplifier hums, drum machines, effects processors, and,     when the spirit moves them, garbled screaming.  They move from atmospheric drones to Boredoms-style chanting     and pounding, fearless of either extreme.</p>
<p><i>Duh Yellow Swans</i> is clearly an early album from two people who are still fully learning what makes the     other musically tick, but such apparent conflict gives the music a palpable feel of its creation.  D. Yellow     Swans are struggling to free all possibilities in playing and listening, and convert those who might not perk     up at the mention of ""improvised noise.""  <i>Duh</i> demonstrates their propensity to head any number of     directions, and if they don't get too caught up in defining themselves then they'll be able to take them     all at once.</p></div>"|8910.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8910-duh-yellow-swans/|7.1|Liam Singer

Changing personas like t-shirts, Madlib has produced a rich,     impressive body of work, breaking boundaries and pushing his genre forward with the restless ease of a     prodigy.  His credentials are stellar: His jazzy, rough-edged production has been the driving force behind     Madvillain, Lootpack, Quasimoto, and a slew of major hip-hop luminaries.  But it's not Madlib's talent that's     in question on his latest release, <i>Tribute to Brother Weldon</i>-- it's his discretion.</p>
<p>It's hard to figure out who to blame for this washout.  When he fell back into the Bomb Shelter studio at     Chateau Stones Throw to meditate on the death of one of his heroes, Madlib was most likely experiencing     less a moment of inspiration than a period of mourning.  Critically acclaimed keyboardist and composer     Weldon Irvine helped set the stage for the soul jazz that came to dominate seminal 70s jazz labels like     CTI and Prestige, and had lauded Madlib's work under the Yesterdays New Quintet moniker.  After Irvine's     suicide in 2002, Madlib produced a suite of songs inspired by Irvine and his adventurous bridging of James     Brown-style soul and improvisational jazz.  These tracks sat for two years before Stones Throw, presumably     with his blessing, released them earlier this month.</p>
<p>Recorded under the name of one of his fictional Yesterdays New Quintet bandmates, <i>Tribute to Brother     Weldon</i> is nothing short of baffling.  These songs billow out like a nebulous cloud, thick with swirling     eddies of meandering percussion and fleeting splashes of melody, but the storm never comes.  Madlib is     reaching for the expansive free jazz of Pharaoh Sanders and the electric funk of Eddie Harris, but without     the direction provided by their blazing solos, the music just blows over.  I'm still trying to pick out     high points, or at least notable moments, but these sketches are too indistinct.  Why he would go this     murky route in tribute to a deeply lyrical soloist like Irvine is a mystery.</p>
<p>Still, the album carries a vaguely reverential tone, as if Madlib were glancing towards the heavens for a     sign yet to come. The instrumentation is diverse-- at one point or another he noodles on kalimba (thumb     piano), flute (or synth?), Rhodes, and Hammond, and contributes indeterminate electronic murmurs from his     reliable Roland 303.  The beats he sets in motion on each track almost approach a formal structure, and     technically sound great-- muffled bass drums, cowbell, woodblock, and hand drums all get a spin-- but they     never fully gel or form complete melodies.</p>
<p>A song-by-song breakdown is sort of pointless, as every distinctive glimmer flashes and is gone before settling     into the consciousness, but I'll give it a shot:  The blubbery analog throb of ""A Piece for Brother Weldon""     adds interesting texture, as do the song's tweeting high-end keys, and there's a brief commingling of sounds     that, in a rare moment of clarity, actually make sense.  ""Time"" stirs with layers of keys and organ dappled     by chimes and shakers, spotlighting Madlib's gift for intriguing arrangements, but, like all of these tracks,     does so without a satisfying buildup or resolution.  A warm rush of bass and pitch-shifted keys opens     ""Nodlew's Sea"", and its somewhat consistent, mellow mood is a welcome (if temporary) refuge.  ""Welldone""     builds a narcotic haze on atmospheric effects, and the opening bass and rimshot beat of ""Keys"" shows promise     but quickly reveals a half-finished idea.  In fairness, any sliver of song taken outside the album's context     could entice listeners, as all the right elements for an intriguing jazz record are in place.  But for heads     looking for beats, rhymes, or life-- even the minimalist kind found on Yesterdays New Quintet's recent <i>Stevie</i> album-- 65 minutes of freeform Madlibbing will likely be too much to stomach.</p>
<p>Madlib has said of his music, ""I'm just trying to get it done and go to the next.""  Studio time is for     rehearsal time, basically, for someone so endlessly prolific.  And that's exactly what this experiment     sounds like: a rehearsal that was probably never meant to see the light of day.  Fortunately, his brilliance     is so formidable that even a bruiser like this one won't do him much harm.  <i>Tribute</i> might be a chink     in his armor, but Madlib is on a personal musical crusade that demands he never look back.</p></div>"|8882.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8882-a-tribute-to-brother-weldon/|5.5|Jonathan Zwickel

    singer/songwriter Davíd Garza has two histories.  The first and generally accepted history, chronicled
    on albums, in press materials, and in magazine articles, goes something like this: A very young Garza
    started playing Deep Ellum bars before he was old enough to get past the bouncers, opening for local and
    national acts.  He played with the lamentably named acoustic band Twang Twang Shock-A-Boom before striking
    out on his own.  His first two albums, <i>Eyes Wide Open</i> and <i>Culture Vulture</i> were bubblegummy
    mishmashes of ebullient pop music, jam band rhythms, and occasional Tejano flourishes and were popular on
    the college circuit during the early '90s.</p><p>
    Around the time his non-local fans were graduating and earning
    their own disposable income, Garza abruptly switched styles on the leaden <i>Blind Hips in Motion</i>,
    whose most redeeming aspect was that it led directly to his major-label debut, <i>This Euphoria</i>, on
    Lava/Atlantic.  Despite falling off toward the end, <i>This Euphoria</i>-- especially the single ""Discoball
    World""-- captured the more motional style of his early recordings without losing any imaginativeness.
    After relocating to Los Angeles, Garza sat in with the likes of Jon Brion, Rhett Miller, and Fiona Apple
    at Largo and occasionally in the studio.  Though his second major-label album, <i>Overdub</i>, earned a
    spot on <i>The New York Times</i>' top ten albums of 2001 list, the record didn't fare well commercially,
    and recently, he was cut loose from Atlantic.</p><p>
    If that history tells a linear story of artistic development and frustration, <i>A Strange Mess of Flowers</i>,
    Garza's first release since the dissolution of his major-label contract, documents a very different story--
    one less dependent on industry machinations.  From 1990 on, Garza has been recording prodigiously and
    assembling songs onto unofficial albums and EPs that he sells at shows and through his website; it's a
    not-unheard-of practice, but it's perhaps the one constant in a career seemingly defined by restless musical
    nomadism.  <i>A Strange Mess of Flowers</i> collects 71 of these rare tracks over four discs and one DVD.
    Some are early versions of songs that saw official release on proper albums, but most of them are commercially
    available for the first time.  Longtime fans will be fascinated; first-time listeners may be intimidated by
    the bulk of material.</p><p>
    What makes the collection more than just another catch-all comp is its organization: Instead of ordering the
    tracks chronologically or as they appeared on the original albums (which would have been intriguing, although
    less rewarding), Garza shuffles them all together, in no discernible order.  As a result, <i>A Strange Mess
    of Flowers</i> gently reinterprets his decade-and-a-half career, revealing the similarities between his
    myriad styles and sounds.</p><p>
    Beneath this immense shuffle of songs lies a career that has evolved dramatically over 15 years, from bouncy
    pop to more sonically inventive dance-inflected grooves.  To a large degree, it's the difference between songs
    developed on stage and tracks developed in the studio.  His early material, like ""Conmigo"", ""Butterflies""
    and ""My Sister"", possesses an exuberance derived perhaps from the need to entertain audiences impatient for
    headliners.  His more recent material has a very different energy, perhaps born out of the confines of the
    studio.  But he never lost his strong sense of melody, his ululating vocal style, or his penchant for clever
    lyrics (""If you're looking for that blind love/ Mine's deaf and dumb, too"" from ""Your Sister's Leopard Coat"")
    and biblical imagery (""She parts the oceans like she parts her hair"" from ""Jezebel Grin"").  If his early
    material occasionally sounds saccharine, his more experimental stuff can tax listeners' patience, and some
    of his 2003 L.A. sessions-- especially the KDRN tracks-- are much too conceptual to be rewarding to much of
    anyone other than him.</p><p>
<i>A Strange Mess of Flowers</i> erases the straight line of evolution from early to recent material,
    setting songs from every point in his career side by side and creating fascinating parallels and
    intersections between them all.  If <i>Eyes Wide Open</i> and <i>Overdub</i> sound almost irreconcilably
    different, the tracks from those periods meld nicely here, complimenting each other in surprising ways and
    revealing the consistent human voice and imagination behind them.  For instance, ""Neva"", recorded in 2003,
    shuffles along on staticky production and Garza's murkily intoned verse, as if trying to shake a postmillennial
    dread through lyrics that reference Radiohead, Autechre, and The Heartbreakers.  It's immediately followed
    by ""Butterflies"", recorded 13 years prior, which marries organic dance rhythms and major-key melodies to
    verses about hopelessness and betrayal.  Played back to back, the former brings out the sour lyrics behind
    the latter's upbeat melody, while ""Butterflies"" highlights the strange two-part structure of ""Neva"" as well
    as the low-key rhythmic progressions that churn against Garza's voice.</p><p>
    With each listen, <i>A Strange Mess of Flowers</i> posits new juxtapositions, so that it seems to mutate
    over time, never a set thing but always challenging the listener's ear.  To an extent, the collection is
    a triumph of sequencing, which excuses throwaway tracks and half-baked ideas because they play so well
    against the more solid songs.  As a result, it never sounds like history disinterred, but history reinterpreted
    and revised: the culmination of an intensely creative career that makes most sense when heard out of order.</p></div>"|3644.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3644-a-strange-mess-of-flowers/|7.4|Stephen M. Deusner

At least, that's how it began.  ""Side
    project"" implies something peripheral-- a catchall for fallout from the main band's songwriting process,
    an opportunity for collaboration and stylistic deviation (e.g. The Postal Service or Gorillaz), or a
    lower-profile testing ground for experiments that might besmirch the reputation of the primary project.
    Often, side projects are like the aberrant pieces that well-known writers publish in low-circulation
    literary journals, or genre fiction published under a pseudonym.  But sometimes, they accumulate gravitas
    until it's difficult to qualify them as side projects, unless the term simply describes a band the artist
    formed while already in another band, which seems fatuous.  The Shins, for example, began as a Flake Music
    side project, but we'd hardly consider it one now.</p><p>
    
    With a volume of output that nearly equals Cursive's, a solidified line-up, and a feeling of completion
    that amplifies with each release, The Good Life have made the transition from side project to independent
    entity.  This wasn't always the case.  The first Good Life album, <em>Novena on a Nocturn</em>, was a
    prototypical side project-- a record of fluttery boudoir ephemera; remnants scraped from the mental sieve
    that caught whatever grains of song wouldn't sift into Cursive's oeuvre.  But even then, The Good Life was
    more than Cursive's rough drafts, with an emphasis on starry ballads and minimal electronic embellishments.</p><p>
    
    The second Good Life LP, <em>Black Out</em>, saw those appended beep-tracks insinuated more deeply into the
    songs' spinal columns to become structurally integral.  Its recurrent ""Black Out"" motif and intricate
    dynamics lent it a ""front project"" feel, yet it was still distinguished from Cursive by its splintered,
    percolating electronica, and a guitar sound that bent toward the stadium anthem more than dissonant, prickly
    hardcore.</p><p>
<em>Lovers Need Lawyers</em>, a teaser EP for the new Good Life full-length due out in August, is ballasted by
    both of Kasher's constant themes-- the inevitable failure of romantic relationships and the futility of art.
    And it downplays the importance of its electronic trappings, focusing on verse/chorus dynamics in a manner
    that approaches traditional guitar rock and indie pop.</p><p>
    
    ""Leaving Omaha"" opens the disc with melancholy strumming and Kasher's tormented version of twangy arena rock,
    teetering on the brink between restless road song and jaded hometown elegy. ""Entertainer"" exemplifies his
    ""beat them to the punch"" mentality.  ""I'm not an artist, I'm an asshole without a job.../ Making money off
    of calling myself out,"" he sings, the harsh sentiment jarringly juxtaposed with a swinging, peppy melody.
    There's a cognitive short circuit built into these lyrics: Like Dave Eggers' <em>Heartbreaking Work</em>,
    every sin of solipsism or over-self-consciousness of which the author might be accused is admitted to
    (therefore forgiven?) in advance, and the effect is like looking at an object between opposing mirrors,
    infinitely regressing into complete metaphysical abstraction.</p><p>
    
    The title track yokes Ray Manzarek keyboards
    to choppy guitar chords and Kasher's wheedling plaints.  And ""Friction!"" is an unexpected bleat of punk
    rock amid all this sardonic Americana, its ardently screamed chorus emphasizing the tossed-off, bone-tired
    quality of the other songs.  It may seem as if a record that leaves the listener feeling so vaguely
    apathetic and depressed should deserve a lower rating, but the music is well-composed, and we must rate
    it according to what it sets out to accomplish, which seems to be to pummel us into jaded submission.  On
    that score, it succeeds admirably.</p></div>"|3645.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3645-lovers-need-lawyers-ep/|7.3|Brian Howe

The Brazilian (with a stopover in Salvador) singer, guitarist and composer has floored     me over the last couple of years with records like 1972's <i>Se o Caso é Chorar</i>, 1973's <i>Todos os Olhos</i>,     1976's <i>Estudando o Samba</i> and 1978's <i>Correio da Estação do Brás</i>-- all featuring his buoyant,     idiosyncratic songs and peculiar takes on traditional Brazilian folk music.  In the early 60s, he made a     name for himself among musicians by performing with icons Caetano Veloso and Gilberto Gil in Salvador,     playing in musicals, which led to the lot of them being courted by RCA as solo artists.  Yet, despite a     background in both folk and classical music, Zé's music was virtually ignored outside of his peers.</p>
<p>Though his first solo LP was released in 1968, it wasn't until David Byrne issued a greatest hits set in     1990 on Luaka Bop that Zé received anything close to his due.  In fact, for much of the 80s, Zé was retired     from music, working as a gas station attendant for his nephew.  Byrne had Arto Lindsay supply info on the     all-but-lost composer, and over the course of the 90s, Zé was transformed from obscure cult figure into     revered songwriter, rightly placed alongside his early collaborators Veloso and Gil.  I can say that I have     yet to hear a bad record by the guy, including his 90s comeback albums <i>Hips of Tradition</i> (1992) and     <i>Fabrication Defect: Com Defeito de Fabricao</i> (1998).  Strike that.  I have yet to hear a Zé record     that wasn't pretty great-- and in light of Animal Collective's recent Brazilian odd-ysseys, now is as good     a time as any to seek out one of the country's original outsiders.</p>
<p><i>Santagustin</i> finds Zé returning to his roots in theater, as he teams with composer Gilberto Assis to     provide music for the ballet troupe Grupo Corpo.  Ballet?  Yes, but check it: It's got homemade answering     machine IDM, discordant guitars and flutes with ""Tom Sawyer"" drums, non-discordant guitars and mandolins     that will appeal to the same sect of Brazilian music lovers who dug <i>Sung Tongs</i>, guys and gals going,     ""Gee-ahhh, oh-way-oh-way, oh-waaayyy!"", and lots of pitter patter Brazilian percussion.  Apparently, Zé     based his music on the ideas of Christian philosopher Saint Augustine, though to read a translation of his     comments in the CD booklet is to enter a convoluted world of whimsical theory: ""The technique of inducing     a controlled infection in order to produce an antidote is well known.  In this instance, through controlled     error in the tonal functions we create a ferment ranging by degrees between rage and inoculation.""  It goes     on like this.  Fortunately, most of this (wordless) music is its own reward.</p>
<p>Opener ""Marco da Era"" begins as a cold, repetitive cell-phone ring, moving subtly into tones from other     phones and eventually morphing into micro-beat electronica.  The high pitches and digital precision sound     closer to Mille Plateaux than Bahia, and when the messy splatter of brass that ends the piece hits, I     wonder if I somehow managed to insert the wrong CD.  However, ""Ayres da Mantiqueira""-- with synth-flute,     off-key whistling, pizzicato plucking and counterpoint of acoustic and electric guitar-- betrays Zé as the     heart of this music.  Likewise, the bouncy, classically tinged ""Nogueira do Monte"" sounds practically lifted     from one of Zé's mid-70s LPs, with immediately distinctive guitar figures and a vocal melody fit for restless     kings.</p>
<p>""Pixinguim-Rasqueira"" also features a Zé trademark of short, wordless vocal accents like ""oh!"" and ""ah!""     used as percussive thuds and pings, amid more intricate acoustic guitar arpeggios and bizarre horn lines     sounding part of a demented circus orchestra.  Throughout the CD, there is a faux-chamber orchestral feel     (which gets the better of my interest on the fairly tedious ""Ciro-Gberto""), though its best moments are     invariably the bubbliest and most infectiously catchy.  I wouldn't recommend anyone start with <i>Santagustin</i> as an entry into Zé's music, but fans will easily pick out the joyous, eccentric strains of his stuff.</p></div>"|8950.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8950-santagustin-with-gilberto-assis/|7.1|Dominique Leone

    On their debut LP, <i>Terrorbird</i>, the Los Angeles quartet for the most part straddle that fat, comfy
    pummel horse between hardcore and no-wave.  On one side are the yelps and screams and gymnastic bursts of
    mathy noise; on the other are the herk-and-jerk guitars, swishy cymbals, and funk-contorted basslines. The
    Mae Shi occasionally manage a song that welds elements from both genres, but for the most part devote their
    energy-- of which there is a ton-- to jumping back and forth between the two, often in a matter of seconds.
    The ultra-fragmented nature of the songs will draw contemporary comparisons to labelmates Deerhoof, XBXRX,
    Pink &amp; Brown, or Brooklyn's Ex Models. More so than those bands' albums, however, <i>Terrorbird</i>'s 33
    tracks demand to be taken as a whole.  Unfortunately, this turns out to be a double-edged sword.  While
    the fragments themselves are never short on energy, they are short on substance-- <i>Terrorbird</i> simply
    doesn't equal the sum of its parts.</p><p>
    
    After the quick bursts of drum noise that comprise the album's title track, The Mae Shi pull out all stops
    for ""Power to the Power Bite Two"", the album's early highlight.  Scratchy screams fight across the stereo
    panning, drums play catch-up with the guitar line that taunted it in the first place, and a steady bassline
    does its best to hold things together down low-- until it just can't take it anymore, and must join the
    guitar for a unison breakdown.  Two ""Revelations"" follow, beautifully smogging the album's mood after such
    a relatively potent pop.  On ""Revelation Three"", The Mae Shi mistakenly tread some embarrassing 311 terrain,
    which thankfully disappears into waves of snare triplets and antsy guitar intervals.</p><p>
    
    This seems to be The Mae Shi's modus operandi on <i>Terrorbird</i>: Brief exercises from Noise Rock 101
    surround the band's more carefully composed numbers, providing a harsh contrast for the album's otherwise
    immediately accessible moments.  That said, when these straightforward songs aren't up to ""Power to the
    Power"" snuff, all the guitar gymnastics comes off as talentless bullshit, drenched in noise to mask an
    inability to play.  It happens on ""Jubilee"", whose forced recombination of plucked guitar, Casio beats,
    and vocal harmonies are so unintentionally out-of-tune that it makes Liars' Angus Andrews sound like a
    barbershop quartet.  It happens again on ""Takoma the Dolphin Is Awol"", which sports a solid narrative
    lyrically, but musically falls back on some seriously obnoxious Rage Against the Machine white-boy funk
    trills.  Perhaps the biggest offender is the one-two guffaw of ""Surf's Up"" and ""Testify"": After the band
    prove they're ""down"" with Garage Band's hip-hop loops on the first one, The Mae Shi try their best to
    emote and come out sounding like The Starting Line unplugged.</p><p>
    
    Thankfully, the band does strike some solid gold on a good deal of <i>Terrorbird</i>.  The straightforward
    discopunk stomp of ""Hieronymus Is a Dead Man""; the nervous lawnmower drum rim snapping on ""One Mississippi,
    Two Mississippi, Three Mississippi""; the tom-tom breaks and tambourine rattles on the minimalist Stones
    mock-up ""Do This""; and the deranged Sousa-meets-Les Savy Fav breakdown of ""Virgin's Diet, The Hand of
    Wolves"" are all seriously great hooks that keep <i>Terrorbird</i> afloat.</p><p>
    
    The album's closing ""Repetition"" suite, despite its Erase Errata ""no-wave lite"" attitude, is at the least
    conceptually interesting: The suite's opening movement experiences four subsequent reincarnations, each
    brief but very distinct, save their common thread of the band members singing, ""We learn by repetition.""
    The Mae Shi end on a somber piano progression, a surprisingly mellow passage for an otherwise irate
    <i>Terrorbird</i>.  While the rest of the album sometimes barely holds together, ""Repetition"" is well
    thought-out and still manages to be just as mean as what proceeds it-- the suite seems a good place for
    The Mae Shi to pick up from on their next album.</p></div>"|5599.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5599-terrorbird/|6.5|Nick Sylvester

Electro-pop fans who've followed an AMG
    breadcrumb trail from Erlend Øye's fantastic <i>DJ Kicks</i> set and loop-heavy solo album to his work with
    Kings of Convenience can now quit flooding the label's switchboard with complaints and concerns: Nobody
    accidentally left the beats off your copy.</p><p>
    Even listeners familiar with the Norwegian duo's whisper-folk back catalog may be jarred by this pristine
    and peaceful <i>Riot</i>; the three-year interim between this album and <i>Quiet Is the New Loud</i> spawned
    both a deconstructing Kings remix album and Øye's DJ booth sojourns, so it would make sense that some of
    that dancier material might have found its way into the Kings' sound.  But it was not to be: The group's
    third full-length finds the pale Nordic singers with the library voices puttering past the intergalactic
    autobahn onramp to re-immerse themselves in their Simon &amp; Garfunkel collection, effectively warding off any
    potential infiltration of Øye's popular moonlighting excursions.</p><p>
<i>Riot on an Empty Street</i> leads off with an evocation of musical solace: ""Homesick"" tells the tale
    of a sales clerk falling in love with ""two soft voices blended in perfection"" on a found tape-- a bit of
    meta playfulness, perhaps, as the Kings' sound itself sends critics scrambling to thesauri in search of
    ever more extravagant ways of describing the band's Charmin-like quietude.  Throughout the album, the duo
    justifies this practice by cloaking their reposeful, melodious-- nay, even mellifluous-- sound in almost
    uncomfortably intimate production.  Microphones are positioned millimeter-close to mouths and guitar bells,
    picking up every string vibration, finger squeak and glottal pop.</p><p>
    The zoomed-in sound may be intended to add some intensity to the album's drumless opening and closing tracks,
    but Øye and Erik Glambek Bøe's stiff English pronunciation and obtuse lyricism (maybe ""Surprise Ice"" is
    just a Norwegian thing?) still make for paper-thin bookends to the album.  The Kings' sound doesn't begin
    to grow roots until the end of ""Know How"", where their bossanova-tinted folk builds to a sing-along with
    guest vocalist Leslie Feist.  The four songs that follow add a support structure of polite percussion,
    which provides a soft rhythmic backbone upon which the duo builds a richer sound: Psychedelic strings
    buttress ""Sorry or Please?"", while doubled piano lines and pizzicato plucks underscore ""I'd Rather Dance
    with You"".</p><p>
    Of course, <i>Riot</i> might have left a bigger impression if that last song title had served as the album's
    mission statement; the only dancing appropriate to most of these 12 tracks is a slow sway while sitting
    Indian-style.  Indeed, the Kings of Convenience would do well to assimilate more of Øye's electronic leanings
    into their original sound, rather than merely mining sad troubadours past for inspiration and leaving these
    tracks as sparse source material for the obligatory remix album.  Only ""Love Is No Big Truth"" appears to
    take a hack at translating a club bangah into the Kings' delicate language, combining an insistent bass
    drum, crisp little electric guitar figures, and banjo to construct a passable folk-bred techno.</p><p>
    More experiments of this sort would help the Kings of Convenience update their harmonies-and-fingerpicking
    sound for a modern world, rather than continuing to exist as a museum piece profiling musicians who like
    ""The Boxer"" way too much.  It would also build a bridge to listeners drawn in by Øye's extracurricular
    activities but who might not be willing to make the leap to as rhythmless an environment as is found in
    most of <i>Riot on an Empty Street</i>.  Should the duo ever decide to cut out the professional remixer
    middlemen and create the hybrid sound their backgrounds suggest, Kings of Convenience might finally become
    the rare 6am comedown band that actually sounds like it recorded during this century.</p></div>"|4450.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4450-riot-on-an-empty-street/|7.3|Rob Mitchum

Their pug faces
    smudged and newsboy caps on backwards, Mouth (Maria Andersson), Muscle (Josephine Forsman), and those
    grudge-holding sisters Jennie and Johanna Asplund (they never forget a face!) searched the crowd for rubes
    and never stepped down from a fight.  ""Alright Alright"", ""On Top of Your World"", ""Fall Into Line""-- the
    Swedish quartet rocked with backs to the wall, as though they'd miss the blindside left hook if they didn't
    strip their music down to the gristle.  Her little gang could be stuffed in the back of a squad car on the
    way to the clink and Andersson would still be flailing, fists clenched, and trying to kick out the windscreen.</p><p>
    
    Between 2001 and 2003, she and the Hotnights strengthened their grip.  They kept turning up on countless
    Hives and Mooney Suzuki support slots; they put a lot of sweat through vintage tees; and they proved to
    the naysayers that they weren't a novelty.  And yet, as powerful and legit as they were, Sahara Hotnights
    still had an identity crisis.  Hate to say I told you so, but in the U.S. at least, a combo of foxy Swedish
    girls playing flinty rock 'n' roll puts dollar signs in the dead eyes of A&amp;R; flacks.  Luckily, the band's
    big-time debut doesn't feature any Dianne Warren writing credits or Matrix-like makeovers.  <i>Kiss &amp; Tell</i>
    might be ridiculously catchy-- the perfect package for a world where chicks with attitude rock the Maybelline--
    but it's still based in reality, and serves the band's strongest statement yet.</p><p>
    
    Whereas <i>Jennie Bomb</i> never took its fist out of your face, <i>Kiss &amp; Tell</i> leaves room around its
    hardened core for engaging subtlety.  Opener ""Who Do You Dance For?"" crackles with Fender swagger, but
    incorporates a 50s sock-hop chorus and slight new-wave overtones.  ""Hot Night Crash"" is a great example of
    the old ""puttin'-our-name-in-the-song"" trick, but it's also a chance for the band's frontline to lean into
    their mics.  Andersson's lead vocal is typically fork-tongued-- a hybrid of jab and come-on-- but the backup
    vocals of guitarist Jennie Asplund and bass playin' sister Johanna are cleverly done and just as forceful.</p><p>
    
    In its punchy production and eagerness to mix hard rock with boppy little guitar leads and cheeky catchy
    choruses, <i>Kiss &amp; Tell</i> is a direct throwback to that fertile crossroads between thickheaded 70s AOR
    and the pop/new-wave nexus of the early 1980s.  The thumping shoulder blade shake of ""Mind Over Matter"" and
    ""Empty Heart"" recall Pat Benatar, or the sharp angles of Tom Petty's ""I Need to Know"".  The handclaps,
    buzzing bass, and Tandy 200 guitar of ""Stay/Stay Away"" are concealed deep within the record, as a little
    gift to those that stay the course.  ""The Difference Between Love and Hell"", too, appears out of nowhere
    at the bottom of the lineup with one of Andersson's most appealing vocal turns and another wily amalgam of
    tinkly chorus keys and a wiry verses.</p><p>
    
    Is this an old Police album?  Does that guitar remind me of Rick Springfield?  Where's my rayon sport coat?
    All these questions and more are answered by <i>Kiss &amp; Tell</i>.  But the record's greatest feat is balancing
    expertly between mainstream accessibility and validation for the Hotnights themselves.  It's a ballsy doll
    revolution.</p></div>"|6969.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6969-kiss-tell/|8.1|Johnny Loftus

    concerned themselves with injecting the vitality and relevance of popular forms into the world of modern
    art music.  Such attempts have ranged from embarrassing to completely gripping, and Gordon's work has
    usually fallen on the positive end of the spectrum.  His newest release, <i>Light Is Calling</i>, is an
    endeavor to join electronic influences with his distinctive style of shifting polyrhythmic structures.</p><p>
    You'd be right to approach such an attempt warily-- many modern composers' hybridization of strings and
    electronic production can give listeners too little credit, or sound like a bookish recluse's attempt to
    hang with the cool kids.  It can be especially cringe-inducing when an aging composer ""discovers"" modern
    electronic equipment and genres, demonstrating only a basic knowledge of drum 'n' bass and ending with a
    product that in no way gets it.  Michael Gordon avoids these pitfalls, enlisting the contributions of
    electronic musicians/producers Luke DuBois and Damian LeGassick as well as Ethel quartet violinist Todd
    Reynolds, and their collaboration has resulted in an accessible work that remains uncompromising in its
    subtle complexity and is a truly coherent meeting of styles.  While the album isn't completely consistent,
    it achieves at its best moments a totally strange and unheard beauty.</p><p>
    The cover photo of <i>Light Is Calling</i> is taken from a short movie by filmmaker Bill Morrison (included
    as a Quicktime video on the disc) for which Gordon provides the soundtrack.  Morrison's short was made
    through the process of reshooting decomposing black and white film, and the result is a dreamy, melting,
    light-drenched scene that could very well be occurring within the technicolor woods on the cover of Tortoise's
    <i>It's All Around You</i>.  The aesthetic of Morrison's film is inexorably intertwined with many of Michael
    Gordon's pieces, and is key to understanding the album's intent.  Both image and music act as meditations
    on memory and the warping effects of time, the beauty of decay, and the role of an outdated romanticism in
    the present day.</p><p>
    In the movie, we watch a decomposing film reel of a soldier who meets a mysterious woman in the woods.
    Gordon provides the sounds of a quartet playing time-warped instruments against a bent metallic background--
    the innocent beauty of a silent-film soundtrack attempting to break through the rusty barrier of years
    passed by.  Its particular conjoining of electronics and acoustic instruments calls to mind Gavin Bryars'
    seminal work ""The Sinking of the Titanic"", in which echoes of the ship's famous string quartet resound
    from the depths of the ocean floor.  Most pieces on <i>Light Is Calling</i> take a similar concept as
    their genesis, offering the sounds of dead genres being dusted off and made to run their course through
    all the complications of the present day.</p><p>
<i>Light Is Calling</i> establishes its thesis in the opener ""Tinge"", a track that echoes the unfettered
    dramaticism of Björk's <i>Homogenic</i> years, where orchestral hits and a Vivaldi-esque violin section
    are tempered by a winding found-sound percussion loop and plodding bassline.  Measures of brilliant strings
    drop in and out of the following piece ""Instrumental"", offering some of the greatest moments of beauty on
    the album as it blurs the lines between live instrumentation and manipulated samples.  Gordon falters with
    overblown sections of dissonant disco in ""My Frig"" and ""Receiver"" that upset the careful balance he achieves
    elsewhere of melodrama with musical humility and reservation.  But the album regains its footing in ""Idle"",
    a piece that successfully enters the dangerous territory of world-folk influences and emerges a surreal,
    hypnotic interlude.</p><p>
    While the varied influences in each track of <i>Light Is Calling</i> are apparent, the result is an admirably
    focused and specific realization of an original aesthetic concept.  Like most Nonesuch releases these days,
    this album's design is beautiful, and here, the art and music conjoin to present a fully unified work.  The
    facade of decay is as integral as the past itself in the art of Gordon and Morrison, transmitting the glow
    of distorted memories and ache of the past's inaccessibility.</p></div>"|3643.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3643-light-is-calling/|8.0|Liam Singer

    Collective.  He started by releasing Matmos-ian traditional Mexican cut-ups as Terrestre, and in 2002, he
    debuted with the album <i>Martes</i> under the name Murcof.  Along the way he's remixed, cut vinyl as the
    mastering engineer for the Static Discos label, and scored the independent film <i>Nicotina</i>.  He's a
    busy guy with a lot of talent, this Fernando Corona.  Remember the name.</p><p>
    With <i>Martes</i>, Corona took fragments of 20th Century classical by composers like Morton Feldman and
    Arvo Pärt and combined the tense arrangements with micro beats.  It was an interesting record with an
    unusual sound, but it wasn't ultimately great; something about the loops and repetition of <i>Martes</i>
    didn't seem to gel.  Corona's conception called for freedom and openness, music unconstrained by the
    snap-to grid.  For that we would have to wait another 18 months.</p><p>
    The 12-inch single ""Ulysses"", released earlier this year, delivered completely on <i>Martes</i>' promise
    and immediately built anticipation for the next Murcof full-length, due by the end of 2004.  On both
    ""Ulysses"" and the B-side ""Urano"", Corona ditched samples to write and record his own charts, melding
    percolating minimalist beats with his subtly dissonant and open-ended phrases for strings.  On this CD,
    Leaf has rewarded those without turntables by compiling the two tracks from the ""Ulysses"" 12-inch, two
    previously unreleased tracks, and seven remixes of material from <i>Martes</i>.</p><p>
    Beyond the exceptional ""Ulysses"" 12-inch, both unheard tracks here are good but sound like holdovers from
    the <i>Martes</i> sessions.  ""Una"" loops and chops a short section for strings and sets the melody against
    an undercurrent of catgut groans and plucks.  It's like a duet between two instruments from the violin
    family-- one set to play ""music"" and the other focusing on ""sounds.""  ""Ultimatum"", which foregrounds the
    drum programming and uses bits of piano and violin more as seasoning, is probably the funkiest track Corona
    has released as Murcof.</p><p>
    The remixes are mostly strong, with the two best coming from familiar names.  Jan Jelinek's ""Der Abschied
    von Dawson City Mix"" of ""Maiz"" is an excellent meeting of the minds that finds Jelinek using clipped
    fragments of plucked violin and double-bass slides for his own jazzed-up rhythmic ends.  Deathprod's take
    on ""Ulysses"" leaves little of the original identifiably intact, but creates the kind of vast, doom-laden
    half-speed drift that will be instantly familiar to those familiar with his excellent <i>Morals and Dogma</i>.</p><p>
    Colleen's mix of ""Muium"" is inspired and imaginative, as Cécile Schott burrows deep inside the original
    track, emerging with handfuls of individual notes that are stretched into drones and reassembled into weird
    melodies.  On the beat-friendly tip, Sutekh's ""Triasgion mix"" of ""Memoria"" is highly danceable and driving
    techno infested with squirming samples pushing in several directions simultaneously, while fellow Nortec
    Collective member Fax (Ruben Tamayo, not Pete Namlook) offers a dubby and comparatively warm take on
    ""Maiz"".</p><p>
    Fernando Corona's distinctive stamp is clearly affixed to every note of his originals, so his music lends
    itself to the remix treatment.  But most exciting on <i>Ulysses</i> are the two new tracks that (hopefully)
    point the way toward the next Murcof album.  What Corona brings to the table is something depressingly rare
    in electronic music: a fresh ear.  Like Ekkehard Ehlers, Corona seems to hear music differently, allowing
    him to compose tracks that sound like no one else.</p></div>"|5598.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5598-utopia/|7.9|Mark Richardson

    Stripes, The Von Bondies, and Whirlwind Heat too gritty and abrasive.  Similar to past releases like <i>Low
    to the Ground</i>, the group's third album, <i>Let's Make Our Descent</i>, is certainly worlds removed from
    the rougher sounds emanating from Motor City-- it may be just as nostalgic, but then, it's also far more
    poppy and polished.  Context, however, is everything: Outside the Greater Detroit area, The Waxwings are
    blandly indistinct, a single-A ball club in a major-league playoff.</p><p>
    
    There's a by-the-numbers quality to <i>Let's Make Our Descent</i>, as if the band had a checklist they were
    trying to fill: Hooks and guitar riffs that are catchy, but not catchy enough that you'll be humming them
    the rest of the day?  Check.  Moderately clever lyrics that occasionally stumble (""Your hesitation's like
    a telescope, girl/ And I can see that you are looking low too low"" promises a punchline it doesn't deliver),
    but never fall hard enough to derail the song entirely?  Check.  Guitars that sound agreeably rough and
    textured, but not quite loud enough to piss off the parents?  Check.</p><p>
    
    The problem isn't that The Waxwings play retro garage-rock; it's that they play such <i>obvious</i> retro
    garage-rock.  For a genre that defines itself so completely by the past, their influences are unfailingly
    nebulous: They have a vague mission to play 60s rock <i>qua</i> 60s rock, as if all they need is a general
    idea of what it sounded like.  What's more, whenever they get near a sonic touchstone, they usually make
    the most blatant choices (The Kinks, The Who, the Stones, et al.), effectively derailing the record on
    premise of playing it too safe and rarely (if ever) taking any musical, imaginative, or emotional risks.</p><p>
<i>Let's Make Our Descent</i> isn't atrocious or embarrassing, but neither is it exciting or memorable.  For
    bands like The Waxwings, only the dubious pantheon of obscurity awaits.  On the other hand, perhaps context
    is everything: Maybe today's also-rans will be tomorrow's <i>Nuggets</i>.</p></div>"|8778.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8778-lets-make-our-descent/|5.7|Stephen M. Deusner

    analog melodies, Brooklyn duo Ratatat decided to do something practical with it.  Their eponymous debut
    retained an epic minimalism, a micro-rock melancholy that even in its stainless steel production radiated
    a fleshy, clear-eyed warmth.  Voiceovers from local MC Young Churf lightened the tone and hinted at the
    group's guarded B-boy predilections, but were so incongruous they could've been smarmy indie-isms.  So to
    snuff any doubters, Ratatat's two lone gunmen, guitarist Mike Stroud and beatsmith/producer Evan Mast,
    essentially plundered the HOT 97 playlist and laid down fresh instrumentals to back a grip of vocal tracks
    from some of rap's biggest hitmakers on this new tour-exclusive release.</p><p>
    
    The band's source material sends an instant message: They proudly indulge in the mainstream, and for the
    most part, spurn any artists who might cast a shadow of underground elitism.  (Even Dizzee Rascal, a
    somewhat exotic phenom in the States, gets radio play in the UK.)  Along with crossover heroes like Kanye
    West, Jay-Z, and Missy Elliott, 50 Cent's G Unit and a host of Wu alumni appear.  The ominous thug melodrama
    is curious-- I have a hard time envisioning two skinny white kids personally relating to the desperate
    urgency of ""Run"", Ghostface Killah's panicked rant with Jadakiss.  But such is the voyeuristic,
    class-spanning pleasure of modern hip-hop, and the gospel organ grind that haunts the track, or the gothic
    piano tiptoe on G Unit's ""Stunt 101"", keep them dark and deep.</p><p>
    
    More than the rappers themselves, the production of the original tracks must've appealed most to Mast's
    hip-hop sensibility.  Ratatat's glitchy metallic rhythms lean heavily toward the syncopated sci-fi bounce
    of platinum rap architects, and for that reason the remix's potentially risky stylistic collision actually
    works.  Mast's sparse, intuitive production and Stroud's teetering guitars slide in beneath the vocals,
    slyly replacing the original big-balled crunk with lustrous geek funk.  Coming early in the mix, Missy and
    Timbaland's ""I'm Really Hot"" blazes with staccato bass and murmuring synths, proving the power of this
    album's worth of dedicated tinkering.  Later, Elliott's ""Wake Up"" false-starts with a similar one-count
    beat before heading into glazed emo-hop territory.  Jay-Z's booty serenade ""Sunshine"" receives similar
    understated treatment, led by a prog-rock bassline, handclaps, and folded layers of guitar.</p><p>
    
    Somewhat surprisingly, the more aggressive, lyrically heavy tracks fare just as well as the floor-fillers--
    though it must be said that extreme volume will be required to rock the party with these mixes.  Raekwon's
    ""Smith Bros"" surfs an ominous broken beat rumble, while ""Cutting It Up"", his pairing with Ghostface, gets
    razor guitar licks and creepy keys.  Like Ratatat's debut, these tracks are unified by a common instrumental
    format that mediates their mood and somewhat limits their sound.  It seems Mast and Stroud have honed in on
    their grand vision and are meticulously refining it on tape.  But if it's a work in progress, it's still
    entertaining-- there's only a couple missteps along the way.  A disappointing amputation of Dizzee Rascal's
    ""Fix Up, Look Sharp"" suffers from a trembling bassline where a seismic blast used to be, and a throwaway
    freestyle from Lazer Life of obscure around-the-way crew/ODB homies Brooklyn Zoo quickly goes nowhere.</p><p>
    
    Even as the band comes remarkably close to distilling the musical essence of hip-hop, their crossover appeal
    is a one-way street.  Fans of Ratatat's original material will naturally flock, but only a handful of Wu
    acolytes and radio-rap lemmings will catch whiff of the project, and of those that do, even fewer will find
    their way past the lack of trunk-bumping bombast to pick up the subtle gravity of Ratatat's inspired
    revisions.</p></div>"|6914.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6914-remixes/|7.0|Jonathan Zwickel

    The problem facing The Kinks when they released <i>The Village Green Preservation Society</i> in late
    November 1968 wasn't merely the competition-- Jimi Hendrix's <i>Electric Ladyland</i>, Led Zeppelin's
    debut, and the Rolling Stones' <i>Beggars Banquet</i> offered plenty-- but that this subtle, funny,
    surreal, and at times almost tender record could have been recorded on another planet.  During the summer
    of 1968, stateside fans were hooked on a high-intensity diet that had them jonesing for aggressive,
    overstated fare like ""Street Fighting Man"" and ""You Shook Me"" and ""Communication Breakdown"".  The disconnect
    between The Kinks and the rock world's rapidly narrowing palette could hardly have been more pronounced.
    Compare the Stones' bombastic, urban ""Sympathy for the Devil"" with understated work like ""Village Green"",
    bouncing along like a horse and buggy as Ray Davies paints the landscape: ""Out in the country, far from
    all the soot and noise of the city...""</p><p>
    
    Critics praised the album, the public ignored it, and Davies-- surveying the scene-- asserted that it wasn't
    created for public consumption.  Intentions aside, The Kinks simply moved on, leaving small knots of fans
    to pledge secret allegiance to <i>Village Green</i>.  However, as years passed and the weather changed,
    its following grew, and finally, one day, the verdict reversed and the album was touted as a masterpiece.
    Ironically, it might have happened sooner had the band not been so prolific up through the late 80s.</p><p>
    
    Intricately sketched and brimming with unusual arrangements, <i>The Village Green Preservation Society</i>
    was the first clear look at an iconoclastic, imaginative and sometimes brilliant artist as he came into his
    own.  Audiences used to sizing up work on a scale created for rock gods and counter-culture icons were
    forced to consider this album as a piece of conceptual art.  The Lennon-McCartney/Jagger-Richards duos
    towered over and shaped the sensibilities of a vast army; Davies explored a deeply personal world that
    confounded fans even as it provoked their curiosity.</p><p>
    
    There's a clue to who he was in the song ""Animal Farm"", which opens with a cascade of chords played on a
    warm, acoustic 12-string, the folk music staple once used on songs like the Rooftop Singers' 1963 hit
    ""Walk Right In"".  Davies' opening lines, forced to share space with the tongue filling his cheek, are a
    mouthful.  ""This world is big and wild and half insane/ Take me where the animals are playing,"" he sings,
    raising the Union Jack, while looking back through the chaos of the day to find a simpler, safer world.</p><p>
    
    The peculiar sensibility that first raised its head on 1965's <i>Kinkdom</i> with the hit singles ""Dedicated
    Follower and Fashion"" and ""A Well Respected Man"" looks different in light of <i>The Village Green Preservation
    Society</i>.  Before the latter album was released, those songs seemed like parody or blue-collar humor;
    in retrospect, Davies was showing a quirky, iconoclastic hand that would soon be more relevant to his music
    than the hard-rocking ""You Really Got Me"".  It's also interesting to consider <em>Village Green</em> as a
    carefully sculpted product of Ray Davies' singular artistic vision.  The album is commonly regarded as
    having the feel of solo work, and if this is a matter of opinion, the songs are singular enough as to
    probably make collaboration difficult.  More than that, at a time when rock instrumentalists were beginning
    to stretch out, The Kinks' playing here always serves the songs, and Davies' vocals in particular.</p><p>
    
    By 1968, as the prevailing rock idiom tended to position music as an armored vehicle ready for battle,
    Davies did his best work with a quiet, ironic smile.  The album-opening title cut begins with a simple
    groove built around acoustic guitars, over which Davies offers a bend pledge of allegiance to the mundane
    curiosities of modern life; in ""Do You Remember Walter"", he reminisces, perhaps as a geriatric adult; and
    on ""Last of the Steam Powered Trains"", he borrows and bends the first few bars of Willie Dixon's ""Spoonful""--
    an ode to the miseries of heroin.</p><p>
<i>The Village Green Preservation Society</i> has been declared the band's masterwork in some quarters, and
    I'll agree-- if only because my favorite Kinks album, built around ""You Really Got Me"", ""All Day and All of
    the Night"" and ""Tired of Waiting for You"", has never been released.  Even so, the album had received proper
    recognition long before the release of this three-disc set, which repackages the original album and adds a
    slew of extras: Bonus tracks are here in spades, along with a collection of period studio noodlings and a
    separate mono version of the entire LP.</p><p>
    
    Of course, while the special presentation does include a few interesting pieces-- looser non-album tracks
    like the humorous ""Mich Avery's Underpants"", ""King Kong"" and ""Wonderboy"", while hardly worth the price of
    this set, offer added insight into the album's sessions-- it's mostly padded by mono mixes that would be
    of little interest to anyone but the staunchest archivists.  As such, disc one, the original album expanded
    with four bonus tracks (including a knockout version of ""Days"") provides the real meat: 36 years after its
    first release, <i>The Village Green Preservation Society</i>, loaded with so much imagination and possibility,
    stands more than ever as a vital work, and as one of rock's first classic, one-of-a-kind albums.</p></div>"|4457.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4457-the-village-green-preservation-society/|9.5|J.H. Tompkins

My world is quiet, my room is dark and I am dreaming.  There's a parade of old
    acquaintances and vaguely familiar places proceeding through my head, but it's a jumbled parade, a plotless,
    random idea stew.  Most of my dreams are like this.  I'm standing on a sandbar in Tampa with an inflatable
    raft under my arm one moment and when I turn around I'm looking at the linoleum floor in my parents' kitchen.
    Old friends show up in incongruous dress or strange places, and I intuitively know what they're saying, even
    though I can't hear a thing.</p><p>
    
    Since high school, music has been a huge part of my life, creatively as well as from a listener's standpoint,
    and the possibilities of sound fascinate me to no end.  But in my mind's most purely creative state-- dreaming--
    there is no sound, and never has been.  This has always puzzled me.  Why would I be missing such a big part
    of myself in my dreams?</p><p>
<center>* * *</center></p><p>
    
    It's now 12:23pm, later that same Sunday.  I'm making my way through the two imposing discs of Room40's
    <i>Melatonin</i> compilation, which bills itself as a collection of ""meditations on sound in sleep.""
    Coincidentally, my cats are sacked on their pillows, and I'm not holding up so well myself.  I've been
    tired a lot lately, and for about 20 minutes, I experience this music through that half-wakeful haze that
    inevitably accompanies a dozing session.  Seems appropriate.</p><p>
    
    I should hasten to point out that I'm not falling asleep out of boredom.  <i>Melatonin</i> is a beautifully
    realized concept, and the sequencing is near flawless, allowing disparate pieces of music to sit naturally
    beside each other, the brief-to-nonexistent silences between tracks contributing greatly to the flow.
    Aside from the general theme of the compilation, the artists involved were given a great deal of freedom
    to interpret their mandate as they saw fit, and their pieces head in several different directions.</p><p>
    
    Chris Watson, Stephen Vitiello and Philip Samartzis all work with field recordings, though each takes a
    different approach.  Samartzis doesn't embellish his slice-of-life recordings with a lot of chopping or
    looping, instead letting them speak for themselves as he edits tape of what sounds like a street market
    opening in the morning, a rowboat ride and church bells in a random, dreamlike and pointedly non-narrative
    sequence.  Watson, whose contribution opens the first disc, molds his insect masses and birds into neon
    choirs, while Vitiello follows with a piece that weaves its found sound through with mild drones that morph
    into near-melodies as they become more active.</p><p>
    
    As one might expect, several artists go the purely ambient route, crafting enveloping soundscapes, often
    with timbres that are hard to source.  Ai Yamamoto's ""Dreaming of Swimming in Emerald Green Water"" is quite
    beautiful, surrounding a harmonium drone with crystalline intonations that together form a bell-like texture.
    Oren Ambarchi's minimal guitar piece ""Stormy Weather Part II"" is a picture of restraint, while Pimmon's
    drones billow like an approaching cloudbank.  The deep, dark tones of DJ Olive's ""Yard Swing Sunrise"" sound
    like the surface of water looks, while Frost's ""Svartifoss"" might be a direct transcription of Jimi Hendrix,
    as heard through three feet of solid ice.</p><p>
    
    Several artists take a much more active approach to their songs, with David Toop and Scanner providing the
    two nightmare tracks.  The voices that rip through Toop's ""Hypnogogmatist"" sound as though they are literally
    tearing the fabric of sleep, particularly the one that opines, ""At night this theory made sense to me, but
    now I can't understand it.""  Scanner's piece is inhabited by disembodied voices as well, but his foundation
    of shivering piano is by far the most profoundly creepy thing on the entire set.  Meanwhile, Janek Schaefer's
    closing piece, ""Love Song"", layers voices singing the word ""love,"" the natural waver of the participants'
    held notes and the random nature of their combinations and recombinations swaying the piece back and forth
    between unnerving dissonance and comforting harmony.  Steve Reich would be proud.</p><p>
    
    On the more rhythmic end of things, John Chantler turns in a tight slab of found-sound jazz, his plinks
    and pings congealing into a fitful beat as electric piano chords hum softly in the background, as though
    oblivious to the beat but nonetheless in time with it.  The only other thing that approaches the rhythmic
    drive of Chantler's contribution is DJ/Rupture's ""Heart Murmur"", gathering various scrapings on bowed
    instruments together over a percussive swoosh that approximates a beat as a panicked man yells, ""Are we
    shooting people?""</p><p>
    
    The sprawl of these two discs almost offers too much to really cover effectively in a review, but it bears
    mentioning that along with all of the standout tracks, there are a few clunkers thrown in.  Some, like
    Timeblind's ""Lust"" (it got more interesting when a prop plane flew over head, mixing with the texture)
    and Steinbruchel's ""Feder"" are simply too static, while others, like Martin NG &amp; Tetuzi Akiyama's
    ""Silver-Brown"" are strikingly unpleasant.  ""Silver-Brown"" has some interesting minimal guitar passages,
    but the sine waves that layer on top are just rude, like imposed tinnitus.</p><p>
    
    On balance, though, a grand total of about five dissatisfying tracks on such a large set is hardly a death
    knell, and <i>Melatonin</i> is mostly a resounding success.  As an added bonus, it also offers a fantastic
    microcosm of most of the trends in 21st Century ambient music in its running order, offering many distinct
    takes on the genre, with a few well-placed detours breaking things up.  It hasn't helped me get to the
    bottom of my silent dreams, but <i>Melatonin</i> still sounds plenty good when I'm awake.</p></div>"|2050.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2050-melatonin-meditations-on-sound-in-sleep/|8.0|Joe Tangari

    Blame toothy marketers waving one-sheets or all that clunky/obsolete record store signage, but the tension
    between dynamic, varied artists and their one-dimensional nametags has rendered even the most basic genre
    classifications meaningless.  ""Punk"" and ""rock"" surrendered most of their borders years ago; now watch as
    their respective subspecialties are bastardized into comparable uselessness: Check, especially, the ""garage-rock""
    revival of yesteryear, and the piles of contemporary bands that were mercilessly pummeled into the archetype,
    without ever actually embracing any of the genre's gnarled, boxy traditions.</p><p>
    
    Tangiers, Toronto's snappy, t-shirted response to The Strokes (and little brother band to The Deadly Snakes),
    were instantaneously filed as revivalists (see: outfits, hair), and subsequently forced to prepare for the
    dismissal that almost always follows a sudden, unchecked press explosion.  Still, it all seemed sort of
    stupidly unfair: Despite having been preemptively lumped in with a whole mess of nu-garage outfits, Tangiers
    were always a party band, more easily likened to Richard Hell &amp; The Voidoids than The Troggs or Paul Revere.</p><p>
    
    Now, following up their excellent 2003 debut, <i>Hot New Spirits</i>, Tangiers are dealing with more than
    just being misunderstood by overeager CD-sorters: Guitarist Yuri Didrichsons and drummer Marco Moniz bailed
    last year, cracking the original lineup and leaving remaining members (singer/guitarist Josh Reichmann and
    singer/bassist James Sayce) to reassemble Tangiers.  Recruiting former Guided by Voices drummer Jon McCann
    and keyboardist Shelton Deverell, Sayce and Reichmann shouldered the songwriting duties and plowed ahead.</p><p>
    
    The resulting record, <i>Never Bring You Pleasure</i>, is a squirrely, bouncing homage to the Rolling Stones,
    with stacks of pert guitar riffs and plenty of lusty vocals.  Like a more convincing Hot Hot Heat, Tangiers
    play sticky rock music that demands some kind of leg-kicking; <i>Never Bring You Pleasure</i> is a raucous,
    jerky combination of punk guitars and brash disco flourishes, a majestically danceable update on staid rock
    traditions.</p><p>
    
    ""I Don't Love You"", with its deadpan verses and howled choruses is a hook-heavy, VU-indebted bit of bratty
    swagger, easily capable of tackling the college charts (or snatching some bored Franz Ferdinand fans);
    opener ""Love Rackets"" is all blips and strums, with Reichmann and Sayce trading off vocal duties over
    McCann's frenzied stomps.  <i>Never Bring You Pleasure</i> is a surprisingly cohesive album (Reichmann
    and Sayce only penned one song together, mostly writing these tracks independently), a loving, unexpected
    reinvention that still manages to cash-in on all that misdirected hype.</p></div>"|7935.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7935-never-bring-you-pleasure/|8.0|Amanda Petrusich

    Dolorean as in <i>pain</i>.  Which, all pretensions aside, is a pretty apt descriptor for this Oregon band's
    debut full-length, <i>Not Exotic</i>.  Their atmospheric indie folk plumbs the depths of everyday despair
    in nine tracks whose narratives and narrators suggest a short-story collection set to music.</p><p>
    
    These songs are heavy on lyrics, but light on instrumentation: only a little livelier than Low and neither
    as exotic as Pinetop Seven nor as tranced out as Bedhead.  Usually, the songs feature just an acoustic guitar,
    shuffling drums, and a quiet piano accompanying Al James' plaintive vocals, but when the band's feeling crazy,
    they throw in synths or a quietly burbling organ.  Almost as a consequence, the songs have an unhurried
    slacker's pace, a walking tempo.</p><p>
    
    ""Morningwatch"" sets the tone early, as James identifies himself with ""those of us who cannot sleep/ Just
    because of things we've done.""  The songs that follow depict acts of physical or emotional violence,
    ineluctable catastrophes that create crippling regrets in his characters.  There's the adulterer in
    ""Traded for Fire"" who runs from his sins, praying, ""Don't let me settle down in a small northern town to
    die.""  A woman withholds a dark secret from her lover in ""Still Here with Me"", although it takes it toll:
    ""And you kiss like a corpse,"" James sings, ""and you smile like a crow.""  On the blandly Gothic murder ballad
    ""Hannibal, MO"", a small-town mechanic confesses to killing his college-bound true love.  Fortunately, James
    has the good sense to imply the narrator's regrets instead of stating them directly: ""Her father says he'll
    shoot me down if I don't do it myself.""</p><p>
    
    A poet before he founded Dolorean, James traffics in a self-conscious brand of indie verse, full of gentle
    pretensions and casually evocative imagery.  For example, in the town of Hannibal, Missouri, ""where the
    Mississippi turns flat and wide/ We'd lay out on the sandbars and fall asleep to the barges and the fireflies.""
    Both his writerly and his physical voice meld together nicely, coasting on the last word in each phrase and
    drawing it out lazily to something halfway between a conspiratorial whisper and a resigned sigh.</p><p>
    
    For every just-right line, though, there's another in which James' lyrical approach is either too much or
    not quite enough.  The rest of ""Hannibal, MO"" is so conversational in tone that it sounds clunky: ""Summer
    was ending and she was leaving soon to study writing on the East Coast.""  Even set to the rueful melody,
    this line jambs against the others, and despite the nearness of betrayal and death, the song never breaks
    its patient tone, its unexcitability undercutting-- rather than conveying-- its deep regret.</p><p>
    
    On the other hand, the jaded ""So You're a Touring Band Now"" contains a pointed commentary on the life of a
    musician: ""My friends are knives that cut out my tongue/ No songs and no beats no words left to speak, just
    utters and grunts,"" he sings.  ""Drive 10,000 miles just to tear off your arm just to play the guitar and
    recite a poem.""  The sentiment-- that the life of a small-time indie rocker can quickly corrode your
    self-worth-- sounds achingly autobiographical, but James overstates it almost to the point of abstraction.</p><p>
    
    As its title suggests, <i>Not Exotic</i> has a modest goal: to spare no pain as it ferries listeners from
    one morningwatch to the next, with as little fuss as possible.  Perhaps a little more fuss would have made
    the journey more memorable.</p></div>"|2550.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2550-not-exotic/|6.6|Stephen M. Deusner

Since the remarkable one-two punch of <i>It Was Hot, We Stayed in the
    Water</i> and <i>The Glow, Pt. 2</i>, the boundlessly imaginative singer/songwriter has seemed to intentionally
    evade the indie rock spotlight, offering vague explanations for his unpredictable actions and flooding the
    market with limited-edition releases under the Microphones name that more often beguiled than intrigued:
    <i>Blood</i> and <i>Little Bird Flies into a Big Black Cloud</i>, two handmade 12-inches, featured alternate
    versions of existing tracks sandwiched between curious sound experiments and song fragments, while the 2002
    compilation <i>Song Islands</i> compiled the band's seven-inches and other unreleased material.</p><p>
    
    In 2003, at the height of this deluge, Elvrum released <i>Mount Eerie</i>, the long-awaited official
    follow-up to <i>The Glow, Pt. 2</i>.  It would be his final studio release under The Microphones guise: a
    daunting concept album on which the man and his guitar played a diminished role amidst waves of atmospheric
    noise not far removed from the spotty material that had dotted his odds-and-sods compilations.  Here, Elvrum
    also took a backseat vocally to the album's many players, whose extended vocal turns and character acting
    made the record's belabored plot a difficult listen for many fans.</p><p>
    
    Shortly after that record's release, Elvrum announced plans to disband The Microphones altogether.  Lacking
    the grand public unraveling of a full-on crash-and-burn, the move couldn't help but feel somewhat anticlimactic:
    As excellent as <i>It Was Hot</i> and <i>The Glow</i> were, they were also terribly irresolute, and left
    Elvrum's legacy uncertain; the records, perhaps for their epic scale and overt ambitiousness, seemed to
    promise that even greater material could be in store-- for Elvrum to pull the plug just as he began to
    gain real momentum was a monumental letdown.</p><p>
    
    That was nearly two years ago.  Rather than hunkering down in the studio with a new cast of players, Elvrum
    has since played vagrant, embarking on circuitous touring spells, here and there dropping the odd sketchy
    detail about the studio endeavors and future plans of his new group, Mount Eerie.  With any forthcoming debut
    perpetually ""in-very-early-progress,"" it has lately seemed that this band's priorities lie on the road, and
    that Microphones fans might never receive the satisfaction of a worthwhile successor to <i>The Glow, Pt.
    2</i>.</p><p>
    
    Alas, those Anacortes-based deviants thought they could hide their clandestine labors from us.  Mais non:
    After a year of honing new material in concert, nine tracks have officially made it to tape.  Two new
    studio releases-- the <i>Seven New Songs of Mount Eerie</i> mini-LP and the <i>Two Songs</i> 12""--
    document a transitory year for Elvrum and his horde, as well as the devolution and distillation of a
    persona and sound.</p><p>
    
    Given a proper studio treatment (and an additional year of practice), Mount Eerie are far more engaging here
    than on this year's lukewarm <i>Live in Japan</i>. Unsurprisingly, the organic, close-mic'd sound posited on
    that collection has been reined in by Elvrum's masterful studio touch, allowing the music to retain an
    unaffected, live-performed spirit without ever sounding sloppy or unfinished.  Additionally, the advent of
    a live band has enabled Elvrum to reconcile two contrary elements of his erstwhile output: a penchant for
    epic experimentation and a deep understanding of the moving commonality of simplistic folk tunes.  Together,
    these elements coagulate into some of Elvrum's finest moments to date.</p><p>
    
    The bulk of new material is found on <i>Seven New Songs of Mount Eerie</i>, which provides an impromptu
    mission statement for a band that's still yet to release a debut full-length.  Featuring a half-dozen
    apparently complete songs, the EP essentially amounts to the meat and potatoes of a Microphones full-length.
    His presence previously scarce amongst indulgent asides and meandering experimental one-offs (<i>The
    Glow, Pt. 2</i> featured only a handful of what can be considered true pop songs), Elvrum has nowhere to
    hide; his vocals are the focal point of each song, tip-toeing timorously but unfailingly alongside the
    accommodating instrumental mix.</p><p>
    
    The minute-and-a-half of delicately strummed chorus guitar melody that opens ""Wooly Mammoth's Absence"" is
    just about his longest downtime on the record.  After the brittle, unassuming prologue, Elvrum enters,
    double-tracked and wontedly demure-- and it becomes immediately apparent that nothing much has changed.
    He coos and mumbles his familiar confessions, but there's still something ineffably engaging about his
    verses.  Elvrum remains a magician of the mundane, and the underlying candor of his compositions still
    sets him apart from his contemporaries.</p><p>
    
    But as striking as he is, Elvrum's not acting alone.  In fact, because these records are greatly stripped
    down from The Microphones' dense, studio-abetted sonic milieu, Mount Eerie's members are arguably more
    invaluable to <i>Seven Songs</i> and <i>Two Songs</i> than The Microphones collective was to Elvrum's
    previous work.  Flitty and vulnerable, Elvrum constantly threatens to dissolve into tape hiss (especially
    fragile is the somber ""With My Hands Out""), and his lo-fi orchestra is all that's there to buttress him.
    Fortunately, the players are up to the task, ably facilitating Elvrum the way his own amorphous textures
    once did.  Rarely, on either disc, does the band assume a starring role (the anachronistic psych-rock of
    ""November 22nd, 2003, 4:45 PM"" is a glaring exception), but their knack for balancing Elvrum's intimacy
    with an unobtrusive sturdiness is notable.</p><p>
    
    On <i>Two Songs</i>, they bear an even greater burden, seemingly attempting to simulate expansive Elvrum
    epics such as ""The Glow"", to somewhat inauspicious results.  The eleven-minute-plus ""Fuck the World"" shows
    a more brazen, even somewhat stylized Elvrum.  Mount Eerie are dependably tasteful, by turns subordinate
    and arch, but the song is altogether too dour to sustain its imposing length.  Elvrum's frustrated lyrics
    occasionally permeate the orchestral mix, stauncher than usual.  At one point, he seems even to risk
    breathlessness, belting in a steady stream, ""If you think that going camping will undo a long life of
    slow dying, then go ahead and go camping.""  Similar moments of uninhibitedness dot the nine-minute ""Do
    Not Be Afraid"", which ends with a blissfully defiant chorus.  But overall, <i>Two Songs</i> is no match
    for the better moments on <i>Seven Songs</i>.  If the group could somehow reconcile the cut-loose
    emotionality of the former with the musical appositeness of the latter, Mount Eerie could potentially
    strike a very winning alchemy.</p><p>
    
    If Elvrum's minimal aural finagling has bridled the fragmentary orchestra, so too, then, have Mount Eerie
    harnessed the unpredictable Elvrum.  The two are seldom less than a boon for one another, and their
    collaboration promises to be fruitful.  Whether there's another ""The Moon"" or ""The Glow"" waiting in the
    wings remains to be seen, but these records are clearly the fodder Microphones loyalists were yearning
    for, and cast a faint beacon of hope that Phil Elvrum's best years may yet lie before us.</p></div>"|11784.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11784-seven-new-songs-of-mount-eerietwo-songs-12/|7.8|Sam Ubl

Since the remarkable one-two punch of <i>It Was Hot, We Stayed in the
    Water</i> and <i>The Glow, Pt. 2</i>, the boundlessly imaginative singer/songwriter has seemed to intentionally
    evade the indie rock spotlight, offering vague explanations for his unpredictable actions and flooding the
    market with limited-edition releases under the Microphones name that more often beguiled than intrigued:
    <i>Blood</i> and <i>Little Bird Flies into a Big Black Cloud</i>, two handmade 12-inches, featured alternate
    versions of existing tracks sandwiched between curious sound experiments and song fragments, while the 2002
    compilation <i>Song Islands</i> compiled the band's seven-inches and other unreleased material.</p><p>
    
    In 2003, at the height of this deluge, Elvrum released <i>Mount Eerie</i>, the long-awaited official
    follow-up to <i>The Glow, Pt. 2</i>.  It would be his final studio release under The Microphones guise: a
    daunting concept album on which the man and his guitar played a diminished role amidst waves of atmospheric
    noise not far removed from the spotty material that had dotted his odds-and-sods compilations.  Here, Elvrum
    also took a backseat vocally to the album's many players, whose extended vocal turns and character acting
    made the record's belabored plot a difficult listen for many fans.</p><p>
    
    Shortly after that record's release, Elvrum announced plans to disband The Microphones altogether.  Lacking
    the grand public unraveling of a full-on crash-and-burn, the move couldn't help but feel somewhat anticlimactic:
    As excellent as <i>It Was Hot</i> and <i>The Glow</i> were, they were also terribly irresolute, and left
    Elvrum's legacy uncertain; the records, perhaps for their epic scale and overt ambitiousness, seemed to
    promise that even greater material could be in store-- for Elvrum to pull the plug just as he began to
    gain real momentum was a monumental letdown.</p><p>
    
    That was nearly two years ago.  Rather than hunkering down in the studio with a new cast of players, Elvrum
    has since played vagrant, embarking on circuitous touring spells, here and there dropping the odd sketchy
    detail about the studio endeavors and future plans of his new group, Mount Eerie.  With any forthcoming debut
    perpetually ""in-very-early-progress,"" it has lately seemed that this band's priorities lie on the road, and
    that Microphones fans might never receive the satisfaction of a worthwhile successor to <i>The Glow, Pt.
    2</i>.</p><p>
    
    Alas, those Anacortes-based deviants thought they could hide their clandestine labors from us.  Mais non:
    After a year of honing new material in concert, nine tracks have officially made it to tape.  Two new
    studio releases-- the <i>Seven New Songs of Mount Eerie</i> mini-LP and the <i>Two Songs</i> 12""--
    document a transitory year for Elvrum and his horde, as well as the devolution and distillation of a
    persona and sound.</p><p>
    
    Given a proper studio treatment (and an additional year of practice), Mount Eerie are far more engaging here
    than on this year's lukewarm <i>Live in Japan</i>. Unsurprisingly, the organic, close-mic'd sound posited on
    that collection has been reined in by Elvrum's masterful studio touch, allowing the music to retain an
    unaffected, live-performed spirit without ever sounding sloppy or unfinished.  Additionally, the advent of
    a live band has enabled Elvrum to reconcile two contrary elements of his erstwhile output: a penchant for
    epic experimentation and a deep understanding of the moving commonality of simplistic folk tunes.  Together,
    these elements coagulate into some of Elvrum's finest moments to date.</p><p>

    bum's rush.  I've never completely understood this.  Weren't dinosaurs streamlined models of evolutionary
    efficiency, perfected over millions of years into refined predators, environmentally friendly herbivores
    and the sleek ancestors of birds?  Well, yes, but they had the misfortune of being selected for extinction
    and having their good names applied to bad stadium rock and lumbering, progressive rock sideshows.  It's
    easy to slander Boston and Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer as obsolete cousins of the brontosaurus because it's
    funny, and there's a kernel of truth in the notion those bands were designed to fail; their best tunes
    were 6-minute studio concoctions that relied on you being either drunk, stoned or acutely drawn to unremarkable
    frontmen.  Still, to buy into standard rock-crit ideas of ""dinosaurs"" is to assume the only worthwhile thing
    those old lizards ever did was die.</p><p>
    
    Over the last 20 years, Japanese drummer and composer Tatsuya Yoshida (Ruins, Koenji-Hyakkei) has made a
    point to disprove this idea, resuscitating various species of lively dinosaurs.  His Ruins duo hijacked
    hardcore punk with the intention of bringing the savage theatrics of France's Magma, Italy's Area and
    Sweden's Samla Mammas Manna to an audience beyond the usual dark, clinical corridors of prog.  Those three
    influences-- all particularly rare and exotic species-- would indicate Yoshida's penchant for obscure beasts,
    but his Korekyojin trio (also featuring Bondage Fruit guitarist Natsuki Kido and Altered States bassist
    Mitsuru Nasuno) reveals a more bloated collection of fossils: Led Zeppelin, Yes (circa <i>Relayer</i>, no
    less) and Rush.  Yet, ever the organized paleontologist, Yoshida cleans and polishes his bones, removes the
    excess mud and clay, and constructs aggressive, razor-sharp skeletons of intimidating beauty and concision.</p><p>
<i>Arabesque</i> is Korekyojin's second album, and betters their 1999 self-titled release on John Zorn's
    Tzadik label.  The tunes are more focused, generally forgoing Yoshida's tendency to either splatter songs
    with chaotic improv or maddeningly acrobatic ""melodies.""  Make no mistake, these guys flaunt their shit--
    check the locked-in fireworks of ""Freestone"", especially Kido's virtuoso funk-inflected lines, or Nasuno's
    ridiculously dexterous bass work on ""Quicksilver""-- but it's the kind of shit that, believe it or not,
    actually gave a prog a good name for a short period in the early 70s.  And for good reason, as <i>Arabesque</i>
    could school any number of modern ""brutal prog"" acts (cf. Lightning Bolt, Guapo, Flying Luttenbachers) on
    how to string together 12 disparate sections into a 5-minute tune and not have come out a) disorganized,
    b) disjointed or c) too fucking insane to listen to.</p><p>
    
    Furthermore, Korekyojin is an all-instrumental project, so if you were holding out on this camp until they
    got the vocals under control, your ship has come in.  The title track busts out the Zep riffs right off the
    bat, and where Ruins would just as soon sour the punch with all manner of screeching histrionics, these guys
    pounce like brawny assassins all over you.  Yoshida's drums are big and spacious, like they had to reserve
    a symphony hall just to get the right reverb on his China.  You better believe he's a dinosaur.  ""Counterpoint""
    rams it all back home with a guitar riff born from ""Immigrant Song"", but allowed to zig and zag through
    Yoshida's head until coming out a raptor of a decidedly more violent, sadistic bent.  After a particularly
    muscular bout of group improv (again, check the bass), the trio lands on another Zep-informed riff, though
    this time it's ""Dazed and Confused"" gone Bartok.  Ai-o!</p><p>
    
    There are a few calm pieces on <i>Arabesque</i> (particularly the Eastern-tinged ""Presage"", about as pretty
    a piece of music as Yoshida has ever released), but Korekyojin's main appeal lies in their abilities to
    rawk as calculating carnivores and make even their ad-hoc moments seem bound to perpetual forward momentum.
    Mind the claws.</p></div>"|4580.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4580-arabesque/|8.2|Dominique Leone

Nobody can see your weak spots if you move too
    fast and deluge them with so much verbiage that the Freudian slips and incidental confessions are hidden by
    the onslaught.  Busdriver talks about the trials of L.A. life, divorced parents and bad breakups, but he
    slides on without a pause; the listener's too busy with the form to feel the content.  He changes the
    subject before you can even give him a simple, ""That's a bummer, dude.""</p><p>
    
    Listening to a Busdriver album is like getting rhymes out of a fire hydrant.  That's not a criticism: His
    hyperactive flow and hyperarticulate assertions are pure pleasure, and so is his delivery, where he's made
    leaps in technique since his earliest CD-Rs.  He stomps and sputters in (mostly self-)frustration, and his
    stentorian voice lurches in tempo and pitch; one minute he gulps his lines like a fish, the next, he spits
    out lyrics like nails.</p><p>
    
    Humor and vivid disgust weave together in his lyrics, which are convoluted and cliche-free: ""Falling in
    love in L.A./ Is like being pricked with a manicured thorn/ Innocent girls who look like they used to star
    in amateur porn/ One financial disaster, an exotic dancer is born.""  And the intensity comes and goes.  His
    rant at his ex on ""She-Hulk Dehorning the Illusionist"" is hilarious (""Somehow I've weaved the myth of a
    decent person around your good looks""), and becomes world-class caustic even before he hits the kiss-off:
    ""You have a playful fetish of having your anal crevice rammed in by a four-door sedan full of football
    players.""</p><p>
    
    Producer Daddy Kev sticks to jazz breaks, from swing to stride to cool to modern, with drumming that propels
    Busdriver's stumbling tempos, and raunchy horns that mimic the swing of his third leg.  Though the dustier
    breaks bring up unwelcome echoes of ""Lucas With the Lid Off"", Kev rarely leans on his sources for nostalgic
    ear candy.  Dig the way he turns the upright bass into a throbbing, almost electronic pulse on ""Beauty
    Supply and Demand"", or the way he fits the burlesque of the title track to the gutter-probing lyrics.</p><p>
    
    With no breaks or gasps for air between the tracks, <i>Cosmic Cleavage</i> is Busdriver's tightest, most
    consistent album.  But it might not be the best starting place for new listeners.  It's not as obviously
    clever (or corny) as his collaboration with Radioinactive and Daedelus, <i>The Weather</i>, and it's harder
    to penetrate than his full-length debut, <i>Temporary Forever</i>.  One of the most effective tracks on
    that record was a tape recording of Busdriver freestyling at the order booth of a fast food drive-thru.
    From the passenger seat, we got to hear Busdriver take a breath before he went back to be the life of the
    party again.</p><p>
    
    Without rests like that, <i>Cosmic Cleavage</i> has the whirlwind ""watch what I can do"" pace of an EP, and
    as it reaches the final track, the density threatens to make it collapse on itself: The thudding, slow bass
    guitar and jabbing keyboards melt into a hot mass, and Busdriver drops out altogether.  Like that scene at
    the end of <i>The Black Hole</i>, we're trapped by the gravitational pull-- what'll we find on the other side?
    The meaning of life?  The answer to our voyage?  God?-- but when we break through to the end, all we get is
    a titty joke sampled from an old <i>Seinfeld</i> episode.  Busdriver, you got away from us again.</p></div>"|1032.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1032-cosmic-cleavage/|8.0|Chris Dahlen

An interstice of calm at the tempest's center, the inert hub from which radial
    spikes of chaos erupt.  It's a formulaic metaphor that requires little explanation.  However, it's important
    to remember that clichés only become clichés by possessing a measure of intrinsic truth, a universal resonance
    that warrants their overexposure.  That innovation is not the last word in achievement is a fact often
    overlooked in appraisals of value.  The transmission of a heritage can be more aesthetically fulfilling to
    some listeners than a new permutation of aural components.  The unrequited love poem is a cliché, yet we
    continue to read and write them.  The <em>bildungsroman</em> narrative arc is a cliché, yet countless novels
    and films continue to potently employ it.  Cognition is binary: The human desire for novelty is twinned
    with an equally imperative desire for continuity.  All this is important to remember vis-à-vis Neurosis,
    who've been refining their formula for complexly symphonic disharmony over nearly two decades, and have
    won a legion of dedicated fans who wouldn't change a thing.</p><p>
<em>The Eye of Every Storm</em>.  I see what they mean, but have a hard time connecting the concept to this
    record.  There are periods of respite within the maelstrom, but these are so tense and tightly coiled that
    they still imply an unabated cacophony.  The quiet intervals don't impart the sense of fleeting tranquility
    one associates with the eye of a storm, and soon enough, the tortured, elongated riffs continue to topple
    ruins, uproot trees, move mountains and evaporate seas.  Some records <em>lull</em>, some <em>kick ass</em>,
    others <em>rock</em>; this one simply <em>lays waste</em>.  Mad Maxian, apocalyptic badlands music, death metal
    puked out at one-quarter speed and interleaved with weirdo folk interludes.</p><p>
    This is the fourth Neurosis record that Steve Albini has produced, and it's well-suited to the man who used
    to notch his metal plectrums and sing about Kim Gordon's panties.  Albini's method of pristine sound separation
    within a metallic, murky overall aspect fits <em>The Eye of Every Storm</em> like a leather scabbard over a
    broadsword (caveat: unlike more palatable-for-cynics, epic noise-rock bands like Zeni Geva, Neurosis records
    contain the ghosts of clattering twenty-sided dice).</p><p>
    The primal percussion and piercing feedback of ""Burn"" gives way to a sinuous, snake-charming lead and the
    guttural assertion: ""You lie in the snow/ Cold but not dead.""  The song is soon complicated with proggy
    guitar aerobics and sub-surface detonations, gaining intensity until it threatens to sunder load-bearing
    walls and bring the house down around your ears.  ""No River to Take Me Home"" starts slower, guitars ebbing
    in staticky pools beneath the ominous vocals, with a central section of quietude (is <em>this</em> the
    elusive eye?  I do not feel calmed) that is sharply juxtaposed with the reemergence of trudging drums and
    massive guitars.  And the title track's eerie alien spacescape is 12 minutes of modulated drones, shifting
    minor key(board)s, and some of the album's less shredded singing.</p><p>
    If every storm has an eye, Neurosis' latest psychic thunderclap must follow suit.  They just neglected to
    commit it to tape.  It's not that there aren't quiet parts; it's that even in their midst, there's no sense
    of diffused tension.  If there is an eye to this storm, it can only be the hole in the center of the CD--
    undeniably there, but gallingly inaccessible and remote.</p></div>"|5903.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5903-the-eye-of-every-storm/|7.0|Brian Howe

    the rest of his career, he might never again release anything as good as ""Dog Days"".  This is hardly a
    slight to Dear-- ""Dog Days"" just happens to be one of the most irresistible house numbers to come out in
    years, and the song casts a long, pitch-black shadow over the rest of his work.  Even Dear's 2003 solid
    debut LP, <i>Leave Luck to Heaven</i>, which tried to keep ""Dog Days"" tucked away until the sixth track,
    ultimately suffered from this emergent disparity.</p><p>
    Dear definitely feels the pressure.  After <i>Leave Luck to Heaven</i>, he tried his best to match the hook
    and energy of ""Dog Days"" with the feisty 12-inch single ""Anger Management"".  The fractured acid-house groove
    had just as much energy as ""Dog Days"", but lacked Dear's breathy vocal hook, relying instead on the warmth
    of the synth sounds themselves.  B-side ""Future Never Again"" fared similarly with gorgeous high- and low-end
    production, and from the release, it seemed that Dear had decided to forgo the ""Dog Days"" formula entirely
    and instead to concentrate on this very exciting warm acid-house approach.  Dear's abrasive debut <i>Kisses</i>
    EP as Audion only fortified this expectation, the 12-inch bearing the faint hint of a denser, club-friendlier
    Pan Sonic.</p><p>
    Given this trajectory, Dear's new <i>Backstroke</i> LP comes with two surprises: For one, Dear relies much
    more heavily on his vocals to carry the songs than before-- more than half of these tracks prominently
    feature his vocals.  What consciously results are Dear's first pop songs, most of which make recourse to
    traditional verse/chorus/verse structure.  The other surprise is more frustrating: Dear's instrumental tracks
    are remarkably flat.  They hardly match the energy of ""Anger Management"" or <i>Kisses</i>, let alone Dear's
    fantastic earlier EPs.  What's worse, since the instrumentals come between the vocal tracks, an otherwise
    exciting <i>Backstroke</i> suffers from some serious drag.</p><p>
    The torrent of noise that delays opener ""Another"" for over a minute finally gives way to a pulse of timid
    synth straight out of Warp's back catalog.  Dear updates the line halfway through with a bubbly glitch
    treatment, but given the line's fragility, he can't do much else with it, and the song stagnates.  Dear
    himself must have realized this about ""Another""; in fact, the vinyl release of <i>Backstroke</i> pulls it
    from the tracklist altogether.</p><p>
    Percussion sounds on ""Tide"" fire off and recoil while Dear snakes a simple but gargantuan bassline and some
    twitchy guitar action into the mix.  By the time Dear enters in verse with modest reverb, the song's chorus
    is about to take over: The guitar drops out, and Dear's catchy nanny-nanny boo-boo potshot (""I don't care
    'bout you anymore"") is closely followed by a trail of deadened vocals, used to bewilderingly great effect.</p><p>
    Unfortunately, what life ""Tide"" manages to breathe into <i>Backstroke</i> is enervated by ""Takes on You"",
    a seven-minute instrumental that boasts the precision of Kompakt but none of its heart.  Dear won't reclaim
    the listener's rapt attention until ""Grut Wall"".  Here, Dear contrasts trench-deep but well-defined low-end
    with bright clicks, while a tired bee-like buzz flutters between the two.  Shortly thereafter, the song's
    colorful electric piano melody-- perhaps a sinister counterpart to Jurgen Pääpe's line on ""So Weit Wie
    Noch Wie""-- settles in for good.  ""Grut Wall"" would have killed even as an instrumental, but Dear's exorcised
    vocals send it rocketing up to meet ""Tide"" as an album highlight.</p><p>
    After ""Grut Wall"", <i>Backstroke</i> becomes particularly disappointing.  ""I Know Howser"" is Dear's lazy
    attempt at schaffel-pop; the possibly tongue-in-cheek ""Huggy's Parade"" is an undeveloped, infantile ""Dog
    Days"" rehash; and there's not much to say about ""Good Girl"" other than that it's just fucking terrible.
    Thankfully, the album's epic closer, ""And in the Night"", redeems some of the album's second-side sins.
    Though definitely out of place on <i>Backstroke</i>-- it sounds more like an overloaded Happy Mondays
    than the minimal house approach to which Dear primarily subscribes-- its storm of horns, keyboards, bell
    sounds, and tape hiss work quite well behind Dear's multitracked vocal melodies.</p><p>
    It's unclear if ""And in the Night"" marks a new direction for Dear or just a fluke, but it stands as one
    last reminder here of how much Dear is capable as an artist.  In this sense, <i>Backstroke</i> could become
    even more of a burden to Dear: The album makes it strikingly clear when he's dead on, and when he's miles
    off.</p></div>"|2527.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2527-backstroke/|6.8|Nick Sylvester

    resonating, disembodied guitarisms establish a soothing alternate universe.  With his third solo project for
    Touch-- following 2001's <i>Suspension</i> and 2000's <i>Insulation</i>-- the Australian guitarist unwraps
    the warm chilliness of past efforts, organizing a languid, abstract world of lulling harmonics and slow-drip
    tones with the on/off attenuation of strings, bells and percussion.</p><p>
    
    Raised in Sydney, and of Sephardic Jewish heritage, Ambarchi's performed and recorded with labelmate Christian
    Fennesz, Sachiko M, John Zorn, Keith Rowe, Phill Niblock, Toshimaru Nakamura, Martin Ng, and others.  But
    while he's been performing live since 1986, guitar in tote, I'd prefer to keep Ambarchi as a one-dimensional
    wraith flittering about my cramped apartment: Nothing like seeing a guy sweating over knobs and cables to
    drain the magic from twilight overtones.</p><p>
    
    As is, <i>Grapes from the Estate</i>'s ambient clusters navigate a field of emptiness.  The first composition,
    ""Corkscrew"", would make an ideal soundtrack for one of Bill Viola's single-channel watery videos, especially
    the moments in which a microscopic lens outlines the surprisingly complex contours of each droplet. The
    piece consists of electric guitars, but sounds like an echoed tone generator, the occasional circles
    surrounding a submerged stone, or a fading gong.</p><p>
    
    ""Girl with the Silver Eyes"" bulks up with Hammond organ and drums, but casts a similar shadow.  The most
    noticeable difference is a fairly distinguished bass overload.  These gentle, heavy pulsations are the only
    cacophonous wavelengths on this album, and they're pretty minor.  Otherwise, at the near-midway point,
    regulatory brushes and snare wraps surface, followed by an intermittent kabuki melody that rises like an
    afterthought.  The track resolves as the pantomime of a quietly corroding music box unleashes its last
    gasps.</p><p>
    
    ""Remedios the Beauty"" opens with a hook and maintains the ""riff"" throughout: Mixing acoustic and electric
    guitars, piano, bells, drums, and the strings of Veren Grigorov and Peter Hollo, it comes off like sheets
    of crystalline snow spiked with a looped Four Tet yarn or a twangy western Matmos two-step at its center.
    Entering the pop realm, it's the most obviously musical, least enigmatic of the compositions.  Still, it
    works in setting up the starkness of the final 20-minute ""Stars Aligned, Web Spun"", which brings the album
    full-circle.  Ambarchi, again alone with this electric guitars, ups the enveloping absence of ""Corkscrew"",
    doubling its duration.  Over time, the sprawl unfurls like found inhuman frequencies: Ambarchi's patience
    in allowing calm tones to live healthy, long lives creates a blinking grid.  It's what I imagine a black
    and white Lite Brite would sound like if it were allowed a temporary whisper.</p><p>
    
    No matter how camouflaged, a guitar is a guitar.  Though it may be hard to believe this flickering six-string
    sunspot emerged from an instrument that established Steve Vai and Yngwie Malmsteen, Ambarchi makes his solo
    talk without resorting to a single spell-breaking finger-tap, mathy scale, or screeching whammy bar.  Wonder
    what he could do with ""Hot for Teacher""...</p></div>"|152.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/152-grapes-from-the-estate/|7.9|Brandon Stosuy

Sweet!  See you at Uranus.  Unfortunately, this spontaneous generation of black holes is like requesting gold circle seats in Hell, and a torrent of horrifying shit befalls the ship's crew.  While ultimately an unrewarding genre exercise, there's a kernel of spooky genius in the film's concept: It imagines a future where humanity's technological itch finally scratches open a purely metaphysical wound, an evil-bleeding gash in reality that neither David Bowman nor The Oracle can help sew up.  It suggests that IT and machines are only stacking our teetering tower of sanity higher.  Innovation doesn't destroy our collectively freaky history-- it just pays it to go away for a while.  And when similarly dangerous black holes are conjured from psycho sonic depths, our sick, dark, peanut-brain past comes forward to complete the real circle of life.</p><p>  Earth knew this; so does Sunn 0))).  The former's 1990s Sub Pop releases were long-form experiments in monolithic tone that tweaked our brain pans and smudged the margin between metal riff and irritable bowel. Naturally, they were incredible.  For a few years now, Sunn 0))) has been paying tribute at Earth's altar with a series of mostly guitar-based releases that flow from a similar vein of doomy trance and sickly noise.  But while Earth eventually settled on imagining what would happen if a muscle car's energy was harnessed, flattened and pounded into the shape of a bong, Sunn's sonic signature has drifted from post-stoner rock thrum into uncharted regions of stalagmite drone.  2003's <em>White1</em> genuflected to the black arts while deconstructing doom metal and sludgy trance; even when there were vocals, its sonic power tried to cut a hole in the world.</p><p>  The resulting <em>White2</em> is defined by its cover art.  On the front, faceless, cloaked peasants gather bounty as a lookout stands watch up a tree.  Are they boldly stealing the fruits of their evil master's garden?  Or are they feudal discards, their souls broken, content to wait out death working for the whims of another?  The answer might lie somewhere in the circular diameter of the grid on its back cover, or in its cryptic statement, ""Optimized for blackened sub-bass systems.""  Likewise, though the artwork may depict the Old World, it's an inside-out version, the result of serfs falling, limbs flailing, into that metric black hole.</p><p>  Sunn offer salve for the hole walls with <em>White2</em>'s three lengthy pieces.  There's a kind of bliss in the folds of ""Helloween""'s distorted bass and tensile, wavering electric guitars-- its thick, repetitive chord changes might be the steadily gaining footfalls of a giant whose friends have already left you beaten and bloodied.  Appropriately, the song's second half descends into droning death knells of tonal squall, a requiem for humanity.  On its surface, ""Helloween"" are riffs made miles long by sustain.  But that length is like a timeline, or a trajectory from the simple fears of man's formative years through the powerfully unsettling simplicity of two distorted guitars and an enormous bass cabinet.  On <em>White2</em>, Sunn set their amps on ""primeval.""</p><p>  If ""Helloween"" is human history distilled, ""Bass Aliens"" is a 23 minute-plus representation of queasy creeping death, filled with the echoing plinks of guitar strings and giant, sea monster swells of bass noise.  'Noise', because after a few minutes the low rumbles are matched and intensified by a processed feedback rattle, its insistent clapping and rattling a tense preamble like the clatter of an unlatched storm door before a F5 twister.  Unfortunately (or perhaps fortunately), the track doesn't quite deliver on its foreboding run-up-- with a final flurry of chop, the storm blows over.  But the world isn't getting off that easy. </p><p>  Sunn end <em>White2</em> with ""Decay 2 [Nihils' Maw]"", and a guest appearance from Mayhem affiliate vocalist Attila Cishar.  Clocking in at nearly half an hour, it's a hissing, howling piece of ambient death that suggests angry souls escaping from a manmade tomb.  Guitar notes and basslines shudder and eventually buckle, reassembling into unrecognizable strings of sound.  Melody falls away as atonal sediment sifts into a gaping black maw.  Faraway echoes could be manic laughter, but they also sound like that incessant, humid drip that persists inside the reptile houses of zoos.  The high-pitched whisper of disembodied choral groups rise in crescendo as peels of breathy screams course beneath Attila's wordless throat singing.  And when he finally begins to make words, it's in a terrifying dead language scarier than Sam Neil's eyebrows. ""Decay 2"" might be ol' crazy humanity's last hope for redemption, but Sunn 0))) leave us no indication of survival or death.</p><p> </p></div>"|7579.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7579-white2/|8.0|Johnny Loftus

    Out go the lights it begins<br/>
    A feelin' in my bones I never felt before<br/>
    People always told me<br/>
    that bars are dark and lonely<br/>
    And talk is often cheap and filled with air.""</i></p><p>
    
    My Morning Jacket's Jim James sings those words on ""Golden"", the effervescent centerpiece of last year's
    excellent <i>It Still Moves</i>.  It's hard to think of a more poignant evocation of the mix of nerves and
    adrenaline that precede a live performance.  But when he sings it over a spare arrangement of two acoustic
    guitars on the new live EP <i>Acoustic Citsuoca</i>, there's no hint of nervousness or hesitation-- he just
    goes for it.  James is one of those people who's been blessed with a voice that you could never mistake for
    another-- it's a clean, piercing tenor that reveals vulnerability when needed, but mostly just soars.  James
    doesn't even need to be saying anything to shiver spines, and when he lets his falsetto rip on a wordless
    passage of ""mmm's"" and ""aaah's"" at the end of this version of ""Golden"", it's one of the absolute highlights
    of a pretty strong set.</p><p>
    
    Perhaps what makes the passion behind the playing and singing on this EP most remarkable, though, is the
    fact that it was recorded at a very casual Halloween gathering in the most excellently named town in
    Massachusetts, Braintree.  There's a laidback, unrehearsed feel to most of it, particularly the three
    stripped-down solo tracks.  Around the two-minute mark in a run through <i>At Dawn</i>'s unrelentingly
    gorgeous ""Bermuda Highway"", James slips for a second on his acoustic and utters a barely audible little
    ""oop!"", and soon after that, almost bursts out laughing as he sings the verse twice by mistake.  Yet,
    these mistakes lend the music a sense of jovial intimacy, especially when set against the powerful
    directness of their content.</p><p>
    
    To hear these songs presented on record without the pools of reverb that My Morning Jacket's albums tend
    to float in is intriguing; they hold up very nicely.  The two fully arranged tracks that open the set are
    especially revealing.  ""The Bear"", from the band's debut, kicks off with the classic ""Be My Baby"" drumbeat,
    but with just the natural reverb of the Startime Pavilion, it sounds very different.  The effect is
    interesting, the band shuffling along with an easy groove while James climbs up into the ionosphere with
    his vocal booster rockets.  The version of ""Sooner"", originally from the <i>Chocolate &amp; Ice</i> EP, actually
    bests the original in some respects, particularly in the late verses when the guitars are replaced with an
    ominously beeping keyboard (featured in the original, but buried under a lot of other stuff) nicely
    befitting the Halloween milieu in which the song was performed.</p><p>
    
    It's not really going out on a limb to say that this is required listening for any established My Morning
    Jacket fan, even if newcomers would do better to start with one of their three full-lengths (take your pick;
    they're all fantastic).  It's a well-captured and spirited performance-- ""a most enchanting night,"" as Berman
    puts it-- and a fine between-albums teaser for fans can't get quite enough of My Morning Jacket's unique
    brand of sonic seduction.</p></div>"|5534.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5534-acoustic-citsuoca-ep/|7.5|Joe Tangari

    comedienne and television host, something akin to Argentina's Tracey Ullman, or say, Carol Burnett. It
    was a role she dutifully fulfilled for almost seven years before succumbing to a twerk of conscience and
    retreating to Los Angeles in the hopes of starting again, this time as a musician.</p><p>
<i>Tres Cosas</i> is Molina's third full-length since she abandoned television outright in the mid-90s,
    but her past as a successful comedian still clings closely to her brand.  The obvious reason for that is
    because it's a compelling backstory in its own right, the kind of anecdote that journalists and publicists
    don't easily forget.  But in the context of her work as a musician, the dogged funnylady characterizations
    begin to make even more sense; modest, meandering and resoundingly uncommercial, Molina's is just not the
    kind of music you would anticipate from a former star of any kind.</p><p>
    
    Conceived as a bare-bones response to 2000's comparatively elaborate <i>Segundo</i>, <i>Tres Cosas</i>
    consists of breathy, wafer-thin Argentinean folk that occasionally flirts with the vanguard.  Excepting
    the underwater synth piece ""Filter Taps"" and the gonzo pitch-wheel bonanza of ""Yo Se Que"", everything here
    hinges on Molina's nimble voice and a guitar, and yet it'd be misleading to stop at calling it acoustic
    music.</p><p>
    
    Part of Molina's appeal-- and this is what's getting her namechecked by more than just the world
    music set-- lies in the way her songs incorporate subtle additions like xylophones, strings, synths, loops
    and ambient washes without ever changing shape.  One gets the sense from tracks such as ""No Es Tan Cierto""
    (which slyly sneaks a xylophone and some sparse percussion behind its opening guitar motif) and the
    beautiful ""Curame"" (a three-shades blend of guitars, keys and vocals) that she's seeing the spaces in her
    songs and arranging them to match.  The end result is a record of mixed materials that still sounds natural;
    a far cry from some of folk music's more hamfisted attempts at acoustic/electronic collusion.</p><p>
    
    Because Molina's compositions tend to be guided by stream of consciousness, sing-songy word trails, some
    of them need lots of time to fully take root; others-- like the clumsy ""El Cristal""-- may never germinate
    at all.  On the whole, however, <i>Tres Cosas</i> is still remarkably lean in fat.  Neither particularly
    immediate nor eager to please, it's also absolutely nothing like a punchline, but who said Molina had to
    be funny anymore?</p></div>"|5593.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5593-tres-cosas/|7.2|Mark Pytlik

    Records in 1993.  You'll recall that, in the early 90s, major labels seeking to emulate the runaway success
    of Nirvana were signing every promising indie band they could get their hands on, and Rocket from the Crypt's
    distinctive blend of meat-and-potatoes rock, raging punk, tattooed and pomaded greaser style, and kitschy
    Americana must have fit the bill.  Interscope took the bait, and the record was a minor hit, garnering
    college and commercial radio play, and even MTV videos for ""Ditchdigger"" and ""Sturdy Wrist"".</p><p>
    
    But the circumstances of the signing remain shrouded in mystery, as RFTC has an odd propensity to fill their
    press releases with apocrypha: The band hilariously claims to have signed to Interscope for $70 million, and
    sold the label the rights to re-release <em>Circa: Now!</em> for an additional $32 million, which reveals RFTC
    as an ambitious band that doesn't shy away from a publicity generating hoax here and there.  And who could
    blame them for doing whatever it takes to separate themselves from the horde?</p><p>
    
    Allegedly, Interscope asked RFTC to record four new songs for their re-release of <em>Circa: Now!</em>, but
    got tired of waiting and released the record with its original tracklist intact.  Regardless of whether
    this is fact or another red herring, it's certain that there are four never-before-released tracks on
    Swami's reissue (hence the ""+4"" in the title).  The original and bonus tracks have all been remastered
    from the original quarter-inch transfers, and profit from the hi-fi yet dirty tone.</p><p>
    
    As <em>Circa: Now!
    +4</em> is an early album in a long and storied career that's seen the band amass a devout cult following
    (as well as for frontman John Reis' other projects, the seminal post-hardcore band Drive Like Jehu and its
    modern scion, Hot Snakes), it lacks the polish and realization of vision displayed by later albums like
    the Interscope-funded <em>RFTC</em>, but is solid nevertheless, and resolutely pointed in the direction RFTC
    would eventually take: distorted, sneering vocals; deep licks of pummeling bass and revving guitars; and
    brassy saxophone flourishes galore.  Drony and propulsive at once, with more midtempo swagger than can be
    found on their amped-up later fare, <em>Circa: Now! +4</em> might even be preferable to the more refined
    later work to listeners who like to take things a little slower.</p><p>
<em>Circa: Now! +4</em> opens with ""Short Lip Fuser"", a deviation from the prevalent loud/soft dynamic of
    its grungy era.  It's just fucking <em>loud</em>, a sonic embodiment of the screaming headache I'm nursing
    as I write (occupational hazard: why couldn't I be reviewing Low today instead of Chris Ott?).  It's a
    dramatic and pace-setting start, with a raw-boned opening riff that gradually accelerates through a morass
    of feedback to find its counterpoint and lock on to the marshal cadence of the drums, before suddenly
    DOUBLING IN VOLUME with an effect akin to that of opening a rock club's door midset.  (By the way, before
    you write in to point out my self-contradiction, the correct volume signature here is not loud/soft, but
    loud/LOUD.  Make a note.)</p><p>
    
    ""Hippy Dippy Do"" represents the rockabillyish side of RFTC, with its initial, flash-fried guitar figure
    going up and down like a rusty zipper, then jamming up in little tangles of pop/punk chugging. The
    uncharacteristically mopey ""Ditchdigger"" (by the Swami's turban, is this Social Distortion covering
    Jawbreaker?), with its regal, harmonic-laden ice sculpture of a melody, is an early standout, as is the
    swaggering dick-walk of ""Hairball Alley"".  The first bonus track, the seemingly underdeveloped ""Lamps for
    Sale"", does become more engaging when a fleeting horn line and upper-register guitar enliven the uninspired
    riff.  ""Crazy Talk"" is more distinctive, with pointillistic drills of tightly controlled thrash pinioned
    by rigid percussion, a lively vocal melody, and hair-raising reiterated rock breakdowns.  The bonus tracks
    are rounded out by the lubricated, unfettered thrust of ""Flight of the Hobo"" and pop/punk prototype ""Over
    the Rail"".</p><p>
    
    As I said: solid.  Rocket from the Crypt may get a kick out of duping the press, but their music ain't no
    joke.  Pitchfork's former resident RFTC booster Nick Mirov is gonna be sewing a new Rocket patch on his
    bowling shirt for this one.</p></div>"|6813.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6813-circa-now-4/|6.8|Brian Howe

    from the independent music press.  The balding, perpetually thirtysomething pop novelist has lately been
    trying his hand at rock commentary (a passion second only to soccer-- er, football), crafting articles for
    <i>The New York Times</i> and <i>The Believer</i>, editing a popular critical anthology (Da Capo's annual
    Best Music Writing series), and even publishing an homage to his 31 favorite songs, titled, appropriately
    enough, <i>31 Songs</i>.</p><p>
    
    Like it or not, Hornby is a relevant cultural figure who has used his clout as a novelist to help develop
    an ancillary career in music journalism.  Though his work in the field is certainly passionate, Hornby is
    undoubtedly a novelist first and a critic second.  The backlash, then, is understandable, when he exhausts
    2,000 words on sentimental lauding over uneven Philadelphia schlock-rockers Marah, or incessantly
    pontificates about his bygone youth and its tenuous-at-best connection to music.  It seems wherever the
    man lays his pen, it serves as a clarion call for the press to root against his new favorite band.  The
    task for fans becomes deciding if, in fact, the death knell is warranted.</p><p>
    
    Witness: Damon Gough.  Gough is an artist who has been handily and, some may argue, unfairly smote by Hornby's
    approbation.  After hearing his wonderfully enigmatic debut, 2000's <i>The Hour of Bewilderbeast</i>,
    Hornby was smitten, and asked the Badly Drawn Boy to score the big-screen adaptation of his <i>About a Boy</i>.
    Both film and score, however, were met with equal parts acclaim and enmity, leaving Gough's standing in
    flux.</p><p>
    
    While many insist the entrapments of commercial success (<i>About a Boy</i>, a contract with ArtistDirect
    BMG) have led Gough down an ill-fated path toward mainstream banality, I've willingly given him the benefit
    of the doubt.  A gleeful champion of <i>Bewilderbeast</i>, I've been searching for some hard evidence-- any
    evidence-- with which to refute Gough's intensely biased detractors.  I concede that, since his wily debut,
    the threadbare Briton hasn't crafted anything approaching the idiosyncrasy and charming verve of <i>Bewilderbeast</i>.
    But while the flaccid one-two punch of <i>About a Boy</i> and <i>Have You Fed the Fish?</i> festered in
    light of his momentous debut, those lackluster efforts surely weren't so awful as to rule out a potential
    return to form... were they?</p><p>
    
    Well, it's beginning to look that way.  Back with a new label (Astralwerks), and a shot at a new beginning,
    <i>One Plus One Is One</i> finds Gough accelerating his concerted drive toward commercial success, and the
    results only offer more fodder for the fallen auteur's ruthless gadflies.  There's nary a strong song here--
    not even a retread of ""Silent Sigh"" or ""Something to Talk About"", much less another ""Once Around the Block""
    or ""Everybody's Stalking"".  Sadly, Gough has firmly and perhaps inevitably cleared, as ex-PFM writer Jesse
    Fahnestock put it, the ""fenceline between execrable REO Speedwagon pomp-pop and touching, emotive songwriting,""
    and landed on, well, you can guess which side.</p><p>
    
    The troubling thing about Gough's undoing is that it hasn't come in the form of a mere stasis, but rather a
    willful regression to a by-the-numbers approach to songwriting, devoid of pretty much any substance.  On top
    of being simplistic, sonically unadventurous, and poorly recorded, these songs aren't the slightest bit
    catchy, a consequence of Gough attempting to balance his dour, nine-o'clock-shadow persona with FM radio
    aspirations.</p><p>
    
    The album's most immediately memorable aspect is its indiscreet prologue and epilogue: a
    pointless sample of what sounds like shopping carts being jostled in a supermarket, only without the
    telltale ch-ching of cash registers.  Gone are the sultry orch-pop orchestrations that characterized his
    debut and parts of the spotty <i>Fed the Fish</i>, replaced by a more pared-down palette of maudlin grand
    piano, close mic'd drums, plenty of indiscriminate strumming, and, for good measure, some new-age flute.
    Even Gough's trademark demure croon seems oddly self-conscious, doubtless a result of his voice sticking
    further out than usual from the tepid instrumental mix.</p><p>
    
    Points of interest are few and far between.  With their staid textures, the songs tend to blend into one
    another, sounding at best like a spiritless hodgepodge of <i>About a Boy</i>'s weaker moments.  The
    title track opener features a smattering of glockenspiel, trumpet, and overwrought strings, but the parts
    fail to coagulate, and the finished orchestration sounds like a bush league Fleetwood Mac.  Elsewhere,
    Gough's lyrics are regrettably schmaltzy, as on ""Year of the Rat"" he croons (with some help from a
    completely unironic children's choir), ""Everybody needs to know it's the year of the rat/ Everyday we've
    got to hold on/ 'Cause if we hold on, we could find some new energy.""  Elsewhere, ""Summertime in Wintertime""
    feebly acknowledges Jethro Tull, juxtaposing a bouncy flute against a generic prog riff.  In context, it's
    something of a <i>tour de force</i> number for Gough, but ultimately a stone better left unturned on an
    album best left unheard.</p></div>"|529.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/529-one-plus-one-is-one/|3.0|Sam Ubl

    and emotional support to people in need and shares its 29 years of experience with organizations nationwide
    through its training and consultation programs.""  The vagueness of that mission statement speaks more to the
    breadth of the organization's services than to the specificity of its actions, which range from education
    and research to care and transportation coordination for AIDS and cancer patients.  The organization also
    performs a distinct service to music fans by acting as a <i>raison d'etre</i> for three installments of the
    <i>Shanti Project Collection</i>s, a series of benefit albums that collect rare and/or unreleased songs
    from a disparate group of artists.</p><p>
<i>SPC1</i> featured Low, Red House Painters, and Idaho, while <i>SPC2</i>
    showcased dusky-voiced female singer/songwriters like Julie Doiron, Paula Frazer, and Edith Frost.  Compiled
    by Badman Records' Dylan Magierek and again illustrated with Nyree Watts' photography, the series' third
    installment is a departure of sorts: Whether purposefully or not, the first two comps focused on songwriters,
    but the five bands on <i>SPC3</i>-- The Black Heart Procession, Califone, Sigur Rós, Arab Strap, and Kinski--
    all emphasize sound over songs.</p><p>
    Each group contributes two songs to the album.  Ironically titled for a lead-off track, The Black Heart
    Procession's instrumental ""Exit Out"" floats along languidly, structured only by Mario Rubalcaba's
    Moebius-strip drums and some strategic chord changes; it's repetitive, but its endless loop builds and
    swirls evocatively. The band's penultimate ""Sort It Up"", however, is just repetitive.  Califone's ""Michigan
    Girls"" is a subdued blues track worlds removed from the backporch jamble of their take on the traditional
    ""Cluck Old Hen"", with its ramshackle groove and lengthy coda.  Arab Strap's dramatic ""We Know Where You
    Live"" and ""Devil Tips"" sound almost like The Streets without the garage beats-- spoken-word narratives that
    emphasize local details and let listeners insinuate larger meanings.  Kinski's two tracks (live-on-the-radio
    versions of ""Semaphore"" and ""Schedule for Using Pillows and Bean Bags"") build to intense peaks, much like
    Sigur Rós's ""Dánarfregnir Og Jaroarfarir"", which forms a louder counterpart to the quieter, lusher ""Bíum
    Bíum Bambaló"", both of which originally appeared on the <i>N\xFD Batterí</i> single.</p><p>
    Obviously, there's no lyrical consistency across these tracks, as only a few of these songs were recorded
    specifically for the <i>Shanti Project</i>, and only about half of those even have lyrics to begin with
    (and that's counting Sigur Rós's songs in Ice-/Hopelandic).  But <i>SPC3</i> compensates for this lack of
    cohesion with sonic juxtapositions that constitute a subtle act of rock criticism.  The collection draws
    out the similarities and differences between these five fairly distinctive bands, juxtaposing The Black
    Heart Procession's languorous lull with Sigur Rós's ethereal atmosphere, Califone's unobtrusive earthiness
    with Kinski's jet-fighter dramatics and Arab Strap's words-as-instruments creations.  The similarities
    between them all-- their devotion to songs that arc gradually and patiently, their sense of structure and
    dynamics, their occasional long-windedness-- become all the more obvious as their differences dissolve.
    The overall effect is that rarest of rarities: a charity collection that sounds sculpted and cohesive,
    that has shape beyond its individual songs and life beyond its origins as a fund-raiser.</p></div>"|1855.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1855-shanti-project-collection-3/|7.5|Stephen M. Deusner

From the clawhammer inspired
    folk songs of Iron &amp; Wine to the ramshackle orchestras of Mirah, the confessionals of Sufjan Stevens to
    the postmodern ballads of the ""freak-folk"" balladeers like Devendra Banhart and Joanna Newsom, the sounds
    of wandering minstrels are filling our stereo speakers with rainy-day melancholy and old timey lore.  But
    be forewarned: If you're planning on releasing your very own acoustic guitar album (and well you should,
    young plucker) you'd better be ready for comparisons to just about anybody who's whispered sad melodies
    over fingerpicked minor chords in the last 40 years.  Gravenhurst's Nick Talbot has discovered this the
    hard way since releasing <i>Flashlight Seasons</i> on his own Silent Age label in 2003; he's since been
    likened by reviewers to Belle &amp; Sebastian, Neil Young, Nick Drake, Jeff Buckley, Simon &amp; Garfunkel, and
    Elliott Smith, to name a few.</p><p>
    
    Now maybe I'm wrong, but it seems to me that not even God himself, armed with an acoustic guitar, could
    write a song that simultaneously juggles all of these artists' varied styles.  Yet a hushed tone and
    pastoral feel can seemingly overwhelm all other musical influences in the ears of some listeners, leading
    to cries of ""folk!"" from all directions.  In truth, Gravenhurst's songs are as indebted to Britpop as any
    songwriting tradition, as shades of The Smiths are evident throughout Talbot's midtempo, gracefully arranged
    works.  Regardless of press angle, Warp Records' reissue of <i>Flashlight Seasons</i> should end up finding
    a wide audience; it's a dark pop record that continuously revels in its own ennui, and will be blasting
    through many a pair of snow-covered headphones in the winter to come.</p><p>
    
    Most of the artists to which Gravenhurst has been compared are revered as much for their brilliant
    songwriting as their performance styles-- they've created songs that can transcend individual interpretation.
    Talbot, though he's put together a dense and appealing album, is no craftsman of such a caliber.  Relative
    to the musical company into which he's been thrust, his vocal melodies are insubstantial and lyrics pretty
    but vague.  <i>Flashlight Seasons</i>' songs are actually driven more their specific atmospherics and
    production, each bathed in a haze of carefully constructed ambiance and accompaniment.</p><p>
<i>Flashlight Seasons</i> is a bedroom album, a recording approach that Talbot prefers to the frustration
    of expensive studio work.  The home-recorded nature here is apparent, not because of anything lacking in
    the production-- in fact, the high quality of recording and mastering that Talbot attained are admirable--
    but because of the obvious amount of care put into the arrangement of each track.  He's managed an intimate
    and unpretentious sound, and taken the time to get it exactly right.</p><p>
    
    Nick Talbot has named the shoegazers among his primary influences, and the reverb-drenched guitars and low
    drones of the genre are apparent in the background of almost every <i>Flashlight Seasons</i> song.  ""I Turn
    My Face to the Forest Floor"" is an unabashedly dark and dramatic number with a chilling chorus.  The bleak,
    industrial landscapes channeled through the music of the post-rockers are evoked by the instrumental
    interlude ""East of the City"".  One of the album's strongest tracks, opener ""Tunnels"", features Talbot's
    icy harmonies over a funeral-march inspired drum and organ.  As a whole, the album makes for a moody
    journey of consistent beauty.  Unfortunately, the fact that Gravenhurst's atmospherics are not employed
    at the service of truly gripping songs means that, though <i>Flashlight Seasons</i> never hits a wrong
    note, its impact is made in muted shades rather than the sharp tones of direct emotion.</p></div>"|3640.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3640-flashlight-seasons/|7.1|Liam Singer

The Detroit trio of T3, Baatin, and Jay Dee managed to
    produce a phenomenal chest-thumping debut full-length, <i>Fantastic, Vol. 2</i>, two years before Em hit
    the silver screen.  The record crystallized Unmah all-star Jay Dee's patented ass-rattling bump and
    established him as one of the hottest producers in the game.  Unfortunately, after Jay Dee's departure
    in 2001, Slum Villa's sophomore release, <i>Trinity: Past, Present and Future</i>, left significant questions
    as to the group's longevity, despite notable production work by Bling 47 counterpart Waajid and promising
    returns from the duo BR Gunna.  2003 delivered more surprises when Baatin, Slum Vil's in-house Rasputin,
    was diagnosed with schizophrenia after increasingly erratic behavior on tour and a two-day shark steak-induced
    coma.  By 2004, hope was fading, deals were drying up, and the frequent lineup changes were wearing heavily
    on the remaining members.</p><p>
<i>Detroit Deli</i>, unfortunately, meets every expectation for a group as battle-weary as Slum Village.
    Tag team producers Young RJ and Black Milk (aka BR Gunna) possibly could have offered the benefit of solid
    backbeats, but they themselves are still searching for finesse.  Tracks like the 80s faux-funk of ""Do You""
    and the Egyptian twist of ""Things We Do"" bear hints of hotness, but in the end only paraphrase J. Dilla's
    genius.</p><p>
    
    Emphasizing beats over rhymes is purist anathema, but let's be honest: Elzhi, T3 and Baatin historically
    never have had the subtlety or dexterity to hold court by themselves.  Even on Slum Village's debut, Jay
    Dee was the visionary, and the rest of the gang was playing catch up.  <i>Detroit Deli</i> only emphasizes
    this disparity further: Baatin's sexistential ramblings are sorely missed; T3 has yet to push past his own
    penis; and Elzhi drops some flatout trash verses, as on ""Count the Ways"": ""You're screamin' in our semen/
    We get done.""  On the opening volley, ""Zoom"", T3, Elzhi and Detroit counterpart Phat Kat stumble like
    amateurs at the 106 &amp; Park tryouts: ""Catch me in Range with the rims, spinnin'/ Spinnin', sorta lookin'
    like its windmillin'.""  Even Wu-Tang fugitive Dirt McGirt comes off lazy on his feature track ""Dirty"",
    serving up the anthemic worst line of 2004 and a surefire lady-slayer: ""If you're flexible, intellectual,
    bisexual/ Can I get next to you?""</p><p>
    
    Despite its many shortcomings, <em>Deli</em> manages a few brilliant moments.  On Kanye West's addition ""Selfish"",
    Slum Village enlists the help of neo-neo-soul crooner John Legend to create a simply ephemeral R&amp;B; cut
    (although I wonder if Kanye's knack for homonyms on his verses is wearing thin).  The baby's-bottom vibe
    on ""Closer"" displays an understated me-so-horny romanticism few can match, and the inspirational ""Old
    Girl/Shining Star"" demonstrates Slum at its playful, gritty best.</p><p>
    
    That <i>Detroit Deli</i> even exists as an album testifies to T3 and Elzhi's determination, but Slum Village's
    ambivalence prevents the record from the organic smoothness of days past.  Without the production ethos of
    <i>Fantastic</i>, <i>Deli</i> only further complicates the group's turbulent history.  On ""Reunion"", Jay
    Dee quips, ""You thought we broke up / But we were just re-assemblin'""; if they even survive to make a
    fourth album, Slum Village will need to find a better configuration.</p></div>"|7252.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7252-detroit-deli/|6.1|Jamin Warren

    don't count my scars like tree rings.<br/>
    My jigsaw disposition, its piecemeal properties<br/>
    are either smoked or honey cured by the panic pure.""</i><br/>
           --Vic Chesnutt, ""Panic Pure"", <i>West of Rome</i></p><p>
    Whether as a critic, devoted fan, or casual listener, it's difficult not to count Vic Chesnutt's tree
    rings, just as it's hard not to overestimate the significance of his wheelchair.  It's become something
    of an icon to the Chesnutt cult, who scour his lyrics for commentary on the traffic accident that left
    the then-18-year-old Chesnutt paralyzed.  The wheelchair looms <i>Changeling</i>-style in songs like
    ""Isadora Duncan"" and ""Supernatural"", and one-time drummer Jeffery Richards used to play it as an instrument
    in live shows, when it would be rigged with microphones.</p><p>
    And yet, the tendency to trace the Pike County,
    Georgia, native's first four albums-- <i>Little</i>, <i>West of Rome</i>, <i>Drunk</i>, and <i>Is the Actor
    Happy?</i>, all of which were originally released on the now-defunct Texas Hotel label-- to that accident
    is more reductive than instructive.  As these and subsequent albums proclaim, there is more to Chesnutt
    than his wheelchair: There is a fondly, even desperately remembered childhood; a tumultuous marriage; a
    wicked sense of humor that played/preyed on pop culture like a musical <i>Mystery Science Theatre 3000</i>;
    a sharp mind; a caustic self-loathing; and a beautifully conflicted Southern man.</p><p>
    After releasing last year's <i>Silver Lake</i>, New West Records is reissuing those first four Chesnutt
    albums in handsome new editions full of bonus tracks culled from live shows, demos (many of which are early
    versions of tracks from 1998's <i>The Salesman and Bernadette</i>), alternate takes, and non-album tracks.
    Each reissue includes new liner notes by Chesnutt's friends and collaborators: producer/sidekick Michael
    Stipe (<i>Little</i>), friend and photographer Jem Cohen (<i>West of Rome</i>), fan Ian McKaye (<i>Drunk</i>),
    and poet Forrest Gander (<i>Is the Actor Happy?</i>).  <i>Drunk</i> is given a bright new cover, and
    thankfully, New West has upgraded the packaging on all four, vastly improving on Texas Hotel's cardboard
    sleeves.  The label even allows Chesnutt to right some wrongs: on <i>West of Rome</i>, for instance, he
    relegates the original opener, ""Latent/Blatant"", which Texas Hotel demanded lead off the album, to bonus
    track status, thus restoring his intended tracklist.</p><p>
<i>Little</i> was released in 1990, after producer and R.E.M. frontman Stipe caught one of Chesnutt's shows
    at the 40 Watt Club in Athens, Georgia.  The most elemental of any of Chesnutt's albums, it features just
    his warbly voice and precarious acoustic guitar, occasionally accompanied by Stipe's keyboard flourishes.
    As its title suggests, <i>Little</i> is about Chesnutt's Pike County childhood, a theme he would return to
    repeatedly as if thumbing worn and creased snapshots found at the bottom of a drawer.  ""Rabbit Box"" begins,
    ""While I was still in elementary school I discovered Daddy's tools,"" following the songwriter as he builds
    a rabbit box out of scrap lumber, but only catches a cat and a possum.  In one sense, his youth represents
    an uncomplicated time-- pre-crash-- when all of life's possibilities lay before him, before they were
    whittled down to the point they are now.</p><p>
    This theme similarly haunts <i>West of Rome</i>.  On ""Panic Pure"", he sings, ""My earliest memory is of
    holding up a sparkler/ High up to the darkest sky/ Some Fourth of July spectacular/ I shook it with an
    urgency I'll never ever be able to repeat.""  But Chesnutt isn't lamenting lost innocence, nor does he
    trust himself not to whitewash the past; memory is something to be wary of, childhood to be reckoned with,
    and his nostalgia alternates between guardedly wistful, recklessly jaded, and sometimes simply observational.</p><p>
    From <i>Little</i> to <i>Is the Actor Happy?</i> Chesnutt's themes grow from childhood to more adult matters
    like friendship, romance and community, while the music grows fuller and more dynamic, losing only a bit of
    <i>Little</i>'s casual intimacy as his backing musicians rotate in and out.  <i>West of Rome</i> has a warm
    sound, thanks to Stipe's increasing confidence as producer and Chesnutt's hesitant electric guitar on songs
    like ""Withering"" and ""Sponge"".  As its title suggests, <i>Drunk</i> is Chesnutt at his darkest, but its songs
    and scope suffer a bit.  ""One of Many"", ""Supernatural"" and ""Kick My Ass"" all crackle with self-reckoning,
    but too often the album meanders boozily, which is perhaps the point.</p><p>
<i>Is the Actor Happy?</i>, his fourth album and last for Texas Hotel, is not just arguably his finest
    release, but also his most extroverted.  His subject isn't just himself, but also his place among friends
    and amid the sprawl of the South.  Namedropping acquaintances like Bill Lowery as well as cultural figures
    like Larry Flynt, Upton Sinclair's Babbitt, and Stipe (in the apologia-cum-duet ""Guilty by Association""),
    he turns his observational eye outward, from the military convoy rumbling through ""Gravity of the Situation""
    to the kudzu-covered apocalypse of ""Free of Hope"".  Then there's ""Onion Soup"", a travelogue-via-epistolary
    song that crafts perfectly understated tragedy from an unsent letter: ""I wrote you an eloquent postcard once/
    About this most exquisite onion soup/ But of course I never mailed it, though/ 'Cause it was your turn in
    the loop.""</p><p>
    What connects these four albums is what Stipe calls Chesnutt's ""economy of gesture and brilliance of
    character.""  Chesnutt's writerly voice is as literary as it is lyrical, not merely because he writes in
    stories and often even in scenes, nor because his subject matter aligns very closely with the concerns of
    Southern writers like Barry Hannah and Eudora Welty, but mostly because Chesnutt can cajole words into new
    shapes and meanings.  On ""Speed Racer"", a song about Kierkegaardian victimhood from <i>Little</i>, he sings,
    ""I used to watch <i>Speed Racer</i> with that hyper attitude/ That carried me here to this fluorescent
    enlightenment.""  Against this curious juxtaposition of afternoon cartoons with European philosophy, the
    pun ""fluorescent enlightenment"" evokes anonymous college classrooms with their institutional lighting and
    the naïve freshman epiphanies therein, which spark briefly and eagerly like an overhead idea bulb.</p><p>
    Chesnutt's physical voice, shaky and high like a cartoon character, works the same way, drawing out odd
    syllables into strange, onomatopoeic sounds, even as he rushes to fit all his words to the melodies.  On
    ""Isadora Duncan"", he shifts the syllable break on the word ""attitude"" so that it sounds like ""a-tit-tude,""
    but without turning it into a raunchy joke.  He uses the British pronunciation of ""advertisements"" on
    ""Supernatural"", with the accent on the second syllable and a soft ""i"" in the third, and growls the word
    ""gravity"" so that it becomes ""grrrrrr-ravity.""</p><p>
    The cumulative effect of this approach to songwriting and singing is that these four albums sound like they
    all come from a very specific, very singular brain, pickled with alcohol and self-loathing but still prickly
    with highly personal insights.  Taken together, these albums form a quadrilogy of complex self-definition and
    self-loathing that is as contradictory as it is utterly compelling.  Few artists could hope to fill their
    music with as much humor, insight, personality and ""panic pure"" as Chesnutt crams into these songs.</p></div>"|11701.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11701-littlewest-of-romedrunkis-the-actor-happy/|8.6|Stephen M. Deusner

    trust himself not to whitewash the past; memory is something to be wary of, childhood to be reckoned with,
    and his nostalgia alternates between guardedly wistful, recklessly jaded, and sometimes simply observational.</p><p>
    From <i>Little</i> to <i>Is the Actor Happy?</i> Chesnutt's themes grow from childhood to more adult matters
    like friendship, romance and community, while the music grows fuller and more dynamic, losing only a bit of
    <i>Little</i>'s casual intimacy as his backing musicians rotate in and out.  <i>West of Rome</i> has a warm
    sound, thanks to Stipe's increasing confidence as producer and Chesnutt's hesitant electric guitar on songs
    like ""Withering"" and ""Sponge"".  As its title suggests, <i>Drunk</i> is Chesnutt at his darkest, but its songs
    and scope suffer a bit.  ""One of Many"", ""Supernatural"" and ""Kick My Ass"" all crackle with self-reckoning,
    but too often the album meanders boozily, which is perhaps the point.</p><p>
<i>Is the Actor Happy?</i>, his fourth album and last for Texas Hotel, is not just arguably his finest
    release, but also his most extroverted.  His subject isn't just himself, but also his place among friends
    and amid the sprawl of the South.  Namedropping acquaintances like Bill Lowery as well as cultural figures
    like Larry Flynt, Upton Sinclair's Babbitt, and Stipe (in the apologia-cum-duet ""Guilty by Association""),
    he turns his observational eye outward, from the military convoy rumbling through ""Gravity of the Situation""
    to the kudzu-covered apocalypse of ""Free of Hope"".  Then there's ""Onion Soup"", a travelogue-via-epistolary
    song that crafts perfectly understated tragedy from an unsent letter: ""I wrote you an eloquent postcard once/
    About this most exquisite onion soup/ But of course I never mailed it, though/ 'Cause it was your turn in
    the loop.""</p><p>
    What connects these four albums is what Stipe calls Chesnutt's ""economy of gesture and brilliance of
    character.""  Chesnutt's writerly voice is as literary as it is lyrical, not merely because he writes in
    stories and often even in scenes, nor because his subject matter aligns very closely with the concerns of
    Southern writers like Barry Hannah and Eudora Welty, but mostly because Chesnutt can cajole words into new
    shapes and meanings.  On ""Speed Racer"", a song about Kierkegaardian victimhood from <i>Little</i>, he sings,
    ""I used to watch <i>Speed Racer</i> with that hyper attitude/ That carried me here to this fluorescent
    enlightenment.""  Against this curious juxtaposition of afternoon cartoons with European philosophy, the
    pun ""fluorescent enlightenment"" evokes anonymous college classrooms with their institutional lighting and
    the naïve freshman epiphanies therein, which spark briefly and eagerly like an overhead idea bulb.</p><p>
    Chesnutt's physical voice, shaky and high like a cartoon character, works the same way, drawing out odd
    syllables into strange, onomatopoeic sounds, even as he rushes to fit all his words to the melodies.  On
    ""Isadora Duncan"", he shifts the syllable break on the word ""attitude"" so that it sounds like ""a-tit-tude,""
    but without turning it into a raunchy joke.  He uses the British pronunciation of ""advertisements"" on
    ""Supernatural"", with the accent on the second syllable and a soft ""i"" in the third, and growls the word
    ""gravity"" so that it becomes ""grrrrrr-ravity.""</p><p>
    The cumulative effect of this approach to songwriting and singing is that these four albums sound like they
    all come from a very specific, very singular brain, pickled with alcohol and self-loathing but still prickly
    with highly personal insights.  Taken together, these albums form a quadrilogy of complex self-definition and
    self-loathing that is as contradictory as it is utterly compelling.  Few artists could hope to fill their
    music with as much humor, insight, personality and ""panic pure"" as Chesnutt crams into these songs.</p></div>"|11701.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11701-littlewest-of-romedrunkis-the-actor-happy/|8.3|Stephen M. Deusner

           --Vic Chesnutt, ""Panic Pure"", <i>West of Rome</i></p><p>
    Whether as a critic, devoted fan, or casual listener, it's difficult not to count Vic Chesnutt's tree
    rings, just as it's hard not to overestimate the significance of his wheelchair.  It's become something
    of an icon to the Chesnutt cult, who scour his lyrics for commentary on the traffic accident that left
    the then-18-year-old Chesnutt paralyzed.  The wheelchair looms <i>Changeling</i>-style in songs like
    ""Isadora Duncan"" and ""Supernatural"", and one-time drummer Jeffery Richards used to play it as an instrument
    in live shows, when it would be rigged with microphones.</p><p>
    And yet, the tendency to trace the Pike County,
    Georgia, native's first four albums-- <i>Little</i>, <i>West of Rome</i>, <i>Drunk</i>, and <i>Is the Actor
    Happy?</i>, all of which were originally released on the now-defunct Texas Hotel label-- to that accident
    is more reductive than instructive.  As these and subsequent albums proclaim, there is more to Chesnutt
    than his wheelchair: There is a fondly, even desperately remembered childhood; a tumultuous marriage; a
    wicked sense of humor that played/preyed on pop culture like a musical <i>Mystery Science Theatre 3000</i>;
    a sharp mind; a caustic self-loathing; and a beautifully conflicted Southern man.</p><p>
    After releasing last year's <i>Silver Lake</i>, New West Records is reissuing those first four Chesnutt
    albums in handsome new editions full of bonus tracks culled from live shows, demos (many of which are early
    versions of tracks from 1998's <i>The Salesman and Bernadette</i>), alternate takes, and non-album tracks.
    Each reissue includes new liner notes by Chesnutt's friends and collaborators: producer/sidekick Michael
    Stipe (<i>Little</i>), friend and photographer Jem Cohen (<i>West of Rome</i>), fan Ian McKaye (<i>Drunk</i>),
    and poet Forrest Gander (<i>Is the Actor Happy?</i>).  <i>Drunk</i> is given a bright new cover, and
    thankfully, New West has upgraded the packaging on all four, vastly improving on Texas Hotel's cardboard
    sleeves.  The label even allows Chesnutt to right some wrongs: on <i>West of Rome</i>, for instance, he
    relegates the original opener, ""Latent/Blatant"", which Texas Hotel demanded lead off the album, to bonus
    track status, thus restoring his intended tracklist.</p><p>
<i>Little</i> was released in 1990, after producer and R.E.M. frontman Stipe caught one of Chesnutt's shows
    at the 40 Watt Club in Athens, Georgia.  The most elemental of any of Chesnutt's albums, it features just
    his warbly voice and precarious acoustic guitar, occasionally accompanied by Stipe's keyboard flourishes.
    As its title suggests, <i>Little</i> is about Chesnutt's Pike County childhood, a theme he would return to
    repeatedly as if thumbing worn and creased snapshots found at the bottom of a drawer.  ""Rabbit Box"" begins,
    ""While I was still in elementary school I discovered Daddy's tools,"" following the songwriter as he builds
    a rabbit box out of scrap lumber, but only catches a cat and a possum.  In one sense, his youth represents
    an uncomplicated time-- pre-crash-- when all of life's possibilities lay before him, before they were
    whittled down to the point they are now.</p><p>
    This theme similarly haunts <i>West of Rome</i>.  On ""Panic Pure"", he sings, ""My earliest memory is of
    holding up a sparkler/ High up to the darkest sky/ Some Fourth of July spectacular/ I shook it with an
    urgency I'll never ever be able to repeat.""  But Chesnutt isn't lamenting lost innocence, nor does he
    trust himself not to whitewash the past; memory is something to be wary of, childhood to be reckoned with,
    and his nostalgia alternates between guardedly wistful, recklessly jaded, and sometimes simply observational.</p><p>

    Invisibles had shot their load and were hobbling on the crutch of their own hype.  The raunchy salsa-disco-funk-fusion
    they'd previously pioneered had gone flaccid, drooping under the weight of its own gratuitous hyphenation.
    Even the flowery influence of David Byrne's Luaka Bop label couldn't give Los Amigos the creative boost
    they needed.  A band that was once an international phenomenon was in danger of being completely forgotten.</p><p>
    Then, something wonderful happened: lightning struck, planets aligned, genius intervened.  Someone put a
    call in to production team Masters at Work.  As the elder statesmen of the club-friendly blend of throbbing
    Latin rhythms and breezy electronic textures known as the Nuyorican sound, ""Little"" Louie Vega and Kenny
    ""Dope"" Gonzalez were the perfect choice to sculpt the band's post-millennial image.  Whereas <i>Arepa</i>
    took a hesitant, flailing step towards dancefloor electronica, <i>The Venezuelan Zinga Son, Vol. 1</i>
    dives gracefully into its swirling currents.  The album's filtered percussion, insistent backbeat and
    silvery, synthesized sheen mark it as a mood enhancer that could've been borne out of the OM or Ubiquity
    Records incubator.  This is the sleek, globe-spanning lovefest Los Amigos always had in them-- Masters
    at Work just peeled away the fluff.</p><p>
    There's no question that these six Venezuelan funboys have grown up, but they're still far from mature,
    which is ultimately a good thing.  For instance, they again present an unabridged 70-minute marathon, but
    this time it's due to extended track length (another house-mix touch) rather than an excessive number of
    tracks.  Also, their playful horndog tendencies have become humorous asides rather than a fratboyish focal
    point (the album's name loosely translates to ""The Major Venezuelan Fuckfest""), a misstep in their older
    work that led to song titles like ""Masturbation Session"" and ""El Disco Anal"".  Most importantly, though,
    the overall sound is much richer-- singer Julio Briceño's voice has been mellowed into the instrumental
    mix, an arrangement relying more on lush, multi-tracked layering than aggressive shredding.</p><p>
    Since their beginnings, Los Amigos have blended an array of dance-inspired influences, and <i>Zinga Son</i>
    emphasizes each while maintaining a well-balanced mix.  There's Brazilian flourish in the batucada breakdown
    of ""Playa Azul"", comedic P-Funk crowd noise in ""Majunche""'s bubbly funk, Willie Bobo-style boogaloo in the
    horn-accented ""Calne"", and a whole lotta Steely Dan-ish AM radio swish in ""Diablo"".  But calling these songs
    out by name diminishes the album's convivial continuity-- like the best dance music collections it flows
    seamlessly.  ""Comodón Johnson"" opens the record on a shy and atmospheric note, its birdsong and wind chimes
    building a summery, front porch vibe.  Soon, a cover of Touchdown's 70s disco anthem ""Ease Your Mind""
    delivers Hall &amp; Oates-evoking synth and sax, and the festivities approach full-swing.  This song specifically
    stands out for its silky production and corny, infectious vocals, and with its blissful, ""golden age of
    disco"" flush, could well become an international club hit.</p><p>
    Whether it's Los Amigos' newfound dynamic sensibility or the studio savvy of Masters at Work, there's an
    intuitive progression to the album that works like a little white pill and makes everything flow just like
    it should.  By the time the dreamy, libidinous ""Bruja"" closes the album with its reverbed vocals and loose
    guitar massage, a warm corporeal pleasure has set in.  This is the point when the aphrodisiac effects of
    the music take over and it becomes imperative to find a dark, private spot and the companion of your
    choice.  From Caracas to Rio to Manhattan, <i>Zinga Son</i> is a musical tour of glittery discotheques,
    sunny beaches, and sweaty underground clubs that's surprisingly sophisticated and undeniably sensual.</p></div>"|4861.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4861-the-venezuelan-zinga-son-vol-1/|7.8|Jonathan Zwickel

    behind with each passing minute, as thousands of records in an uncountable number of styles continue to find
    their way in and out of record bins-- has not yet taken me to the French punk/new-wave scene of the late
    70s.  And there's a good chance I'll never get there, since punk was never something I identified with much,
    and I've even been sluggish about hearing all the important stuff released by countries that speak my own
    language.  Given my slight background in the Continental new-wave of the late 70s, I can't tell you exactly
    where Frenchman Eric Debris, who was a member of Metal Urbain before he started recording solo as Dr. Mix
    and the Remix in 1979, fits in.  But listening to this compilation of his complete works under this alias,
    I can tell you he was onto something pretty great.</p><p>
    
    Debris' M.O. as Dr. Mix and the Remix was to record covers of late 60s/early 70s rock 'n' roll and avant-garage
    classics on which he'd overdrive the guitars to ridiculously trebly lengths, and then sing a bit like Ian
    Curtis, in a clunky French accent, through a pitifully cheap reverb unit while letting a rudimentary drum
    machine handle the beats.  During Dr. Mix's short run from '79 to '82, Debris released a handful of singles
    and one full-length album (also called <i>Wall of Noise</i>), mostly on Rough Trade.  In the 1995 <i>Spin
    Alternative Record Guide</i>, The Jesus &amp; Mary Chain's Jim Reid pegged that album his third favorite record
    of all time-- which says something for Reid's courage, since the distinctive sound of <i>Psychocandy</i>
    appears to have been lifted wholesale from select <i>Wall of Noise</i> cuts.</p><p>
    
    The Stooges' standard ""No Fun"" appears in three different versions: The single, which leads off this disc,
    was a full-band leftover from a Metal Urbain session; the original album version included later is cheaper
    and noisier (and better); and then there's a great instrumental ""version"" (also recorded solo), which served
    as the B-side of the single.  The Dr. Mix treatment of ""No Fun"" finds Debris sounding like a dork and yet
    managing a certain cool, democratizing Iggy Pop's sexuality by making it available to anyone with the energy
    that a few meager tools creatively deployed.</p><p>
    
    Even more exciting, the insistent and stiff 4/4 kickdrum on a 10-minute version of The Velvet Underground's
    ""Sister Ray"" could become proper dance music with the right EQ settings, and Debris' slurred and drooling
    vocals lead one to believe he did, in fact, hit the mainline-- possibly sideways.  The Troggs' ""I Can't
    Control Myself"" finds Debris turning down the guitar a bit to focus on his vocals, the barking cadence of
    which suggest that Wolfman Jack might have done a radio tour of France at some point.</p><p>
    
    Not all the old chestnuts fare so well (""You Really Got Me"" is dinky synth-pop, and its clean recording
    makes it seem amateurish rather than inspired) and the Dr. Mix originals are generally pretty bad, mostly
    warmed-over rockabilly forms without the wit and energy Debris brings to the covers.  Despite these serious
    dull patches, when Dr. Mix is good, he is very good.  Most of all, <i>Wall of Noise</i> gets to the heart
    of why American rock music became a worldwide phenomenon: The format is supple and can be endlessly shaped
    and re-imagined without losing its essential identity.</p></div>"|2566.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2566-wall-of-noise/|7.1|Mark Richardson

    tumbleweed, and a cardboard cut-out moon.  You can see her performing blind and oblivious in the midst
    of a saloon-bar brawl, strumming and humming to herself while fists are thrown.  You can see her as some
    speechless, shy introvert, only experiencing love through romance novels and crackly old country records,
    playing songs in her bedroom that no one will ever hear.</p><p>
    
    Whatever images <i>Honey for Dinner</i> conjures of its author, they're all fascinatingly out-of-time.
    While anyone with a four-track and a few Robert Johnson records can feign some form of retro authenticity,
    it's much harder to mine the styles on display here and still sound like an intriguing, individual artist
    in your own right.  Produced by Will Oldham's brother Paul and featuring Papa M's Dave Pajo on bass, drums,
    and banjo, Peggy Honeywell's curious debut collection of delta blues, bluegrass, and classic country yodel
    achieves this better than most.</p><p>
    
    Still, despite the noteworthy guest appearances, <i>Honey for Dinner</i> lacks any kind of technical
    proficiency.  Opening shot ""Sympathy Date"" alternates between sharp, graceless guitar jabs and eloquent
    wisps of slowed-down melody.  Pajo backs it all with the barest of banjo lines.  Musically, the track is
    crude and brash, but by lacing it with the endearingly self-deprecating lyric, ""I took advantage of your
    kind, kind heart/ 'Cause I'm really not as smart,"" Honeywell comes off coy and sweetly bashful.</p><p>
    
    Just past a pair of 50s blues 'n' boogie pastiches lies a brace of gorgeous ballads: ""Hug My Heart"" and
    ""Moon"".  The former is a fluttering heartbeat of fixation and longing, while the latter's cries of ""I
    don't wanna live on the moon"" rail against green-eyed ambition, reveling in simplicity and home comforts.
    Honeywell's voice displays straight-edge honesty and emotes with an almost-weeping wilt, providing these
    tracks with even greater allure.</p><p>
    
    Of course, while the ensemble's technical incompetence can be quite charming, its limited musical pallet
    proves somewhat frustrating.  It's baffling that Pajo is sidelined here, given his talent for arrangement;
    he offers only the slightest flicker of bass or slide-guitar, allowing Honeywell's clumsy three-chord strum
    to drive the record.  As a result, the title track and ""Bower Bird"" are stunted by a lack of variety-- and
    clocking in at just over 20 minutes, the record does seem somewhat slight as a result.</p><p>
    
    The litmus test for whether you'll enjoy or despise this album lies in the closing cover of the Elvis Presley
    standard ""All Shook Up"".  Swapping rock 'n' roll stomp for a folksy flutter of panicked plucking and off-beat
    singing, Honeywell's version casts love as less the adrenal sensation that pulsated through Elvis' original,
    and more her own flush of blushes and half-stuttered sentences.  If you enjoy watching your love songs struggle
    to express the depth of emotion by which the singer is tormented-- offering only a glimpse of the passion
    exploding underneath-- you may find Honeywell's ""All Shook Up"" completely entrancing.  But <i>Honey for
    Dinner</i>'s self-imposed musical limitations do keep it from being something truly special, and as such,
    the album simply stands as a charming, impulsive, and beguiling collection of awkward bluegrass and mannered
    southern strum.</p></div>"|3978.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3978-honey-for-dinner/|7.0|Neil Robertson

    For Stars may be more than happy to oblige.  <i>...It Falls Apart</i>, the band's fourth full-length, has
    arrived, quavering vocals, organ dirges, and bubbling synths ablaze.  Sonically overwhelming throughout its
    eight tracks, the album affirms the enduring significance of alt-rock's most pervasive clichés.  As such,
    the album <i>feels</i> important, but behind its earnest and not-so-clever ruse lies little more than
    well-articulated fluff.</p><p>
    For Stars seem to be angling for a happy medium, and in some ways, they achieve it.  Like Radiohead without
    the intellectuality and studio precision, or Grandaddy without the endearing sloppiness, the California
    group hover between stylistic opposites, trying ardently to grasp both extremes, but ultimately fail to
    match the scale of their unrealistic ambitions. <i>...It Falls Apart</i> is essentially a mottled amalgam
    of alt-rock truisms, overloaded with grandiose piano ballads, backwound guitars and glistening synths.</p><p>
    The record can be viewed a historical tribute of sorts, as virtually every song closely (and perhaps accidentally)
    approximates one or more of rock's most widely canonized artists, to the point that a track-by-track litany
    could be recited.  Listening from that perspective, sadly, does little to absolve the album of its abundant
    faults: Most devout music fans have already heard all the bands For Stars ape, and in their shadow,
    this group is revealed as a feeble doppelganger, tiredly reiterating moot points for which only the most
    gluttonous listeners will reserve patience.</p><p>
    The jig is up from the get-go.  Opener ""I Should Have Told You"" recasts Radiohead in the wan light of airy
    American orchestral pop, riding an <i>OK Computer</i>-nostalgic riff over a well-trodden ground of arena
    rock piano and painfully over-affected vocals.  Equally ludicrous are Carlos Forster's lyrics, chief among
    which is the refrain, ""I took her down/ And I made her cry.""  And as if that acerbic salvo wasn't enough,
    ""Calm Down Baby"" impedes the point with the devastating chorus, ""Friends again/ You're just my friend again/
    There's a million things I'd rather be than your friend.""  A breakup album if nothing else, <i>...It Falls
    Apart</i> adheres to its role consistently and appropriately, a lot like, say, Tom Green in <i>Freddy Got
    Fingered</i>.</p><p>
<i>It Falls Apart</i> isn't completely devoid of pleasurable moments-- just severely lacking in them.
    Pinioned by a four-on-the-floor drumbeat, ""It Doesn't Really Matter"" avoids disintegrating in For Stars'
    typically overzealous wall of sound, allowing listeners a rare chance to appreciate Forster's lilting
    vocals and the band's amply reverbed guitar fronts.  Here, when the usual monotony begins creeping in near
    the two-minute mark, in comes a sultry trumpet break, performed subtly and limberly enough not to deluge
    the song in cheese.  Unfortunately, it's back to the piano and more spiritless love ballads from there.</p><p>
    What For Stars lack in originality they overcompensate for in emotionality.  I have no doubts about Forster's
    sincerity when he belts lyrics like, ""Make me a sailboat/ And put me in a bottle/ 'Cause I got a dream/ Of
    seeing the sea""-- and that's the troubling part.  His simplistic, declaratory verses are par for the course
    in pop music, but when they're presented as quixotically as on the maudlin ""Calm Down Baby"", they cease to
    merely be part of the mix and grow intrusive.  And on the grand scale of pop music history, For Stars are
    certainly very <em>un</em>obtrusive, but there's nothing more unnecessary than callow attempts like this to
    mask something that's already been done masterfully as an original statement.  It's one thing when cover
    bands make unabashed efforts to eulogize the work of others, but there are few things so obnoxious and
    ill-fated as when a group borrows established motifs and attempts to brand them as their own.</p><p>
    In fairness, Forster does have one thing right: On the soporific, Pink Floyd-copping ballad ""Shattered
    Glass"", he observes, ""This is no ordinary world.""  If only For Stars were successful at abiding that
    verity in their music, we might be talking a much different game.</p></div>"|3153.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3153-it-falls-apart/|4.6|Sam Ubl

    group's driving force.  Despite serving as lead guitarist for a band that came to typify a genre, Williams
    always played a somewhat diminished role, relegated to ancillary status by drummer-cum-frontman Damon Che's
    beguiling polyrhythms.  I always wondered how Don Cab would fare with a less audacious (if not just lesser)
    drummer, and Battles' <i>EP C</i> and <i>Tras, Fantasy</i> offer the answer:  Buoyed-- never obscured-- by
    John Stanier's competent but unspectacular timekeeping, Williams flourishes, spearheading a set of hardened
    guitar harmonies that summon the likes of Philip Glass and Unwound.</p><p>
<i>EP C</i> and <i>Tras, Fantasy</i> are the first in a succession of three EPs scheduled for release this
    year by Battles (a third sees issue in September), a collaboration between Williams and emergent avant-jazz
    composer Tyondai Braxton.  The guitarists' styles harmonize uncannily well, and <i>EP C</i> underscores
    their individual abilities while simultaneously siphoning them into an adherent combo.  Somewhat protracted
    in the development of their central ideas, these consciously static songs, once unleashed, bottle enough
    tension to topple a house.</p><p>
    Dreary, postmodern and monolithic throughout, <i>EP C</i> stays a rigid and weary course, unflinchingly
    dialed-in to Stanier's cagey ostinatos and Williams' confrontational anti-melodies.  Stanier's utilitarian
    playing serves as sturdy accompaniment to Williams and Braxton's brittle fingering, but he knows how to
    pour it on-- in his minimalist way-- when it serves: ""Tras 2"" carries <i>EP C</i> out with an two-minute
    drum ""solo,"" almost completely devoid of fills, during which Stanier verily delivers the disc's hardest
    groove.</p><p>
    On opener ""B + T"", his drumming stays a rigid course, pounding a Spartan but insistent rhythm until a
    roaring triplet fill brings the song to an abrupt halt.  Exceeding six minutes in length, it's an early
    potential breaking point, a sophisticated and confrontational slog that tries the listener's patience.
    And that's pretty much Battles in a nutshell.  Williams &amp; Co. aren't here to dick around; their shrill
    dynamics offer an immediate and unsettling clarion call.  Chances are, if you're not feeling <i>EP C</i>
    from the get-go, you won't see it through to the next track, much less the fifth.  Yet, in only 24 minutes,
    Battles turn in a holistic statement that fulfills its ambitions and leaves no end untied.</p><p>
    If ""B + T"" is the heady statement of intent, ""UW"" is the cordial palette cleanser; for three expansive
    minutes, Battles' dense rhythmic onslaught is supplanted by an ambient synthscape.  In contrast with the
    confrontational instrumentation of the opening track, ""UW"" is devoid of live acoustic performance, relying
    instead upon the noncommittal jabbering of synthesizers.  Fortunately, the song neither wanders too far
    from the band's concise style, nor indulges too liberally in textural experimentation to be a detriment.</p><p>
    From there, however, the poles posited on the opening two tracks coalesce into a more fully-formed representation
    of Battles' sound.  ""Hi/Lo"" opens with a chiming, arrhythmic Rhodes riff before stiffening up to a sludgy
    bass-and-drums vamp.  Understated synths are slyly interwoven throughout, fleshing out the staid textures
    produced by the band's acoustic core.  Elsewhere, ""Lpt-2"" dabbles in trip-hop-style beat manipulation,
    while closer ""Tras 2"" further deconstructs the band's sound, featuring curt start/stops and counter-rhythms
    that channel Don Cab more directly than any other song here.  As the disparate elements drop out, Stanier
    persists, carrying the groove for nearly two minutes before removing his syncopated snare cracks and leaving
    his kickdrum to erratically feel for the beat.</p><p>
    The band wastes no time with intimations or foreshadowing on <i>Tras, Fantasy</i>, blending electronics
    into the acoustic mix from the outset. ""Tras"" conveniently encapsulates many of the themes sprinkled about
    on <i>EP C</i>, reining in Battles' penchant for odd-time syncopation, angular guitar harmonies, and
    electronic tinkering in a prompt 3\xBD minute package.  Though its central riff isn't as compelling as any
    of those on <i>EP C</i>, the song nevertheless underscores the musicians' intricate communication while
    highlighting their individual talents.  ""Fantasy"", the album's B-side, turtle-turns the directness of
    ""Tras"", eliminating all semblance of melody and replacing it with a hard-driving house beat that meanders
    for 8+ minutes over several subtle variations.  Brazen and uncompromising, the ""song"" is a real backbreaker,
    cryptically reflective of Battles' jarring compositional style and opaque aesthetic.</p><p>
    If these records are a testament to Ian Williams' skill as a frontman, they also shed new light on the
    talent of Damon Che.  While Battles play an intentionally much grimmer style of music than Don Cab, Che
    had an astounding knack for evincing vibrant textures from his sonorous kit, and as a result, lent color
    to Williams' playing.  Here, Williams is bleaker, clearer and firmer, making Battles a much different--
    but no less muscular-- beast than his former band.</p></div>"|11693.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11693-ep-ctras-fantasy-ep/|7.8|Sam Ubl

While most of us first encountered him as the Brooklyn
    bard behind last year's precious <i>Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State</i>, Stevens had in fact
    made two very different recordings prior to that album's release.  Proceeding in reverse chronological order,
    in 2001, Sufjan put together <i>Enjoy Your Rabbit</i>, which was, for all intents and purposes, a noise
    album based on the Chinese zodiac cycle.  Sounding more like a side project than a juicy bit of Stevens'
    history, that record understandably throws new Sufjan devotees for a loop, especially given the sparse
    acoustic sound of his most recent release, <i>Seven Swans</i>.</p><p>
    
    In contrast, Stevens' 2000 debut, <i>A Sun Came</i>, makes much more sense as a <i>Michigan</i> prequel.
    The disc's music was written and recorded in 1998-- back when a collegiate Sufjan played whistles for the
    Michigan folk quartet Marzuki-- and provides a backstory rich enough to suggest that his music could have
    gone in any number of directions.</p><p>
    
    Over the course of the album's original 18 tracks, Stevens revealed his Celtic, Middle-Eastern, Indian,
    American folk, and indie rock influences, experimenting with noise and vocal samples, and playing no less
    than 14 instruments.  In this respect, <i>A Sun Came</i> suffers from a double-edged bloat.  Stevens had
    many disparate ideas here, and his songs were necessarily dense as a result, yet he refused to censor
    himself.  After a sprawling 78 minutes (the reissue adds three tracks), <i>A Sun Came</i> bears more than
    a few missteps and a good number of head-scratchers, but by chance also documents some bright beginnings
    for this increasingly popular songwriter.</p><p>
    
    Sufjan's whistle tenure with Marzuki betrays itself instantly: ""We Are What You Say"" opens briskly, with
    swoops of guitar plucks providing a cushion for the harmonized flutters of wood flutes.  The song's Celtic
    current surfaces most noticeably when heavy-handed percussion ushers in a chorus of dense countermelodies.
    Maybe the theme from <i>Titanic</i> ruined me, but the wood flute begins to grate by the song's midway
    break, after which Sufjan steams through an instrumental outro stuffed with violin screams and even another
    recorder that had been tucked deep into the mix.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, the density of these compositions doesn't always make for an interesting listen-- particularly
    when the song's building blocks are themselves uninteresting.  ""A Winner Needs a Wand"" is a good example of
    this: The track retains the crowdedness of ""We Are What You Say"", but the predictability of its flute melodies
    is a setback.</p><p>
    
    Throughout <i>A Sun Came</i>, Sufjan routinely summons these prominent wood flute flutters-- which is
    admirable as a thematic link among the album's quite different moods, but ultimately feels like a
    superficial gimmick.  Messy, distorted guitar molasses slurps back and forth on ""Demetrius"", Sufjan's
    surprisingly rocking track that recalls Sebadoh noise and the melodies of a lo-fi Jesus Lizard.  It's
    one of the album's best tracks, until midway through, Sufjan mistakenly launches into a Middle-Eastern
    instrumental rant that talks loud but says nothing.  Later, the deliberate piano line and Sufjan's chilling,
    hushed vocals could have resulted in a fine post-rock outing during ""Dumb I Sound"", until those flat wood
    flute lines reappear and ruin the moment.  And on the gimmick-free Elliott Smith-via-Sonic Youth tribute,
    ""The Oracle Said Wander"", Sufjan sounds out of his element, and the song comes off cold.</p><p>
    
    There are a few instant groaners, too.  Two chords into ""Rake"", Sufjan's adds a lame third and unwittingly
    relegates his possibly interesting self-duet into Goo Goo Dolls territory.  ""Wordsworth's Ridge"" begins
    like an unaccompanied acoustic improvisation, only for an insistently lame flute and piano parts to muzzle
    its bite. ""Happy Birthday"" revisits acoustic alternative radio, this time with perhaps the album's most
    obnoxious vocal melody.</p><p>
    
    These days, Sufjan manages the impression that he's serious about his music and his faith, and maybe to the
    point of sacrificing his sense of humor.  It's unclear how true the appearance matches his reality, but
    three times on <i>A Sun Came</i>, Sufjan seems to indulge in light genre parody, to pleasing results.
    ""Rice Pudding"" marinates in the absurd Sonic Youth noodling he apes on ""Demetrius"", while the fiery
    woodwind squelches on ""Satan's Saxophones"" seem an unwitting musical satire of free jazz.  Most directly
    humorous is ""Super Sexy Woman"": Did Sufjan really just sing, ""She'll shoot a super fart/ The deadly silent
    kind""?!</p><p>
    
    For all <i>A Sun Came</i>'s directions, its most relevant one comes as the last track on the remastered
    version of the album.  ""You Are the Rake"", which Sufjan recorded in 2004, is a remake of one of <i>A Sun
    Came</i>'s sore spots, ""Rake"".  Six years after he first wrote the vocal melody, Sufjan bids farewell to
    all the bells and tin whistles that clogged up the song, and instead simply picks up his banjo.  His
    chords are retuned and delivered more sparsely here, which accommodates the addition of the ever-present
    Smith sisters, who further tease out the song's deep hook.  The difference between the two renditions is
    remarkable, and testifies to how much Sufjan has progressed as a musician and songwriter.  As a bloated
    reissue, <i>A Sun Came</i> ironically proves that for Sufjan, less is often much more, especially when
    melodies are as convincing as the ones he writes.</p></div>"|7513.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7513-a-sun-came-2nd-edition/|6.0|Nick Sylvester

A man with more personalities than that cross-eyed guy in <i>Identity</i>,
    Vibert has, under his various guises, released records on Warp, Rephlex, Astralwerks, Mo'Wax, and Ninja
    Tune.  His resume reads like a directory of essential electronic labels, and his output-- be it the
    experimental drum 'n' bass of Plug, the jungle jumble of Andrew Amen, or the scrap heap house of his
    eponymous releases-- all reflect his imperative to push established genres into territory just beyond the
    usual.  Now Vibert returns with his fifth album under the Wagon Christ moniker-- the one reserved for the,
    um, quirkier side of his quirks.  But does his almost mythical work ethic amount to genius or expose the
    disposability of his music?</p><p>
    
    The answer lies closer to genius than junk.  <i>Sorry I Make You Lush</i> is an extremely listenable,
    laughable album, a futuristic freakshow of deep, stirring melodies and innovative beat arrangements.
    There's a great variety of android emotions at play here, wrought by a fluctuating sonic density that
    explodes one moment into galactic proportions, and contracts into padded cell claustrophobia the next.
    Even with ""Shadows""' haunted overtones and ""UBFormby""'s bug-eyed schizophrenia, Wagon Christ's trademark
    sense of humor is always evident, both in musical form and in the use of outlandish vocal samples.</p><p>
    
    The latter show up most notably in the aptly titled ""The Funnies"", a patchwork funk knit mostly from
    chop-shop percussion (with plenty of cowbell) and manic guffaws, and the zero-gravity roller boogie of
    ""Kwikwidetrax"", which lies creepy Cockney toddler vocals over a rubber Bootsy bassline and a whiplash
    hip-hop break.  Ultimately, though, these songs come off like smart-alecky gimmicks, almost too reliant
    on the easy laugh to set their sights on higher goals.  But they're also Wagon Christ's patented weirdo
    shtick, and devoted fans will undoubtedly be tickled.</p><p>
    
    The real gems are found on the less slapstick tunes, where Vibert's nuanced composition is at its clearest.
    These tracks, like the album-opening ""Saddic Gladdic"", are deeply indebted to Vibert's purring Moog melodies,
    naturally flouting their heavy-handedness (can something called a ""Moog"" ever sound grave?).  ""I'm Singing"",
    submerged in a wash of acoustic guitar, gentle ambient effects and electro breaks, is a soothing <i>Tron</i>
    torch song that eventually slides into anesthetized planetarium-show exotica.</p><p>
    
    Wagon Christ's elusive sense of humor is mainly a by-product of clever juxtaposition.  For instance, Vibert
    balances the <i>Twilight Zone</i> paranoia of ""Sci-Fi Staircase""'s high-register melody with a sweetly breaking
    beat.  It's a ridiculous, unparalleled combination that, as the song moves through a concentrated, stuttering
    tweak and ethereal synth solo, takes on grandiose proportions.  The album's title track hides a plodding
    drum 'n' bass rumble beneath what sounds like a banjo jam and Mellotron string section, then segues into
    squishy electro breaks halfway through, and adds what sounds like a snippet of The Police's ""Synchronicity""
    synth and some light-saber samples for comedic effect.</p><p>
    
    Taken as a whole, <i>Sorry I Make You Lush</i> can be seen basically as a breakbeat clinic, a kitchen-sink
    rhythmic workout splayed across a surreal, Dali-esque melodic landscape.  Vibert consistently makes a solid
    case for his mastery of the form, stripping his beats down to their engines and souping them up with the
    most outrageous, flamboyant finishes he can muster.  The album's closer rides on a wiry, insomniac beat
    and aquatic synth that recalls Air's ""Premiers Symptomes"" on Ritalin.  As a closer, it's a truly enthralling
    track, hardly worthy of its ""Nighty Night"" title.  If Cool Hand Luke can keep the vibe this strong, he
    may as well keep shooting-- <i>Lush</i> is pretty close to a bulls-eye.</p></div>"|8556.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8556-sorry-i-make-you-lush/|7.8|Jonathan Zwickel

    marketplace,"" there's still something undeniably-- if stupidly-- charming about Fuck's preemptive commercial
    bellyflop.  While total disregard for mainstream acceptance/placement on Wal-Mart shelves may not be as
    powerful a virtue as some would like to think, the glib, art-for-art's-sake balls of naming your band after
    America's most noxious expletive continues, after nearly 10 years, to stand as a puzzlingly impressive
    choice.  The Rammstein collection may go untouched, but please pluck Fuck from the shelf before Grandma
    comes to visit.  They're just that fucking dangerous!</p><p>
    
    The abrasiveness of their moniker will inevitably inform any first impression of Fuck, but their name is
    ultimately unrelated to the gentle swoon of their lush, folky musings.  Despite meeting in a police holding
    cell and churning out songs with dumbly enchanting titles (see ""Panties Off"" or ""Motherfuckeroos""), Fuck's
    relationship to ""fuck"" provides what might be the single, crowning irony of the band's career: They've
    wrapped themselves up in a word that's both wholly definitive and comically irrelevant.  With their skewed,
    airy take on traditional folk-rock and Timmy Prudhomme's bizarre, cooed lyrics, Fuck are occasionally
    subversive-- but mostly they're just pretty.</p><p>
    
    Since forming in Oakland, California in 1993, Fuck have ripped through a mess of labels, making their
    footprints harder to trace; after two full-lengths on Rhesus, Fuck signed with Matador in 1997, who
    released their third and fourth records (1997's <i>Pardon My French</i> and 1998's <i>Conduct</i>).  2001's
    <i>Cupid's Cactus</i> appeared on Smells Like, while <i>Goldbricks</i> and <i>Those Are Not My Bongos</i>
    were snatched up by Italian label Homesleep, a move which rendered both albums virtually nonexistent on U.S.
    soil-- until 2004, when Future Farmer finally opted to release <i>Bongos</i> stateside.</p><p>
    
    Like most Fuck records, <i>Those Are Not My Bongos</i> is a whispery haze of giggly jokes (some excellent,
    some less so-- skip through the ""Does the penis offend you?"" intro, but savor the momentary idiocy of ""I
    saw Betty and Veronica/ Juggling Jughead's harmonica""), docile folk strumming, and sweet, breathy harmonies.
    But, thankfully, Fuck aren't all snark: When Prudhomme bravely whispers, ""When cool things happen, I think
    of you,"" it's obvious that the band's lyrical agenda isn't exclusively preoccupied with landing prime dick
    jokes.</p><p>
    
    ""Nowhen, or 'Now, Hen'"" sees Prudhomme wheezing delicately over a lone electric guitar and gentle keys;
    ""Table"" is similarly non-confrontational, with bits of piano, bouncy drums, steady guitar, and domesticated
    lyrics: ""She sets the table/ Rechecks the table.""  Fuck haven't totally abandoned their more experimental
    tendencies, but <i>Bongos</i> is a softer, more cohesive effort than anything else in the band's discography,
    and worth just as much consideration as that word on the spine.</p></div>"|3237.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3237-those-are-not-my-bongos/|7.5|Amanda Petrusich

    ""fly/high/sky"".  Nevertheless, there's Pink Grease's Rory Lewarne yowling just such a couplet over ""The
    Nasty Show""'s throbbing glitz.  Lewarne hoots and hotfoots his way through the red-lit alleys and beaded
    curtains of <i>This Is for Real</i>-- which turns out to really not be-- dropping lines like, ""I want your
    fingers inside this song,"" and suggesting ways to spend the day horizontal as his five mates fluff every
    inch of the strutty rawk and preening glam their seemingly petri dish-activated name suggests.  Take a
    whiff of their pant leg, baby.</p><p>
<i>This Is for Real</i> has its moments, but it's not the sex-punk triumph these Sheffield-based narcissistic
    debaucherists seem to believe it is.  It wants to be Phoebe Cates popping tops to The Cars, but it's more
    like the pool house and oily Mike Damone.  Throughout the album, the guitars and Lewarne's leering yelp
    are supported by sax and synth.  And yet, for a band with a guy devoted to ""machines and inventions,""
    there's very little exploration of sonic possibility.  ""Emotional Retard"" and ""Fever"" are dirty rock
    stompers, the former layering in florescent keys for generic effect; the latter highlighting a squawking
    saxophone that sounds sampled from INXS.</p><p>
    
    Indeed, glammy and/or punkish rock augmented with smirking electronics just doesn't get the sex trade moving
    in 2004-- that sound's been done in more ways than one.  Which is why, after a while, Pink Grease's come-on
    just starts to sound superficial.  Lewarne must believe that the number of F-bombs dropped corresponds
    directly to the music's randy qualities.  And maybe it does, kind of.  ""Superfool"" sufficiently grits up
    new wave, and even gets away with the old breathless orgasm sample.  ""Pink G.R.EASE"", too, ties all the
    elements together-- kicky glam rockin', slutty horn blown', vintage key-tar playin', and high-pitched
    lyrical struttin' all gel in perfect R-rated harmony, to make Elton John get thoughts about beddin' down
    with Jon Spencer.  And there's no way opener ""Remember Forever"" isn't an in-the-red anthem for the Urban
    Outfitters elite.  Its verses' clangy guitars and unstoppable shadoobies might never go out of style.</p><p>
    
    Still, <i>This Is For Real</i> just doesn't resonate.  Pink Grease's brash swagger is pretty admirable--
    they believe in their freaky-deaky awesomeness so fervently that it's fleetingly addicting.  But sex has
    gotten riskier since the 1970s.  In fact, its attendant hoops can make the whole bit more irritating than
    exciting.  This is probably why so many groups, the Grease included, look to the bowls of pills and freedom
    of the swingin' Me Decade-- getting rocks off in real time is tougher than unhooking a third-form bra.  But
    that it's so difficult means we can't keep reveling emptily in the past.  We need new aphrodisiacs, and new
    methods for the new makeout mores.</p><p>
    
    Some of the cats Pink Grease thank in their liners have the right idea: Liars aren't sexy, but there's a
    danger in their music that makes it attractive; Ladytron's machine music makes androids dream of electric
    sheep, and humans in angular haircuts hook up like bunnies; even Spencer, amidst his infamous posing,
    conjures some hot and bothered kinetics.  Pink Grease's initial EPs and this resulting full-length have
    flashed potential, but finding the elusive rock G-spot is more difficult than pushing pulsing synthesizers
    into tweezed gutter-punk rhythms and yelling about sexin' over its surface.  So, in the end, Pink Grease
    offer what amounts to a quickie-- not nearly enough sexual energy to fuel an entire party.  Like Phoebe
    Cates climbing out of the pool, their reality is more an illusion.</p></div>"|6545.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6545-this-is-for-real/|6.9|Johnny Loftus

    Q: Well, what do they sound like?</p><p>
    
    A: Tram, a band frequently likened to Low, happens to be similarly atmospheric
    and slow-paced. But the resemblance ends there. In place of Low's Spartan
    restraint and Duluthian Mormon mystique are a tendency toward sedative
    multi-instrumental lullabying and a heavy dose of wispy, British melancholy.
    Tram's arrangements are vibrantly lush, even orchestral at times, but never
    crowded. Paul Anderson's buttery, androgynous voice and a constant presence of
    liquid, full-bodied acoustic guitar strumming are the mainstays of Tram's
    soporific sound. Tempo-wise, I'd say a tree sloth could really rock out to
    this shit.</p><p>
    
    Q: So, they're like British, huh?  Can I expect glib riffs and pop hooks
    galore?</p><p>
    
    A: Uh, well, no.  Not really. Poignant, pretty memories abound, but not quite
    in ""galore"" concentrations. Anderson's singing is actually somewhat understated.
    He'll often place his accents on the first beat of every measure for an effect
    of stoned, rolling, wavy momentum. A second, instrumental melody-- mostly slide
    guitar or arpeggiated chords-- often lurks in the shadows and embellishes the
    vocal line. The singing won't embed itself in your tossing, turning head, but
    the dissembling, subtle beauty of the overall music will reward repeat listens,
    without exhausting itself.</p><p>
    
    Q: So, why exactly should I give a shit?</p><p>
    
    A: Jeez, who said anything about giving a shit? There's nothing groundbreaking
    here. Not even close. What Tram does well is synthesize the soothing,
    grief-addled pace of Mazzy Star with the melodic sensibilities of James'
    quieter songs, while flexing their own talent for arrangement and low-key
    melody. For a four year-old band putting out a sophomore album, Tram displays
    a great deal of maturity and grace. So, if you happen to come by a copy of
    <i>Frequently Asked Questions</i>, you'll be glad you have it.  If not, don't
    worry; it won't knock you out of ""the know.""</p><p>
    
    Q: What's the deal with the title?</p><p>
    
    A: So glad you asked. Now I've got a cheap excuse to pull out my Paul Anderson
    quote:</p><p>
<i>""We had no previous experience with computer-based recording software and
    were faced with the daunting task of getting to grips with new technology;
    hence the ironic album title </i><i>Frequently Asked Questions</i> (for it seemed
    that we were spending our whole lives staring at instruction manuals). The
    title also seemed to tie in appropriately with the themes dealt with on the
    album.""</p><p>
    
    Q: I noticed trumpet, strings, and oboe. Did Tram play all the instruments?</p><p>
    
    A: No, smart guy. Actually, a whopping eight additional musicians took time
    out of their busy schedules of recording commercial jingles and drinking away
    their sorrow to lay tracks down for a pittance.  Even PJ Harvey collaborator
    John Parish was dragged in to produce ""Once I Was""-- a Tim Buckley cover, and
    the only track not produced by Anderson and Nick Avery.  Adding to the
    name-drop miasma, the Buckley track was recorded at the Cocteau Twins'
    September Sound studio. Which, in turn, sat on property owned by the Who's
    Pete Townshend. The studio was subsequently demolished to make room for
    high-end apartments. No, it's true.</p><p>
    
    Q: So, like, can I rock out to this?</p><p>
    
    A: Yes, you and the tree sloth both.</p></div>"|8130.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8130-frequently-asked-questions/|7.0|Camilo Arturo Leslie

While Page, Plant, Jones &amp; Bonham were getting ink for the
    holes they left in hotel room walls, some poor schlub who worked for the band was on the phone, discussing
    terms of payment for damages.  And when that call ended, he had to make sure the trucks hit the road for the
    next city on time.  Most big tours are actually registered corporations, and they're insured out the ass,
    but chances are, no one in the audience knows that, because it's just not what people want to hear about
    their music.</p><p>
    
    Outside of superstar acts and their traveling caravans, though, you have the more common occurrence of a
    band jamming themselves into a single van, looking for a place to stay every night and dealing with a
    different promoter in every city, and this is no less fraught with tedious details-- in the end, everyone's
    just trying to make a living, and if everything doesn't come together like it should, well, everybody loses.
    Trekking around and making group decisions is difficult enough when you have three or four band members and
    the occasional lackey, but it's even more ridiculous when you've expanded your lineup to a full-on octet.
    Just try scheduling studio time for eight people with other things going on in their lives.</p><p>
    
    The Concretes, who first blossomed almost a decade ago as an all-female trio in their native Stockholm,
    have engaged in just such as expansion project.  And although they admit that sometimes eight is a few
    too many members, they have no plans to kick anyone out for the time being, preferring to stick to their
    pluralistic, collective way of doing things.  The band's democratic process is immediately evident in the
    music of their self-titled album, which is essentially their debut long-player (their only previous
    LP-length release, <i>Boyoubetterunow</i>, was a stateside compilation of two early EPs).</p><p>
    
    So even though it took them nearly 10 years to cut a full-length, it seems to have been worth the wait--
    the tracks on <i>The Concretes</i> are easily their most accomplished, fluid statement to date.  Vocalist
    Victoria Bergsman initially seems to be rather firmly at the helm, her hazy Edith Frost-y croon providing
    an axis for the band's swirling Mazzy Starscape.  But as the album wears on, it becomes clear that the
    band is on equal footing with her.  She's cast almost totally adrift on ""Lonely as Can Be"", riding rapids
    of noisy guitar and battling the two-member horn section for melodic supremacy.  At any given moment, the
    music might peel back to reveal a delicate piano or organ motif, only to close back over in a wash of cymbals
    and massed backing vocals.</p><p>
    
    And even with all that going on, The Concretes still rope in a dozen collaborators, including a string
    quintet and a harpist, who lend an ethereal hand to closer ""This One's for You"", the band's most overt
    nod to Mazzy Star's <i>So Tonight That I Might See</i>.  While much of the record dwells in deliberately
    paced big sky country, The Concretes do whip up two amazing up-tempo pop tunes.  ""You Can't Hurry Love""
    is not a Supremes cover, despite the presence of a song three tracks later titled ""Diana Ross"".  Rather,
    it's a bouncy (and exceedingly short, at just 1:56) blast of summer that sounds more like The Jesus &amp; Mary
    Chain than Phil Collins.  ""Seems Fine"" opens with a horn theme while drummer Lisa Milberg lays down a surf
    beat, and the band runs through just about every conceivable instrumental combination at their disposal
    through the verses.  And again, it's got concision going for it, running through dozens of variations on
    a simple theme in barely two minutes.</p><p>
    
    As tough as it may sometimes be to sift through eight different opinions in search of a definitive decision,
    it sometimes works to a band's advantage: Groups like Godspeed You! Black Emperor and Broken Social Scene
    face the same obstacle, yet manage to consistently overcome.  So maybe there's a democracy at work within a
    larger group dynamic that can yield greater results-- or perhaps great minds simply think alike.</p></div>"|1571.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1571-the-concretes/|8.1|Joe Tangari

They aren't loud and don't need to be-- their third and best album, <em>Set Yourself on Fire</em>, is a great example of sonic efficiency. Its songs are packed like a Geo Tracker for a cross-country road trip, yet nothing gets crushed or stuffed or buried. It might be the best orchestral pop album of the past year, only it doesn't sound orchestral, at least not according to the outsize string-and-reverb model favored by bands like Oasis or Spiritualized. If you find me a recent album that towers higher with fodder so virtuosically managed and manipulated, I'll give you 20 dollars and jump in a foreboding body of water from a height.</p><p>  It took me two months to plow through <em>Heart</em>, Stars' 2003 sophomore effort. Two songs, ""What the Snowman Learned About Love"" and ""Elevator Love Letter"", sailed so high above the rest, I demurred at the possibility of imperfection. The album relied on standout riffs and jags of cathexis; it was, in essence, a collection of rifftastic one-liners, and one-liners sometimes fall face first. <em>Set Yourself on Fire</em> is more full-bodied; nothing is so singular it isn't worth fleshing out or adding to, which bolsters the weaker songs without watering down the cream.</p><p>  The album opens with a disquieting epigram: ""When there's nothing left to burn, you must set yourself on fire."" A procession of lugubrious strings gives ""Your Ex-Lover Is Dead"" the hugely premonitory feel of <em>Heart</em> opener ""What the Snowman Learned About Love"" without its flimsy grandiloquence. Amy Millan may whisper the refrain, ""live through this and you won't look back,"" but the song is no chore; in fact, it's an apt segue into the astonishing title track.</p><p>  ""Set Yourself on Fire"" takes Millan's mandate and soars with it. A lo-res synth arpeggio carries the song alongside a propulsive drumbeat and cascading strings. The song performs a nimble time change in its bridge before staking a final salvo-- ""20 years asleep before we sleep... forever""-- over an icy coda. You might hear it on a Peter Pan bus, north of New Haven all industrial barrens, sunny cold mid-December afternoon after leaving your girlfriend, and you might cry.</p><p>  The subsequent two tracks defibrillate the heartbroken. ""Ageless Beauty"" will sell Arts &amp; Crafts' first ringtone, just watch. Its simple changes are dusted with zippy auxiliary lines playing peek-a-boo. ""Reunion""'s chorus is so bathetic it's entrancing: ""All I want is one more chance,"" sings Torquil Campbell, ""to be young and wild and free."" Rather than a second refrain, they give us a spry guitar lick that could make its chorus and secede if it wished.</p><p> <em>Set Yourself on Fire</em> is about breaking up and breaking down, and as such the album feels wontedly cathartic, like the moments right after you hit your emotional nadir and start getting your shit together. Stars handle the mood delicately with few slip-ups; my only complaint is that they never handle much of anything else. Save ""The Big Fight""-- which is tame, slow and lounged-out-- there's no controversy, only half-smiles and the soggy aftermath. But even the dearest numbers have faint, nagging undercurrents. The band make no effort to avoid the inevitable charges of over-sentimentality; in fact, they indulge the calls: ""The cold is a vindictive bride,"" reads their website bio, ""she'll trap you between her thighs and turn your heart to ice if you're not careful."" Despite overblown romanticism run rampant, Stars somehow remain understated. It's the ""Soft Revolution"", as the terrific penultimate track declaims. Hop aboard.</p><p> </p></div>"|7472.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7472-set-yourself-on-fire/|8.4|Sam Ubl

    Somewhere around that time-- though it's difficult to peg exactly when-- Newcombe became too old to die
    young.  Until then, life was scripted as surely as the last swim of the band's namesake; the once-young
    artist, whose battle cry even today is ""keep music evil,"" knew his lines: brilliant, erratic songwriter/bandleader
    hurtles forward sustained by life-provoking drugs, alcohol and rock 'n' roll-- the very same things that
    threaten to take him over the edge into nowhere.</p><p>
    
    The problem is that, at the crucial moment when life gives way to life support, you turn a page and the
    script has nothing but blank pages (and trust me, I speak from experience).  Newcombe and his band, The
    Brian Jonestown Massacre, have spent the ensuing years since this unfortunate rite of passage trying to
    figure out what comes next.  The results, in general, have been mixed, but Newcombe <i>has</i> had some
    great moments, especially considering that cosmetic surgery and dispensing wisdom-- two of three time-honored
    options-- weren't really within his grasp (the third, denial, has proven a bit more useful).</p><p>
    
    The key moment on <i>And This Is Our Music</i> comes during ""Prozac vs. Heroin"", in the form of a righteously
    head-turning phrase from a rock 'n' roller who is desperately driven to turn heads.  More than merely moving
    units, the song's title articulates the dilemma facing those who won't or can't surrender: What's a guy to
    do when life offers shitty choices, he seems to be asking, and in doing so, he exposes what may well be the
    band's first-ever moment of human fragility.  Through a typically rich acoustic haze, the lyric ""they will
    be done,"" comes floating to the surface; were it not so surprising, I'd describe it as blissful resignation.</p><p>
    
    My friend Richard and I used to laugh and make lists of Newcombe's 60s references each time a new Brian
    Jonestown album dropped, and had Richard heard ""When Jokers Attack"", built around The Yardbirds' ""Over
    Under Sideways Down"", he'd have nodded happily, except a couple of years ago he went to Amsterdam and
    nodded off and out one day, case closed.  ""Joker""-- upbeat and slyly aggressive beneath the fat warm
    12-string-- harkens back to an earlier BJM moment, and to give Newcombe credit, he knows it's one that's
    past.  Today, the band's music bears a deliberate, meditative quality, as if it were possible for a guy
    known for brawling, taunting and taking too much of whatever was available to sit cross-legged with a
    sitar in his lap and touch souls with some divine spirit or another.</p><p>
    
    Life isn't easy for hell-bent artists who live past their point of departure.  While there's only one
    Keith Richards, there are thousands who've wrecked themselves the same way, and in Newcombe's defense,
    he realizes he's getting off light.  Most of us, if faced with that outcome, would pack it up and go
    home.  But even while Brian Jonestown Massacre are moving into a future that permits zero visibility,
    this is still their music, and I like it a lot.</p></div>"|928.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/928-and-this-is-our-music/|7.8|J.H. Tompkins

More than a few people have told me they
    thought it was ""Now It's Overheard,"" and one friend said he always heard it as ""Now It's Over, Ed"".  The
    latter would be somewhat appropriate, considering that Now It's Overhead's debut was song cycle tracing a
    romance's arc from initial spark to luminous apogee to guttering finale.  But as a bandname, it would have
    been profoundly stupid.  And Andy Lemaster's name isn't Ed.  It's Andy.</p><p>
    
    Now It's Overheard would be a passable bandname, but one with little logical currency.  Then again, Now
    It's Overhead doesn't make much sense, either.  Both do evoke a vague impression of something just out of
    reach, or placed at a certain remove; an abstraction too large (although ""large"" is a sort of inappropriate
    term to append to an abstraction) to be apprehended except by its absence.  Certainly there is no spark of
    recognition upon finding out it's ""head,"" not ""heard"" (like, ""Why is Hendrix saying to excuse him while he
    kisses this guy?  Oh, sky!  Sky!"").</p><p>
    
    Even if the precise mechanics of Now It's Overhead's music are as enigmatic and slippery as the name, the
    pleasures it yields are much more concrete.  The debut was easy enough to describe as Engine Down covering
    Depeche Mode (or the inverse, if you like), and while this sophomore release retains its superficial
    characteristics, it's more difficult to accurately triangulate among musical reference points.  A sort
    of sculpted synth-pop composed of impossible shapes that cohere into perfectly smooth and easy-to-swallow
    lozenges, it's a rare music that sounds as if it were extremely complicated and difficult to construct,
    yet seems remarkably simple and immediate upon completion </p><p>
    
    Like the band's debut, <em>Fall Back Open</em> is a cousin to albums by XTC and The Flaming Lips, where
    production techniques aren't a medium for the music so much as an integral part of it-- not a bolstering
    agent but something inextricable from the whole.  Which isn't surprising, considering that band leader
    Andy Lemaster, who runs the increasingly sought-after Athens studio Chase Park Transduction, is establishing
    himself as an <em>enfant terrible</em> of production and proving himself capable of creating huge, intricately
    textured spaces for songs to reside.</p><p>
<em>Fall Back Open</em> is more reminiscent of the arid, slow-burning side of the debut (""With a Subtle Look""
    comes to mind) than its upbeat fare, a reverb-drenched cruise missile flying in relentless slow-motion, like
    Calla with a pulse and a cherubic blond singer who could have gone boy-band as easily as indie-land.  ""Wait
    in a Line"" rolls over the windshield like reflected streetlights, nightclub-bound and smelling of sex, a
    feverish nightlife anthem with crisply syncopated drum patterns and sultry lap steel weaving through the
    ever-present reverb cascading down in sheets.  ""Surrender"", meanwhile, is a sweltering torch song of
    exponentially intensifying guitar glissandos and unfettered angst.</p><p>
    
    If a Georgia boy on the usually Nebraska-centric Saddle Creek strikes you as odd, note that Lemaster is a
    veteran of Bright Eyes's backing band, and that Now It's Overhead includes both members of Azure Ray-- and
    those aren't the only names checking in on Now It's Overhead's sophomore outing: Conor Oberst offers backup
    vocals on the title track, a vaulted echo chamber with so much reverb you almost watch it carom back and
    forth like a spectator at a tennis match.  And Michael Stipe even checks in to sing backup on ""Antidote"",
    his composed mid-range ballasting Lemaster's febrile chorus to good effect.</p><p>
    
    It should be said that the overall sameness of <em>Fall Back Open</em>'s tempo and atmosphere may wind up
    truncating its reply value.  And I'm still not sure what, exactly, is overhead.  Whatever it is, though,
    its impact can only be enhanced by the fact that you can't look at it straight on, only perceiving red
    and gray vestiges of movement in your peripheral field.</p></div>"|5853.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5853-fall-back-open/|7.0|Brian Howe

    eight pages of links to archived They Might Be Giants email discussion lists that I contributed to during
    my middle and high school years.  Typed excitedly at lunchtime on state-of-the-art UNIX terminals, these
    eternal reminders of some painfully awkward times feature discussions on the latest Giants' releases and
    arguments as to the meaning of lyrics like ""put your hand inside the puppet head.""  TMBG were the first
    band I ever became obsessed with, acquiring any and all singles, bootlegs, and videos I could find.  To
    an eighth grader in the age of grunge, they were the only known alternative to ""alternative,"" and offered
    a musical safe-haven for anyone who might have thought that wearing a ""Normal People Scare Me"" t-shirt was
    a good idea.</p><p>
    
    Because of my history revering the band, it's hard to face the fact that TMBG's output is gradually becoming
    less consistent and inspired.  Their newest release, <i>The Spine</i>, is, like so many of their other recent
    releases, not a bad album, yet contains too many mediocre tracks to be comforting.  The most disappointing
    aspect of <i>The Spine</i> is its musical conservatism.  John Linnell's prowess at arrangement and instrumentation,
    on full display in his excellent solo album <i>State Songs</i>, seems to become increasingly buried by walls
    of heavily produced guitars upon each release.  This wouldn't be so bad if the duo were still writing hooks
    that left you singing for three days upon a single listen, but there are only a few truly memorable melodies
    here.</p><p>
    
    Much as the eighth grade girls would usually squint at me and say ""you're so random"" after I'd attempted a
    joke, TMBG have long suffered the upsetting label of ""quirky.""  Like fellow lyrical innovators the Talking
    Heads, they've tended toward the topics of household appliances and sinister characters rather than life's
    emotional highs and lows.  Because their lyrics have reveled in puns and surrealist wordplay, they've usually
    been dubbed ""silly"" rather than ""arty,"" though neither term really encapsulates the evil robots and grinning
    skulls at the core of the Giants' imagery.  Thus, while TMBG have been no stranger to Dr. Demento over the
    years, a dark tone or manic absurdity has always kept their humor slightly shy of straight-ahead novelty
    territory.</p><p>
    
    Increasingly, such complexity is lost in TMBG's output, and on <i>The Spine</i>, the attempts at humor are
    spotty.  ""Au Contraire"" fully succeeds at humor, featuring Jodie Foster and Mahatma Gandhi playing a
    contentious game of cards; similarly, ""Wearing a Raincoat"" contains the streams of nonsensical associative
    thought at the center of the band's earliest work.  Then again, the songs ""Prevenge"" and ""Some Crazy Bastard
    Wants to Hit Me"" are no wittier than the basic premises of their titles.</p><p>
    
    It is readily apparent that <i>The Spine</i> was produced by Pat Dillett, who helped TMBG craft 1990's
    hit-heavy <i>Flood</i>.  Both <i>Flood</i> and <i>The Spine</i> have a smooth, session-musician production
    quality that tempers the Giants' more experimental musical tendencies.  Yet, where <i>Flood</i> made a
    successful approach at greater accessibility, <i>The Spine</i>'s radio-friendly sound goes way overboard.
    The rampant vocal manipulation and techno-inspired turns are ridiculous against the Johns' matter-of-fact
    singing tones, resulting in tracks that sound more like Flansburgh and Linnell at a Karaoke night than on
    an album of their own songs.</p><p>
    
    There are successful tracks here, though they're usually reminiscent of past hits.  The anthemic opener
    ""Experimental Film"" nearly replicates the lyrical conceit of <i>Severe Tire Damage</i> single ""Dr. Worm"",
    both sung by excitable but inarticulate narrators with minor artistic ambitions.  John Flansburgh has
    spoken of his love for Sinatra, the influence being particularly evident on ""Kiss Me, Son of God"", and
    here, he croons on the excellent track ""Trapped in a World Before Later On"".  ""Stalk of Wheat"" also manages
    a distinctly 1930s tone in its big-band style call-and-response.  And TMBG do up the intensity on the
    energetic and catchy ""Damn Good Times"", a poppy piece with a klezmer-style ending.</p><p>
    
    Over the last five years, TMBG have involved themselves in an array of exciting projects.  Like Danny Elfman
    and Mark Mothersbaugh, they're headed down the route of heady rock musicians turned soundtrack composers.
    Currently, they're working with Dave Eggers and director Spike Jonze to release a Moveon.org benefit album
    featuring Elliott Smith, R.E.M. and David Byrne.  By all accounts, they're still putting everything they
    have into their live shows.  With all this going on, it seems like their real creative energy is being
    turned elsewhere, as <i>The Spine</i> doesn't give me the sense that the Giants particularly wanted to
    make it or had much fun in the process.  Still, as long this band's output continues to offer middle
    schoolers out there some kind of alternative to Hoobastank, I really can't complain.</p></div>"|8000.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8000-the-spine/|5.3|Liam Singer

    several dignitaries, the press described the effect of his music as ""sound terror.""  For Branca, there is
    no such thing as ""too loud"": His most recent composition is an ensemble for 100 electric guitars.  But
    Branca's album releases are far less grandiose than his live performances.  While works such as ""Symphony
    No. 1"" for sixteen performers have overwhelmed audiences with their disorientingly high volumes, oil-drum
    percussion and Branca's spastic conducting style, the live sound is too large to be even approximated
    through two speakers, leaving a listener to wonder what the big deal was about.  In contrast, last year's
    reissue of <i>The Ascension</i> and this year's <i>Lesson No. 1</i> contain earlier works for small ensembles.
    They may not have shattered as many eardrums, but on CD the sound remains close enough to grab hold of you
    and lift you into Branca's intense world.</p><p>
    
    The first two pieces on this album, ""Lesson No. 1"" and ""Dissonant""-- originally released in 1980-- comprise
    Branca's first solo release after leaving punk/no-wave outfit Theoretical Girls.  The liner notes quote him
    as regarding ""Lesson No. 1"" as a simple experiment in minimalism.  Simple or not, it is most certainly huge.
    It begins with two guitars picking out pulsating Reichian riffs, before introducing a triumphant one-note
    wall of sound with organ and bass shifting underneath to give a sense of harmonic movement.  It contains the
    seeds of Branca's future work with cells of tonal noise, and today can't help but bring to mind everything
    from the seared distorted walls of My Bloody Valentine to the triumphant crescendos of Godspeed You Black
    Emperor! to Oneida's ultra-repetitive jams.  The guitars increasingly bend in pitch as the piece continues,
    exploring a microtonal world of detuned strings.  Like minimalist composer Rhys Chatham-- with whom he briefly
    played before they became rivals-- Branca was interested in highlighting the harmonics extant in battling
    waveforms and the sounds that naturally emerge from repetition.</p><p>
    
    As ""Lesson No. 1"" encapsulates the ecstatic drama of future instrumental post-rock, ""Dissonance"" foretells
    the broken industrial sound of many composers to come, especially that of the Bang on a Can collective with
    whom Branca has associated himself in recent years.  Scored for guitar, keyboards, bass, drums and sledgehammer,
    ""Dissonance"" replicates the pounding honking perpetual motion of city life, shifting in and out of polyrhythmic
    experimentation and more chugging guitar work.  ""Dissonance"" dispels any notion that Branca's complexity
    might only be rhetorical.  Whether you want to call it punk-fueled anti-prog or recontextualized art music,
    it is complicated stuff, requiring great practice from the instrumentalists and mental engagement on the
    listener's part.</p><p>
    
    Some classicists proclaim rock incapable of the emotional subtlety and variation of orchestral music.  The
    extra inclusion of ""Bad Smells""-- a piece written for Twyla Tharp's dance company in 1982 and played by an
    ensemble including Sonic Youth members Thurston Moore and Lee Renaldo-- spends 16 minutes dispelling that
    notion.  Though still a relatively early composition for Branca, it contains an overwhelming variety of
    moods and textures-- reverie, humor, triumph, anger, struggle-- and makes this CD worth considering even
    if you own the previous reissue of <i>Lesson No. 1</i>.  This release also includes a video showing Branca

The ideal:
    D.I.Y. ethics, an emphasis on art above marketability, and a purity of purpose that is resistant to fads and
    monetary influence.  The reality: indie bands are receiving six-digit recording advances from major media
    conglomerates, and are just as ripe for demographic targeting, strategic media placement, and lifestyle
    branding as ""mainstream"" bands.  Indie groups like The Shins, Death Cab for Cutie and Modest Mouse can be
    heard on teen dramas, late-night talk shows, and in Target, automobile and fast-food television spots.</p><p>
    
    More power to them.  I don't posit that the increasing permeability of the membrane between indie and
    mainstream is an insidious development; instead, it should be acknowledged in the interest of foiling
    nonsensical Puritanism.  While truly market-exempt, homegrown music exists (let's call it indie with a
    lowercase ""i""), it's undeniable that capital-I Indie Music (i.e. music aimed at the charts that is ""indie""
    only in its external mien) is here.  Indie Music is big business, and it's absurd to act like it's still
    being run out of someone's garage.  The central paradox is that Indie Bands are marketed as personal
    choices that express the consumer's highly specific personality and separation from the herd by grouping
    them within, natch, one large and faceless herd-- at least Avril Lavigne makes no bones about being for
    the masses.</p><p>
    
    Enter The Comas, who tread this imbricate middle ground between indie and mainstream.  Teen dramas on the
    WB have become a fertile market for Indie Music song placement.  Comas singer Andy Herod has done Death
    Cab and The Shins one better by dating <em>Dawson's Creek</em>'s Michelle Williams for a couple years, then
    writing an album about the relationship and its demise.  <em>Conductor</em> was at least partially banked by
    Warner Bros., who released it overseas before selling the rights for the American release to Yep Roc.  Not
    to mention that the music itself-- alternately dreamy and rocking, aching and pissed indie (make that
    ""Indie"") pop-- has both the sort of accessible, mainstream appeal and the aura of timeliness that comes
    from the confluence of elusive cultural currents, the stuff of which crossover hits are made. </p><p>
    
    But the market is fickle, and what will break big seems almost arbitrary.  Regardless of whether or not The
    Comas push through, <em>Conductor</em> is an accomplished pop/rock album that, while being more sonically akin
    to The Stills, shares Death Cab's sense of accessibility and emotional transparency.  The album opens with
    ""The Science of Your Mind"", an ominous minor-key guitar drone bolstering a mobile lead melody and Herod's
    sleek, hooky vocals: ""Help me make this go away/ Like you burned up all my faith.""  Like all the superbly
    sequenced and tonally contiguous songs on <em>Conductor</em>, it conveys a sense of starry darkness and alien
    landscapes inspired-- if one believes press release mythology-- by Herod's repeated viewing of the film
    <em>Dark City</em>. ""Moonrainbow"" is an acoustic-sounding ballad that moves through subtle orchestral pop
    movements and breathy falsettos.  And ""Tonight on the WB"" represents the more woozy, fuzz-rock side of The
    Comas, blurring the lines between Williams' role in Herod's life and her role in sundry dramatic entertainment:
    ""We love it when you fall apart/ You turn it into higher art.""</p><p>
    
    The album is accompanied by a DVD, <em>Conductor: The Movie</em>, which was written and directed by filmmaker/animator
    Brent Bonacorso.  It features videos for each song that seamlessly blend into a unified aesthetic statement,
    an elliptical science-fiction love story with appearances by Williams and Herod that is visually informed by
    a blend of live footage and polished animation (robots and weird floating schematics galore), the technologically
    haywire topology of the aforementioned <em>Dark City</em>, and a rather cool visual effect of light pouring
    off objects in bubbles.  Like <em>Conductor</em> the album, the film pulls no punches in its quest for a
    highly refined effect: It is resolutely hi-fi, looks unabashedly expensive, outsourced and D.I.W.C.A.
    (Do It With Corporate Assistance) and is-- paired with the songs-- the product of a distinct and ambitious
    intent to be a veritable <em>event</em>, to distinguish itself from the throng of decent yet interchangeable
    indie rock releases. </p></div>"|1771.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1771-conductor/|8.0|Brian Howe

    purchase remix collections and collaborative efforts touting my favorite artists as its contributors, despite
    the fact that such albums have disappointed for years.  These releases promise the potential inherent in a
    wide spectrum of creative minds refining each other's best qualities, yet tend to instead showcase talented
    musicians on autopilot.  Like anybody else, artists are prone to phoning it in when the stakes aren't high,
    and can be reluctant to let go of a great idea in the service of someone else's name-- sentiments bluntly
    summed up in the title of Aphex Twin's last release, <i>26 Mixes for Cash</i>.  Happily, Boom Bip's new
    offering, <i>Corymb</i>, is one of the few recent remix collections into which it is apparent the contributors
    have invested thought, effort and care, resulting in an appealing investigation of the variegated sounds
    surrounding Boom Bip's musical peer group.</p><p>
<i>Corymb</i> is a combination of two EPs released in the last two years, <i>From Left to Right</i> and
    <i>Morning and a Day</i>.  Replicating the coffee-stained packaging concept of his debut, Mr. Bip makes it
    clear that this is not a new album proper.  It is <i>Seed to Sun</i>'s companion disc, offering six remixes,
    three B-sides, and two Peel sessions.  All of Boom Bip's new tracks are appealing uptempo instrumentals
    sharing more in common with each other than do any three songs from his schizophrenic debut.  Both ""From
    Left to Right"" and ""Morning and a Day"" feature spacious guitars laid over bouncy synths; ""In the Tree Top""
    begins to explore similar territory, but ends prematurely.  The included Peel session versions of <i>Seed
    to Sun</i> tracks feel a little sprawling against the tight, focused sound elsewhere on this CD, but
    coherence is not the goal of this collection, and the new version of ""Pulse All Over"" makes for an epic
    closer.</p><p>
    
    For the most part, Boom Bip's remixers thoughtfully walk the line of augmentation vs. obliteration regarding
    their source material.  The chilly, muzak-laden dissonance in the Boards of Canada's ""Last Walk Round Mirror
    Lake"" remix adds a sinister touch to the lo-fi guitar that closed out <i>Seed to Sun</i>, and recalls the
    Boards' 2000 single ""In a Beautiful Place out in the Country"".  Venetian Snares' Aaron Funk coaxes a jittery,
    paranoid track out of ""The Unthinkable"", while (surprisingly) leaving the song-- featuring the voice of Buck 65--
    in recognizable form.  Conversely, cLOUDDEAD's deconstruction of ""Closed Shoulders"" jumbles Boom Bip's
    beat-driven original into a drone reminiscent of the instrumental passages on their self-titled debut.</p><p>
    
    Four Tet's excellent take on ""Third Stream"" stutters through a slew of rhythmic typewriter keys before
    introducing the double bass that anchors both versions of the song.  Lali Puna crafts a subdued, uplifting
    track from the darker and more expansive original ""Awaiting an Accident"".  Mogwai's contribution, a sparse
    remix/retelling of ""The Use of Unacceptable Colors in Nature"" is the only piece without much immediate
    impact.  Listening to it directly in conjunction with the original, however, you can get a sense of the
    band's intentions as they take one of the most catchy, emotive and dense tracks from <i>Seed to Sun</i>
    and strip it down to its bones.  The process gives interesting insight into what a ""remix"" of a
    mostly-electronic artist by a mostly-live band can possibly entail.</p><p>
    
    On both of his albums to date, Boom Bip has tended toward contributors whom he himself has remixed,
    collaborated with, or toured alongside.  This is a good way to combat the syndrome of mediocrity often
    plaguing collections such as <i>Corymb</i>; after all, contractual commitment can compel a track into
    being, but it is personal commitment that will probably produce a good one.  For those artists here who
    aren't beholden to Boom Bip, the care of their efforts is a telling sign of the respect this multifaceted
    figure has managed to establish for himself in the music world.</p></div>"|859.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/859-corymb/|7.4|Liam Singer

Featuring Need New Body drummer Pow Pow
    (née Chris Powell) and Bablicon bassist Griffin Rodriquez (known here as Blue Hawaii), as well as three Chicago
    musicians sporting their own clever nicknames, Icy Demons' <i>Fight Back!</i> is really more the consummation
    of an old friendship than a new deal.  Bablicon featured heavily on Need New Body's 2001 debut, and there
    was always bound to be a serviceable halfway point between the bands' respective freeform melting pot and
    frenetic exertion.  Which is all good background, to be sure, but what I really want to know is, if the
    demons are icy, has Hell frozen over?  Because they all look kind of chilly on the album cover (which,
    incidentally, folds out into an awesome six-panel icy demon family portrait on the reverse of the liners).</p><p>
    The album art is weirdly apropos for the music contained within-- the hodgepodge of funky little demons in
    all kinds of strange colors looks a lot like how the band sounds.  Their music is dense, weird and full of
    strangely hued interludes.  It's tempting to call the music a grab bag of styles, but the twist is that
    these guys are combining styles that never really had names to being with.</p><p>
    The odd falsetto vocal melodies that Powell whips up usually spring from an instrumental line buried somewhere
    in the music, often on a cello or one of Dave ""Thousand Rabbits Running"" McDonnell's many reed instruments.
    On ""Manny's"", his melody is indirectly doubled by guitarists Matt ""Young Master"" Schneider and Dave ""Moylando
    Calrissian"" Moyland-- but rather than simply duplicate his vocal line, each guitarist weaves his own slightly
    dissonant line beneath that roughly follows the same arc, giving the verse an odd Beefheartian flavor.  The
    song later takes off into a prolonged instrumental fantasia led by McDonald's clarinet and Powell's
    jazz-inflected drumming.</p><p>
    Rodriquez's history as an Elephant 6 cohort and the band's standing on Circulatory System's Cloud Recordings
    label seems all the more logical as you read through the extensive list of guest musicians, who are credited
    with everything from simple trombone and backing vocals to ""spirit wind.""  The free-wheeling structure that
    trademarks Bablicon's labyrinthine albums is also the guiding principle here, as songs veer into passages
    of psychedelic bop and florid music box electronica, with subbass beats supplanted by clicking percussion
    and spoons.</p><p>
    ""Desert Toll/Spirit Guide"" is a Fender Rhodes-led dive into Miles Davis' fusion period via <i>Islands</i>-era
    King Crimson, while the vocal tracks brim with Zappa weirdness and multi-tiered arrangements that suggest
    Mingus had he given up jazz for Krautrock in his final days.  ""Bitter Moon"", meanwhile, is almost a straight
    pastiche of Sergio Mendes &amp; Brasil '66 circa <i>Equinox</i>, with guitar figures that might fit on a Jobim
    record-- if Robert Fripp was Jobim's guitarist.  ""Simian Warlords"" leads Boards of Canada into inhospitable
    lo-fi territory, while ""The Silent Hero"" opens with Spanish piano and settles into a dub groove coated in
    shivering guitar interjections and kalimba.  Which is all to say that Icy Demons don't really sound entirely
    like anything else.</p><p>
    There are apt comparisons to be found within individual songs, but as a whole, <i>Fight Back!</i> is one
    hell of a unique concoction, like a prog-fusion orchestron gone completely nuts.  As such, it's also
    unfortunately given to a few long passages (a couple lasting more than one track) of exhausting pasta
    preparation-- I wish I could say having passages that remind me of the Peter Thomas Sound Orchestra and
    Mancini spy scores was enough to make for a killer record, but it's really not.  That said, most of the
    material is very strong, and the album is frontloaded with several sublime snatches of out-and-out
    strangeness.  It's not going to cause any major climatic shifts south of Heaven, but it's should please
    a lot of people in search of their next fix of almost indescribably odd indie rock.</p></div>"|4155.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4155-fight-back/|7.3|Joe Tangari

She has to grab his butt every time he's brushing his
    teeth, and he always has to shout upstairs for ""one last kiss!"" before he heads out the door.  Or there's
    the way she sings to him in the kitchen, ""Let's just gaze in the space between your face and mine,"" and
    then they smooch 'til everyone's sick.  It's great that they have marital bliss-- most couples sure don't--
    but do we have to watch it?</p><p>
    
    ""Suddenly I'm in a sea of honey pouring down on me,"" sings Tanya Donelly, and I'm glad she's enjoying that
    Bath &amp; Body Works gift certificate.  All this cooing has the intimacy of a living room music session, with
    Donelly and hubby Dean Fisher leading a mostly acoustic set of guitars, piano and pedal steel.  (That's the
    Throwing Muses' Dave Narcizo on drums, but he's mostly passing through on his way to borrow the weed whacker.)
    And as always, Donelly gives us her exquisite punky-pop soprano, which stands on its toes to scratch off a
    piece of heaven.</p><p>
    
    But even if her solo work has grown calmer and more domestic over the years, she's still handy with a ballad--
    especially in the stunned ache of ""Divine Sweet Divine"" or the melody of ""Every Devil"".  The title track moves
    with a nice sashay, but as on her other solo albums, she frontloads the breathtaking songs: <i>Whiskey Tango
    Ghosts</i> stays satisfied, to the point of sounding undifferentiated.  The choice to record this with a
    small ensemble and spare production makes it cozy, the swells of passion never hit as hard as they should,
    or sound as lush as they did on 2002's <i>Beautysleep</i>.  Donelly sings about a love so strong that she
    almost loses herself in it, but the music doesn't follow her.</p><p>
    
    It's hard not to compare this album to her half-sister Kristin Hersh's acoustic set, <i>The Grotto</i>,
    which came out last year on 4AD: Both use stripped-down bands, but more importantly, both albums are
    focused on marriage.  Hersh's record prodded the difficulties and tensions in any relationship, healthy
    or otherwise, and caught the times that you doubt how healthy it is to begin with.  By contrast, Donelly
    sings as if she's just a week past the wedding and they're still unwrapping each other like presents.  Her
    marriage is her balm.  She hints at bad memories and anxieties-- the ""devils"" and ""ghosts"" that float through
    the lyrics-- but that's all firmly in the past, and her husband is the rock she can turn to, the presence
    that saves her from rattling around the house alone.</p><p>
    
    Tanya Donelly has earned her contentment.  But where does she go from here?  Even to a married guy like
    myself, whose take on the ties that bind falls somewhere between the Hersh and Donelly perspectives,
    <i>Whiskey Tango Ghosts</i>' happiness overplays its hand.  The note of doubt cast by the last song,
    ""Fallout"", barely sinks in before you hear the bonus track-- a brief a cappella performance of ""Dona Nobis
    Pacem"" (""Give Us Peace"", for those of you who missed glee club), where Donelly's seraphic voice ushers us
    away from a domestic scene cast in a snow globe, whose glass must not, will not break.</p></div>"|2418.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2418-whiskey-tango-ghosts/|6.3|Chris Dahlen

    made.  The group at this point had become a minor street phenomenon in the local alt-weeklies, but Black
    Thought's city-specific freestyles over ?uestlove's soul-powered grooves still remained a guarded
    Philadelphia secret.  The Roots had also garnered attention then for having attending the prestigious
    Creative and Performing Arts high school (CAPA), as the school's artistic mission was so rigidly
    anti-popular and <i>l'art pour l'art</i>.  It was win/win: The CAPA tag offered The Roots instant artistic
    legitimacy, and The Roots made CAPA the coolest place in the world.</p><p>
    
    Six records in, several Roots members are no longer even Philadelphians, let alone CAPA alums.  Still,
    I've always tried to understand each Roots album as capturing the band's original CAPA vs. Pop paradox:
    smart lyrics and jazz backbeats whose abstract tendencies never came at the expense of accessibility.  By
    1999's <i>Things Fall Apart</i>, however, The Roots had discovered a balance within that paradox and
    fulfilled their initial promise, and 2002's experimental <i>Phrenology</i> documented the band at a
    critical point of self-revision: Beyond the intense creative pressure The Roots put on themselves and
    their genre, they also added a guitarist, said farewell to Malik B., and welcomed more guest spots than
    ever before.  There's something to be said for the fact that <i>Phrenology</i> housed both The Roots'
    most difficult songs and two extremely successful radio singles, ""The Seed (2.0)"" and ""Break You Off"".</p><p>
    
    On <i>The Tipping Point</i>, though, The Roots forgo experimentation altogether, focusing their energy on
    a new direction: adult-oriented rap.  For an album borne from jam sessions-- a technique the band employed
    to guide them toward a looser feel-- this is easily the flattest and most Grammy-conscious album The Roots
    have made.  Its majority carelessly regurgitates the painful cliches of ""enlightened"" hip-hop's critical
    and commercial darlings, while the band falls back on their organic hip-hop sound as a gimmick and piles
    on guest appearances to disguise their lack of creativity.  In other words, if you thought ?uestlove's
    cameo on Joss Stone's putrid ""Fell in Love with a Boy"" was a regrettable misstep, pull up a trashcan and
    get ready to wretch.</p><p>
    
    Opening track ""Star"" reveals that The Roots have become more chimerical than ever: Here, the band drums up
    a faux-Timbaland beat that fights with a sample of Sly &amp; The Family Stone's ""Everyone Is a Star"", while
    Black Thought assures us, ""This ain't pop like Kylie Minogue.""  Unfortunately, that may be the track's
    lyrical peak.  By the outro, The Roots have slumped into a neo-soul take on The Spinners' ""It's a Shame""--
    just the first of many in <i>The Tipping Point</i>'s soulless neo-soul fluff-track cadre.</p><p>
    
    Sadly, The Roots seem to be following the Black Eyed Peas' lead on <i>The Tipping Point</i>-- and not just
    musically.  Among the album's giant lyrical flops are: ""Yeah, it ain't nothin' like the rush I get in front
    of the band/ On stage with the planet in the palm of my hand"" (from the album's atrocious first single ""Don't
    Say Nothin'""), ""This rap game is like selling coke legally"" (off ""Somebody's Gotta Do It""), and finally,
    ""Why""'s caricatured insight, ""Some people's chasing their dream/ Some people's chasing their high.""  The
    record doesn't fare much better elsewhere: ""Guns Are Drawn"" is a <i>Reflection Eternal</i> C-side; ""Boom!"",
    on which Thought impersonates Big Daddy Kane and Kool G. Rap, wants to be Beastie but barely puts up a
    fight to party; and ""Duck Down"" brings us back to Timbo-esque beats, this time with a kickdrum sound that
    drowns out the hornlines that may otherwise have served as the track's only saving grace.</p><p>
<i>The Tipping Point</i> does have two bright spots: ?uestlove beats the hell out of his cymbal while
    managing a slew of stop/starts and a sick minimal stomp on ""The Web"", and the Kranz beat and river of
    great guest rhymes on hidden track ""The Mic"" is ironically the album's most fun cut.  Both songs are
    straightforward raps, and stick out on <i>The Tipping Point</i> precisely for this unadorned simplicity;
    by and large, the album is much too concerned with playing it safe, and generally fails for its lack of
    casual insouciance.</p><p>
<i>Illadelph Halflife</i> and <i>Things Fall Apart</i> opened with the following warning: ""Inevitably,
    hip-hop albums are treated as though they are disposable.  They're not maximized as product even, you
    know, not to mention as art.""  The sample is appropriately absent from <i>The Tipping Point</i>.  There's
    no doubt that The Roots have maximized their product with this record; unfortunately, it's resulted in
    their first disposable release.</p></div>"|6834.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6834-the-tipping-point/|5.4|Nick Sylvester

    What a beautiful night.  All the cars passing by look like fireflies.  They move by slowly and resolutely,
    but I can't really hear them.  I can hear the grass, and I think that's a breeze.  Sometimes the wind sounds
    like someone singing.  What a stupid thing to say.  I've really got to start writing greeting cards, there's
    probably good money in that.  But it's true, sometimes the wind sounds like a fucked-up cabaret singer, just
    letting loose with moans and whispers like she doesn't care who hears it.  Why should she care?  What did
    Madison say?  ""All the bad choices ppl make for themselves come down to thinking they're a person that
    they're not.""  Maybe so.  But this singing couldn't care less.  It winds through desperate weeds and my
    hair, and would sooner level the city behind me than stop to consider who it is, why it's singing.  Crazy,
    what music can do.  How am I going to live with myself?</p><p>
<i>The droning, consonant pull of the title track doesn't so much ebb and flow as drift, always towards
    some pristine reservoir.  I don't normally associate ""bliss"" with this band, and though it's unfair to
    assume soft, major-keyed trance necessarily equates to bliss, I fall into the trap this time.  But it's a
    bliss that discards expected notions of peaceful resolve and acceptance; </i>Joy Shapes<i> plays for people
    who realize what terrible things they are capable of (or have already done) and are leaping hopelessly into
    areas of the mind safely buffered from the real world.  Some people call this ""transcendent.""  ""Stroke"" is
    similar, at least insofar as it sticks to major keys (and devilish sevenths) and gentle processions, though
    is wilder at heart.  It has distant chimes, ringing in no obvious order or tonality, that make everything
    positioned on top of them seem heavenly.  When the female voices enter almost seven minutes in, I struggle
    to compare them to anything-- maybe it's reminiscent of the last song on </i>Vision Creation Newsun<i>,
    when the savage Boredoms shed their spikes and let the blood on their teeth dry as they slept.  Charalambides
    don't play with sharp teeth; they're wild like vines and centipedes.</i></p><p>
    
    Had I known you could bleed this much I might've reconsidered.  But we'll see each other again.  And I know
    I'll get everything that's coming to me.  Fuck, even now, as I'm standing over you, torn and broken, you
    seem amazing.  Did I do this?  You still feel here, not here.  I could never really hate you.  Jesus, I
    didn't do this.</p><p>
<i>As </i>Joy Shapes<i> unwinds with a gradual, near-violent climax of howling feedback, doubled by voices
    disconnected from their bodies on ""Voice for You"", it occurs to me that these songs aren't so much hymns of
    passing to the other side as murder ballads.  They're for murdering daydreams and the outside world; killing
    off connections to other music, and mental archives kept around in case you forget what ""joy"" and terror are
    supposed to feel like.  I guess I should say that it's the best Charalambides album I've heard, if that makes
    a difference.  And it's not that I think daydreams should be killed, but that some music has a way of sparking
    more than just your everyday escapism.  That's healthy, right?  Of course it is.</i></p></div>"|1734.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1734-joy-shapes/|8.6|Dominique Leone

    rings in the background, its insistent digital purr interrupting his acoustic guitar strumming and stage-whisper
    vocals.  Seemingly unrehearsed, it more or less determines the song's finale, as Zientara quickly wraps it
    up and answers the phone: ""Inner Ear.""</p><p>
    
    Yes, it's <i>that</i> Inner Ear, the studio Zientara founded in Washington, D.C. during the late 1970s,
    where he has produced acts like Fugazi, Q &amp; Not U, Bad Religion, Rites of Spring, and Deceased.  And yes,
    to record <i>Sixteen Songs</i>, Zientara forsook all the technological marvels of the modern recording
    studio and apparently set up his analog machine at the receptionist's desk.  Whenever Zientara gets excited
    and the song builds to a climax, as on ""Waiting for the Muse"", the machine can barely capture all the sound,
    and the resultant muddiness implies real intimacy and vulnerability.  The sub-demo quality of the album,
    like a field recording or some 60s troubadour's lost tapes, is purposeful, the underproduced and lo-fi-primitive
    sound intended to convey unprepossessing spontaneity: Zientara wants you to think he recorded these songs
    off-the-cuff, possibly during his coffee break.  And most likely he did.</p><p>
    
    He calls his approach ""minimalism"" in the short liner notes: ""Most important is the fact that with a single
    voice there is a littleness... a feeling that the singer is no more important than the person listening,
    probably less so.""  As a veteran producer's manifesto, those words are a bit meandering and unedited, much
    like the music itself, but the album's basic cardboard packaging and matter-of-fact title would seem to bear
    out his message of ""littleness.""</p><p>
    
    But Zientara is a producer first, a musician second.  The intimacy on <i>Sixteen Songs</i> sounds practiced,
    which makes the album's murkiness seem a little calculated.  He wants to remove himself from the music
    completely, to subjugate his ego to the songs themselves-- a noble effort, but an impossible feat.  The
    more he tries to erase his own identity, the more obvious such machinations become, like the guy in the
    bar whose pick-up line is that he has no pick-up line.</p><p>
<i>Sixteen Songs</i> isn't a lie, though; it's just a casual feint.  Lyrically, these songs try to be about
    real things, but ineluctably they circle back on themselves.  As the song title ""Sing a Song with You"" implies,
    the album's evocations aren't emotional but musical, which Zientara seems to realize deep down.  These aren't
    songs about life or love, pain or happiness, but about how cool Bob Dylan and Cat Stevens were, about recording
    at the office and taking your work home with you, about music being the single defining aspect of your life
    and the excitement of pure creation.</p></div>"|8958.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8958-sixteen-songs/|7.0|Stephen M. Deusner

    Transmigration of Souls"", he was expected to greet the honor with polite gratitude.  Instead, he blasted
    the awards committee for ignoring ""many, if not most of the country's greatest musical minds... in favor
    of academy composers"" over the past 50 years, noting that they had failed to recognize popular figures
    Philip Glass and Laurie Anderson, pioneers like John Cage, or any jazz artists such as Thelonious Monk.
    Adams cares deeply about the state of American music past and present, and has always been a populist
    post-minimalist.  Where his peers have turned to world or academic music for inspiration, he's comfortable
    referencing the sweeping pastorals of Aaron Copland, the jumbled marching-band Americana of Charles Ives,
    or the so-called ""Jewish melancholy"" embedded in the past century of New York art music.  It is his unique
    style, as well as a tempering of any romanticized views of his country, that usually prevents these influences
    from carrying his music into realms of fluff and cheese.</p><p>
<i>Road Movies</i> gathers piano pieces written throughout most of Adams' career (the selections were
    originally composed between 1977 and 2001).  Unlike most of his peers, Adams' music has grown neither
    stagnant nor obtuse as he's aged, probably because he hasn't committed himself to a particular musical
    dogma.  That's not to say that the works on <i>Road Movies</i> don't vary in quality; however, the two
    standout pieces, ""Hallelujah Junction"" and ""Phrygian Gates"", are both inspired compositions that stand as
    prime distillations of Adams' style.</p><p>
    
    1996's ""Hallelujah Junction"" is a vertiginous composition for two pianos, exhibiting the unbroken stream of
    consciousness apparent in Adams' best work.  The music effortlessly flows from one rhythmic and harmonic
    figure to the next as each piano compels the other into new territory.  After exploring grand pastoral
    beauty in movements I and II-- and hinting at various styles of folk and popular music along the way--
    movement III loses itself in a frenzied, dissonant boogie.  It's not the ending I'd have chosen, but when
    you've been composing for more than 20 years, I guess you get sick of transcendental finales.  The
    composition recalls both Steve Reich's experiments in combining several instruments of the same timbre,
    as well as the shifting rhythmic fluidity driving Louis Andriessen's more frenetic works.</p><p>
    
    ""Phrygian Gates"" (1977) for solo piano is the piece that Adams considers his official ""Opus I.""  It established
    a sound that would come to be recognized as uniquely his, attracting wide attention upon its release and
    unofficially challenging Philip Glass to the title of ""world arpeggio overlord.""  It was written as Adams'
    attempt to evoke the constantly modulating, shifting structures of waves, which it does beautifully.  Rolf
    Hind's interpretation on this recording, though less emotive than others, is admirable in its machinelike
    virtuosity.  It masterfully highlights the subtle rhythmic shifts and angular transitions that lend resonance
    to the work's unique momentum.</p><p>
    
    Less exciting are ""American Berserk"" (2001) and the title piece (1995).  ""American Berserk"" explores the
    chaos approached at the end of ""Hallelujah Junction"".  Its Bartok-like application of folk rhythms to a
    disjointed and ferocious melodicism is interesting but on the whole, not very exciting.  The title is taken
    from Philip Roth's <i>American Pastoral</i>, a phrase used to describe the ""desperation of the counterpastoral""
    that confronts the book's characters through the realities of the Vietnam War.  Given this context-- and
    the year of the piece's composition-- one can infer that ""American Berserk"" was most likely written in the
    months directly following 9/11, and it cannot help but resonate with the event.  Like much of the reactionary
    art created during that period of initial shock, it is powerful in context but does not retain its impact
    independently, a fate avoided by the his distanced and thoughtful Pulitzer winner ""On the Transmigration of
    Souls"".</p><p>
    
    ""Road Movies"" is a piece for solo violin and piano, and while its second movement, ""Meditative"", is a quiet
    masterpiece, casting a fragile fog of empty fourths and fifths around a slight bluesy lilt, the first and
    last sections of the piece are underwhelming.  Adams attempts to capture the frantic energy of bluegrass
    fiddling here, but the solo violin turns out to be a misjudgment of instrumentation.  It doesn't have enough
    harmonic complexity to carry the force of its repetitive motives and static sixteenth notes against the
    percolating figures of the piano.</p><p>
    
    Still, this-- along with <i>Shaker Loops &amp; Phrygian Gates</i>-- is a good place for those unfamiliar with
    Adams.  Piano works serve as a good entry point when it comes to a composer such as John Adams, whose
    orchestral output might alienate some, many of whom could consider his classical works all pomp and
    circumstance.</p></div>"|448.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/448-road-movies/|7.5|Liam Singer

    was clear: Julian Casablancas has appropriated, if not completely ripped off, Lou's trademark sing/speak
    delivery and older-than-its-years vocal texture, and the band's guitar sound-- approximately two parts chug,
    one part ring-- owes no small debt to the ringing chug that Lou honed to syringe-tip perfection in The
    Velvet Underground.  Unquestionably, Lou's legend lives.  But what about his music?  Given his recent
    dalliances into updating Edgar Allen Poe (<i>The Raven</i>) and exploring possum life (""Like a Possum"",
    from the lyrically unambitious <i>Ecstasy</i>), the faithful had begun to worry.  And so, inevitably, it
    was time for a live album; enter <i>Animal Serenade</i>.</p><p>
    
    Last time Lou released record with ""Animal"" in the title, his career was in similar (if more potentially
    promising) straits.  Fresh off 1973's <i>Berlin</i>, the critical and commercial disappointment we now
    know to be brilliant in its own self-consciously morbid-as-fuck kind of way, Lou-- still just a year removed
    from ""Walk on the Wild Side"" and the <i>Billboard</i> Top 20-- rallied the troops, donned pancake makeup
    and a studded dog collar, and spat out <i>Rock 'n' Roll Animal</i>, a slick, hard rock reconsideration of
    his career, and the definitive live document of Lou Reed, Clown Prince of Smack.</p><p>
<i>Animal Serenade</i>, released a non-coincidental 30 years later, aspires to be the live document of the
    more refined Lou: he of the leather pants, sunglasses, and the obligatory sleeveless black t-shirt; he who
    is presumably inclined to ditch his buddies for three-hour tai chi sessions and readings of Faust; he who
    is on a one-man, Neil-from-<i>Real World: London</i>-like crusade to find the sound so pure as to cause
    people to shit themselves (""I had an acoustic guitar with the sound of diamonds,"" enthused Lou in the liner
    notes for <i>Perfect Night: Live in London</i>).</p><p>
    
    The song selection, that of an aging artist dependent on his cult, works something like a Rush setlist.  Lou
    and his band offer subtle updates of some but not all of the old favorites (""Men of Good Fortune"", ""Venus in
    Furs"", ""The Day Jack Kennedy Died"", ""I'll Be Your Mirror"", etc.)  Newer and/or ""overlooked"" cuts are hidden
    inside clusters of more familiar ones, presumably with the implication that, the occasional fuck-up (""Sex
    with Your Parents Part 2"", ""Egg Cream"", the aforementioned ""Possum"", etc.) notwithstanding, Lou can still
    write powerful, smart, deceptively simple songs.  Maybe.</p><p>
    
    Still, the old warhorses are the draw on <i>Animal Serenade</i>, and for the most part, they're given tasteful,
    appealing (if unspectacular) readings, with cellist Jane Scarpantoni adding texture and Lou's rhythm section
    laying down the usual workmanlike, just-a-little-too-diligent-for-its-own-good foundation.  Lou is in good
    voice and in a fine mood, even playful in places.  (""As in most things in life, it's that little hop in the
    end,"" he jokes of the fourth chord in ""Sweet Jane"".  Of course, he doesn't actually play ""Sweet Jane"".)  The
    two-hour-plus runtime is gratuitous; probably the idea was to present the complete show (a la <i>Alive</i>
    by Kiss), but the effect is mind-numbing, and most of the successful experiments are lost in well-mannered
    gray.</p><p>
    
    Two songs cut through the fog.  The Fernando Saunders-penned ""Reiven Cherie"", the title apparently French
    for ""Ersatz Stevie Wonder"", is painfully out of place, overlong, and almost completely unrewarding.  Antony,
    a bold if appropriate choice for a singer on ""Candy Says"", re-imagines the number as a tragedy, his quivering
    voice practically dripping with knowing pain, peeling decades of rust off the lyrics, imparting them with
    feeling, making them new.</p><p>
    
    Maybe Lou Reed can't be vital anymore.  Maybe he's too old, too far removed from the experiences that shaped
    him.  But <i>Animal Serenade</i> proves that his best songs are locked forever in the present-- ageless,
    timeless, constant, and true; unlike their author, they are immortal.</p></div>"|6738.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6738-animal-serenade/|6.5|Stephen May

    shambolism as they were with cardies, Bowlie, and avoiding the press, you'd have gotten pretty long odds
    that they'd become an ambitious, sophisticated, sunny pop band.  Yet, six years after they began to embrace
    Northern Soul with the same fervor as ""Northern Sky"", the band that couldn't cut it on <i>Sessions on
    West 54th</i> is carrying the flag for multi-layered, nuanced indie pop.</p><p>
    
    Granted, it's been a sometimes rocky transition from being a loose collective to a tight unit: 2000's odd
    grab-bag <i>Fold Your Hands Child, You Walk Like a Peasant</i> often sounds labored or cautious, while last
    year's <i>Dear Catastrophe Waitress</i> sometimes seems too meticulous, clean and stuffy.  But over the
    course of <i>Waitress</i>' three counterpart EPs-- <i>Step into My Office, Baby</i>, <i>I'm a Cuckoo</i>
    and <i>Books</i>-- the band have grown increasingly playful and are finally fully comfortable working as a
    studio outfit.</p><p>
    
    Oddly, the best material from these EPs (as well as from the post-<i>Fold Your Hands</i> EPs and <i>Dear
    Catastrophe Waitress</i>) contradict the old standby critique of Belle &amp; Sebastian Mk. II, that a democratic
    approach to the band's music spoiled the beauty of Stuart Murdoch's benevolent dictatorship.  Murdoch remains
    the band's best lyricist by some distance, but a communal approach to crafting melodies, hooks, and sonic
    accents-- which, in some cases, result in heavily layered and multi-part tracks-- is now arguably the band's
    primary strength.</p><p>
    
    When not lapsing into hippy-dippy Polyphonic Spree territory, Belle &amp; Sebastian's increased penchant for
    loose grooves, elastic rhythms and playful ideas is a welcome and necessary antidote for a band that
    threatened to become nothing but neutered, constipated soul or by-the-numbers pastiche.  This more relaxed
    approach carries echoes of early Orange Juice and, arguably, may have been coaxed by the freedom of the
    single format.  Liberated from the pressure of recording and releasing a full album-- and with no need to
    make each release a definitive statement-- Belle &amp; Sebastian took some chances and ended up releasing a
    handful of great songs, including ones that morph into interesting directions in the hands of others (The
    Avalanches' remix of ""I'm a Cuckoo"") or themselves (the ""version"" of ""Your Cover's Blown"").</p><p>
<i>Step into My Office</i> is the weakest of the three EPs.  The title track grates as much as it charms,
    and although everything from its ""Dope Show""-esque opening to its sexual innuendos can't help but produce
    fewer smiles once you know they're coming, it's still a joy to hear Murdoch's winking transformation from
    ""working for the joy of giving"" to the joy of, erm, getting.  ""Love on the March"" is a bit of wintry bossa
    nova, the sort of application of Brazilian aesthetics one would except from pasty Scots.  ""Desperation Made
    a Fool of Me"", meanwhile, may be the disc's best track.  Recorded with longtime Scottish pop engineer Tony
    Doogan, it's a daily-grind/killing-me-softly type song about dashed expectations and the harsh yet strangely
    rewarding reality of an often difficult life-- one on which Murdoch's weary vocal matches the song's sleepy,
    worn tone and content.</p><p>
<i>I'm a Cuckoo</i> wisely pegs <i>Waitress</i>' most radio-ready track as a single.  The jaunty, quotable
    ""Cuckoo"" is all wish fulfillment and dancefloor daydreams, and it's even more engaging on its own than
    within the context of an album.  The Avalanches remix ignores Murdoch's suggestion that he'd ""like to be
    in Tokyo"", and instead transports him to North Africa via a chorus of Sudanese children and some sort of
    hand-played frame and/or wooden percussion (a doumbek? Djembe? Darbukka? Ask Damon Albarn, he'll know).
    Besides the vocals, the remix's one consolation to the album version is its re-creation of the main melody
    line on a wooden flute.</p><p>
    
    Sticking with the tourist/traveller's theme, <i>I'm a Cuckoo</i> also rescues Stevie Jackson's ""(I Believe
    in) Travellin' Light"" from the dustbin.  Wisely cut from <i>Dear Catastrophe Waitress</i> (it doesn't fit
    the record's mood), ""Travellin' Light"" is another of Jackson's Greenwich Village Salesman folk songs, a
    dusty ballad that avoids the pantomime of Belle &amp; Sebastian's career nadir ""Beyond the Sunrise"", yet isn't
    as delightful as ""The Wrong Girl"".  And perhaps oddest of all, ""Stop, Look and Listen"" shifts from Mike
    Nesmith to Dick Dale within its seven minutes.</p><p>
    
    Another <i>Waitress</i> favorite, ""Wrapped Up in Books"", leads off the <i>Books</i> EP, but it's merely a
    teaser for ""Your Cover's Blown"".  Described by <i>NME</i> as the ""indie 'Bohemian Rhapsody'"", it's a slinky,
    sultry mini-suite-- spy vs. spy in the discotheque.  Even the re-emergence of the Arthur Lee impression
    Murdoch debuted on ""I'm Waking Up to Us"" can't detract from its whiplash smiles.  The deep bass and hi-hat
    of ""Cover (Version)"" offer an alternate approach to ""Your Cover's Blown"", serving as a cousin to the
    Avalanches' ""Cuckoo"" remix.  The cut-and-paste approach and combinations of seemingly disparate elements
    on display here (as well as in the original) echo The Fiery Furnaces and dance culture in equal parts.
    And finally, ""Your Secrets"" takes us back to the start, recalling bits of the stronger melodies from
    <i>Fold Your Hands</i>, but retaining the crisp feel of <i>Waitress</i>.  Like this EP's literary title
    track, it could have slotted into any of Belle &amp; Sebastian's past albums-- a trick that ""Your Cover's Blown""
    and its companion track will hopefully manage on the band's next full-length.</p></div>"|11671.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11671-step-into-my-office-baby-epim-a-cuckoo-epbooks-ep/|6.9|Scott Plagenhoef

    handful of great songs, including ones that morph into interesting directions in the hands of others (The
    Avalanches' remix of ""I'm a Cuckoo"") or themselves (the ""version"" of ""Your Cover's Blown"").</p><p>
<i>Step into My Office</i> is the weakest of the three EPs.  The title track grates as much as it charms,
    and although everything from its ""Dope Show""-esque opening to its sexual innuendos can't help but produce
    fewer smiles once you know they're coming, it's still a joy to hear Murdoch's winking transformation from
    ""working for the joy of giving"" to the joy of, erm, getting.  ""Love on the March"" is a bit of wintry bossa
    nova, the sort of application of Brazilian aesthetics one would except from pasty Scots.  ""Desperation Made
    a Fool of Me"", meanwhile, may be the disc's best track.  Recorded with longtime Scottish pop engineer Tony
    Doogan, it's a daily-grind/killing-me-softly type song about dashed expectations and the harsh yet strangely
    rewarding reality of an often difficult life-- one on which Murdoch's weary vocal matches the song's sleepy,
    worn tone and content.</p><p>
<i>I'm a Cuckoo</i> wisely pegs <i>Waitress</i>' most radio-ready track as a single.  The jaunty, quotable
    ""Cuckoo"" is all wish fulfillment and dancefloor daydreams, and it's even more engaging on its own than
    within the context of an album.  The Avalanches remix ignores Murdoch's suggestion that he'd ""like to be
    in Tokyo"", and instead transports him to North Africa via a chorus of Sudanese children and some sort of
    hand-played frame and/or wooden percussion (a doumbek? Djembe? Darbukka? Ask Damon Albarn, he'll know).
    Besides the vocals, the remix's one consolation to the album version is its re-creation of the main melody
    line on a wooden flute.</p><p>
    
    Sticking with the tourist/traveller's theme, <i>I'm a Cuckoo</i> also rescues Stevie Jackson's ""(I Believe
    in) Travellin' Light"" from the dustbin.  Wisely cut from <i>Dear Catastrophe Waitress</i> (it doesn't fit
    the record's mood), ""Travellin' Light"" is another of Jackson's Greenwich Village Salesman folk songs, a
    dusty ballad that avoids the pantomime of Belle &amp; Sebastian's career nadir ""Beyond the Sunrise"", yet isn't
    as delightful as ""The Wrong Girl"".  And perhaps oddest of all, ""Stop, Look and Listen"" shifts from Mike
    Nesmith to Dick Dale within its seven minutes.</p><p>
    
    Another <i>Waitress</i> favorite, ""Wrapped Up in Books"", leads off the <i>Books</i> EP, but it's merely a
    teaser for ""Your Cover's Blown"".  Described by <i>NME</i> as the ""indie 'Bohemian Rhapsody'"", it's a slinky,
    sultry mini-suite-- spy vs. spy in the discotheque.  Even the re-emergence of the Arthur Lee impression
    Murdoch debuted on ""I'm Waking Up to Us"" can't detract from its whiplash smiles.  The deep bass and hi-hat
    of ""Cover (Version)"" offer an alternate approach to ""Your Cover's Blown"", serving as a cousin to the
    Avalanches' ""Cuckoo"" remix.  The cut-and-paste approach and combinations of seemingly disparate elements
    on display here (as well as in the original) echo The Fiery Furnaces and dance culture in equal parts.
    And finally, ""Your Secrets"" takes us back to the start, recalling bits of the stronger melodies from
    <i>Fold Your Hands</i>, but retaining the crisp feel of <i>Waitress</i>.  Like this EP's literary title
    track, it could have slotted into any of Belle &amp; Sebastian's past albums-- a trick that ""Your Cover's Blown""

    shambolism as they were with cardies, Bowlie, and avoiding the press, you'd have gotten pretty long odds
    that they'd become an ambitious, sophisticated, sunny pop band.  Yet, six years after they began to embrace
    Northern Soul with the same fervor as ""Northern Sky"", the band that couldn't cut it on <i>Sessions on
    West 54th</i> is carrying the flag for multi-layered, nuanced indie pop.</p><p>
    
    Granted, it's been a sometimes rocky transition from being a loose collective to a tight unit: 2000's odd
    grab-bag <i>Fold Your Hands Child, You Walk Like a Peasant</i> often sounds labored or cautious, while last
    year's <i>Dear Catastrophe Waitress</i> sometimes seems too meticulous, clean and stuffy.  But over the
    course of <i>Waitress</i>' three counterpart EPs-- <i>Step into My Office, Baby</i>, <i>I'm a Cuckoo</i>
    and <i>Books</i>-- the band have grown increasingly playful and are finally fully comfortable working as a
    studio outfit.</p><p>
    
    Oddly, the best material from these EPs (as well as from the post-<i>Fold Your Hands</i> EPs and <i>Dear
    Catastrophe Waitress</i>) contradict the old standby critique of Belle &amp; Sebastian Mk. II, that a democratic
    approach to the band's music spoiled the beauty of Stuart Murdoch's benevolent dictatorship.  Murdoch remains
    the band's best lyricist by some distance, but a communal approach to crafting melodies, hooks, and sonic
    accents-- which, in some cases, result in heavily layered and multi-part tracks-- is now arguably the band's
    primary strength.</p><p>
    
    When not lapsing into hippy-dippy Polyphonic Spree territory, Belle &amp; Sebastian's increased penchant for
    loose grooves, elastic rhythms and playful ideas is a welcome and necessary antidote for a band that
    threatened to become nothing but neutered, constipated soul or by-the-numbers pastiche.  This more relaxed
    approach carries echoes of early Orange Juice and, arguably, may have been coaxed by the freedom of the
    single format.  Liberated from the pressure of recording and releasing a full album-- and with no need to
    make each release a definitive statement-- Belle &amp; Sebastian took some chances and ended up releasing a
    handful of great songs, including ones that morph into interesting directions in the hands of others (The

    one compared numbingly often to The White Stripes.  Most of the clean garage revival was as predictable as
    a Guy Lombardo tribute, but the Furnaces stood apart, both for their The Band-meets-Syd Barrett nuggets
    and their lyrics, which read like a ransom note made from ripped-up atlases.  Frontwoman Eleanor Friedberger
    sang ""I went to"" as often as James Brown goes ""unh,"" and her brother Matt coupled raucous guitar leads with
    a piano that rollicked like a fall down the stairs.</p><p>
    Yet nothing on <em>Gallowsbird's Bark</em> hints at the ambition of The Fiery Furnaces' second album, the
    76-minute <em>Blueberry Boat</em>.  The 10-minute opener, ""Quay Cur"", sets the stage: After a two-minute
    overture with loud, blatting organs that pump like they're driven by bellows, Eleanor is introduced in
    the character of a child who lost her protective locket, ""and now I'll never never, never feel like I'm
    safe again,"" she says.  The adventure starts: They cut to the next section, where the guitars come in on
    a deluge of nautical imagery-- and then the frenzy gives way to an acoustic interlude that finds Eleanor
    singing gently in... Inuit?</p><p>
    The Furnaces pull off other mini-operas on ""Blueberry Boat""-- on which Eleanor faces off against a gang of
    pirates-- and ""Chris Michaels"", whose different parts run together so quickly that its story is almost
    mashed to gibberish.  Matt Friedberger, who-- unlike on the band's first album-- wrote all of the material,
    emerges as a pop auteur.  Matt has acknowledged the influence of The Who's rock suites, ""A Quick One, While
    He's Away"" and ""Rael"", but instead of taking a single theme and expanding it into one lengthy song, Matt is
    more likely to concatenate half-dozen seemingly separate ideas in a way that makes every piece-- even a
    straightforward track such as ""Straight Street""-- feel epic.
    </p><p>
    So much stuff is jammed into <em>Blueberry Boat</em> that you'd think Freidberger put some of it in for kicks.
    The Noah's Ark of retro guitars and garish prog keyboards initially seems random, and on the evidence of the
    Furnaces' live shows, these versions aren't even definitive: Their sets rework, split and remake their
    repertoire into one breathless block of music, one on which a song might show up for only one verse or
    come back three or four times.  But this isn't arbitrary: Matt and Eleanor are just reworking and sequencing
    the songs for different contexts.  The process resembles the way a DJ sets up a mix, and-- like in a club
    setting-- the final product should be judged not simply on which pieces they use, but on how well those
    segments work as a whole and how the band controls the energy in the room.
    </p>
<p>
<em>Blueberry Boat</em>'s 13 tracks form a perfect flow, sticking short tunes between the mini-operas,
    building up through ""Chris Michaels"" to the brief respite of the ""Paw Paw Tree"" before exploding into ""I
    Lost My Dog"", the album's dizziest travelogue.  As scrambled as Matt's palette may sound, a close listen
    reveals how perfectly he evokes each song's content: The sighing tones near the start of ""Blueberry Boat""
    sound like waves lapping the bow of their vessel, ""Mason City""'s beat chugs softly, like a train gliding
    into a station, and on ""I Lost My Dog"" Matt captures the frenzy of running all over town by switching
    instrumentation with every verse.
    </p>
<p>
    The lyrics keep pace, repeating the encyclopedic references and buckshot wordplay of the last album, but
    extending the narratives.  Matt pulls us in and out of the fantasy-- as on ""Spaniolated"", where Eleanor
    starts as a grown-up slacker, only to find herself abducted before regressing back into childhood and
    given pills ""to keep from growing taller."" <em>Gallowsbird's Bark</em> told similarly meticulous stories
    about Eleanor's real-life wanderings through London or New Jersey, but this time the songs grow into
    elaborate fictions, and the stakes are higher, with battles and abductions belying the cheerful arrangements.
    </p>
<p>
    The Furnaces sound tighter here than on their debut, but they still retain a sense of carelessness and
    spontaneity-- listen to the rambunctious piano interlude on ""Blueberry Boat"" or the distracted spit off
    his guitar solos.  Matt sings more on this record, with a delivery similar to Peter Gabriel in his Genesis
    days, and Eleanor's melodic, speak-singy vocals show a wider range and more force.  Eleanor pushes her
    crystal-clear enunciation with a more aggressive delivery, especially when she slips into character, such
    as when she stands up to a mob of pirates and swears, ""You ain't never getting the cargo of my blueberry
    boat.""
    </p>
<p>
    John Darnielle's <em>Last Plane to Jakarta</em> devastatingly parodied The Strokes approach to their second
    album, joking that they would use their money and clout to make a two-album monster with eight-minute jams,
    tuba solos and a Gregg Allman guest spot.  Whether that sounds like a dream or a nightmare, the joke was
    on us: The Strokes' second album sounded mostly like their first. But The Fiery Furnaces have made the kind
    of rock behemoth Darnielle described, a record for the overgrown part of our brain that craves engrossing
    complexity.  The exuberant overload of <em>Blueberry Boat</em> will thrill and transport you with the
    ineluctable force of a great children's story, one whose execution matches its imagination.  And like all
    the best children's stories, it takes off once the kids break the rules-- when they're dragged away from
    safety but have enough curiosity and faith in themselves to enjoy the adventure.  We're just lucky to trail
    behind and pick up their breadcrumbs.

    (singer of <i>You Forgot It in People</i>'s ""Almost Crimes"") has roughly six backrooms worth of charisma
    stockpiled in her lighter pocket alone.  Yet, despite that her tenure in the scene-stealing department
    extends back to her days with the middling indie rock outfit By Divine Right, Feist has always approached
    her solo career with agonizing apprehension.  Her solo debut, <i>Monarch</i>, appeared in 1999, and while
    a serviceable indie rock record, it did little to communicate the swaggery gleam of her stage persona.</p><p>
    Nearly five years removed from that debut, <i>Let It Die</i> finds Feist in a radically different state of
    mind, completely abandoning her guitars-and-strings indie rock shorthand in favor of folk, jazz, French pop,
    and disco accoutrements.  While her propensity for serial genre-hopping makes it difficult for the album to
    congeal into a whole (<i>Let It Die</i>'s scattered closing trilogy comprises covers of songs by Ron Sexsmith,
    The Bee Gees and 1940s vocalist Dick Haymes), it is nonetheless held together by her wistful song selection
    and an airy, summery aesthetic.</p><p>
    Although many of its originals were sparked in Toronto, where Feist first cut them as four-track demos, the
    bulk of <i>Let It Die</i> was realized and recorded in Paris with the assistance of fellow Canadian expat
    Jason Beck, better known as Peaches collaborator Chilly Gonzales.  Emblazoned with jazzy guitar shapes,
    droning vibes, crisp percussion, toothless synths, smoothed-out samples and Feist's slippery vocals, the
    music sloshes around the stereo channel like liquid in a canister.  It's no wonder that, despite her
    protestation, reviewers have quite reasonably taken to calling it Feist's French pop album; whether
    intentional or not, <i>Let It Die</i> shares all sorts of characteristics with our archetypal vision of
    Paris.  ""Whimsical,"" ""romantic"" and ""adventurous"" are all adjectives that apply.</p><p>
    With five original songs followed by six covers, <i>Let It Die</i> intimates its own Side A/B divide, of
    which the former is undoubtedly the stronger half.  We begin with ""Gatekeeper"", a sparse, jazzy lament on
    love's inconstancy that at once establishes the album's central theme; namely, the juggling act involved
    in reconciling boundless romanticism and optimism for the future with the soured relationships and broken
    hearts of the past.  One of the summer's gentlest, most natural pop melodies follows with first single
    ""Mushaboom"", from which we're gently airlifted into the title track.  Featuring a funereal organ line and
    a weak pulse of a drum beat, ""Let It Die"" yields one of the album's stillest moments. Equal parts relationship
    swansong, a reproach to a former lover, and a hardening act (chorus: ""The saddest part of a broken heart
    isn't the ending so much as the start""), it is also the album's emotional centerpiece.</p><p>
    Comprising covers of material by FraxE7oise Hardy, Sexsmith and others, Side B is decidedly less rewarding.
    Among Feist's least essential readings is her version of Sexsmith's ""Secret Heart"", which, although lovingly
    rendered, betrays the original's vulnerability to a tangle of cutesy string plucks and whiz-bang synth
    sounds.  When things work, as they do on her softly lit, glossy rendition of The Bee Gees' ""Inside Out""
    and her black-and-white take on Haynes' black-and-white piano ballad ""Now at Last"", they verge on inspired,
    but I too often found myself willfully ignoring the implications of her aggregate five original songs over
    the last four years and stubbornly unwishing some of the more extraneous covers in favor of more of her own
    material.</p><p>
    Ultimately, however, Feist's charm is such that it doesn't matter all that much who writes the songs so long
    as they're the right ones.  Indeed, one of the major reasons <i>Let It Die</i> hits is because Feist finally
    knows precisely what she's aiming at.  For that quantum leap in wisdom, we'll grant her the aforementioned
    five-year hiatus, but after this record, we're not likely to be as patient again.</p></div>"|3314.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3314-let-it-die/|8.1|Mark Pytlik

    a smoky, rundown venue when a stout, woodsy Canadian shoves <i>The Odyssey</i> in your face again and
    forces you to keep reading.  An unlikely scenario, to be sure, but it apparently happened repeatedly to
    Dan Bejar this past spring when Carey Mercer and his band Frog Eyes supported Destroyer on tour:
    hyper-literate (though not in any rigid academic sense), Mercer almost religiously takes every possible
    chance to digest the classics and proclaim their greatness to others, as if the works were his own personal
    discoveries.  His enthusiasm, for all the quirky ways it manifests itself, is very genuine-- 500 years from
    now, I can imagine someone touting The Beatles, who by then will surely be relegated to historical academia,
    with the same intensity.</p><p>
    
    We're given some vague sense of Mercer's high-pitched Homeric fervor on his Frog Eyes recordings, but on
    <i>Light Flows the Putrid Dawn</i>, his solo debut as Blackout Beach, it's very clear that the British
    Canadian bard has internalized a distinctly classical vocabulary and all its accompanying metaphors.  Combine
    these anachronisms with Mercer's fragmented, imagistic approach to lyrics and his feral, operatic delivery,
    and <i>Light Flows the Putrid Dawn</i> proceeds like some dense Delphic prophecy-- for our own sake, we
    can't keep ourselves from deciphering it.</p><p>
    
    The album's brief runtime (less than 24 minutes) is more than compensated for by the overwhelming density
    of the music.  Opener ""If I Were Not Alexander..."" proceeds slowly, but remains impossibly disorienting:
    Mercer's impenetrable Central Park soothsaying competes with his equally cryptic guitar soloing, to which
    tickles of piano and accordion are distantly allied.  ""The Swineherd Sings..."" follows as the more melodic
    and intelligible counterpart, as Mercer sings of Stalin, ""I ain't no great fan of men/ It is men that built
    this damn pen.""  Mercer switches gears for the psycho-waltzes ""Krull Courtship"" and ""The Stuttered XXX
    Breeze XXX"", two songs that aptly justify the frequent Bowie comparisons.</p><p>
    
    Elsewhere on <i>Light Flows the Putrid Dawn</i>, Mercer situates himself firmly on the Rock Side of the
    burgeoning freak-folk movement: Sparse, overdubbed guitar tracks like ""The Putrid Dawn Is Only for Us
    Baby"" and ""New Soft and Shimmering Motherhood Alliance"" might draw comparisons to the San Francisco
    noise-pop outfit Iran, and especially on ""Meadows and Pleasant Madames..."", Mercer's lupine croons and
    the accompanying hellish miasma are closely reminiscent of Tim Buckley.  On the relatively stiff closing
    march ""The Quiet Merchant Gets His Song Too"", Mercer tries his best to rhythmically mask the intense pain
    with which he wrings out alcohol's often devastating consequences: ""Oh mothers, I feel for you.""</p><p>
    
    For all <i>Putrid Dawn</i>'s musical merits, Mercer's voice is still admittedly a tough sell.  On Frog Eyes'
    past releases, he's sometimes sounded incongruous, either because the instrumentation didn't match his
    bravado, or because the accompaniment simply disregarded it.  It's a well-warranted reservation to harbor
    when approaching <i>Blackout Beach</i> (which was recorded prior to 2003's <i>The Golden River</i>), but
    one that may safely be put to rest.  Mercer is simply never out-of-sync with himself here, and his vocal
    melodies benefit from his bizarre but undeniably singular orchestrations.  As listeners, we can tell Mercer
    clearly knows what he wants out of these songs-- even if we don't know exactly what that entails.</p></div>"|1117.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1117-light-flows-the-putrid-dawn/|7.9|Nick Sylvester

    is so well established that it's now become a reference point for most downtempo breakbeat releases.
    Signature artists like Amon Tobin, Cinematic Orchestra and Coldcut have set the mold by which the
    London-based label combs for artists, and for the most part, it's been uncannily successful in tracking
    down their ilk wherever they lurk.  Their latest project dips into the unlikely breeding grounds of
    Wroclaw, Poland to spotlight an emerging duo who've gained major acclaim in their homeland but not much
    further beyond.  Skalpel, first ""discovered"" by Ninja Tune's Russian futurist DJ Vadim on an Eastern
    European tour, is comprised of Marcin Cichy and Igor Pudlo, two jazzophile DJs whose slinky, filmic debut
    fits perfectly into the Ninja Tune template.</p><p>
    The question is whether or not that's a good thing.  Skalpel are certainly more than adept at what they
    do; their seamless blend of dusty 50s and 60s Polish jazz records is technically flawless and their subdued,
    dramatic compositions are stirring.  If you're looking for a new kick, however, you won't find it here-- the
    recipe, though originating from an ethnically left-field kitchen, is tried and true.  You've heard it done
    before by their labelmates and others, a reverence for fantasy basement jam sessions peopled by the likes
    of Miles, Elvin, Herbie and Shorter, processed through a funky breaks blender to yield a sonic frappe both
    thoroughly modern and strangely reminiscent, something almost completely subliminal.</p><p>
    Perhaps Skalpel's four shows for Ninja Tune's <i>Solid Steel</i> radio program over the past couple years
    set the album on its beeline course; right out of the gates it bumps and jostles into warmly familiar
    territory a la Cinematic Orchestra's seminal <i>Motion</i>.  A uniquely playful sense of kitschy humor
    first surfaces within the rubbery double bass and old-time vocal samples of ""Not Too Bad"" and ""1958"",
    where a staid female voice instructs, ""Let them play their jazz albums, and dance all night if they want
    to.""  Actually too subdued for all but the most blunted dance floors, these songs possess an understated
    bounce and horn-led levity best suited for a headphone symphony.  The voluptuous sound of hard-plucked
    upright bass and perfectly crisp snare keeps the pulse just above comatose, floating in a comfortably
    lullabied middle ground.</p><p>
    But most of all, it's the album's fluid, meandering solo samples that help push Skalpel above decaffeinated
    café jazz.  The inclusion of liner notes detailing the original players they've sampled here gives some
    insight into their <i>modus operandi</i>, and a pleasant effect of the duo keeping enough of the original
    players' bars intact is that the music absorbs some of the soloists' stylistic overtones, without ever
    feeling like shameless plundering.</p><p>
    A few tracks midway through <i>Skalpel</i> raise the album to its peak.  The rolling cymbals and electronic
    atmospherics of ""So Far"" pair with minor-key piano and horns to progress through nighttime byways; ""Break
    In"" leads off with a psychedelic flourish before delving into an indiscernible horn current broken by
    ethereal vibraphone and dubby studio tricks; the kinky organ run on ""Quiz"" steadily builds and changes as
    the song progresses.  On these songs, Skalpel smudge the line between organic and electronic effortlessly,
    like a landscape artist working with charcoal, creating deep nuances of light and shadow that give the work
    its overall depth.  The Polish language samples on ""Theme from Behind the Iron Curtain"" are a welcome reminder
    of the music's origins, coming right before the serene dream of ""Sculpture"" that gently closes the album.</p><p>
    With Skalpel, Ninja Tune adds to its roster another peddler of dreamy, jazzy breaks-- the kind of innocuous,
    idealized electro jazz that smacks to some people of played-out formula.  But for fans of the style, there's
    a whole lot of to enjoy on this debut.  Its rhythmic dexterity and melodic sweep are hard to deny-- as long
    as you can swallow that sense of having heard it all before.</p></div>"|7768.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7768-skalpel/|7.2|Jonathan Zwickel

It fizzes up inside; you start saying things like ""neato.""  Pop's better
    in moderation, but it's best with whiskey, and The Nice Device know it.  For a self-released debut EP, the
    Detroit fivesome's <i>Birth of a Lover</i> is one professional package, punching out seven songs in under
    20 minutes and preferring bare-knuckle performance to bubblegum pussyfooting.</p><p>
    
    Andrea Gbur wails like a female Jim Ellison, and something in the harder edge of her voice says she knows
    what girls want, too, but on a track like ""Never Be My Man"", their racket is focused like solid state fuzz.
    The Nice Device aren't going to get all cute on you and start chirping about love puppies over syrupy string
    sections.  No, ""My Little Birdie"" and ""Oh Me Oh My"" are powered by a blown tweeter rhythm guitar that cranks
    like it's trying to kick over an old motorbike.  The keyboards are in the garage-rock vein, adding color to
    the choruses with vintage tones.  And yet, the hooks keep bringing <i>Lover</i> right back to pop.  Indeed,
    The Nice Device aren't staying in the garage, and they're certainly not wasting time noodling in the studio;
    they're playing out in the street, busting open fire hydrants with bursts of summertime-friendly hard pop.</p><p>
    
    Okay, they did have to spend <i>some</i> time in the studio.  But the gritty straightforwardness brought
    to the proceedings by White Stripes and Mooney Suzuki producer Jim Diamond keeps these proceedings sufficiently
    raw, while the Brendan Benson-produced tracks showcase a rare poppy economy.  The Nice Device even layer
    some dynamics into the brief <i>Lover</i>.  ""How Low How Obscene"" slices up bibles at a slinky crawl, and
    features a few more of the clever vocal overdubs that surface throughout.  These, of course, only further
    characterize Gbur, constantly preventing a fade into the chick-singer fog.  ""Back to the City""'s coed
    harmonies are great as well, and the song's ambitious, Bowie-meets-The Go arrangement makes for a nice
    change of pace.</p><p>
    
    Still, The Nice Device's knockout shot is straight-up, stripped-down rock 'em sock 'em hard pop bop.  On
    ""Gotta Get It"", Gbur's brassy wail is like a come-hither finger from the darkest alley in the city, and
    ""My Little Birdie"" strikes a balance between charming sugar high and nuts 'n' bolts junkyard cacophony.
    <i>Birth of a Lover</i> is a remarkably strong debut, and sets The
    Nice Device up as your new crush for summer.</p></div>"|5902.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5902-birth-of-a-lover/|7.0|Johnny Loftus

    Hives four years ago, when this catch-all collection was released by Poptones Records in the UK (complete
    with a ""u"" in ""favourite"").  At the time, it was perhaps the band's most audacious move: releasing a
    greatest hits comp before they even had a hit.  In 2004, however, following a hit album, a vaguely defined
    garage-rock movement, and a <i>Spider-Man</i> soundtrack, The Hives are neither ""new"" nor arguably ""favorite.""
    In the intervening years, a seven-nation army of nostalgia-minded bands has amassed to exploit the hazy
    definition of ""garage-rock,"" from The Vines and Jet to The Killers and Thee Shams.  Unless this month's
    <i>Tyrannosaurus Hives</i> pulls some kind of amazing stunt-- and the first single, ""Walk Idiot Walk"",
    with its <i>Who's Next</i> guitar riff, suggests it just might-- Sweden's brashest and best-dressed
    pop/punks could fall victim to the harshest backlash this side of The Strokes.</p><p>
    
    However, as <i>Your New Favorite Band</i> still proves, The Hives could very easily erase all doubts.
    Officially released stateside in anticipation of <i>T. Hives</i>, <i>Your New Favorite Band</i> collects
    singles from <i>Veni Vidi Vicious</i>, <i>Barely Legal</i>, and the <i>A.K.A. I-D-I-O-T</i> EP, as well as
    a B-side from the ""Hate to Say I Told You So"" single and a DVD with three videos.  Curiously, the collection
    is arranged in reverse chronological order, beginning with tracks from <i>Veni Vidi Vicious</i>: ""Hate to
    Say I Told You So"" still retains its churning momentum thanks to Chris Dangerous' perfectly concise guitar
    riff, and despite the polish, Howlin' Pelle Almqvist's vocals are still sandpaper rough.  But, in this
    context at least, ""Die, Alright!"" sounds like the most urgent song they've yet recorded, its final chorus
    a true punk epic.</p><p>
    
    The downside of this arrangement is that it frontloads the collection with The Hives' best material, and
    gradually grows weaker as the disc progresses.  Moving backwards, <i>Your New Favorite Band</i> next features
    five tracks from <i>A.K.A. I-D-I-O-T</i>.  While ""Outsmarted"" and ""Here We Go Again"" overflow with swaggering
    audacity, tracks like ""Mad Man"" and the marble-mouthed rant ""Untutored Youth"" just sound shrill and overeager
    to impress.  The two tracks from <i>Barely Legal</i>, ""Automatic Schmuck"" and ""Hail Hail Spit n' Drool"", are
    the weakest of the bunch, amplifying The Hives' most cartoonish tendencies.</p><p>
    
    What's missing from this collection is the glue between songs.  <i>Veni Vidi Vicious</i> constructed a
    sovereign nation-state complete with its own nuclear arsenal, functioning economy, police force, and, um,
    metric system.  <i>Your New Favorite Band</i> holds together through sheer entropy as it moves from its
    strongest to its weakest tracks.  It's a strange trajectory, receding backwards in time even as it moves
    forward, yet it still manages to prove that despite their matching outfits and sights on new-favorite-band
    status, The Hives rise above their own shtick-- if sometimes just barely.</p></div>"|3891.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3891-your-new-favorite-band/|7.7|Stephen M. Deusner

    them.  Think of <i>Mojo</i> magazine asking a handful of quasi-celebrities each month to pick a ""Saturday
    Night"" and ""Sunday Morning"" record; Loren Connors' <i>The Departing of a Dream</i>, for example, should
    only be legally available between 11 p.m. and 4 a.m., while Sam Prekop's solo record makes sense on a cheery
    day when the sunlight is streaming through the window.</p><p>
    
    When listening to <i>Satin Black</i>, the fourth record by the instrumental guitar/bass/drum trio Paik, I'm
    struck with a paradox.  This is the perfect soundtrack for a dark room in a dank basement that has been
    sealed off completely from a disgustingly sunny day, so it's daytime music of a different sort.  Paik make
    the kind of slow, drop-D guitar sludge that alienated suburban kids have been getting stoned to since Black
    Sabbath entered the fray.  Nighttime is about dreams and endless possibility and daytime is for making things
    happen; Satin Black is about disengaging from the cycle altogether.</p><p>
    
    I mention Sabbath only as an indicator of mood; Paik are not metal, though they are certainly heavy.  The
    touchstones of their sound are ultimately much more contemporary, as they combine Sonic Youth's experiments
    in tuning and atonal riffage with Bardo Pond's krautrock-channeling rhythmic thrust.  Guitarist Robert Smith's
    instrument often seems as though it has only a couple of loosely wound strings (such is the nature of his
    bottom-focused stabs and endless ripples of sustain), which is amplified by the fact that he often wraps
    his lines completely around those of the bass guitar.  The drummer focuses on a thudding style of heavy
    rock ""groove"" while making heavy use of crash and ride cymbals to maintain an air of mysticism, the sharp
    metal percussion connecting with our subconscious vision of the gypsy caravan.</p><p>
    
    I would say that Paik chug forward like a poorly lubed steam train, but since they're from Michigan, perhaps
    a souped-up but rusted-out 1978 Crown Victoria would be a better metaphor.  In any event, Paik construct an
    unpredictable ramshackle clang, always just on the verge of falling apart, around a core of serious power.
    The detuned three-note riff of ""Jayne Field"" combined with the Bonham-esque percussion stomp creates a
    tension that the tumbling middle refrain releases nicely.  ""Dirt for Driver"" and the title track, meanwhile,
    find the guitar leaving the massive central bass riff to explore acidic upper-register runs, at times
    exhibiting a touching lyricism.  The songs are all on the long side, of course, befitting a band that
    aligns itself with the Michigan space-rock scene, and <i>Satin Black</i> culminates in the 15-minute closer
    ""Stellar Meltdown en el Oceano"", an extended feedback drone with the drummer laying out that could be
    understood as a tribute to the sonic ambience of Detroit industry.</p><p>
    
    Even if <i>Satin Black</i> is heavy and bleak music for dropping out, I'm certainly not knocking it.  In
    fact, we need those kinds of records desperately.  A few hours wallowing alone with records like this one
    can be cathartic in its own way, like pushing the ""pause"" button on your life, and it's sure a lot better
    for you than heroin.  You can always open the curtains after you've spent some time down here working
    things out.</p></div>"|6544.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6544-satin-black/|7.5|Mark Richardson

    <i>Stranger than Paradise</i>.  Although her IMDb resumé includes small roles in a few other films (including
    Steve Buscemi's <i>Trees Lounge</i>), recently she has prioritized a musical career over a theatrical one.
    She started studying violin at the age of six, and in addition to solo albums (<i>Mud</i> is her second;
    her first, <i>Flicker</i>, was released in 1999), she's played violin on albums by Dayna Kurtz and Michael
    Gira's post-Swans project The Angels of Light.</p><p>
    Though she's developed in the five years since her debut, <i>Mud</i> remains a largely unrefined affair,
    with a recurring problem lying with arrangements that fail to truly mesh, resulting in songs that feel
    somewhat tossed together and rough around the edges.  This is particularly evident on ""No One"", in which
    Balint's vocals never really sound as though they fit with the melody oozed out by her accompaniment (which
    includes three guitars, a French horn, keyboard, bass, drums, and glockenspiel).  The song comes close to
    gelling during the choruses, but these are often too short and easily forgotten in the context of the rest
    of their respective tracks.  ""Good Luck"" sounds like an updated version of Luscious Jackson's ""Naked Eye"",
    with Balint cramming bland lyrics (""Will you chew me up, spit me out in the end/ Just when I think you're
    my friend"") into four minutes.  Notably, this is the only song on which she doesn't play anything.</p><p>
<i>Mud</i> isn't always shaky, though.  Balint's strongest songs seem to be the ones on which she plays
    violin: With an instrument on which she's so obviously comfortable, she's able to fill in any of the
    awkward spaces in her arrangements.  On the opening track, ""Pebbles &amp; Stones"", Balint sounds more relaxed
    than on most of the rest of the album, both vocally and musically.  The banjo, played by <i>Mud</i>'s
    producer JD Foster, gives the song an alt-country feel, yet the lack of twang in Balint's coarse alto,
    which at times too closely mirrors that of PJ Harvey, saves it from sounding derivative, and her violin
    swoops in to smooth out her rough instrumental transitions.</p><p>
    The harshness of Balint's voice fits well with the despair that often lies in her lyrics: ""Your God is
    sick, your God's a joke/ The lovely tales and songs a pile of shit,"" she sings on ""Your God"". She doesn't
    ever really sound angry, though, which is to her credit: Her voice wouldn't easily lend itself to inharmonious
    wailing.  While the opening of the album's final song, the piano-driven ""Who Are You Now"", comes strikingly
    close to a Sarah McLachlan intro, its slow tempo allows Balint to reveal more emotion than on her other
    songs, as she bemoans the betrayal of a lover (""I opened this drawer, found a hotel room key.../ Wish I'd
    taken a picture of the dent on my chest/ You left when you buried your head there to rest"").</p><p>
    Again, Balint's soulful violin complements both her vocal melody and the instrumentation, and she closes the
    album on a strong (albeit melancholy) note.  Even though a few of her songs don't quite gel, Balint shows
    promise as a songwriter, and with the strength of her violin-playing, her arrangements will surely improve
    as she grows more comfortable with performing.</p></div>"|1116.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1116-mud/|5.9|Catherine Lewis

    by all means pop some kettle corn and make tonight an Andrew Lloyd Weber night.  Proving that all <i>The
    Passion</i> needed to unite audiences was some wicked psychedelic jams, <i>JCS</i> told the story of Christ's
    last couple days in quintessential 1973 fashion: extravagant jumpsuits, limb-flailing choreography and
    racially encompassing cast decisions.  Along with Norman Greenbaum's ""Spirit in the Sky"", the film is the
    best time capsule of that weird post-60s fallout period where the hippies that didn't turn militant turned
    to a bell-bottomed form of Christianity.  To modern Jesuphobes, the results are both stomach-ache hilarious
    and strangely, sneakily moving.</p><p>
    
    The Polyphonic Spree never directly lift up their myriad voices for God (except in an ancient Egyptian
    Sun/Ra worship sense), yet I can't help but think of their 20+ members as the direct offspring of the
    <i>Jesus Christ Superstar</i> movie cast.  Whereas the film shows a schoolbus full of lax-groomed hippies
    driving to Israel to perform their songs amidst desert ruins, The Polyphonic Spree pack their bohemian mass
    into tour buses and bring their robe-clad Godspeed You Prozac Emperor sound to the dingy, beer-reeking
    venues of America.  Though their uniform dress and Jehovah's Witness exuberance often gets them smirkily
    labeled as a cult, anyone who's found themselves amidst the band's live audience can tell you how difficult
    it is to keep your indie cynic shield intact and not get drunk on whatever jolly substance the band's audio
    Kool-Aid is heavily laced with.</p><p>
    
    Which is all a long-winded way of explaining why I sorta like The Spree, despite lyrics like, ""You gotta be
    good, you gotta be strong"" (not a Des'ree cover), or, ""It's the coolest waterslide""; you might feel suffocated
    by the band's optimist syrup, but it's clear that, if nothing else, they're not being calculated about it.
    It also helps that <i>Together We're Heavy</i> finds the group growing musically from the let's-start-quiet-then-GET-REAL-LOUD
    arrangement rut of their debut, <i>The Beginning Stages Of</i>, with Tim DeLaughter conducting his followers
    through a near-continuous hour of complex musical ebbs and flows.  Following their debut album's usage of
    section numbers (song titles are in parentheses), and stitching eight-minute epics and one-minute fragments
    together into a cohesive symphony, the band's sound benefits greatly from DeLaughter's realization that not
    every instrument always needs to be playing at once.</p><p>
    
    With tracks serving more as chapter-like divisions of an album-long piece than actual song markers, it's
    hard to spot which standout track will be alchemized into money for new robes by the band's formidable
    licensing squad.  ""Hold Me Now"", however, has been announced as the first single, which makes sense: Its
    pounded piano and brassy peaks are the best candidates to sell Dell laptops or Sobe juice, which
    (Pitchformula take note) never even remotely detracts from its sunshiny summer party utility.  ""Two Thousand
    Places"", the aforementioned Des'ree quoter, also aligns the band's swollen instrumental inventory into a
    joyous noise, despite being slightly marred by a lapse into the repetitiousness of the debut's songwriting
    (see: ""Soldier Girl"").</p><p>
    
    More impressively layered, if less instantaneously memorable, are the album's lengthier tracks, most bearing
    multiple segments and melodies and placing The Spree's sound (along with their awesome new curlicue logo)
    in direct lineage from <i>Chicago Transit Authority</i>.  Opening track ""A Long Day Continues/We Sound
    Amazed"" spends its middle section enmeshed in a mellow trippy vamp that shows off the group's more restrained
    use of their palette, while ""Suitcase Calling"" works through at least five different ways to express bouncy
    glee.  The climactic ""When the Fool Becomes the King"" shows the downside of this approach, with too many
    ambitious sections glommed together in seemingly arbitrary fashion, but even this 10-minute journey ends
    up with a clever reprise of the first album's ""It's the Sun"", locking <i>Together We're Heavy</i>'s
    overarching structure into continuity with the band's previous work.</p><p>
    
    Still, am I the only one slightly bothered by Tim DeLaughter's continued <i>Single White Female</i>-esque
    desire to become Wayne Coyne?  The Polyphonic Spree have begun to carve out their own niche here, so it's
    troublesome to see their leader shaping his creative energies in transparent idol emulation; if The Flaming
    Lips' next album took a turn towards hip-hop, even money says DeLaughter would be interviewing MCs within
    hours.  Fortunately, the ensemble makes up for much of this, getting by on taking their primary influence's
    orchestral good mood to the logical extreme.  The Polyphonic Spree's gospel may not be the most original of
    scriptures, but their non-denominational Indiespell is good enough to flail your arms to while worshipping
    the planetary body of your choice.</p></div>"|6395.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6395-together-were-heavy/|7.6|Rob Mitchum

Rather than
    waging an ill-fated battle to entice the ever-jaded indie masses with quixotic idiosyncrasy, they've studied
    the musical zeitgeist, and at first glance, appear to roll with it.  <i>Dance the Dance Electric</i>, the
    group's debut full-length, would blend inconspicuously into the emergent dancepunk section of any
    hipper-than-thou record store-- that is, until an unsuspecting store clerk actually bothered to spin the
    disc, whereupon it would be revealed as a sophisticated collection of casual genre-hoppers and tender love
    songs that far outshines most of the bilge spawned from James Murphy's Chernobyl-like fallout.</p><p>
<i>Dance the Dance Electric</i> is simultaneously one of the most tragically hip and irreverently unaffiliated
    records of the year, cavorting from unabashed disco revivalism to scuzzed-out new-wave to reggae-tinged
    psychedelia in a mottled kaleidoscope of brazen idealism.  While aesthetically, all indications are of
    something closely related to the nascent discopunk phenomenon, The Shocking Pinks are only tangentially
    interested in getting down.  In fact, the complexity of their ambitions rivals vastly more established
    groups, and the youthful intensity with which they attack each objective is a constant boon.</p><p>
    At first, the album abides its come-ons: ""Lovehate"" is instrumental discopunk at its purest, enduring for
    six minutes on a redundant bassline, slap-happy bongo playing and an erratically soloing guitar.  While
    certainly not a vast departure from the cliches being propagated by present-day death-disco revivalists,
    the song is endearingly sloppy in contrast with the razor-sharp instrumentalism of bands like !!! and Out
    Hud.  That it's one of <i>Dance the Dance Electric</i>'s weaker tracks is a testament to the potency and
    stylistic diversity of the band's songcraft.</p><p>
    Any intimations ""Lovehate"" makes at inane trend appeasement are quickly dispelled as the ethereal guitar
    peals of ""Peaceout"" stagger into focus and Nick Harte delivers the album's first vocals.  With all the
    pieces in place, the song hovers briefly at a blissful stasis, but rather than stagnate in a comfortable
    environment, the band vary things with a pensive coda section.  ""Peaceout"", which finds more similarities
    in Built to Spill than ""Beat Connection"", proves The Shocking Pinks not merely fluff imitators, but truly
    competent songwriters.  That revelation is amply reinforced by the subsequent track, ""It's Hard to Breathe"",
    which eviscerates Joy Division and The Smiths, and features the simplistic yet devastatingly emotive chorus
    lyric, ""This is a love letter/ Straight from my ha-ha-heart.""</p><p>
    From there, the album dives back into the rugged, tentatively groove-minded ""Every"", and for two minutes,
    <i>Dance the Dance Electric</i> actually lives up to its misleading title.  Then, suddenly but smoothly,
    the song metamorphoses into a dream-pop vamp, retaining nothing but a vague variation of its central riff.
    Conveniently reflective of the album as a whole, ""Every"" channels a panoply of influences, but uncannily
    emerges with a singular voice.  Its 6\xBD wayward minutes easily make for <i>Dance Electric</i>'s most
    scatterbrained track, but also one of its catchiest.</p><p>
    Such is the paradox that lies at the heart of this record, and what makes The Shocking Pinks altogether so
    exciting.  Songs like the Dekker-smitten ""Affection"" and the schlock-funk ""In the Labyrinth"" lie two seconds
    away and a world apart-- it shouldn't work, but most of the time it does.  Of course, this eager eclecticism
    makes for a somewhat inconsistent final package, but any transgressions are forgiven for the indefatigable
    verve of the album.  In- or out-of-context, these are undeniably strong songs from a group of musicians who
    understand the popular climate well enough to maneuver it, to a staggering effect.</p></div>"|7767.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7767-dance-the-dance-electric/|8.2|Sam Ubl

In
    the interim, he's had to deal with the dissolution of the band whose lineup had seemingly solidified for
    that effort, but more importantly, he's become a father, so he's understandably had other things to attend
    to.  There's also the little matter of deciding where he wanted to go next-- the band he'd assembled in 2001
    was the first true rock lineup The Divine Comedy had had since their nascent days as a jangly three-piece
    in Northern Ireland (their short album <i>Fanfare for the Comic Muse</i> is actually quite good, though
    Hannon has disowned it).  The breakup of the <i>Regeneration</i> band was assumed by many to be the death
    of the Divine Comedy moniker, but Hannon apparently realized that it would be pointless to go on without
    the tag that had effectively become his pseudonym.</p><p>
    The decision to keep the name makes sense on more than a business level.  <i>Absent Friends</i> is a sort of
    quintessential distillation of The Divine Comedy's many phases, Hannon handling the production and most of
    the instruments himself while longtime cohort Joby Talbot conducts the orchestra, which is here back to full
    prominence.  Hannon has always probed for that part of each of us, no matter how well hidden, that swoons
    for sap and melts for melodrama using the clichés of six or seven decades of pop songwriting to frame the
    modern era in its own ridiculousness.  This formula is pure poison for people who take themselves too
    seriously-- which, if you ask me, is all the more reason to like it.</p><p>
    Even if you're resistant to Hannon's grandiosity, it's hard to deny the lush sweep of the album's opening
    title track, a song that confirms his place as the closest thing to an inheritor of Scott Walker's mantle
    as we're likely to get.  The orchestration is expert and economical, and Nigel Godrich, bumped from the
    producer's chair to the mixing board this time around, perfectly stacks the song's elements to make them
    sound absolutely huge.  Hannon's tenor is commanding, and he spins an incredible melody as he runs through
    a series of tributes to 20th century icons whose lives ended prematurely, from French actress Jean Seberg
    to Laika, the first dog in space.</p><p>
    ""Absent Friends"" is just one of several songs on <i>Absent Friends</i> that rank among The Divine Comedy's
    finest.  ""Come Home Billy Bird"" no doubt has autobiographical implications relating to touring with a band,
    but Hannon puts them onto a business traveler, whose harried, hungover ordeal at the airport prompts him to
    give it all up.  Hannon captures the blur of international travel with a sticky, hurried melody and hilariously
    poignant lyrics regarding drinking games with Belgian business partners, cab rides that are more tortoise
    than hare, and inadequate seating.</p><p>
    Elsewhere, Hannon is at his most lovesick, as he intones over dizzying strings on ""Sticks &amp; Stones"": ""You
    and I go together like the molar and the drill/ Flesh is weak but darling we know/ That the ego's weaker
    still.""  But thematically, there's little that competes with ""The Happy Goth"", a song that moves effortlessly
    between Latin-tinged passages, Brill Building pop explosions, and an insidiously catchy minor-key chorus.
    The song essentially consists of Hannon telling parents not to get too worked up about all the time their
    teenage daughter is spending alone in her room, but the way he couches it in out-of-touch terms that parents
    might understand (he calls her boots ""Doctor Martens"") makes it both humorous and strangely sympathetic to
    the parents' concerns.</p><p>
    There's an oddly American perspective to ""The Freedom Road"", a hushed trucker's song that bobs along on a
    throbbing bassline, perhaps a testament to Hannon's extended cross-continent tours of North America, while
    closer ""Charmed Life"" is a sweet message to his daughter, as well as a very unsongwriterly admission that
    life hasn't actually been so bad after all.  Hannon does slip a bit on ""Leaving Today"" and ""The Wreck of
    the Beautiful"", two dirges that feel labored-- he's always insisted on having one or two of these songs on
    each of his records, and they inevitably kill the momentum, though ""Leaving Today"" does thankfully avoid
    the morbid existentialism of so many of his slowest songs.</p><p>
    So after years of Hannon the Bookworm, Hannon the Lover, Hannon the Romantic, and Hannon the Humorist, we
    now have Hannon the Dad, and it runs out that he was a little bit of each all along-- he had just never
    found a way to put all of his tendencies in the same place at once.  <i>Absent Friends</i> isn't my favorite
    Divine Comedy record (<i>Fin de Siecle</i>, actually), but it is an excellent record, and one that seems
    more likely to appeal to non-fans than his more ostentatious outings.</p></div>"|2342.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2342-absent-friends/|7.8|Joe Tangari

    them for the internet era; their Dirtnap debut is an unabashed encomium (one might even say ""parody,"" were
    it not such an obvious labor of love) to a new-wave now old enough for mid-life crises and lower back pain.
    It's a hi-fi facsimile: the black and white grid of faces and neon-pink cursive that mark the album's cover
    hark back to the ""garish is good"" aesthetic of the late 70s/early 80s-- only to be outdone by the back cover,
    which boasts sunglasses, black ties, sleeveless dress shirts, and everyone gazing into the middle distance
    toward, presumably, The Future, where everything occurs against a <em>Tron</em>-like backdrop; where Max
    Headroom is George Bush to Spuds McKenzie's Dick Cheney; where Belinda Carlisle toils in obscurity while
    Gary Numan's Tubeway Army rake in major moon-bucks.  Inside, there's a picture of The Girls <em>applying
    their eyeliner in a mirror</em>.  Are you feeling me yet?  What I'm saying is, they ain't fuckin' around.</p><p>
    
    But this is no fishnet-hawking electroclash fashionista rock; besides having more sexxx appeal than both
    Coreys combined, The Girls've got chops like Ralph Macchio.  Those of you who know The Cars and The Voidoids
    can guess what you're in for; for you young'uns, I'll say this: The Girls sound kind of like Stellastarr*
    (I mean that in a nice way), yet hew more closely to new-wave roots than the more indie rocking Stellas,
    viz. punchy simplicity over grandiose anthem rock.</p><p>
    
    Vocally: foppish and fey, staccato yelps and hiccups, words padded with more syllables than anything that
    isn't a British manor has the right to contain (example: ""stereo"" inevitably becomes ""ster-e-ah-e-ah-e-o"").
    Lyrically: classic Information Age gobbledygook, designed less to convey information about the modern world
    than to describe its accumulation of surface and signal via verses that rely more on allusive phonetic
    similarity than actual narrative (example: on ""She's Hysterical"": ""Schematics, schematics/ Mechanical
    reaction/ Schematics, schematics/ You're in love with your reflection/ Oh no, she's gonna blow!"").
    Guitars: sleek and buzzing, all sculpted slides and reedy fuzz chords.  Rhythm section: crisp and spare,
    skeletal-- witness the analog man striving toward the pristine precision of the drum machine.  (And of
    course) Synths: and plenty of them, clean and lambent melodic lines fresh from the can, clarion call for
    the UFO set, gloriously artificial bubbles glowing like fluorescents.</p><p>
    
    I'd be remiss to not mention ""Dope Disguised as Nuns"".  It's about... okay, remember that <em>Saturday Night
    Live</em> commercial parody about monkeys that clean your bathroom?  Where the monkey writes, ""Monkey hate
    clean"" on the bathroom mirror with lipstick?  That was funny, right?  It seems The Girls agree: The song
    seems, in all seriousness, to be <i>about that sketch</i>.  I'm still confused.  I'm not going to insult
    your intelligence with some dubious tie-in to the rest of The Girls' oeuvre-- I mean, that skit isn't even
    from the right era of <em>SNL</em>.</p></div>"|3639.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3639-the-girls/|7.0|Brian Howe

    David Byrne, Amon Tobin and other Brazilian musicians like Caetano Veloso and Antonio Carlos Jobim.  Her
    impressive connections to the heart of modern Brazilian pop might suggest her own music should follow
    in a direction akin to her father's seminal bossa nova or the tropicalia popularized by Veloso in the
    70s.  To her credit, Gilberto has usually opted for a more modern approach, incorporating electronics and
    sly IDM touches into her music, especially notable on her pairing with former Deee-Lite DJ Towa Tei on the
    1995 track ""Technova (La Em Copacabana)"".</p><p>
    Along these lines, <i>Bebel Gilberto</i> isn't so much a continuation of the singer's esteemed musical lineage
    as a consistently pleasant affair reminiscent of similarly warm efforts by Björk.  Its melodies float atop
    bossa-tinged arrangements unobtrusively, as if the songs weren't necessarily meant to catch your ear so much
    as caress your cheek.  There are subtle electronic flourishes throughout (courtesy of frequent Björk producers
    Marius DeVries and Guy Sigsworth)-- though nothing as distinctive as Amon Tobin's work on Gilberto's 2000
    solo debut <i>Tanto Tempo</i>-- and the delicate strings conducted by another Björk-collaborator Gavyn Wright
    betray the disc's affiliations with easy listening music.  Of course, this hardly precludes enjoying the
    best moments-- after all, congeniality isn't a crime.</p><p>
    ""Simplesmente"" (""Simply"") takes a facile, but alluring chord progression that allows Gilberto to coo in
    English and Brazilian, using melodies that don't veer beyond her modest range, yet never seeming meandering
    or repetitive.  Her voice is eerily reminiscent of Saint Etienne's Sarah Cracknell, and this song could
    have appeared on any of that group's albums from <i>Good Humour</i> onwards.  Likewise, the midtempo,
    lightly funky ""Cada Beijo"" (""Each Kiss"") sounds like an outtake from Björk's <i>Homogenic</i>, right down
    to its mysterious textures of bells, strings and flutes.  Gilberto is hardly as distinctive a vocalist as
    the Icelandic diva, but in a way, that makes her music less convoluted.  When her songs stick to her
    strengths (easy, flowing melodies and ability to use her voice as ambient counterpoint, gliding in the
    background of her arrangements), they can be richly rewarding, even moving.</p><p>
    Still, Gilberto has a tendency to run her strengths into the ground on occasion.  ""All Around"" could have
    been an attractive update on her father's streamlined bossa nova at three minutes, but at almost five, it
    seems a tad indulgent.  ""Aganju"", like ""Cada Beijo"", again brings to mind <i>Homogenic</i>-era Björk, and
    even adds some spacey reverb to the singer's voice that lends the song a dreamy quality.  Yet, at a point,
    ""dreamy"" becomes ""tedious,"" especially during a lengthy vamp at the end.  <i>Bebel Gilberto</i> will not
    likely turn Gilberto's fans off, but often runs the risk of losing their attention.</p></div>"|3451.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3451-bebel-gilberto/|6.0|Dominique Leone
