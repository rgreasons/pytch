Broadrick</a>. This may seem like a strange thing to say about an early member of UK grindcore legends </span><span class=""st""><a href=""http://www.napalmdeath.org/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Napalm Death</a></span><span class=""st""> and a founding member of industrial metal powerhouse <a href=""http://www.godflesh.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Godflesh</a>, but Broadrick, especially in his various side projects with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/539-the-bug/"">Kevin Martin</a>, has long seemed impatient with orthodox metal, remolding it into jazz, dub, hip-hop, drum'n'bass, ambient music, power electronics, and whatever else strikes his fancy. It sounds like dilettantism, but it's really a constitutional preference for depth and groove instead of height and speed (at least since his frantic days in Napalm Death). Broadrick has taken metal to a lot of different places-- even, some detractors allege, beyond the pale, when he turned it into melodic shoegaze with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2238-jesu/"">Jesu</a>.</span></p>
<p>Those detractors should appreciate the darkness and brutality of <i><a href=""http://3by3music.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Posthuman</a></i>, released on electronic label 3by3 as JK Flesh, which is being touted as a return to Godflesh form. But the striking resemblance to fashionable bands like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5684-fuck-buttons/"">Fuck Buttons</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2469-liars/"">Liars</a>? They might appreciate that less. A cratered terrain of heavy basses, guitars, and electronics offset by nervous percussion, <i>Posthuman</i> suggests the smoldering aftermath of a war to extinction. But as metal as that sounds, there are plentiful moments when it's just one notch of irony or ingenuousness away from being <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27383-salem/"">Salem </a>or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30169-skrillex/"">Skrillex</a>, respectively. I have no idea whether or not Broadrick has a certain audience in mind for his music, but the record's sequencing feels like post-dubstep training wheels for wary metal heads.</p>
<p><i>Posthuman </i>opens with a learning curve: ""Knuckledragger"" is dominated by a lurking guitar line and infernally garbled vocals; it sounds like metal reduced to a fundamental and abstractly loop-based essence. ""Idle Hands"" is anchored by charred, concussive chords, but sneaks in scissoring cymbals and bubbling synthesizers that tease some of the dancefloor calamities to come. After the crushing noise rock of ""Punchdrunk"", the guitar subsides and the machines take over for a full-bore post-dubstep record, rife with sinuous melodies, swerving rhythms, and infallible electronic processes, with the Jesu-like live musicianship of ""Walkaway"" waiting at the very end like a palate cleanser, or a reward.</p>
<p>While I find the record almost uniformly engaging, it's this middle run of songs where <i>Posthuman </i>really comes to post-life. Broadrick is great at building monumental structures that shudder with the internal pressure of propeller whirs and volatile basses, staggering half-step drums and shuffled double-time hi-hats, juddering ring modulators and arpeggiators, and circularly slithering guitar phrases that breathe out unholy fumes. The run of songs from the intensely body-rocking ""Devoured"" to the runaway wobble of ""Earthmover"" is especially gripping; the title track is a machine that manufactures pure violence. <i>Posthuman</i> might not fully win back the crowd that Broadrick alienated with dreamy Jesu, but you can't deny that at least he's back to trying to blacken your eyes rather than put stars in them.</p></div>"|16592.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16592-posthuman/|7.6|Brian Howe

""Confessional"" music typically has an implied barrier between the singer and the audience-- at least some sense that there is mediation that keeps listeners aware that they are voyeurs-- but Chua's music, though clearly addressed to particular people, doesn't seem to draw that line. The result is music that is intense and obviously personal, but slightly disorienting: It's a bit like having a stranger tell you all their secrets while you try to keep track of the concrete details. </p>
<p><i>Oh Holy Molar</i>, Felix's second album, recalls the starkness and exaggerated intimacy of records by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/702-cat-power/"" target=""_blank"">Cat Power</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3037-scout-niblett/"" target=""_blank"">Scout Niblett</a>, but Chua is a far more reserved and poised individual. Whereas those singers can barely hold back their rawest emotion, Chua filters all that through pith and poetry. She delivers her most passive-aggressive lines with a stinging wit, but her funniest lines are self-deprecating, as when she mocks her own musical limitations in the opening track, ""The Bells"". </p>
<p>Chua is not an exceptionally versatile singer but her phrasing is exceptional, particularly in the way she invests lyrics that might seem like clunkers in print with several shades of emotional subtext when sung aloud. A good example can be found in the late album highlight ""Pretty Girls"", in which she tells the listener ""he said I had beautiful eyes and I said, 'yeah, but I'm dead inside.'"" Chua sings ""beautiful eyes"" as though she is simultaneously wincing and blushing at the suggestion, and her voices is clipped and high on ""dead inside,"" as if she's embarrassed to even utter this teenage goth sentiment. She's also good at singing lines with a blunt force. In the relatively uptempo ""Don't Look Back (It's Too Sad)"", she echoes the chorus of Björk's ""5 Years"", singing, ""you don't know what love is,"" but Chua is less exasperated and more resigned in her tone, ending the refrain with a curtly dismissive ""anyone who knows what love is would understand."" </p>
<p>Felix's music is skeletal in its minimalism, with only the fewest tones and beats required to convey structure and color. Chua is particularly enamored of the sound of her piano, leaving space in many of the songs for her chords and notes to ring out for as long as possible before moving to the next sound or utterance. This is just as true of Neil Turpin's percussion, which is so foregrounded that each beat feels highly considered and deliberate. The approach suits the band's most melodic and outwardly engaging tracks, like ""Oh Holy Molar"" and ""Oh Thee 73"", but it wears its welcome on slower, slighter cuts like ""Rites"", ""Little Biscuit"", and the two-parter ""Blessing"". Those songs are not failures, but they reveal the limits of Chua's voice and aesthetic.</p></div>"|16593.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16593-oh-holy-molar/|7.3|Matthew Perpetua

Even during the lightest moments of his three-decade career, Gira's bellow has been deep, dark, and direct, both an apt vehicle for his raw lines about spiritual tumult and human filth and a compelling accompaniment to Swans' stylized roil. But at least on <i>We Rose From Your Bed With the Sun in Our Head</i>, the new live double-disc set from his rebuilt old band, Gira sounds exhausted. That Pentecostal bark has weathered into a battered bleat. At the start of ""Eden Prison"", for instance, Gira's voice shakes and breaks, barely shaping the syllables into their proper forms. ""Within the walls of Eden Prison,"" he opens, struggling to climb over the relative quiet of drifting guitar and a twinkling vibraphone, ""there is a mark upon our stone."" <i>We Rose</i> comes culled from Swans' first tour in more than a decade, an intercalary period in which Gira introduced the world to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/288-devendra-banhart/"" target=""_blank"">Devendra Banhart</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/236-akronfamily/"" target=""_blank"">Akron/Family</a>, played solo acoustic shows, and led the comparatively mild-mannered <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/95-the-angels-of-light/"" target=""_blank"">Angels of Light</a>. Pushing 60, maybe he just doesn't have the requisite stamina to lead Swans, a band once so loud and dangerous they made fans vomit.</p>
<p>But sit tight. The 100 minutes of music that precede ""Eden Prison"" on <i>We Rose</i> make for an exhaustive listen, with 15-minute sprawls of suffocating noise, drums that suggest a fleet of fists to the face and loads of shouts about praising God, committing infanticide, and welcoming slavery. It's the kind of hyper-brutal album that requires an intermission or, at the very least, a long hard look at a plain white wall when its two hours have ended. Though <i>We Rose</i> pulls from gigs in Melbourne, Berlin, and New York City, this collection offers a mostly accurate recapitulation of the 102 sets that this iteration of Swans played since the 2010 release of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14651-my-father-will-guide-me-up-a-rope-to-the-sky/"" target=""_blank""><i>My Father Will Guide Me Up a Rope to the Sky</i></a>, the band's first album in 13 years. Loud, mean, and complicated, this six-piece is an articulate goliath, capable of drowning out Gira in waves before disappearing into pools of silence without warning. Each piece of this unit deserves mention: The finesse of Norman Westberg's guitar playing offers the perfect foil for Gira's general force. Christopher Pravdica's bass snaps as much as it throbs, while Christoph Hahn uses his double-lap steel guitar not as a country-music accent mark but as an origin of general abrasion. Drummer Phil Puleo and multi-instrumentalist Thor Harris often double the rhythm, giving that old Swans stomp bigger feet. This band is at once visceral and subtle, reverent with the source but relentless with the sound. During ""Sex, God, Sex"", Swans suggest the sound of a thousand whips lashing at once; during ""The Seer"", they shape feedback into geometric patterns that Sonic Youth and Sunn O))) alike might admire. </p>
<p>So back to Gira's apparent feebleness: Both times I saw Swans on this tour, they pounded harder than I could have remembered or imagined; Gira lead them through these live shows for two years, so of course he was tired. For one gapless, 30-minute expanse, Swans segue a new sheet-of-noise instrumental, ""The Seer"", into the barking-and-marching classic ""I Crawled"". Gira spends the last quarter of the track moaning, sighing, and doing whatever else he can to sound completely mad. The band lashes together one more time, more malevolent and urgent than before, Gira hollering like he's finally lost. When it's over, he verifies the drain: ""If I had a fucking knife, I'd cut my head off right now."" Somehow, Swans then manage to play a 12-minute version of ""Eden Prison"" that starts and finishes like a whisper but, at its middle, reaches an apogee of high-volume repetition and reward. It's a marvelous payoff of perseverance, a promise that, no, this band or its leader isn't done. </p>
<p>In January of 2010, when Gira announced that he was reforming Swans, he wrote a predictably didactic open letter that made his purpose with the band clear: ""After five Angels of Light albums, I needed a way to move FORWARD, in a new direction, and it just so happens that revivifying the idea of Swans is allowing me to do that... THIS IS NOT A REUNION. It's not some dumb-ass nostalgia act. It is not repeating the past."" Some will see this 10-song tracklist and bemoan the absence of old material; four of the tracks come from 2010's <i>My Father Will Guide Me Up a Rope to the Sky</i>, while two supposedly come from <i>The Seer</i>, the new Swans album that the first, very-limited edition of this package helped fund in a sort of de facto Kickstarter campaign. (""I decided to start touring Swans, and it's like mainlining heroin,"" Gira told me just before the tour started, prophesying the apparent addiction.) But there are plenty of other Swans live albums if you need to hear that old stuff, and Gira has long clung close to what's most recent, trying new sounds and new members and new modes with admittedly variable results. <i>We Rose</i> is a perfect void of nostalgia that comes at a moment when similar indie rock heroes have reunited to defile the corpses of early works for lump sums of cash. For the last two years, one of the world's most bellicose bands has paid respect to its legacy largely by leaving it alone and tried to expand it by testing its old limits. Here, they do just that, beating past successes with the purpose of the present and showing that-- reunion or no, 58-year-old frontman or no-- this is exactly the kind of forward-pointing roadmark Swans deserve. </p></div>"|16588.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16588-we-rose-from-your-bed-with-the-sun-in-our-head/|8.0|Grayson Currin

The truth is, this is one profoundly and proudly silly band. But absurdity is ultimately Cornershop's greatest virtue: They may have made their name in the mid-1990s with a heady, cosmopolitan concoction of psychedelia, old-school funk, and mantric Punjabi folk, but their music also makes room for <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds1bS_Wwphc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">1970s boogie-rock</a>, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SZzGPbg7pc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">cornball country</a>, and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnwUADCQqtU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">vocoderized robo-disco</a>. And in Tjinder Singh, the band possess an eminently witty wordsmith who can undercut big, insurmountable issues like globalization, racism, and cultural hegemony through droll character studies and wry satire-- and, in the process, generate some of the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTt42i8oQBQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">greatest</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds1bS_Wwphc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">song titles</a> in recent memory.</p>
<p>But since reemerging from an extended hiatus in 2009, the band have forsaken cut-and-paste pastiche in favor of holistic consistency: Comeback effort <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13813-judy-sucks-a-lemon-for-breakfast/"" target=""_blank""><i>Judy Sucks a Lemon for Breakfast</i></a> placed a premium on classic-rock accessibility, complete with a cover of Bob Dylan's ""The Mighty Quinn""; 2011's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15378-cornershop-and-the-double-o-groove-of/"" target=""_blank""><i>Cornershop and the Double 'O' Groove Of</i></a> applied the silken vocals of Punjabi singer Bubbley Kaur to a set of mellow-golden funk. <i>Urban Turban</i>, however, is a far more fragmented experience by its very design: six of its 12 tracks originally debuted over the past year through the band's online <a href=""http://www.cornershop.com/2011/05/the-singhles-club-brand-new-cornershop-track"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Singhles Club</a>, most of which saw the band backing up a mostly unknown, international cast of vocalists. Think of <i>Urban Turban</i> as a more modest, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/46404-flaming-lips-blood-vinyl-10-copies-2500-features-keha-erykah-badu-nick-cave-chris-martin-blood/"" target=""_blank"">less bloody</a>, but equally playful version of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16522-the-flaming-lips/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Flaming Lips and Heady Fwends</i></a>.</p>
<p>Cornershop do attempt to impose some structure on <i>Urban Turban</i>'s piecemeal tracklist by pegging the charming, interactive children's song ""What Did the Hippie Have In His Bag?"" (a ""Brimful of Asha"" for the pre-school set) as the opener and as a late-album reprise. These bookends account for Singh's lone lead-vocal appearances on the album, and what transpires in between hews closer to Singh and partner Ben Ayres' 1999 disco-funk diversion <i>Clinton</i> than any previous Cornershop album. But even with the revolving-door mic policy and ping-ponged stylistic shifts, Cornershop's irreverent approach to agit-pop is easy to detect: ""Who's Gonna Lite It Up?""-- featuring a hot and bothered performance from Parisian vocalist Izzy Lindqwister-- issues its riot-starting directive through a seductive, Betty Davis-worthy funk, and the band gives a buoyant, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wro3bqi4Eb8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Tighten Up""</a>-style soul workout the urban-blighting title of ""Concrete, Concrete"". Even the aforementioned ""Hippie"" leads its kiddie chorus to a rather dispiriting life lesson: ""Now that we've climbed the mountain/ The mountain will never seem the same again.""</p>
<p>One can't help but relate that line to Cornershop's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ELTXK-fgyM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">fleeting ascendancy to the Top of the Pops</a>, and how the experience only seemed to further entrench the band's contrarian qualities, resulting in exploratory side projects and an increasingly sporadic, career-suicidal release schedule. But as the third Cornershop release in four years on the band's own Ample Play imprint, <i>Urban Turban</i> feels especially emblematic of a band that's fully liberated itself from any commercial or audience expectations and shifted its experimental ethos into overdrive, bouning from Daft Punkian Franco-disco (""Non-Stop Radio"") to wonderfully wiggy Punjabi-sung sci-fi funk (""Inspector Bamba Singh's Lament"") to digital dub (""First Wog on the Moon"").</p>
<p>As to be expected from an album of one-off collaborations, some <i>Urban Turban</i> cuts struggle to stretch a basic idea into a fully realized song, like the annoyingly repetitious French-touch house of ""Solid Gold"" and the all-too aptly titled ""Milkin' It"", an endless stream of shout outs to old-school MCs-- courtesy of guest In the Light of Aquarius-- that sounds like some murky throwaway track from the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13319-ill-communication-deluxe-edition/"" target=""_blank""><i>Ill Communication</i></a> sessions. (Though this Canadian reviewer is grateful for the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzull7scV2Y"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Maestro Fresh Wes</a> name-drop.) But then there are songs you wish they'd ride out forever, like the lovely ""Something Makes You Feel Like"", featuring a restless, blearly-eyed vocal turn by French singer Soko that's offset by an easy-going ""Sweet Jane"" groove; it serves as a reminder that, for all their genre-blurring, pan-cultural cred, Cornershop can also be an excellent Velvet Underground cover band. ""Something makes you feel like/ The grass is greener on the other side,"" Soko sings, before adding, ""but there is no other side."" Of course, that's just Cornershop being cheeky again: 15 years on from their one and only pop hit, and three years into a remarkably prolific second phase, Cornershop are clearly enjoying life on the other side.</p></div>"|16589.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16589-cornershop/|7.0|Stuart Berman

And yet, a gritted combination of power chords and a major-key melody swaddled in guitar fuzz never fails to trigger the same bundle of associations: This is Underdog Music, conceived in a ramshackle garage in a city with no other social options, recorded on the cheap, and above all else, <i>fun, </i>a celebration of spirit trumping skill. The first of those two are likely the case for PS I Love You, who hail from the college town of Kingston, Ontario, and who don't sound like they've followed up 2010's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14709-meet-me-at-the-muster-station/"" target=""_blank""><i>Meet Me at the Muster Station </i></a>with a much larger budget. Don't let the commonality of the words in <i>Death Dreams</i>' title-- these are two of rock's most enduring subjects-- mislead you:<i> Death Dreams</i> might sound beer-soaked, but it's drowning its sorrows with very loud and brash songs about very small and internal breakdowns.</p>
<p>Though it implies a deep interest in the metaphysically morbid, most of <i>Death Dreams</i>' lyrics concern the everyday problems of being alive-- financial insecurity, social anxiety, a longing for the immediate past. It's the sort of thing endemic to truly being on your own for the first time, and in PS I Love You's case, it's fairly easy to read into their particular post-grad depression as a band: They spent a couple of years gutting it out in Canada's competitive indie rock scene, and the positive reception of <i>Muster Station </i>made touring outside of their local surroundings feasible and necessary, though likely not entirely lucrative. Over the rangy ""Future Dontcare"", Paul Saulnier sounds about as resigned as his Frank Black squawk will allow him, admitting, ""I wish this summer was like last summer/ Love doesn't care about the future."" More to the point is ""All I ever wanted/ Is more than I ever had,"" a line repeated in three separate tracks: here, and elsewhere, what Saulnier claims to have had sounds frighteningly hollow.</p>
<p>Much of <i>Death Dreams </i>is addressed to a ""you"" likely too far in the rearview to respond to Saulnier's heart-rending confessions-- on ""Saskatoon"", he confides ""you pulled out your hammer and broke open my chest,"" likely knowing it's a one-sided conversation. And though ""Sentimental Dishes"" rages through a seemingly joyful chorus repeatedly yelling ""I don't wanna do the dishes!/ You don't wanna do the dishes!,"" it's not a petulant brat's protest against parental authority. The problem with the tableware (and later, secrets) is that ""you got to keep them... for the rest of your life,"" becoming something like a ""no wire hangers!"" situation where a mundane domestic problem becomes a metaphor triggering an epic meltdown.</p>
<p>But the parts of <i>Death Dreams </i>that really sting are the ones that long for comforts of home and stability that ""Sentimental Dishes"" implies are unachievable. Amidst all the churning drums and distortion, it's all too easy to miss how <i>Death Dreams </i>is amongst the most thoroughly dejected albums you'll hear in 2012: ""Don't Go"" edges perilously close to emo freefall (""This is the worst week of my life!""), before Salunier pulls back with a startling admission of how he got there: ""Sleeping in the van with a knife in my hand.../ In one day I lost all I ever loved."" His mantra of ""your pretty, pretty city"" during ""Toronto"" is one seemingly born of awe and fear, as Saulnier goes out for pancakes, writes in his diary, and reads comic books alone at 6 a.m. only to think someone's constantly following him. That PS I Love You manage to give <i>Death Dreams </i>a real sense of perspective even with such an economy of words is crucial. Outside of the occasional flurry-fingered tapping solo that hints at otherwise untapped technical proficiency, the musical values here-- essentially, indie when it felt equally informed by punk and classic rock-- are so familiar that contorting one's self to describe it anew is ridiculously difficult and not even that helpful. You either want a cheeseburger or you don't.</p>
<p>But even comfort food's gotta deliver, and particularly after the second ""Death Dreams"" interlude, PS I Love You mire tentatively between jams and songcraft-- there's some truly ingratiating melodies scattered throughout the first half, and Saulnier's lyrics have substance and weight, but too often they fail to coincide simultaneously. There's also the matter of the unflattering, flabby production that smothers pretty much every edge and hook and raises the question of how a strict guitar/drums duo somehow manages to be so difficult to record.  Perhaps it's a conscious decision, to make Saulnier's yelping against a hovering layer of insulation make the struggles of the lyrics more pronounced and viscerally real. But at its worst, it just sounds like he's being tickle tortured.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it's all too tempting to extrapolate the pervasive crisis of confidence that runs throughout <i>Death Dreams </i>as a symptom of PS I Love You's own context. <i>Muster Station </i>remains a perfectly enjoyable record that in retrospect was likely the beneficiary of being one of the few doing this sort of thing well at the time. And <i>Death Dreams </i>might be equally strong, but its inability to step things up can come off like a retreat in light of how much tuneful, wooly garage rock has come out since. Not to mention that while most groups suffer comparatively to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27595-japandroids/"" target=""_blank"">Japandroids</a>, being the <i>other</i> Canadian fuzz-rock duo singing about being in a band and the accompanying generational malaise isn't going to do you many favors in 2012. <i>Death Dreams </i>has its charms, but it begs the question of how much you can be excited about an underdog amongst underdogs.</p></div>"|16584.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16584-ps-i-love-you-death-dreams/|6.4|Ian Cohen

It's understandable: The <i>Walden</i>-esque tale of Justin Vernon's isolation while recording <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10709-for-emma-forever-ago/"" target=""_blank""><i>For Emma, Forever Ago</i></a> is now the stuff of legend, but in the years since he's assembled a legion of quietly formidable collaborators who have helped flesh out the Bon Iver sound. Among them is former music student and fellow Wisconsinite Sean Carey. After first hearing <i>For Emma </i> on Myspace in 2007, legend has it that Carey spent two weeks in his bedroom figuring out all the songs' percussion parts and harmonies. Booked as the opener for one of Vernon's early Bon Iver shows, Carey sang some <i>Emma</i> songs backstage and Vernon asked him to join the band that night. While this story doesn't exactly have the mysterious allure of Vernon's whole cabin-in-the-woods creation myth, it does pretty accurately capture Carey's role in the band: the talented yet dutiful behind-the-scenes guy with an ear for deconstructing arrangements.</p>
<p>Carey's first solo offering, the ambient-inspired folk of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14569-all-we-grow/"" target=""_blank""><i>All We Grow</i></a>, was a muted rustle of a record, and what it lacked in the strong vocal and storytelling elements of Bon Iver's music it made up for in elegantly realized arrangements and a warmed-breeze atmosphere. But if <i>All We Grow</i> had the benevolent glow of a Wisconsin sunset, Carey's new EP, <i>Hoyas</i>, sounds like a soundtrack for an ice-slicked, insomniac winter drive. Blending mumbled folk and bleary-eyed blips, lead-off track ""Two Angles"" sounds like the Postal Service might have if Jimmy Tamborello's tapes had gotten lost in the mail and accidentally ended up on Phil Elverum's doorstep. Muffled by a fog of gently distorted guitar chords, pulsating synths, and horns that sound so distant it's like they were plucked from somebody else's dream, Carey's voice never raises above a whisper.</p>
<p>Vocals and lyrics are usually the least compelling elements of Carey's music. The guy's definitely not a bad singer, he's just not a terribly distinct one, and on <i>Hoyas</i>, he proffers an interesting-- if kind of low-hanging-- solution to this problem: How about some Auto-Tune? All of the tracks except for ""Two Angels"" feature the sort of vocals that can't help but recall the Bon Iver's Kanye-famous a cappella track ""The Woods"". Carey's Auto-Tuned vocals don't serve the emotional gut-punch that Vernon's do, but his monotone delivery on the tracks ""Inspir"" and ""Avalanche"" show that stirring catharsis isn't exactly his aim. Instead, <i>Hoyas</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> expresses a fascination with the relationships between the synthetic and organic, between distance and intimacy, and between folk tradition and digital vocabulary. But the steely elegy of ""Inspir"" shows that across all of these divides, Carey's not interested in taking sides, instead mapping the terrain where they all converge.</span></p>
<p>That Carey's day job is playing in such an acclaimed, frequently be-memed band as Bon Iver is, of course, a mixed blessing. On the one hand, it will prove difficult for him to shed the ""guy from Justin Vernon's backing band"" tag should he ever choose to do something radically different, but for now, because Carey's music never strays far from that familiar neck of the woods, it means he's got a built-in fanbase. Carey might be a lackluster frontman, but he's an expert vibesman-- and maybe Vernon's infamous squirminess to his own acclaim has shown Carey that it's not a terrible position to be in; it's probably no great disappointment to Carey that he's unlikely to earn any solo Grammys or spawn any <a href=""http://boniverotica.tumblr.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span style=""color: #e53024; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;"">joke Tumblrs</span></a> any time soon. <i>Hoyas </i> is at its best when it sounds like Carey's disappearing.</p></div>"|16587.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16587-s-carey-hoyas-ep/|7.0|Lindsay Zoladz

The current state of bass music seems practically engineered to tackle that particular challenge, with some corners of the scene pushing back against superclub maximalism by dicking with the parameters of just what maximalism really is. <a href=""http://lazersword.net/blog/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lazer Sword</a>, the production pairing of Lando Kal and Low Limit, emerged with a Yay Area take on hip-hop-distilled electro that thoroughly engulfed everything they could wrap their hands around. Their 2010 self-titled debut was a tribute to all things blindingly outsized and glossy in bass music, pastel neon reflected on blinding chrome. And once they got all that out of their system, they decamped for new cities in different continents (Lando to Berlin; Low Limit to L.A.) and started siphoning up a bunch of new styles in the process.</p>
<p>With <i>Memory</i>, their first album on the similarly polyglot-minded Modeselektor's <a href=""http://www.monkeytownrecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Monkeytown</a> label, they've further developed their tendency to put together one subgenre's tracks by another one's rules. It's apparent they've been picking up all the right influences to streamline their sound, too. There're rhythms that flirt with footwork and Euro-juke. The once-obvious 1980s signifiers have been chronologically muddied with a few nods to subsequent eras in techno, house, and UK funky. And they've swapped out their local-niche-appeal West Coast underground rap collaborations for a wider emphasis on manipulated vocal samples, integrated in ways that recall everything from Todd Edwards' spliced-up house divas to Roger Troutman's talkbox.</p>
<p>Lazer Sword pool those inspirations into tracks that throw double-reverse switches into the relationships between genres, blurring lines between influence and acolyte. The rhythm of ""Missed a Spot"" seems half a step between tilting one definitive way or another between footwork and the more ambient, Photek-ish end of drum'n'bass, then pulls tension out of the drum track's slow merging with a burbling acid-house riff. ""CHSEN"", a marquee teamup with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2630-machine-drum/"" target=""_blank"">Machinedrum</a>, hints at the tarantula-stepping juke/jungle that made <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15621-rooms/"" target=""_blank"">Room(s)</a></i> one of last year's most bracing albums, but the rhythms are simmered down to the point where it sounds more like a companion piece to the refined ghostliness of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16292-kindred/"" target=""_blank""><i>Kindred</i></a>-mode <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4806-burial/"" target=""_blank"">Burial</a>. ""Sounds Sane"" turns vintage techno into an odd recursive conversation with contemporary electro-- or maybe it's the techno element that's contemporary and the electro that's a throwback. Figuring out how they're dealing with the when does seem beside the point when it's more crucial to hear how they're messing with the what.</p>
<p>Most of all, they've developed the approach of making high-energy tracks with subdued and subtle components-- beats that move with grace instead of brute force. Whether the tracks tweak footwork (""Toldyall""), techno (""Point of Return""), or some funk-damaged corruption of microhouse (Jimmy Edgar collaboration ""Let's Work""), they roll over rhythms that are intricate, often to the point of frenetic, while still letting plenty of air push through in heavily echoing negative space. Isolating the elements-- dripping percussive bass, brittle snares, tissue-paper synthesizer ambiance-- reveals a force generated more from a nuanced layering of understated elements than any big cranked-to-11 instrumentation. It's a far cry from the place they were at a couple of years ago, but they've found a good balance between headspace and footspace.</p></div>"|16590.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16590-lazer-sword-memory/|7.5|Nate Patrin

The year was 1992, and <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/409-blur/"" target=""_blank"">Blur</a> were touring the U.S. in support of their underperforming debut, <i>Leisure</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">, a relatively tepid guitar-pop record of vague lyrics and the occasional explosive hook. Missing his homeland and repulsed by the self-serious, omnipresent grunge sound, he returned to England two months later with the intention of making music that was proudly, flagrantly British. It proved to be a good look for the band: with the release of their next two albums, the solid </span><i>Modern Life is Rubbish</i> in 1993 and the sparkling <i>Parklife </i> in 1994, Blur transformed their image from late-era Madchester tag-alongs to pop's most incisive inquisitors of the British way of life. This was in great part thanks to Albarn's character-driven lyrics: <i>Rubbish</i>'s no-name 20th-Century Boy and 20th-Century Girl and <i>Parklife</i>'s Tracy Jacks (a sad sack civil servant who cracks one Tuesday morning and bulldozes his own house) warned of what could happen without the promise of tomorrows, the thrill of spontaneity, and a belief in a rather optimistic strain of anarchy it was not off base to call magic.</p>
<p>Two decades later, Albarn is exploring the idea of Britshness through a character and a form that's decidedly less modern. A departure from his most recent work with <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/1767-gorillaz/"" target=""_blank"">Gorillaz</a> and the afro-inspired <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30229-rocketjuice-and-the-moon/"" target=""_blank"">Rocket Juice &amp; the Moon</a>, <i>Dr Dee</i> is the stately, melancholy soundtrack to the opera Albarn wrote for theater director Rufus Norris. <i>Dr Dee</i> had a brief preliminary run in Manchester last year and will run again during the Cultural Olympiad this summer, but in the meantime Albarn-- never one for a second of downtime-- holed up with the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra and recorded the tracks for what's being nominally presented as a solo album.</p>
<p>As far as British anti-heroes go, John Dee is a good deal more spectacular and complex than, say, Tracy Jacks. Dee was a brilliant, controversial visionary of the Elizabethan era, a gifted mathematician with an unerring belief in magic. Throughout his long life he fell in and out of favor with the court; at one point during Mary's reign he was arrested for charting the queen's horoscopes, while three years later Queen Elizabeth appointed him her scientific advisor and asked him to choose her coronation date based on her star chart. A firm believer in the occult who late in his life made attempts to communicate with angels, Dee's life was a combination of prestige, failure, and misunderstandings, and the tone of <i>Dr Dee </i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">makes it clear that Albarn finds luxuriant depths of melancholy in his character. On the lush, downcast ""The Moon Exalted"", he is accompanied by the porcupine-bristle of a harpsicord as he sings, ""It's a powerful thing/ The morning I awoke to find you'd gone/ The moon was rising higher than the sun."" In recent years, Albarn's retired the bratty stacatto that characterized his Britpop hits, and his voice has taken on this wonderfully droopy, lead-balloon quality. With nary an upbeat moment over the soundtrack's 50-minute run, <i>Dr Dee</i> makes use of this stylistic evolution; it's without a doubt the biggest bummer of a record he's made since <i>13</i>.</span></p>
<p>Like the large majority of <i>Dr Dee </i> listeners, I have not seen the opera. It garnered pretty good reviews over its first run, but the most common criticism seemed to be that it was a tad impenetrable; viewers who went expecting a clear, linear narrative found Albarn's collection of impressionistic tableaus hard to follow. And if those were the complaints of people who actually <i>had</i> a visual element to guide them, you can imagine that listening blindly to the soundtrack is not exactly a cake walk, comprehension-wise. Still, there's some enjoyment in getting lost in Albarn's gloomy melodies and the occasional immersive scene (the fluttering voices of ""Coronation"" in particular), if you are content to let go your hopes of any kind of narrative mastery. To me, oddly enough, the closest pop analog to <i>Dr Dee</i> is a (much more sedate) Frog Eyes record-- the frenzied, King Lear-inspired pantomime <i>Paul's Tomb: A Triumph</i> is never entirely subsumed by the fact that I have no idea what the hell is going on. I could say the same for most of <i>Dr Dee</i>.</p>
<p>But therein lies the problem: Presented apart from its visual component, what is the <i>Dr Dee</i> soundtrack, exactly? There are pop elements to Albarn's compositions here, but they won't be quite enough to hold the attention spans of his less patient fans. And on the other side of the coin, Albarn's pop-star background keeps <i>Dr Dee</i> from scaling more operatic heights. In the end, the <i>Dr Dee</i> soundtrack is a deeply felt but difficult to love entry into Albarn's entirely singular discography. A Renaissance man to a point that occasionally confounds his less adventurous listeners, it should be no great mystery why Albarn finds Dee-- who was, after all, the man who coined the term ""Britannia"" in the first place-- a worthy subject.</p></div>"|16585.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16585-damon-albarn-dr-dee/|6.7|Lindsay Zoladz

Back in 2010, the UK producer who works as <a href=""http://soundcloud.com/girlunit"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Girl Unit</a> followed up ""IRL"", his debut single for the hip cross-continental poly-dance label Night Slugs, with an absolutely massive slab of electronic mania in the form of <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12026-wut/"" target=""_blank"">""Wut""</a>. Simultaneously frantic and spacious, with the kind of vocal hook that both burns itself into your brain and resists simple replication, ""Wut"" was six-and-a-half minutes of airhorn-slathered awesomeness that made the melodic tang of purple sound positively black by comparison. It was the type of single that didn't so much top year-end lists as it did absolutely wreck anything that came close to approaching its perch.</p>
<p>The single sounds as relevant now as it did in 2010, its all-everything-now sonic swarm and nods to Southern hip-hop rhythmic textures found in contemporary maximalist producers, from Araabmuzik to Rustie. It doesn't seem like a stretch to say that, in another five years, either everything or nothing will sound like ""Wut"". The official release was backed by two accompanying cuts of <a href=""http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Bayhem"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bayhem</a>, ""Every Time"" and ""Showstoppa"", both of which sounded like <a href=""http://twistedmetal.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Twisted Metal</i></a> elevated into real-life status, with gnarled car crashes and warehouse explosions tornadoing through speaker systems. The only thing more surprising than all of the carnage Gamble was capable of creating was the silence that followed, as he essentially took from then until now as a vacation, rather than capitalize on the considerable momentum that the ""Wut"" single rewarded him with.</p>
<p>One year and seven months after ""Wut""'s release, Gamble's back with a new EP for Night Slugs, <i>Club Rez</i>, and with its arrival comes the inevitable question: Can he make lightning strike twice? The answer's complicated, since there really isn't one to be found. If Gamble's aware of the deserved hyperbole that his previous work's been awarded, he certainly isn't interested in showing his hand; neither a disappointment nor a promise delivered, <i>Club Rez</i> finds him largely abandoning the chaos of his previous releases and seeking out different sonic territory that's unfamiliar to both the Girl Unit project and Night Slugs' general oeuvre. Some might feel let down that there's nothing here that's as singular or sonically comparable as anything on his previous EP, but once the shock wears off, there's plenty to sink your teeth into regardless, especially if you have a solid pair of headphones to tap into the at-times lush landscapes Gamble's constructed here.</p>
<p><i>Club Rez</i> certainly sounds like a new statement of purpose for Gamble, as he showcases his previously untapped melodic ability by presenting hooks that stand sturdily when not propped up within an ace DJ set. His affinity for color is largely in full form here, as evidenced by the techno-fused French Touch flourishes of ""Ensemble (Club Mix)"" and the distant screaming flares of ""Rezday""; elsewhere, he proves more than adept at evoking atmosphere, from the <i>48 Hours</i> shake of ""Plaza"" to the cavernous dance-mecca trance of the title track.</p>
<p>The EP's most surprising moment arrives in the form of ""Double Take"", which starts off as a drip-drop slice of steam-machinery beat math that characterized label mate Jam City's early NS singles, before blooming into the type of gorgeous, slow-riding R&amp;B hook that nearly deserves separate designation from the track it's attached to. Given his documented proclivity for aural insanity, the amount of restraint that Gamble shows here is more than impressive and certainly speaks to the great promise his talent possesses. He manages to satiate his obsession for thousand-detail soundscaping while creating pieces that walk the line of sensory overload, never overwhelming but always blurring the edges.</p>
<p><i>Club Rez</i> is something of a marking point for Night Slugs as a label, too. Many of the imprint's releases take on a blocky, club-functional sonic guise; <i>Club Rez</i>, on the other hand, not only roosts in the Night Slugs catalog's small club of relatively straightforward releases-- ""Wut"", L-Vis 1990's <i>Forever You</i> EP, Julio Bashmore and Hyetal's collaboration as Velour, <i>The Velvet Collection</i>-- but also stands out as one of the label's most accessible releases to date. Perhaps that's why the EP falters when Gamble turns out productions that are more traditionally Slugs-y, like the pounding metal intensity of ""Cake Boss"" or the skittering bass drops of the title track.</p>
<p>About ""Club Rez"": the single proper has been floating around for a while previous to this EP's release, most notably making an appearance near the end of label co-boss L-Vis 1990's BBC Essential Mix earlier this year. Hearing it in its shortened form, I hoped that there would be some sort of Big Release leading up to the track's handstamped trance motif, the kind of logical progression that such a melodic buildup usually demands. Perhaps the most disappointing thing about ""Club Rez"" is that there is no such release, but then Gamble clearly enjoys playing The Waiting Game, even if there are no winners in the end. Let this be an open plea, then, that we don't have to wait so long to hear from him again, if only because the weight of expectations can crush even the most solid follow-ups.</p></div>"|16580.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16580-club-rez-ep/|7.5|Larry Fitzmaurice

And yet, for all its meat-grinder stereotypes, UK's ""major indie"" realm has produced Foals, Friendly Fires, the Horrors, Bombay Bicycle Club, and <a href=""http://www.thecribs.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Cribs</a> as proof that you don't have to be a Hall of Famer to follow a bungled debut with a bizarre and interesting career arc these days. In 2004, the Cribs were teens cashing in on the post-Franz Ferdinand, post-post-Strokes gold rush; since then, Johnny Marr joined and then quit their band, Lee Ranaldo spit some spoken word on their third album<i>, </i>and Alex Kapranos, Nick Launay, and Edwyn Collins can all list ""the Cribs"" in their production credits. If the terms ""Louis XIV"" or ""the Dead 60s"" mean anything to you, you'll admit that's a pretty good return on an investment all things considered. </p>
<p>On their fifth LP, the group's plural-noun band name is about the only remnant of the Cribs mid-2000s roots: <i>In the Belly of the Brazen Bull </i>goes full-blown Buzz Bin. Hey, sometimes Brits have a good track record with this kind of thing: Yuck made one of 2011's strongest debuts and Blur decided on <i>their</i> fifth album they wanted to be Pavement, too. Of course, the Cribs aren't sensitive, artsy souls like those two and it actually works to the advantage of <i>Belly</i>; perhaps it's the result of spending their adult lives on a major's dime, but this record is fueled by a naïve belief that radio hits are achievable and can be strong-armed.</p>
<p>Otherwise, how do you explain having both Dave Fridmann <i>and </i>Steve Albini on production, when anyone who's heard both <i>The Soft Bulletin </i>and <i>Rid of Me </i>knows that only makes sense as some sort of buddy cop stunt casting? Their commitment to creating an accurate period piece is really something else, though. One of the tracks recorded by Albini is called ""Chi-Town"", which explicitly namedrops Logan Square while implicitly recalling the badly missed alt torchbearers Oxford Collapse. The guitars on ""Glitters Like Gold"" have edges, but they're frayed and distorted, not angular and finicky. Ryan Jarman still sings in a head voice, but it's projected from his palate rather than his nasal cavity and even amidst the tricked-out, ultra-distorted production of ""Glitters Like Gold"" and ""Confident Man"", he sounds a heck of a lot like tourmate Ben Gibbard. The half-time, xylophone-tinkling bridge of ""Jaded Youth"" is pretty much a verbatim quote from Weezer's ""The Good Life"". Look, the Cribs are still the same guys who <a href=""http://www.nme.com/news/glastonbury/29197"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">told Glastonbury that British indie was a bigger problem than global warming</a>-- this was probably in the works longer than any of us realize. </p>
<p>Fortunately, the Cribs write better hooks than C-level revivalists like Tribes, and if guitar-based music is still your source of shameless pop, you'll probably enjoy <i>In the Belly </i>more than most records that actually aspire for art. Plus, the titles! They thought of everything! ""Come on, Be a No-One"" isn't much of a song so much as two and a half minutes of killing time between a ridiculous chorus confidently flopping itself down at the altar of MTV; it hardly matters that the verses don't really go anywhere since you could drag a beached whale with that hook. ""Jaded Youth"" similarly offers a pitch-perfect slacker sentiment (""If I went back to school?/ Would I feel cool?"") within an insistent melody perfect for the drive-time commute after half-assing it at the office. Likewise, the highly unbalanced dynamics of ""Uptight"" and ""Anna"" give Jarman the necessary boost to <i>just miss </i>the big high note that every chorus inevitably leads to. None of it's new, but how many consistently good songs have to be strung together before you entertain the idea that a record might actually be <i>great</i>?</p>
<p>It's a moot point since the Cribs undermine themselves by unintentionally sticking to the format of so many of the 90s records it recalls. Without much an idea of where the Cribs themselves personally fit into all of this, when the tempos die down and the hooks start to slacken, without the $17 investment in a physical copy, it's a lot tougher to find a reason to give Side B the attention the Cribs might expect out of you. After the ruthless efficiency of ""Chi-Town"", they start getting fidgety with their effects pedals (""Back to the Bolthole"") and ""I Should Have Helped"" is pretty much the least memorable song on <i>In the Belly </i>because it's the only one with an acoustic guitar. Even if its 14 tracks only clock in at around 40 minutes, it's pretty easy to feel like this mercurial band got what they wanted out of the deal in the first 30.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the strength of ""Glitters Like Gold"" and ""Come on, Be a No-One"" overrule any sort of questions as to whether <i>Belly </i>is part of some sort of trajectory, a passing fancy, a dead end, or any kind of indication as to whether even the Cribs think they're capable of greatness.  Odds are, the Cribs will be on something different by their next album and they'll make a couple of hot songs that'll fit onto a Greatest Hits that's nicely taking shape. Hey, you can't make one of those without being a ""career artist,"" right?</p></div>"|16567.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16567-the-cribs-in-the-belly-of-the-brazen-bull/|7.3|Ian Cohen

Its two main influences-- frostbitten Scandinavian black metal and rustic U.S. roots music-- should not combine, let alone gracefully. One is theatrical and expressionistic in its expression of nihilistic rage, almost claustrophobic in its pure form. The other is stripped-down and attempts to get at some ideal of emotional honesty, a sound that's loose and expansive in its evocation of American distances.</p>
<p>And yet <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30180-horseback/"" target=""_blank"">Horseback</a> managed to intuit some kinship between them. (They also throw in a dose of horror-movie melodrama and experimental suites-instead-of-songs portentousness, just because it might not be an arty 21st-century metal album without them.) Instead of clashing, these two distinct modes harmonize on <i>Half Blood</i> into something dark and sweeping, where it all could have wound up a ridiculous failed experiment. Instead we get a why-didn't-anyone-think-of-this-sooner mix of metal ugliness and heartland beauty, post-rock at its most spartan and hard rock at its most out-there.</p>
<p>Horseback have been plying this oddball-but-effective hybrid for a couple of years now. <i>Half Blood </i>is simply the strongest argument yet for just how effective it can be. They're still probably the only band in the world that makes a writer want to reference both weirder-than-weird black-metal band Necrofrost (those Tolkein orc vocals) and the lonesome cowboy epics of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/650-calexico/"" target=""_blank"">Calexico</a> (those mournful guitars and weighted-by-heartbreak drums). Earlier albums, like 2010's <i>The Invisible Mountain</i>, proved their point with gusto, namely that a band could evoke the sad, wide-open spaces of American roots music while suggesting the screams and riffs of black metal could be equally (and not dissimilarly) affecting. Drunken ballads about losing everything aren't a million miles from drinking blood and wailing about how you wish everything would just <i>stop</i> already.</p>
<p>Certain moments on <i>Half Blood</i> suggest a metal band covering Ry Cooder's <i>Paris, Texas</i> score, or maybe a Crazy Horse helmed soundtack to a suppressed Kris Kristofferson film about a guitar-toting truck driver in post-apocalyptic 1970s America. So when I say ""country"" you should probably know I mean the loose, electrified, booming groove that resulted when hairy dudes with big amps and Bonham-grade drumming took a shine to Opry-approved stuff. And if most post-metal acts take cues from the already metal-indebted dynamics of Mogwai, the early tracks on <i>Half Blood</i> more recall the more clearly American sturm-und-twang of <i>Spiderland</i>, if Slint had been as into bar-band boogie as they were into King Crimson.</p>
<p>Other bands have attempted to merge highway romanticism and extreme brutality, of course. The reunited Earth have almost completely transmogrified from an experimental doom act into a bleak roots unit. Late-period Neurosis offered oppressive sludge and spacious twang in equal amounts, birthing the whole post-metal thing in the process. And the latest iteration of Swans is kind of the gold-standard for crushing heaviness, blackened blues, and emotional violence, all in one unstable package. But Horseback are the only band that's mined similar territory while risking the potential silliness of extracting corpse-painted wails from their native context of epically grumpy one-man-band isolation and plunking them into a world more typically influenced by Merle Haggard, Marshall stacks, and crying in your Wild Turkey.</p>
<p>All that said, I don't want to make <i>too</i> much of the ""Hank meets Euronymous"" thing. There are moves Horseback make here-- like the <i>Omen</i>-grade liturgical hooey on ""Inheritance (the Changeling)""-- that have no precedent in any context <i>other</i> than metal. (And horror movies, I guess.) And as stunningly well-realized as some of this stuff is, I can't pretend that the psychedelic excesses of the album-closing trilogy entirely work, even though excess and song trilogies are both metal staples, so Horseback's reach occasionally exceeding their grasp doesn't sore-thumb as much as it might if their big influence were the Ramones. If anything it's kinda inspiring to see guys stretch out, get loose, scramble up the mountain of art, when they could have just driven a unique-to-say-the-least sound into dullness.</p>
<p>And as for that signature combo, you still want to ask: How does all that tortured (and affected) monster grunting and groaning not puncture the austere gorgeousness of the low-key moments and the thunderousness of the climaxes? Maybe it's because-- and here those with a phobia toward metal vocals will have to take a leap of faith-- tortured (and affected) monster grunts are no more ridiculous, or any less potentially moving, than indie whispering or canyon-troubadour crooning or drunken party-dude bellowing. Speaking of Slint, I'm reminded here of Steve Albini's admission that, on his first few listens to <i>Spiderland</i>, he went from being embarrassed by the singing and the lyrics to being deeply moved by them.</p>
<p>It might be a stretch to say metal-resistant listeners will have a similar reaction to the singing on <i>Half Blood</i>. But it's not out of the realm of possibility. I was certainly moved by the combination, at times, but then I've also been moved by the shrieking renunciation of all human values in Striborg songs.</p></div>"|16583.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16583-half-blood/|7.6|Jess Harvell

Marc Barrite, who records minimal yet lively tech house under the alias <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22157-dave-aju/"" target=""_blank"">Dave Aju</a>, had an additional angle of his own to deal with: His late father Joe Barrite was a musician himself, one who had spent decades gigging around San Francisco playing jazz trumpet, and at some point they'd brainstormed the idea of doing a collaboration that never happened in his father's lifetime. Among all the things that Marc doubtlessly had to sift through in the aftermath, the recordings his father left behind must have been the weightiest.</p>
<p>To make up for the missed opportunity for a father-son collaboration, Marc spent three-plus years digging through his father's archived work in preparation for <i>Heirlooms</i>, coming to terms with it, synthesizing it, reshaping it and making his own statement out of it. The catch is that, for most listeners, his father's reported influence is easier to pinpoint than the original sound of his actual music. He was reportedly an aficionado of fusion and free jazz, an interest that's been passed down and subtly integrated into Aju's eclectic strain of house. But there aren't any widely available, commercially released Joe Barrite recordings to refer to in order to gain a contextual foothold here, so any real insight into the source of Marc's father's impact is tangential.</p>
<p>Aju also has a wider set of personal influences to work with, and you can hear them all put to good use over the course of <i>Heirlooms</i>. An early 18 ½-minute span consisting of tracks ""All Together Now"" and ""To Be Free"" lets him sink deep into hypnotic house that feels less minimalist the more it stretches out. The momentum is maintained by Aju's tendency to drop <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6208-george-clinton/"" target=""_blank"">George Clintonian</a> ad-libs into the latter track's lyrics-- refrains echo the liberated thoughts of circa-<i>Osmium</i> rarity <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=807844CSp8I"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Fantasy is Reality""</a> (""freedom is free of the need to be free""), or play off Shakespeare with cosmically sloppy wordplay (""to sneeze or snot to be""). The funk is more explicit in a later tandem, the roller-disco bounce of ""Ms. Reposado"" and the 1983-via-<i>1999</i> digital boogie of ""Caller #7"". But even in the cuts that hew closer to Detroit and Chicago than Oakland and Minneapolis, like the sax-adorned ""Away Away"" and the sophisticated cocktail house of ""You Gotta Know"", there's hints of something loose and freewheeling underpinning that four-on-the-floor .</p>
<p>Even if this is an album that defies obvious lineage and needs a roadmap to uncover the specific sources from Joe Barrite's archive, there's an inescapable sense of emotional impact here. Even if you don't know the background of the album, there's something about a few of the flourishes that pull heartstrings-- the increasingly vivid horns that seep through the sub-tectonic bass downtempo cut ""Until Then"", or the dense rhythmic build, abetted by the Sol Percussion Ensemble, that pushes through the MPB-inflected ""Brown &amp; Blue"". And if you do know the background, the first sound you hear on the record-- faint, faded trumpets mournfully echoing through a misty atmosphere-- gives the next four minutes of ""Rise"" and the ensuing hour of music a compelling power that peaks with the Rhodes-drizzled delicacy of Soulquarians-gone-<a href=""http://www.kompakt.fm/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kompakt</a> closer ""Revealing"". <i>Heirlooms</i> is an album that acts as a eulogy, a wake and an inheritance all at once-- one man's presence kept alive through the work of his son. But if all you learn about his father is that he raised a kid who's capable of putting out an album like this, that's worth respecting, too.</p></div>"|16582.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16582-dave-aju-heirlooms/|8.0|Nate Patrin

The best stuff misremembers what it enshrines, producing a jarring little chamber of echoes that plays upon beloved memories while confusing them-- I love this song/wait, is this how this song goes? Ty Segall and White Fence's Tim Presley are masters of garage-rock's indirection game; their collaborative album, <i>Hair</i>, is an absorbing, bleary maze of detours and red herrings. To hear them steer their demented little dune buggy through rock history is not unlike partaking in the American history lessons that Abe Simpson pieced together ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARXfQzfl9EQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">mostly through sugar packets</a>"": All the familiar players are here, but they're acting funny.</p>
<p>The songs they write together -- Segall on drums and rhythm guitar, Presley on bass and lead-- are not anthems. They are puzzles built from rock-music parts, and you don't pump your fist to a puzzle. But they are peculiarly absorbing, and they only grow more so with repeated listening. In every song, there's a jump, an oomph, a missing-reel moment, in which a sudden left turn devours a song whole or a stray thread bumps everything off the designed course. The opener, ""Time"", eases its way into a sweetly evocative folk-rock strum, pitched so accurately you get instantly lost trying to track it: something from George Harrison's <i>All Things Must Pass</i>, maybe? But then, in its last minute, the song drops into a forceful blurt of fuzz guitars so abruptly that its tendons nearly snap. It's a bracing reminder that you are not, in fact, listening to George Harrison.</p>
<p>Segall and Presley are both tinkerers like this, the sort of people who seemingly enjoy pulling support beams out of their songs to see how well they hop along without them. Songs start somewhere rote and then slowly topple over before they end. ""Easy Ryder"" begins in a place so familiar that your ears dilate: a straight-ahead Ventures surf lick, a lazy drum shuffle, and lyrics intoning the title. But when the halfway-point guitar solo pop ups, on cue, it noodles away past its designated end, pecking determinedly away at the song until the relationship between the two begins to resemble <a href=""http://i1112.photobucket.com/albums/k497/animalsbeingdicks/abd-241.gif"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">this dynamic</a>. ""Scissor People"" starts with a Yardbirds-style riff, but when it breaks down to a one-chord vamp, it keeps breaking down into smaller and blurrier parts, interrupting itself until it just bangs its head against a  corner repeatedly. It's a quizzical chaos, a cocktail of adrenaline and neurosis.</p>
<p>Some of this schizophrenia stems from Segall and Presley's differing temperaments. As White Fence, Presley tends to be sleepier and more abstracted; Segall's music is wilder and unconstrained. Their union feels intriguingly unstable: You can almost pinpoint the moment on the narcotized psych-folk ballad ""The Black Glove/Rag"" where Segall grows restless with the song's tempo and wrests control of it, steering it into a field of tires. They are interesting enough together that the stuff that sounds like it took 20 total minutes to cook up and record (the hiccuping rockabilly of ""Crybaby"") glows with their singular weirdness. At eight songs and under half an hour, <i>Hair</i> is short, but full of enough odd little fillips-- the creepy whispers that open ""The Black Glove/Rag"", the stumbling, quasi-solemn ""1-2-3-4"" countdown that opens ""Time""-- that it feels like a world. Given the incestuous, collaborative nature of the San Francisco psych-rock playground, it's likely that these two will make more music together. I hope they never figure each other out completely.</p></div>"|16558.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16558-ty-segall-white-fence-hair/|8.2|Jayson Greene

Well, if a Downtown A&amp;R came into a strategy meeting with the blueprint for Electric Guest, they'd be on workman's comp after all the back-patting. The buzzed-about L.A. band is pretty much a bulletproof combination of who you know and what you know-- lead singer Asa Taccone's brother Jorma is one of the songwriters in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27233-the-lonely-island/"" target=""_blank"">the Lonely Island</a>, and they quickly caught the attention of the increasingly unstoppable <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1186-danger-mouse/"" target=""_blank"">Danger Mouse</a>. But more important is that their sound perfectly anticipates a logical extension of the MGMT/Passion Pit/Foster the People trickle-down effect, composed like corporate pop, produced like radio R&amp;B, and given a synth-and-guitar power trio presentation that somehow lets it scan as ""indie rock."" Add Danger Mouse and the fact that the slightly built, photogenic Taccone even dances a lot like Mark Foster, and how can this fail? Not surprisingly, their debut <i>Mondo </i>does turn out as something like a useful industry tool, but it's not so much a replicable schematic as it is a cautionary tale of what happens when a ""hit record"" forgets to actually include hits.</p>
<p>Don't blame Danger Mouse, though his fingerprints are all over this thing, for better or worse.  Unfortunately, it's for worse at the outset, as opener ""Holes"" mismatches a wobbly synth progression with unctuous artificial string cheese, invoking his egregious ability to make things sound simultaneously demo-cheap <i>and </i>overproduced. For the most part though, <i>Mondo </i>coasts on his M.O. to produce animated renderings of soul music-- something that's facially roots-based, but decked out with enough Pro Tools tricks to avoid being the stuff of revivalists. ""This Head I Hold"" <i>does </i>recall the rave-up R&amp;B of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1866-gnarls-barkley/"" target=""_blank"">Gnarls Barkley</a>, and ""Awake"" <i>does </i>riff with enough bluesy grit to recall the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/375-the-black-keys/"" target=""_blank"">Black Keys</a>, and the vast majority of the trad-indie second half of <i>Mondo does </i>do a passable <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28316-broken-bells/"" target=""_blank"">Broken Bells</a>. </p>
<p>Unfortunately for Electric Guest, this halo effect only highlights Taccone as <i>Mondo's </i>gaping hole<i>.</i> His phrasing and tendency to pinch falsetto instead of belt it out suggests some formative experiences singing into a hairbrush over Justin Timberlake records. But in execution, there's a personality void every bit as glaring that of a bland indie singer raised on Yo La Tengo, and he leaves no lyrical or melodic impression despite consistently being at the forefront. ""Under the Gun"" and ""Troubleman"" sit in a narrative no man's land, either B- assignments for Jon Bon Jovi's MFA correspondence course or Lonely Island songs waiting for punch-up. ""The Head I Hold"" burrows its way in out of sheer persistence, but it's Taccone's grating hitch of an ""ooh"" that serves as the hook as opposed to a fully hummable melody or a sticky lyric. ""Amber"" takes a similarly incantatory approach, its entire operation based on Taccone's distending the phonics of its title to the most annoying extent imaginable. Lord knows Danger Mouse gives Taccone all the help he can get-- adding sacrament-wine gospel sweetener to the choruses of ""Awake"" and ""Waves"", and running Taccone's voice through just about every pencil mic, phonebox, and Strokes-like filter out there so as to make the reediness sound like a conscious production decision rather than a clear limitation.</p>
<p>I was prepared to at least give it the credit of being ""workmanlike"" until the second half presumes Electric Guest's work is already done. Like most filler, it uses genre as a crutch. The double-time rhythm of ""Waves"" has some kind of soul-clap aspirations, but Taccone's vocals are meek and squeaky. If milquetoast indie bands ever get around to covering Frank Ocean's cover of Coldplay, it might turn out something like ""American Daydream"". If the mere title of ""Troubleman"" doesn't inspire enough eye-rolling, just know the first lyric is, ""She was young once/ A girl of the bohemian kind,"" and after eight-and-a-half minutes of scattered acoustic strumming, it's finally over. This is clearly the handiwork of a band that figured merely showing up is 95% of the job.</p>
<p>The problem with <i>Mondo </i>can be summed up by how it recognizes ""pop"" as a noun but not a verb-- there's no reason to believe that Electric Guest won't be playing stripped-down versions of ""This Head I Hold"" or ""American Daydream"" at the KROQ Acoustic Christmas, but neither of them leap out in a way that suggests they'd even come close to headlining either. Or maybe they will, who knows? But in the realm Electric Guest are trying to succeed in, you <i>should </i>know, and the actual songs of <i>Mondo </i>leave too much to uncertainty. No matter how many times you've heard ""Pumped Up Kicks"" or ""Sleepyhead"" or ""Kids"", it's stuck in your head whether or not it got your prior consent. You forget how most of <i>Mondo </i>goes even while it's playing.</p></div>"|16574.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16574-electric-guest-mondo/|4.6|Ian Cohen

<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-family: Georgia;"">Lee Hazlewood is hard to categorize. With his eerie baritone and ear for trippily reverbed vocals, he mingled orchestrated pop and Laurel Canyon folk, a bit like Serge Gainsbourg singing country and western or Leonard Cohen gone bubblegum. He was never quite as overtly sexual as his French contemporary nor as overtly Biblical as his Canadian peer, but possessed an equally singular vision of pop music, which, 40 years after his heyday, makes his songs immediately distinctive and identifiable. But Hazlewood's solo career was overshadowed by his collaborations, first with Duane Eddy and most famously with Nancy Sinatra. He wrote and produced her biggest hits-- ""These Boots Are Made for Walkin'"" and ""Some Velvet Morning""-- and even recorded a few duets with her, like Porter &amp; Dolly for the Sunset Strip. During the mid-1960s, their partnership made her a star in her own right, although she would always be known as Frank's daughter. After they parted ways, Hazlewood released a string of comparatively minor hits on his own LHI Records, and while he never achieved the same level of success he enjoyed with Nancy, he never lost his weirdo ambitions.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-family: Georgia;"">Assessing his legacy is just as difficult as pinning down his sound. Hazlewood remains a curio, with neither the influence that Phil Spector continues to assert nor the cultish cachet of someone like Van Dyke Parks. Instead, he's just one of those oddballs floating around the pop periphery, with a surprisingly large catalogue that's more dark corners than known quantities. That makes him a perfect subject for a compilation like Light in the Attic's <i>Nudes, Singles &amp; Backsides, </i>which culls from three years of his career and only scratches the surface of his repertoire. Compiling seventeen tracks from his lesser-known LHI output in the late 1960s and early 1970s, it shows him working well within the Nancy/Lee concept, often using a female counterpart to offset his own vocals. Much like Gainsbourg, he envisions pop songs less as monologues and more as dialogues between men and women. <i>Nudes</i> is heavy on duets, and while there's no Nancy here, there is Ann-Margret, still so full of blustery femininity on ""Sleep in the Grass""; Nina Lizell, embodying European mystique on ""Leather and Lace""; and Suzi Jane Hokom, barely distinguishing herself on ""Nobody Like You"".</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-family: Georgia;"">And there's Hazlewood himself, presiding over everything with that disarmingly low voice of his, so lonesome in this cavernous production. The man had a sense of humor-- check out that album cover-- but didn't always let it show in the songs, which tend to be straightfaced and self-serious. That's not necessarily a dig, especially when ""Victims of the Night"" evokes a surreal Golden State desert landscape and ""Califia (Stone Rider)"" shifts tempo into an exquisitely blissed-out coda. A meditation on lost love that verges on the suicidal, ""The Bed"" proves he could write a sadsack country song with the best of them, and he could invest a line like ""I've learned to pay the paperboy on time"" with immense melancholy. But occasionally his lyrics jump on a premise and ride it like a rodeo bull. ""If It's Monday Morning,"" which sounds like a response song to Kris Kristofferson's ""Sunday Morning Coming Down"", repeats itself rigidly, turning a potentially intriguing hook into a tedious refrain.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-family: Georgia;"">Most rewardingly and remarkably, <i>Nudes, Singles &amp; Backsides</i> manages to present a fairly detailed portrait of an artist who found himself suddenly back on the pop music margins. But he continued to conceive of new shapes for pop songs, and his struggle to adequately and accurately express himself through the music of his time illuminates this collection and compensates for the almost comically grave spoken-word passages and the occasional clunky line. This compilation won't raise Hazlewood beyond his cult status, but maybe that's where his songs are best heard. </span></p>

Representing Greek tragedy, the ""loss and failure"" side of the American Dream, a daddy complex, and the vacuity apparently lingering inside us all, over six months prior to the eventual release of the LP there was very much a feeling of Marina over-complicating the whole affair: trying to dress up the high-gloss record that she had made with Katy Perry's collaborators (seemingly at the behest of her major label) in layers of philosophy, mythology, artifice, and blonde wigs. (There's a babyish song here called ""Hypocrates"", misspelled for seemingly no good reason, and with no reference to the philosopher in the song.) It must have stung like billy-o when Lana Del Rey came along and executed precisely what Marina was aiming for, hardly having to open her much-discussed mouth in order to explain herself whilst Marina tied herself in conceptual knots. In short, <i>Electra Heart</i> bears no profound relationship to Greek mythology or philosophical thought beyond exploring situations of basic human pathos (or lack thereof), but its rare affecting moments are heavy with tragedy.</p>
<p><i>The Family Jewels</i> was disliked by many for its vaudevillian Sparks-like gaucheness, Marina's self-aggrandizement and cock-a-hoop vocal (though there's no doubting the chops of a song like <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VTcJfL7RE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Hollywood""</a>). But there was a sense of personality to the music as well as Diamandis' deep, hiccupy voice, and a promising sense of audaciousness that's been all but lost here. Working with Dr. Luke, Stargate, Greg Kurstin, and Liam Howe, the songs on <i>Electra Heart</i> fall into three basic categories: the bland, swampy banger (sub-category: ""Lies""' Skrillex-lite), a regal, electronic strut falling somewhere between Depeche Mode at their poppiest and the Doctor Who theme tune, and very cloying, nursery rhyme music-box ballads. The campy ding-dong of ""The State of Dreaming"" is as close as <i>Electra Heart</i> gets to fun, with huge church bells whooshing from side to side in the mix like a pantomime dame testing the trajectory of her ball gown skirts. Relegating great early single <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU7GoCKSQfg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Radioactive""</a> to the bonus tracks on the deluxe version of the LP is nearly as daft as some of the waffle that Marina comes out with here. </p>
<p>Marina really, really wants you to know that she's into pop culture, though the lazy, meaningless strings of references that comprise a good chunk of the songs here aren't any kind of postmodern comment on the Tumblr-ification of society, but just plain bad songwriting. The bombardment of archetypes and clichés is exhausting: ""Beauty queen of a silver screen"" persuading someone to buy her ""a big diamond ring"" on <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gj5L9SYhoSE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Primadonna""</a>; the titular <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_orsY7C7yk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Homewrecker""</a> (where excruciatingly bad spoken word verses clash against a pretty triumphant chorus) whose ""life is a mess, but I'm still looking pretty in this dress."" ""Teen Idle"" is just horrible, a glitchy ballad that sounds as though it was recorded in a church, where she wishes to be a ""virgin pure/ A 21st century whore,"" ""a prom queen fighting for the title/ instead of being 16 and burning up a bible/ feeling super super super suicidal,"" a chorus of Marinas echoing ""super."" She wishes for ""blood, guts, and angel cake"" because ""I'm gonna puke it anyway,"" a weird preoccupation of hers that also crops up in ""Homewrecker"" (""girls and their cosmic gourmet vomit""), continued from ""Girls"" on her debut. But as for ending the ego, Marina does seem obsessed with ideas of finality and death-- knowing ""where I will belong/ When they blow me out"" on the quavering, celestial ""Fear and Loathing""-- seemingly finding solace in the reliability of microcosmic, compact celebrity tragedies, perhaps in the face of the parts of this album that ring desperately true. </p>
<p>""You only ever touch me in the dark/ Only if we're drinking can you see my spark,"" she sings on ""Lies"". ""The only time you open up is when we get undressed,"" she laments on ""Starring Role"", which glimmers like clashing porcelain before a stuttering, empowering chorus where she refuses to be a supporting cast member in an alluded-to love triangle. ""Doesn't mean that I am weak,"" she asserts on ""Power &amp; Control"", repeating, ""I am weak, I am weak, I am weak"" in an increasingly ephemeral voice. ""Every day I feel the same/ Stuck, and I can never change/ Sucked into a black balloon/ Spat into an empty room"" goes ""Living Dead"", a snappy, taut Soft Cell-like number. It feels like shaky ground to say that these vulnerable moments are <i>Electra Heart</i>'s finest, catchiest, and hardest-hitting songs, Marina's soaring vocals packing some genuine emotion, picking up on themes of self-loathing that don't need blasé allusions to bulimia in order to indicate emotional emptiness; where the often transcendent states of sex and alcohol collaborate for profoundly dispiriting experiences. Her honesty, at least, is empowering. Whilst there's no getting past some of the duller and more unbearable material on this record, it's a real shame that it's come hamstrung in this unnecessary concept, ready for people to laugh when Marina fails to pull it off. If she'd made a record full of songs as unaffected as these four, <i>Electra Heart</i> could be one of the year's most acclaimed pop albums. Let's hope there's a next time.</p></div>"|16579.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16579-electra-heart/|5.9|Laura Snapes

New Yorkers <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30346-led-er-est/"">Led Er Est</a> released their debut album <i>Dust on Common</i> on <a href=""http://wierdrecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wierd</a> in 2009, and were firmly bedded down in the scene spawned by that label. They talked enthusiastically to the <a href=""http://thequietus.com/articles/03537-analogue-alienation-the-very-rare-sound-of-weird-records"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Quietus</a> around that time, highlighting how the weekly parties Wierd threw in New York brought together a tightly cloistered group of people who were obsessing over the cold wave/minimal wave revival. Led Er Est have since moved on, inking a deal with the increasingly influential <a href=""http://www.sacredbonesrecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sacred Bones</a>, perhaps in an attempt to greater fulfill the barefaced pop ambitions they displayed on tracks like the standout <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lhgiHZbMac"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Port Isabel""</a> from <i>Dust on Common</i>. That song sounds like a hit from an alternate universe, with its precisely woven structure and hotwired charge of electronics when the chorus lands. It's the type of track that buzzes with aspiration, aching with a longing for the wider audience it deserves. </p>
<p>Parts of <i>The Diver</i> get tangled up in Led Er Est's disposition for proficient pop, but it's mostly steered into darker terrain due to a tragedy that befell singer Samuel Kklovenhoof during its construction. ""A lot of the lyrics are a bit bleak,"" he admitted in an <a href=""http://www.spin.com/articles/hear-led-er-est-channel-tragedy-new-lp-diver"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interview</a> earlier this year, after revealing the album was partially inspired by the sudden death of his sister in a car accident. So this isn't the moment when the members of Led Er Est break the cold wave chains that bind them; instead, it feels like a rehash of many of the ideas developed on their debut record. There's nothing here that matches the bold leap of faith fellow synth travelers <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28171-cold-cave/"">Cold Cave</a> demanded of their audience with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12093-the-great-pan-is-dead/"">""The Great Pan is Dead""</a>, but it's unlikely Led Er Est would ever attempt something so brash. They operate in a dingy kind of half-light, obsessed with wringing genuine emotion from the decrepit electronics and occasional bursts of guitar at their disposal.</p>
<p><i>The Diver</i> dips in and out of two distinct moods. On tracks like ""The Diver"" and ""Agua Fuerte"" there's a palpable sense of drama, with Kklovenhoof veering close to the kind of low rent tumult <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/61-marc-almond/"">Marc Almond</a> appropriated at his peak. The instrumentals ""Bladiator"" and ""Sanetta"" continue that theme, launching full pelt into Ballardian techno-fear, causing all kinds of Cold War paranoia to come to mind. The other mood lightens the picture just a touch, allowing Kklovenhoof to flex the strain in his voice over the sheet-like electronics of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13409-kaiyo-maru/"">""Kaiyo Maru""</a> and ""Divided Parallel"". The latter contains hints of the pop band Led Er Est can't fully allow themselves to be yet, even working in a Peter Hook-esque undertow that bounces off Kklovenhoof's yearning vocal. But the desire to meddle takes them down a few uneven paths. The punk howl that punctures ""Animal Smear"" and ""La Lluvia y Memoria"" is an unwelcome addendum, coming off as an attempt to force change rather than naturally work it into the album's shifting tones.</p>
<p>This record throws Led Er Est into a holding pattern. It doesn't advance much on their debut and, like that record, it only intermittently allows their latent promise to creep to the fore. Despite the label change they're a band that hasn't managed to cast aside the baggage of the scene from which they've sprung, and maybe they're perfectly happy down there, divining a mix of agitation and affection from archaic electronics. There's still a nagging sense that they're dressed in borrowed clothes, which are being tailored to fit the continued series of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16327-the-minimal-wave-tapes-volume-2/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac""><i>Minimal Wave</i></a> compilations. Arguably most truly great music comes from a mixture of inspiration and thievery, but at present the balance is tipped a little too far toward the latter for this band. And that's a shame, because on tracks like ""Divided Parallel"", Kklovenhoof shows off his aptitude for a type of pop that's far warmer and fuller than the material he's sourcing, momentarily tipping Led Er Est out of the scenester bracket in which they're currently lodged.</p></div>"|16568.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16568-the-diver/|6.1|Nick Neyland

The UK-born singer-songwriter has a real feel for idiom. He can do washed-out new wave, strobing disco, atmospheric balladry. He'll throw in a sax break and the odd cover. In one way, Kindness represents the end-point of the chilled aesthetic that tints our memories of the summer of 2009 until they have the look of an Instagram photo. Where much of that music was homemade and owed a lot to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/search/?query=ariel+pink"" target=""_blank"">Ariel Pink</a>, Bainbridge's Kindness gives that ""songwriting as mixtape"" approach a professional sheen. With production from Philippe Zdar of French dance outfit Cassius, it's all rendered just so, every element placed where it should be.</p>
<p>That might sound like a faint praise, but the truth is it's hard to get music to sound like this. Back when Bainbridge's musical heroes (Nile Rodgers, Jam &amp; Lewis, Cerrone) were at the peak of their game, the industry generated a lot of revenue and a lot of that went back into studios. People knew how to craft records that sounded good, and they had the tools to make it happen. So the fact that Bainbridge's scratchy lite-funk guitars, rubbery bass, and layered, reverb-saturated vocals are all in their right proportions bears note. When <i>World, You Need a Change of Mind</i> is playing, it's unlikely to make anyone who doesn't spend all their waking hours tracking blog trends mad. So on that level, purely as an audio object, <i>World</i> is a success. It can fill up a room and turn it into a cool and friendly place (those choosing music for the sales floor of your hip local retailer are sure to notice these qualities).</p>
<p>Like a lot of young producers in the electro-pop sphere, Bainbridge started out recording covers of songs by favorite artists in order to figure out how it was done. But his songwriting progression since then hasn't kept pace with his technical know-how, and this set runs into trouble when considered outside of pure style. It's telling that the two most memorable melodies on <i>World</i> come from other writers, and oddly, the chosen covers have something to bother people on both sides of the Atlantic. ""Anyone Can Fall in Love"" is a 1986 UK hit by actress <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anita_Dobson"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Anita Dobson</a>, and it was the theme song to the show she starred in, ""EastEnders"". While I have no associations with ""Anyone Can Fall in Love"", as heard here it comes over as pretty but ultimately cloying and silly, an unearned stab at at soul-driven tenderness.</p>
<p>The other cover is of the Replacements' <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/13268-swinging-party-replacements-cover/"" target=""_blank"">""Swingin' Party""</a>, a song for which I do have a lot of associations. The Kindness version is lovely in its way, with delicate production and loads of atmosphere, but it basically strips the song of its meaning and leaves only an ethereal, vibe-laden shell. ""If being afraid is a crime, we hang side by side"" is a line of desperation, the kind of thing that made Paul Westerberg such a distinctive voice. But with Bainbridge, you feel like he has the world on a string. There's no vulnerability. His version is ""sad,"" I guess, but almost anything sung with his layered, ghosted-out vocals would be. You don't get a sense of his personality, what he brings to it. </p>
<p>Bainbridge's original material is not quite as tuneful but it does possess a consistency of vision. The appealing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12489-cyan/"" target=""_blank"">""Cyan""</a> sounds like Arthur Russell collaborating with Toro Y Moi, and it finds just the right mix of dreaminess and propulsion. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12853-seod/"" target=""_blank"">""Seod""</a> has an appealingly thick blend of vintage synths and ping-ponging percussion. And ""That's Alright"" is the set's one true curveball, zeroing in on that late-1980s moment when Prince and Jam &amp; Lewis were using the gated snare to inflate pop to absurd proportions. Forget that it lifts the vocal hook from <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqRDct1IDI8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Escort's ""All Through the Night""</a> and is essentially a genre exercise, and it's easy to wallow in just how well it's all done. ""That's Alright"" also sounds oddly fresh at this moment, one of the few places where Bainbridge makes a choice that doesn't feel obvious. And that's ultimately the issue with this record. <i>World, You Need a Change of Mind</i> certainly isn't a bad album, and the technical execution is first-rate. Its failure is ultimately one of ambition. This is music to be enjoyed while doing something else, not something you fall in love with.</p></div>"|16576.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16576-world-you-need-a-change-of-mind/|6.4|Mark Richardson

The set includes <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aokGEMTCWg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Forbidden Colours""</a>, the mannered ambient-pop singer's piano-led 1983 collaboration with former Yellow Magic Orchestra member Ryuichi Sakamoto. The song was the theme for the film <i>Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence</i>, and after watching Sakamoto work on the score, Sylvian was quoted as marveling at how the Japanese composer tried to create ""a sense of place, a landscape in the mind of the listener.""</p>
<p>The refined, piano-driven torch song bears on Montreal producer Mike Silver's quietly compelling new EP as <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/cfcfmusic"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">CFCF</a> in more than one significant way. <i>Exercises</i> consists of eight minimalist, keyboard-based tracks, all but one of them instrumental, with Silver citing Sakamoto alongside 20th-century composers <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6177-philip-glass/"" target=""_blank"">Philip Glass</a> and David Borden as inspirations. The lone song with vocals, ""Exercise #5 (September)"", is actually an expansive reinterpretation of the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8RxNeHKgNU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">opening track</a> on Sylvian's gorgeous, Sakamoto-arranged 1987 album, <i>Secrets of the Beehive</i>. And although CFCF has progressed at a staggering rate over the past five years, mental landscapes have always been this project's specialty.</p>
<p>The geography of<i> Exercises</i> is chilly, spacious, and oddly out of time. Where CFCF's only proper full-length to date, 2009's increasingly vital <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13648-continent/""><i>Continent</i></a>, conjured up the neon glow of a 1980s Michael Mann soundtrack, and 2010's RVNG-issued <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14941-the-river-ep/"" target=""_blank""><i>The River</i></a> EP explicitly sought to evoke the Peruvian jungle of Werner Herzog's 1982 film <i>Fitzcarraldo</i>, this time around Silver has been comparing his music to the kind of blocky concrete structures that sprang up throughout the 1960s-- such as New Hampshire's Phillips Exeter Academy Library, which is depicted on the artwork. </p>
<p>There's a premature-ruin-like quality to brutalist colossuses like Boston's <a href=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/Boston_city_hall.jpg/800px-Boston_city_hall.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">City Hall</a> or Washington, D.C.'s <a href=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/Fbi_headquarters.jpg/800px-Fbi_headquarters.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">J. Edgar Hoover Building</a>,  and it's this combination of imposing austerity and weathered familiarity that Silver seizes upon to make his current landscape hospitable. The organic-toned keyboards here are familiar from CFCF's piano-house-tinged 2011 ""Cometrue"" 12"", but <i>Exercises</i> mostly forgoes beats, letting those concentric patterns of melody build on each other meditatively, ornamented lightly by fuzzy glints of synth. The post-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29228-jamie-smith/"" target=""_blank"">Jamie xx</a> bedroom-disco grooves of ""Exercise #2 (School)"" and ""Exercise #8 (Change)"" mix up Silver's template just enough.</p>
<p><i>Exercises</i>' ""September"" cover nearly quadruples the length of Sylvian's sparsely poetic original, transforming the genteel piano ballad into billowing, understated synth-pop. ""We say that we're in love/ While secretly wishing for rain,"" Silver sings, his calm, reassuring voice much more out in front here than on <i>Continent</i>'s snowblind <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6026-fleetwood-mac/"" target=""_blank"">Fleetwood Mac</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77VF9mrQ2Ms"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">cover</a>.  It's a deeply evocative track with potential crossover appeal, and finding it tucked away in the midst of a disc of mostly melancholy contemplations only makes it feel more special. Much as Sylvian-Sakamoto's exaggerated artificiality can be more poignant and, ultimately, no less sincere than traditional displays of earnestness, so the piano-recital functionality of these self-described ""exercises"" belies the EP's very pop emotional wallop. By stretching out into classical- and <i>kosmische</i>-informed keyboard selections, CFCF has reached a place where his next options are almost limitless. </p></div>"|16565.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16565-cfcf-exercises-ep/|8.0|Marc Hogan

He never should have been <i>in</i> prison in the first place; he'd been jailed in 1984 by the government of coup leader Major-General Muhammadu Buhari on trumped-up currency charges. Fela was an outspoken opponent of Buhari, as he had been of Nigeria's other coup-installed dictators before, and his imprisonment was an attempt to silence him. It backfired. Amnesty International launched a worldwide campaign for Fela's release, and then Buhari himself was overthrown by another coup, this one led by Ibrahim Babangida. Babangida pardoned Fela and actually brought Kuti's older brother, Beko, into his administration as Health Minister.</p>
<p>Fela opens the concert captured on <i>Live in Detroit 1986</i> with a short monologue that directly references his wrongful imprisonment. ""In my country,"" he says, ""Things happen just like that…You go your own way, mind your own business, next thing I know I'm in prison, man, just like that."" It's part of a nicely rhythmic build-up to the song ""Just Like That"", a song that continues the litany of arbitrary ills that Fela laments can befall an average Nigerian (he generalizes it to all of Africa, too), wrapping them in recollections of Nigeria's devastating 1967-1970 Civil War.</p>
<p>This version of ""Just Like That"" is half an hour long, which makes it by some distance the shortest workout on this set, which was taped by Bob Teagan at the Fox and is just now seeing release. The set is only four songs long, but it sprawls for nearly two and a half hours spread over three discs. Honestly, it could have fit on two discs without changing the running order, so I'm not sure why there are three. Fela's last band, Egypt 80, was a pretty different animal from Africa 70, which is the band most people are familiar with from its funky, forceful, and relatively compact masterpieces ""Zombie"", ""Water No Get Enemy"", ""Expensive Shit"", and ""Roforofo Fight"", among others. Egypt 80 emphasized jazz over funk, for one thing, and indulged in long, spacy jams built around hypnotic grooves.</p>
<p>The performance flows very freely through the four songs, each of which is introduced with a pointed, and usually pretty funny, monologue from Fela, whose facility with sarcasm was just about unparalleled in his day. Kuti engages his audience, teaching them short Yoruban phrases for call-and-response passages (and admonishing them to pronounce Yoruban words like Africans-- ""We Africans talk with our whole mouths""), and these sections of long tracks make for good contrasts with the rhythm section's coolly funky vamping and the lead instrumentalists' winding solos.</p>
<p>It is a mostly great show, though not all dynamite. ""Confusion Break Bones"" wanders through one section so bizarrely discordant that it almost sounds like each instrument in the rhythm section is playing a different song at the same tempo, but it's a few minutes out of 40, and works in its own kind of freaky way. One of the show's highlights comes near its end, as ""Beast of No Nation"" thumps out of a big, full-band crescendo and settles on this amazing, bass-led rhythm that's so compelling on its own no one bothers to play anything over it. It gets the audience, already obviously engaged and even familiar with some of the material, really pumped. Listening to it off a very well-recorded audience tape is of course different from being there, and as a listening experience, this show is perhaps best taken a disc at a time. Still, whether heard whole or in pieces, it captures one of Fela's less appreciated phases and finds him still brimming with piss and vinegar two trying decades into his crusading career.</p></div>"|16562.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16562-live-in-detroit-1986/|7.9|Joe Tangari

It began as a London-centric exploration of bass, but like most victims of globalization, any local identity has been slowly bled out to make it palatable to a worldwide audience. That focus on visceral and universal low-end thrills may have made for some good dumb pop tunes, but it also strips away the vital stamp that comes from an invested audience with ties to a community. This blanding in the name of branding isn't specific to dubstep, of course. It's just that baile funk and reggaeton and soca and all the other idiosyncratic community-based tweaks to beats-and-bass never impacted heartland America enough to be so ruthlessly exploited. Not that this has stopped many underground beatheads from plundering them, sometimes with honorable intentions and sometimes not.</p>
<p>One thing that makes <a href=""http://filastine.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Filastine</a>'s <i>Loot</i> so good is that it presents a vision of worldwide bass culture that acknowledges both the importance of context and the problematic and positive ways global connectivity changes things by bringing far-flung sounds together. It's not an academic record. Filastine understands the visceral impact of this stuff, even as the overall mood of <i>Loot</i> can get pretty laid-back. But it's clear he's thought hard about how to both honor and mutate music that's not necessarily ""his."" It's the inverse of Diplo's context-free mash of whatever regional sounds have currently caught his ear, those squeaky clean thrill rides around a spotless global amusement park. Loot is more like the everyone's-an-immigrant visions of city life that cyberpunk once presented, outsiders and insiders thrown together, an ongoing experiment in technology and tradition finding new ways to inhabit the same space, glittering and futuristic but with plenty of ineradicable human grit, learning, ingenuity.</p>
<p>Like those polyglot sci-fi visions of culture-mixing, and maybe like the better parts of our own world now, <i>Loot</i> doesn't smooth away those rough and personalized edges from individual cultures into a palatable mush of clichés that'll go down as easy in Dubai as Dubuque. Instead, Filastine revels in the edges, the way some blur together and some never will, as evidence of the jigsaw quality of modern living, urban and otherwise. In any big city, all this stuff does exist in one space, pockets of fierce traditionalism and a technology-enabled feeling of placelessness, different worlds webbed together as much by wires as one-on-one interaction.<i></i></p>
<p><i>Loot</i> also feels like the work of someone who's actually traveled to, rather than simply dropped in and downloaded from, what writer/musician Matt ""Woebot"" Ingram has called the ""shanty house"" circuit, groups of producers and players far outside of the Western entertainment industry, who mix the traditional sounds of their region with the seemingly post-geographic dance sounds that swept the planet after rave and hip-hop culture went viral. One tune here is a mix of wildly shuffling electronic rhythms that you can't peg to one location and (possibly) processed brass instruments that sound as much like mournful Ethiopian jazz as the nagging synth-oompah hooks from reggaeton. Filastine calls it ""Shanty Tones"", with what you have to assume is equal parts respect and knowing cheekiness. Because like Filastine, those ""shanty house"" artists share both an intense interest in localism and the same access to worldwide grooves we all enjoy through our very telephones these days.</p>
<p>And so while you can hardly call <i>Loot</i> a dubstep record, it plays throughout with dubstep's form and sonics, whether it's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13230-colony-collapse-ft-nova/"" target=""_blank"">""Colony Collapse""</a> looking back to the grim caverns of bass of the original Forward&gt;&gt; crew or ""Skirmish"" losing itself in the current vogue for video game madness. It's also not a ""Jamaican record"" or a ""Middle Eastern record"" or a ""Latin American record,"" though it bears influences from visits to (or infatuations with) sounds from those wildly varied and impossible-to-sum-up regions. Filastine knows the long, sad string melody on ""Sidi Bouzid"" is beautiful enough to be played straight, as tribute to the country where he first heard such music or homage to those who taught it to him. But maybe that would simply be flexing his learning, rather than staying true to <i>Loot</i>'s overall project. So soon enough he introduces a gurgling, lurching computer groove into this analog and ancient-sounding tune, and it's the third invented world he creates out of these two distinct sounds that takes ""Sidi Bouzid"" somewhere unexpected, and maybe more gripping than either would have been on their own.</p>
<p>Filastine has clearly taken the time to learn what makes his sources tick rather than slapping awkward ""ethnic"" samples over bought-by-the-yard grooves. But he's never so reverent that he refuses to inject any of his own personality into the mix, which I take to be a drummer's a sensitivity to making looped rhythms dance in off-kilter ways, the mark of someone who knows his way around a physical kit but also grew up in a world reshaped by rap, dancehall, et al. Maybe I'm wrong to single out one element of this equally borrowed and invented brew as the ""personal"" one, but there's a recurring hip-hop bump that acts as anchor on <i>Loot</i>, one that lopes more like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2248-j-dilla/"" target=""_blank"">Jay Dee</a> than baps like NYC. It's a beat that might be the audible American contribution to this cross-cultural mix-and-mash.</p>
<p>But it's still the mix, rather than the personal stamp, that drives <i>Loot</i>. It's a mix that's political in the low-key and non-dogmatic way of someone open to new experience in a world ever-hostile to difference. Someone less interested in colonizing ""exotic"" sounds for profit as simply sharing what's moved him, making no claims of ownership on a unique culture while acknowledging that in 2012 everyone has the opportunity to draw on sounds from just about every corner of the planet. Everything is jumbled into a glorious whole that somehow finds room for parts that were never designed to fit together. And if these dozens of inputs seem both disorienting and natural when they come together, it might just be that, in <i>Loot</i>'s vision of the world, where international connection is not just possible but impossible to ignore, all this musical information crush feels hospitable rather than chaotic because that's just how we live now.</p></div>"|16573.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16573-loot/|7.0|Jess Harvell

Some throw in the towel, abandon their youthful ideals and Poison Idea backpatches, cover up their ""No Gods/No Masters"" tattoos, and buy in. Others follow a different path, one that sometimes leads them right back on home. Happily enough, the latter case is becoming more and more common, with gratifying results. The recent rash of reunions and influx of unexpected new material from crusty old warriors like Amebix, Hellbastard, Antisect, Doom, and now <a href=""http://wolfbrigade.se/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wolfbrigade</a> have rattled the collective crust scene, proving both welcome and divisive.</p>
<p>Some would have preferred to leave the static safety of their record collections alone, but unfortunately for them, some of these old dogs have got a few tricks left.<span class=""st""> Rob </span>""The Baron"" Miller, the v<span class=""st"">ocalist/bassist of English crust legends </span><span class=""st"">Amebix, </span>paused his sword-smithing forge long enough to record <i>Sonic Mass</i>, and painted a picture of what Amebix looks like in 2011 (apparently, there's a lot of Killing Joke involved). UK anarcho-punk Pete Lyons of Antisect turned away from his upright day job as a recording engineer to take the stage with his band once more. The merry miscreants of England's Hellbastard have been touring and recording their arses off, ripping crust across the globe, and now, after a slight hiatus, Swedish institution Wolfbrigade have returned with a vicious new album and, one may hope, a new lease on life. Southern Lord's recent crust-punk fetish has struck again, as the now-venerable American label brought the pack on board for their first new album since 2008's <i>Comalive</i>. </p>
<p>Metallic crust is the order of the day, and has been the band's bread and butter since they came snarling into life in 1995 under the original moniker Wolfpack. Not much has changed in the past 17 years, save for a cleaner, slightly more accessible production (accessible in a ""doesn't sound like it was recorded live in a squat basement in 1983"" kind of way, that is) and a few out-of-the-ordinary flourishes. The guitar tone is perfect-- burly, metallic, clangy. Like countrymen <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5631-disfear/"" target=""_blank"">Disfear</a>, Driller Killer, and Anti Cimex, Wolfbrigade know how to keep it coming fast and deadly, and they have little time for progressive nonsense or grandiose concepts. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.</p>
<p>From the first second on, <i>Damned</i> lunges for the jugular, kicking into ""Feed the Flames"" and speeding through 11 more tracks in under 35 minutes. Songs hover around the two- to three-minute mark, cramming the perfect blend of old Swedish kängpunk, anarcho-crust, chunky Stockholm death metal, and, of course, Motörhead into short, purposeful blasts. The only real wild card here is ""Ride the Steel"", a startlingly melodic number that starts out dark and brooding, building into the expected d-beaten frenzy, but then changes things up halfway through with an instrumental melodic break lifted straight out of the Gothenburg songbook. It's all very recent Disfear (lend an ear to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jVwXXG9HPo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Get It Off""</a> and you'll see what I mean). Who got their epic melodeath parts mixed up in my crust? Though a bit unexpected, the genre-bending departure works. Tracks like ""From Beyond"", ""Peace of Mind"", and the Motörhead-baiting ""Catch 22"" keep up the melodic edge, but without as much of the gloom. Happily, Wolfbrigade seem content to have kept the experimental moments to a minimum, using them as accents rather than uncomfortable focuses. The old boys know what they're doing, and they know how to do it well. <i>Damned</i> is another worthy addition to their rock-solid catalog, and will surely make a more than welcome addition to any metalpunk's record pile. Now if only we can get them to knock off this ""not playing live"" thing.</p></div>"|16575.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16575-damned/|7.2|Kim Kelly

""Brooklyn, we go hard/ We on the look for the advantage, we work hard,"" she sang on ""Shove It"", the outer-borough banger that <a href=""http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=6&amp;ved=0CEwQtwIwBQ&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DXUGAmDTLPY0&amp;ei=UCegT-HZAZDG6AHB--SkAg&amp;usg=AFQjCNFGHlVvh4S2rsIn4qic_PvhYZsiBQ&amp;sig2=bpgpM1P7nYbxcm3As7AoLg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jay-Z eventually rapped over</a>. Part A&amp;R rep (she'd worked at Epic Records and once wrote material for singers like Lily Allen and Ashlee Simpson) and part punk (she fronted a new-wave grunge act from Philly called Stiffed), she wanted the corporate pop machine she mingled with to know she was batting for the creative underclass. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11483-santogold/"" target=""_blank"">Her debut</a> was chock full of declarations of authenticity like, ""That shit must hurt real bad/ Fakin' what you wish you had."" But what happens when your creative underclass hops in bed with the corporate pop machine on its own accord?</p>
<p>This is the dilemma White faces four years removed from her genre-blending debut. Four years that have blurred indie/corpo, authentic/fake, pop/rock dichotomies to the point of irrelevance. White's long-time producer Switch, for example, started out shaping the sound of the global underground as one half of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27663-major-lazer/"" target=""_blank"">Major Lazer</a> and wound up repurposing it for none other than Beyoncé. ""I remember when Switch went to work on Beyoncé's record,"" White said <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/45538-santigold-talks-long-awaited-new-album/"" target=""_blank"">in a recent interview</a>. ""I had actually... played Beyoncé Major Lazer's 'Pon de Floor' and she was like, 'That's amazing.'"" It was only a matter of time before that beat found itself on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15585-4/"" target=""_blank""><i>4</i></a>'s lead single ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBmMU_iwe6U"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Run the World (Girls)</a>"" and the accompanying music video racked up 133 million YouTube views. ""I was working with Switch at the time and I was like, 'OK, Switch, we're working tomorrow?'"" White explained. ""And he was like, 'Actually, I'm working with Beyoncé.'""</p>
<p>Perhaps realizing words like, ""Taint my mind but not my soul/ Tell you I got fire/ I won't sell it for no payroll"" would ring hollow, White has switched the overarching message to something a bit more personal this time around: Don't put me in a box, I'm in control, and I can be as many different things at the same time as I want to be. On the Kehinde Wiley-designed cover she appears as three different characters-- a valiant Napoleonic type next to a horse in a painting, a man perched arrogantly in a chair in a suit, and a sex kitten/warrior woman figure in a lamé one-piece. Unfortunately, the record doesn't deliver on the bold promise to explore a fantastical assortment of characters. Instead it offers a polished assortment of tidily global-sounding, mid-tempo pop tunes that seem to end before they ever kick off, strung together by a checklist of semi-impassioned capital-K Keywords: Youth, Machine, Riot, Fame, Freak, Pirate, Keepers. </p>
<p>A telling moment arrives on ""Freak Like Me"", a thorny, gyrating standout that jolts you from the record's lull. After a few listens you realize why: The track repurposes the tune of ""Rich Girl"", the adaptation of a <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBHZFYpQ6nc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Fiddler on the Roof </i>song</a> popularized by <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z432Pwci0-Y"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Louchie Lou &amp; Michie One</a> in the 1990s and then by <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rlNpWYQunY&amp;ob=av2e"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Gwen Stefani and Eve in 2004</a> (come to think of it, Santigold's ear for the crossover potential of ska, dub, and punk-pop shares more with Stefani than it does with M.I.A., someone to whom she's constantly compared). It doesn't spell good things for the rest of the album that one of its boldest-sounding songs grabs at familiar low-hanging fruit.</p>
<p>Despite the star-studded grab-bag of a production roster that includes Q-Tip, TV on the Radio's Dave Sitek, Boys Noize, and Yeah Yeah Yeahs' Nick Zinner, the record flattens into a glossy collection of effortless dub-tronica that's oddly lacking in texture. The closest White plays to actual make-believe is on ""Look at These Hoes"", a diss track with a lurking throttle of a beat over which Santi appropriates a snide rap persona, spitting ""Look at me/ Then look at these hoes/ These bitches ain't fuckin' with me."" The tension between earnestly pissed and mockingly caustic makes for the record's most engaging track. The remainder is primed for play in, say, the dressing rooms at a hip clothing chain or downtown hotel bar-- a fate that almost seems tragic given White's allegiance to opposing ideologies and aesthetic decisions. </p>
<p>At this point it's difficult to discern whether <i>Master of My Make-Believe</i> is disappointingly inert because it's actually unadventurous or because the rest of the world has simply caught up with White. Would the fusion of twinkling electronic dub with shreddier undertones on the anthemic ""Disparate Youth"" be more interesting if we didn't have bands like Sleigh Bells melting bubblegum sensibilities into punishing guitar shriek? Or if each week didn't bring a ceaseless wave of remixes pairing artists who never would have appeared in the same mp3 tag three years ago? They're questions White herself is yearning to answer, and struggling. She acknowledges it on the appropriately titled ballad ""The Riot's Gone"", singing: ""I've been searching for an angle/ For a cause I can't defend."" She'll admit she knows better than anyone that fight music is hard to make when you can't figure out what you're fighting against.</p></div>"|16570.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16570-master-of-my-make-believe/|6.3|Carrie Battan

But it was still easy to make sense of their instantly sprawling discography, as each record presented a distinct identity and intent: <i>Methodrone</i> was their bad-trip take on shoegazing drone-rock; <i>Their Satanic Majesties' Second Request</i> exuded a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/546-the-beatles/"" target=""_blank"">Beatles</a>-in-India splendor; <i>Take It From the Man!</i> channeled the sneering petulance of mid-1960s freakbeat; <i>Thank God for Mental Illness</i> captured Newcombe in busker-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1177-bob-dylan/"" target=""_blank"">Dylan</a> mode, and so on. Newcombe's influences were easy to parse on those early records, but at a time when the pop mainstream was starting to embrace electronica, and the initial promise of grunge had been diluted into corporatized alt-rock, Newcombe's fervent dedication to reviving these once-revolutionary musical forms constituted its own act of radicalism.</p>
<p>Much has been made of the Brian Jonestown Massacre's inter-band acrimony and revolving-door personnel, but truth is that initial creative surge was fueled by more or less the same core lineup. Since that cast had all but splintered by 1999, Newcombe has struggled to find the same kind of camaraderie, overhauling lineups, changing recording locales, and introducing new guest vocalists on an album-by-album basis. All that upheaval has resulted in more whimsical, exploratory records, ones that have opened up new sonic territory for the band (see: the disco/house beat pastiches of 2010's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14009-who-killed-sgt-pepper/"" target=""_blank""><i>Who Killed Sgt. Pepper?</i></a>), but have ultimately lacked the insurrectionary verve and focus of the BJM's 90s-era formation. As its title suggests, <i>Aufheben-- </i>a German term with <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aufheben"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">several, oppositional meanings</a>-- marks another change of scene and personnel for Newcombe, this time to East Berlin with a multicultural cast of session musicians. But the album also features the grounding influence of ex-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4048-spacemen-3/"" target=""_blank"">Spacemen 3</a> bassist Will Carruthers (a touring member since 2008) and BJM Mk. 1 member Matt Hollywood, the closest thing the autocratic Newcombe has ever had to a foil. Their presence could very well account for the fact that <i>Aufheben</i> is the band's most consistent, welcoming, and sonically lustrous album in years, stylistically of a piece with the acoustically driven, organ-swathed psychedelia of <i>Their Satantic Majesties' Second Request</i>, but updated with a more pronounced rhythmic thrust and Middle Eastern instrumental accents.</p>
<p>Where Hollywood once enjoyed a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8391-george-harrison/"" target=""_blank"">George Harrison</a>-esque allotment of two or three vocal turns per album, his contributions here are purely as a guitar player. But it's not like Newcombe's hogging the mic for himself; as per the BJM's recent track record, he spends the album's first half receding indecipherably into the mix or deferring to an unknown guest singing in a foreign language (in this case, Eliza Karmasalo, who supplies the airy Finnish lead vocal to the glacial, motorik pop of ""Viholliseni Maalla""). But what's missing here isn't so much Newcombe's voice and personality (which take a more central role in the album's second half) as a sense of dynamics or anthemic release. Newcombe is a master at turning the minimal into maximal, layering myriad swirling textures into a dizzying head-rush of a tune (see: ""Seven Kinds of Wonderful""), but crafty production only takes him so far. As richly rendered as songs like ""I Wanna Hold Your Other Hand"" and ""Clouds Are Lies"" may be, they pretty much reveal all their secrets right from the get-go and don't waver or intensify for their duration, without so much as introducing a chorus or a key change. And in the absence of any dramatic arc, the songs' running times become wholly arbitrary-- a point that Newcombe himself acknowledges when he fades out ""Gaz Hilarant"" abrupty after two uneventful, unintelligible verses. </p>
<p>Curiously, Newcombe saves his most fully realized melody for flautist Friederike Bienert on the atypical but surprisingly affecting instrumental ""Face Down on the Moon"", which posits an easy-listening union between Indian and English pastoral-psych traditions. And while the title of closer ""Blue Order New Monday"" reads like another case of Newcombe pillaging the rock canon for his own devious ends, the song actually counts as one of his most open-hearted gestures to date. As if to make up for his stinginess with the hooks elsewhere on <i>Aufheben</i>, Newcombe offers, by way of parting gift, a song that's all chorus, no verse, setting an optimistic sing-along refrain atop swells of strings, daydreamy piano taps, electronic frequencies, and a big, booming shuffle beat à la the Beatles' <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U14xSCKQEmM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""It's All Too Much""</a>. Sure, he probably didn't need to stretch it out past the seven-minute mark, but, in light of a career as tumultuous as his, you can't begrudge Newcombe for wanting to prolong this moment of bliss.</p></div>"|16563.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16563-the-brian-jonestown-massacre/|6.3|Stuart Berman

Nearly every lyric begins with a lonesome-sounding ""I"" that suggests all the time Schaaf's spent in his own head; the ones that don't mostly opt for a distant ""you,"" a direct address that still feels separated by the crackle of cellphone static or that anticipatory beat between texts. ""I am the elephant king/ But I am lonely,"" an unusually metaphorical Schaaf lets go around <i>Strange Land</i>'s one-minute mark, right as new bandmates Michael Tapper and Jon Natchez tumble into the frame. Schaff's a lonely soul, but on <i>Strange Land</i>, he's in good company.</p>
<p>The addition of drummer Tapper and jack-of-all-trades Natchez has opened up Yellow Ostrich's sound considerably. Natchez's subtle instrumental flourishes color in the spaces Yellow Ostrich's debut, <i>The Mistress</i>, drawing stark lines through, while Tapper's alternately tricky and tender rhythms help push along Schaaf's not-infrequent compositional shifts. He's still quite fond of the long, slow build, but Schaaf's songs have grown impressively dexterous, nimbly hopping from aching verse to pleading chorus while sidestepping overarrangement or stumbling constructions. Natchez's swaths of strings and hints of woodwind complement Schaaf's pleading, barely post-adolescent vocals particularly well, lending just the right kind of gravity to Schaff's effusive emoting without standing in its way.</p>
<p>This newfound musical sophistication's started to creep into Schaaf's lyrics, but only just. ""I want your love,"" goes the chorus of ""I Want Yr Love""; ""I got no time for you,"" he repeats, with a kind of conflicted desperation in his throat, on ""I Got No Time For You"". I haven't sleuthed out his DOB or anything, but Schaaf certainly seems young; save the daydreamy ""Elephant King"", his lyrics have the sort of diaristic, subtlety-be-damned feeling of those late teenage years when a curfew-skirting late-night drive home from a girlfriend's house feels like the kind of thing somebody ought to write a song about. The 29-year-old, tax-paying, catfood-buying me finds some of Schaaf's lyrical directness a bit pat, but the 19-year-old version-- as prone to bold declarations and romanticizing heartbreak as Schaaf-- would've lapped this stuff right up. Schaaf's coming live and direct from that age where you've finally seen enough to realize you haven't seen very much at all. ""I read about places I'll never see/ I sing about things that I'll never be,"" he sings on ""Wear Suits"", a missive from the mind of a guy who's slowly settling into his own place in the world.</p>
<p>And <i>Strange Land</i> still finds Schaaf and co. with plenty to figure out. Natchez and Tapper, steady hands that they are, feel like session men as much as proper bandmates; their subtlety's appreciated during the quieter moments, but the high drama of certain songs could very well prove dizzying were these arrangements a bit bolder. And Schaaf could probably stand to have his heart stepped on a couple-three more times to chase some of the cuddliness out of his lyrics; when ""Marathon Runner"" kicks off with a story about telling a friend to ""give up on her dreams"" (which, Schaaf admits, was ""mean""), no one north of voting age could be blamed for sprinting towards the skip button. But what Schaff's everyloner routine lacks in subtlety, it makes up in a certain fraught, occasionally uncomfortable relatability. Anyone who's ever spent hours on the phone or drove hundreds of miles in their car just to connect with somebody, anybody-- and who hasn't?-- will hear a little of themselves in <i>Strange Land</i> and, if only for a second, feel a little less alone.</p></div>"|16572.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16572-strange-land/|6.8|Paul Thompson

But the fall in popularity and prolificacy of stalwarts like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2385-r-kelly/"" target=""_blank"">R. Kelly</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27856-the-dream/"" target=""_blank"">The-Dream</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9061-ne-yo/"" target=""_blank"">Ne-Yo</a> has dovetailed with R&amp;B's embrace of-- or forced marriage to-- David Guetta's brand of house music, which in turn has elevated safe and malleable singers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10008-usher/"" target=""_blank"">Usher</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10805-chris-brown/"" target=""_blank"">Chris Brown</a> above the genre itself. Even <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10706-trey-songz/"" target=""_blank"">Trey Songz</a>, the current male R&amp;B star who has seen a rise in popularity despite foregoing a move towards dance music, is oppressively vanilla. The niche has been filled partly by rappers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake/"" target=""_blank"">Drake</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28309-j-cole/"" target=""_blank"">J. Cole</a>, who let their love of R&amp;B and songwriting seep deep into their music, with the former, of course, often singing himself.</p>
<p>If there's any light in the tunnel, it isn't coming (yet, at least) from artists like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29533-the-weeknd/"" target=""_blank"">the Weeknd</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29508-frank-ocean/"" target=""_blank"">Frank Ocean</a>, both of whom have presented singular points of view, but have only flirted with the radio and are still regarded by mainstream audiences as curios. But there is <a href=""http://www.officialmiguel.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Miguel</a>, a 25-year-old Los Angeles native who is currently a minor pop star trying to prove his staying power. He isn't a callback, though, to guys like Kelly or The-Dream, who, at least temporarily, reworked the lexicon of R&amp;B. In fact, the most unique and magnetic thing about Miguel's music is how hard it is to pin down, and just how deep and diverse his bag of tricks seems to be. This became starkly obvious on three fantastic singles (released across summer 2010 and spring 2011) from his debut album. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7PVhQPaFNY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""All I Want Is You""</a>, the lead, was dark and dusty in a way that recalled when hip-hop and R&amp;B started to approach each other in the 1990s; <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4GJVOMjCC4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Sure Thing""</a>, its follow-up and his biggest hit to date, nodded at neo-soul without losing its modernity; and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gt3QLI3XYtk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Quickie""</a> refixed reggae into something distinctly post-coital.</p>
<p>The key with Miguel's music is that nothing comes off as an experiment. Instead, he leaves you with the impression that he loves music and exploring his own mind equally. It's an approach that is refreshingly uncynical, and he carries it over to <i>Art Dealer Chic</i>, his recently released series of EPs. The three volumes comprise nine songs and just about 30 minutes of music, and despite a total throwaway track and two others that he reprises from earlier mixtapes, they contain some of the best R&amp;B music of the year, as well as further evidence that the man with no calling card isn't about to get lost in the shuffle anytime soon. Across the releases he's lovestruck, horny, self-centered, insecure, apocalyptic, and suspicious, and he impressively traverses almost enough sonic territory to match (although <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3397-prince/"" target=""_blank"">Prince</a> does loom large).</p>
<p>Let's hit the showstoppers first. ""Adorn"", the lead track off volume one, has the slink, sheen, and falsetto of the 1980s, but it's the way in which Miguel cuts through the grinding, whirring bass with radiant backing vocals that makes the song so beguiling. At just over two minutes it's a straight rush of endorphins. Then there's ""Arch n Point"" and ""...ALL"", the first two tracks from volume two, which encroach a bit on the Weeknd's cornering of dark, conflicted R&amp;B. The former is the project's sexiest song, with Miguel imagining fishnets and bottle service. It's built on stacked, heavy guitars that he softly ratchets up in intensity toward a subtle climax that indicates a confidence in his own songwriting (a more unsure artist probably would've unleashed an ill-advised solo). ""...ALL"" is Miguel's take on clubby R&amp;B, but instead of opting for the meathead bleat of Dr. Luke, he dips into organ-house as he finally turns his pen on himself, singing about his thirst for sucess, then questioning whether he's selfish before finally concluding, ""fuck it, everybody's selfish.""</p>
<p>Volume three doesn't quite scrape those heights, but it shows that Miguel can retain his singularity even when he's at his most referential. ""Party Life"" is a rather overt homage to Prince's ""1999"", but the track is constructed and sung in a way that acknowledges the Purple One fandom without donning a white blouse. There's also ""Candles in the Sun, Blowin' in the Wind"", a political, Marvin Gaye-ish track that wins out over its slight hamhandedness by using the vocabulary of hip-hop and approaching something like political corruption in the first place. The third volume, like the other two, contains one track that isn't up to snuff, and it's only that forgettable one-third that drags the entire collection down.</p>
<p>But the highs here are very high, and in whetting the appetite for his presumably forthcoming sophomore album, Miguel has maybe inadvertently set expectations sky-high. But if there's anyone who can handle it, it's this guy. While his peers are mostly either shamelessly chasing trends or burrowing deep underground, Miguel is straddling the line with songwriting that achieves singularity through its unpredictability. On ""…ALL"" he belts, ""I ain't afraid to fail/ Can't you tell?"" and very rarely do you see an artist sum up his or her own appeal so succinctly. Everyone in the major-label music business is scared as hell of failing; <i>Art Dealer Chic </i>is what happens when you're not. What a breath of fresh air.</p></div>"|16571.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16571-art-dealer-chic-vols-1-3/|7.8|Jordan Sargent

Even a glance tells you they're of a certain time and place, an era where song titles appeared on the front of a vinyl release so you knew exactly what you were getting, and where on the back those titles might reappear with a big block of text telling you why you should buy it. That approach was already something to invoke with a nod backwards when the band came together in the mid-1980s, and little surprise they gained the love of fellow pop classicists, most famously Morrissey, as much as post-Jesus and Mary Chain fuzz and hooks types. Heck, plenty of Americans of a certain age heard them and thought, ""Oh, the second coming of Blondie,"" and lord knows that group knew their 1960s pop, too.</p>
<p>Flash forward to the present and the number of bands that have used the Primitives as even unstated or implied role models abounds: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28196-best-coast/"" target=""_blank"">Best Coast</a>? <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19442-vivian-girls/"" target=""_blank"">Vivian Girls</a>? <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27360-the-pains-of-being-pure-at-heart/"" target=""_blank"">The Pains of Being Pure at Heart</a>? Start there and keep going. So to have the group around at all, still centered around the partnership of Paul Court on guitars and bowl cuts and Tracy Tracy on vocals and sharp style as well as veteran drummer Tig Williams and new member Raph Moore, is its own treat. Instead of trying to explicitly keep up with those in their wake, though, they're taking the lead of some tracks on last year's initial reunion EP and working solely in covers this time, mostly from the 1960s. At one time this might have seemed like a further retreat into the past, but now it's more of a lateral move, the kind of delve into relative obscurity that seems to suit the 21st century and its cycle of reissues and hyperspelunking.</p>
<p>While it would be nice to have a new album of originals one day, <i>Echoes &amp; Rhymes</i> is more than a curio. If it's not anywhere close to the speaker shredding of the Primitives' earliest days, it has that thick, rushed and energetic sparkle that still seems to be the ultimate sonic signifier of a dream of perfect pop, viewed in guitar, bass, and drums terms-- even when the Joe Meek orchestrations and thick keyboards take turns here and there. ""Panic"", originally by Reparata and the Delrons, serves as a lovely tone setter, and there's an immediate joy in hearing a song like ""Turn Off the Moon"", first sung by Sue Lyon, the lead actress from Stanley Kubrick's <i>Lolita</i>, or the massive surge of Jackie DeShannon-by-way-of-Olivia Newton-John's ""Till You Say You'll Be Mine"" with Williams' various drum fills as loud and perfect as Court's guitar.  Given the obscurity of the originals, there are moments of wondering what those older takes might sound like as the band then busts out another sharp remake: Hearing Tracy kick in the French for Laura Ulmer's ""Amoureux D'Une Affiche"" is one of those moments that initially surprises, but it only takes a second to hear that easy, never-buried bite in her voice.</p>
<p>That element is always present, since there's a clear sense of how Tracy is her own vocalist in her own right rather than simply redoing the songs in their original image-- if Court was always the prime songwriter, his words and her delivery were still something that actually felt right in the moment rather than simply the past redone. There's plenty of sass abounding on songs like LeGrand Mellon's ""Move It on Over""-- ""Never want to see you again/ So be gone by the time I count to 10,"" and then the countdown kicks in line by line-- but nothing cuts as sharply as ""Crash"" or ""Stop Killing Me"". Though Sandy Posey's ""Single Girl"" might come close as a clear flipside, a winsome, still self-possessed anthem to counteract the brasher moments.</p>
<p>Then again, there's also something so perfect in the fact that, after all, it's a slew of female singers and performers being covered, something more than a reclaiming of history from the expected approaches, something which lifts even the slower songs like Polly Niles' ""Sunshine in My Rainy Day Mind"". When Court takes his own vocal lead turns on Nico's ""I'm Not Sayin'"" and the concluding ""Wild Flower"", first done by the She Trinity, it's the kind of touch that both fits the band and the project, a reason to point out that there's something good here beyond simply looking at the 60s and thinking it was always going to be summed up by a lazy invocation of the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, the Beach Boys, and James Brown.</p></div>"|16569.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16569-echoes-and-rhymes/|7.5|Ned Raggett

Sometimes all it takes is one song. In the case of Baltimore's <a href=""http://lowerdens.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lower Dens</a>, who are fronted by onetime folk eccentric <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/289-jana-hunter/"" target=""_blank"">Jana Hunter</a>, that track was <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13005-lower-dens-brains/"" target=""_blank"">""Brains""</a>. Released in advance of this record, the single added krautrock and electronic touches to the group's signature guitar swirl and suggested a new dimension and a new confidence. Everything hit with more impact: the drumming was crisper, Hunter's singing was richer and more evocative, and there was an extra layer of prettiness, but also menace. The message seemed to be, ""Here's a band you can't ignore anymore.""</p>
<p><i>Nootropics</i> strengthens that argument, building on the promise of ""Brains"" and vastly widening the band's sonic palette. Richly detailed, dark, and ethereal, the album is a feast for sound-first listeners drawn to expressive shifts in color and tone. To suggest that it's a creative step forward for Lower Dens is not to knock their 2010 debut, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14339-twin-hand-movement/"" target=""_blank""><i>Twin-Hand Movement</i></a>, which was a fine album but pretty specific in its appeal. (A moody nighttime listen, ideal for a 2 a.m. drive home by yourself or a late-night glass of whisky.) <i>Nootropics</i> is at once more inclusive and varied, though. And the band achieves this by pulling a clever trick: taking some of the most well-loved elements of the rock canon and making them their own.</p>
<p>""I listened to <i>Radioactivity</i> by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2352-kraftwerk/"" target=""_blank"">Kraftwerk</a> pretty much constantly while writing this record, and... we listened to a lot of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1624-fripp-eno/"" target=""_blank"">Eno and Fripp</a> and the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Idiot_%28album%29"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Iggy Pop record that David Bowie produced</a>,"" Hunter <a href=""http://stereogum.com/1005691/progress-report-lower-dens/franchises/progress-report/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">said in an interview</a>. And you can certainly hear those influences at play. Robotic synths, ambient drift, stark percussion-- many of the touchstones of 1977 art rock are on display in tracks like ""Lamb"" and ""Candy"". It doesn't feel like by-the-numbers mixtape-ism, though, partly because Hunter's singing is too dynamic to allow for that. Her androgynous voice can be airy and lilting or times throaty and masculine, and it lends an eerie otherness to the songs. Even when backed by a simple motorik bassline, Hunter sounds beamed-in from somewhere else.</p>
<p>This is one of those albums that creates its own little sound world, and a lot of its appeal has to do with qualities like texture and atmosphere. These are terms so overused in music writing that they've nearly lost their meaning, but here they're important. Take for example the very tactile percussion of ""Alphabet Song"". Snares and cymbals click-click-click like someone with long, fake fingernails tapping on a car window. Or go back to ""Brains"", which does an excellent job of building tension and transferring energy with those outward-spinning guitars. For a while they kind of chime in place, but then right before the chorus hits, they step down an octave and there's an exhale. The mood changes and takes you along with it.</p>
<p>With so much attention on the sonics it can be easy to ignore the words, and actually I'd say the lyrical content is the record's least interesting aspect. In that <a href=""http://stereogum.com/1005691/progress-report-lower-dens/franchises/progress-report/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">same interview</a> from above, Hunter discussed the subject matter, going into some heady stuff about Dada and transhumanism and ""denying our animal selves."" I'm not sure what she meant, and I'm not sure that it matters. This isn't an album about a specific narrative, it's about sounds and colors and the way a synth tone or cryptic string of words hits you and makes you feel something. When the guitars are chugging and the drums are crackling and Hunter sings, ""When I finally let my guard down, I was in the middle of the sea and drowning,"" I don't know what she means exactly, but it gives me goosebumps. Every time.</p></div>"|16555.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16555-nootropics/|8.2|Joe Colly

They're almost almost an inversion of the perceived Instagram model for photographs: instead of artificially aging the now, it's the past blown up and made precise, the gaps in the ink strokes made readily apparent along with the clear signs of where further coloring stopped. For any cassette release from that time that's received a retrospective celebration, whether via Messthetics, Minimal Wave, or something else again, that feeling always seems to hang heavy over the end result, at once strange and slightly humorous, like it snuck into something bigger by accident. </p>
<p>Doubtless Newell, long settled into a continuing career of poet, essayist, and musician as a kind of across-the-Thames cousin of the admittedly more scabrous <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/21954-billy-childish/"" target=""_blank"">Billy Childish</a>, feels like that would be perfectly appropriate. As the liner notes describe, it wasn't that Newell and Elliott didn't want to keep their work hidden from the world but they probably didn't expect that efforts initially dubbed at home a few at a time would ever have more than a fleeting attention paid to them by similarly minded souls. Considering how immediate so much on these three albums are, though-- and, quite simply, how fun they often sound, regardless of lyrical intent at points-- it's almost hard to think they wouldn't have found some wider audience one way or another.</p>
<p>In retrospect, though, what's clear even from the start of <i>Blow Away Your Troubles</i>' ""Swinging London"" is how perfectly positioned the Cleaners' sound, or even more crucially their overall aesthetic was, in terms of a break between past and future. No measurable listening audience in 1981 beyond the DIY underground would have expected anything to sound like this did, with a mix of rough edges, distanced vocals, definite hooks, and unexpected mixing choices, plus interjections and diversions that harkened back to the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band and ""The Goon Show"" among other sources. (Not to mention songs that fully embrace those routes-- ""Alien"", with its recurrent dialogues between human and outer-space visitor, is one of the most ridiculous things around.) It's theoretically new wave if you squint, but not the major label or even most indie label kind.</p>
<p>Of course, as the double-vinyl <i>Blow Away Your Troubles</i>, originally released in 1981, rapidly establishes, it wasn't about obscurantism for its own sake-- it's a stretch to say that it would be obvious in later years that Andy Partridge would end up producing Newell based on the evidence of songs like ""A Blue Wave"" or the piano-and-metronome-paced ""Wivenhoe Bells"" telling of small incidents in a small town. But in its weird way Newell arrived first where <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4685-xtc/"" target=""_blank"">XTC</a> would end up, an implied tension having relaxed to allow strange humor, political unease, and breezy rather than frenetic melodies and choruses to set a new course. A song like ""Modern TV"", a kind of relative-across-the-water of Black Flag's ""TV Party"", is all about serenely catchy surf-derived choruses and distant keyboards, while a sense of something epic and mournful is all over ""Marilyn on a Train"", achieving a kind of casual grandeur on its verses in particular that any number of post-punk dreamers would probably have loved had they heard it. Even something like ""A Minimal Animal"", an attempt to tackle reggae via several kind of distances down to stretched-out and echoed vocals and the utter pisstake ""So This is Modern Jazz, Is It?""-- more like a bizarre scat-singing attempt from a long dead lounge-- all works perfectly in context.</p>
<p><i>On Any Normal Monday</i>, released in early 1982, found the Cleaners in slightly changed circumstances, its liner notes talking about Newell's acquiring a four-track machine and Elliott's increasing personal attention elsewhere. It's not quite the Newell solo show yet (especially considering that he put out both a stand-alone tape and an archival one pre-Cleaners with the Stray Trolleys soon thereafter), but things are a little clearer, a touch crisper, and maybe inevitably a touch less frenetic, though a newer version of ""Marilyn on a Train"" retains its elegant sweep. Admittedly songs like ""European War"" aren't meant to be giddy regardless, but the humor of ""Be an Idiot Popstar"" seems a touch less goony in all senses of the word. </p>
<p>By the time of <i>Midnight Cleaners</i>, which also came out in 1982, Elliott's appearances were even more sporadic and the genteel TV-theme feeling of ""This Rainy Decade"" heralds something that was increasingly Newell's own particular flag of convenience. Hearing a bit of winning guest saxophone as it first appears in the extended introduction to ""Corridor of Dreams"" seems strangely monumental in context, even if it was only a year since the duo's debut effort. But if songs like ""Only a Shadow"" and ""Time in Vain"" are more polished and straightforward power-pop efforts with a crisp, slightly thin sound and steady drumming as opposed to the wiggier songs that helped inaugurate the band to start with, there's always the slightly cryptic spoken word, sax, and beat mix of the title track and the shimmering rush of ""Factory Boy"" in contrast. Meanwhile, a new version of ""Wivenhoe Bells"", with bells, phone samples, and children's voices added to the energetic flow of the arrangement, nicely squares not-too-distant past and present.</p>
<p>Newell's later efforts as the Cleaners from Venus and in other ventures would continue to explore the possibilities of home pop/rock recording, much as other figures worldwide as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2318-chris-knox/"" target=""_blank"">Chris Knox</a> and the stalwart <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2930-r-stevie-moore/"" target=""_blank"">R.

But in its weird way Newell arrived first where <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4685-xtc/"" target=""_blank"">XTC</a> would end up, an implied tension having relaxed to allow strange humor, political unease, and breezy rather than frenetic melodies and choruses to set a new course. A song like ""Modern TV"", a kind of relative-across-the-water of Black Flag's ""TV Party"", is all about serenely catchy surf-derived choruses and distant keyboards, while a sense of something epic and mournful is all over ""Marilyn on a Train"", achieving a kind of casual grandeur on its verses in particular that any number of post-punk dreamers would probably have loved had they heard it. Even something like ""A Minimal Animal"", an attempt to tackle reggae via several kind of distances down to stretched-out and echoed vocals and the utter pisstake ""So This is Modern Jazz, Is It?""-- more like a bizarre scat-singing attempt from a long dead lounge-- all works perfectly in context.</p>
<p><i>On Any Normal Monday</i>, released in early 1982, found the Cleaners in slightly changed circumstances, its liner notes talking about Newell's acquiring a four-track machine and Elliott's increasing personal attention elsewhere. It's not quite the Newell solo show yet (especially considering that he put out both a stand-alone tape and an archival one pre-Cleaners with the Stray Trolleys soon thereafter), but things are a little clearer, a touch crisper, and maybe inevitably a touch less frenetic, though a newer version of ""Marilyn on a Train"" retains its elegant sweep. Admittedly songs like ""European War"" aren't meant to be giddy regardless, but the humor of ""Be an Idiot Popstar"" seems a touch less goony in all senses of the word. </p>
<p>By the time of <i>Midnight Cleaners</i>, which also came out in 1982, Elliott's appearances were even more sporadic and the genteel TV-theme feeling of ""This Rainy Decade"" heralds something that was increasingly Newell's own particular flag of convenience. Hearing a bit of winning guest saxophone as it first appears in the extended introduction to ""Corridor of Dreams"" seems strangely monumental in context, even if it was only a year since the duo's debut effort. But if songs like ""Only a Shadow"" and ""Time in Vain"" are more polished and straightforward power-pop efforts with a crisp, slightly thin sound and steady drumming as opposed to the wiggier songs that helped inaugurate the band to start with, there's always the slightly cryptic spoken word, sax, and beat mix of the title track and the shimmering rush of ""Factory Boy"" in contrast. Meanwhile, a new version of ""Wivenhoe Bells"", with bells, phone samples, and children's voices added to the energetic flow of the arrangement, nicely squares not-too-distant past and present.</p>

They're almost almost an inversion of the perceived Instagram model for photographs: instead of artificially aging the now, it's the past blown up and made precise, the gaps in the ink strokes made readily apparent along with the clear signs of where further coloring stopped. For any cassette release from that time that's received a retrospective celebration, whether via Messthetics, Minimal Wave, or something else again, that feeling always seems to hang heavy over the end result, at once strange and slightly humorous, like it snuck into something bigger by accident. </p>
<p>Doubtless Newell, long settled into a continuing career of poet, essayist, and musician as a kind of across-the-Thames cousin of the admittedly more scabrous <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/21954-billy-childish/"" target=""_blank"">Billy Childish</a>, feels like that would be perfectly appropriate. As the liner notes describe, it wasn't that Newell and Elliott didn't want to keep their work hidden from the world but they probably didn't expect that efforts initially dubbed at home a few at a time would ever have more than a fleeting attention paid to them by similarly minded souls. Considering how immediate so much on these three albums are, though-- and, quite simply, how fun they often sound, regardless of lyrical intent at points-- it's almost hard to think they wouldn't have found some wider audience one way or another.</p>
<p>In retrospect, though, what's clear even from the start of <i>Blow Away Your Troubles</i>' ""Swinging London"" is how perfectly positioned the Cleaners' sound, or even more crucially their overall aesthetic was, in terms of a break between past and future. No measurable listening audience in 1981 beyond the DIY underground would have expected anything to sound like this did, with a mix of rough edges, distanced vocals, definite hooks, and unexpected mixing choices, plus interjections and diversions that harkened back to the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band and ""The Goon Show"" among other sources. (Not to mention songs that fully embrace those routes-- ""Alien"", with its recurrent dialogues between human and outer-space visitor, is one of the most ridiculous things around.) It's theoretically new wave if you squint, but not the major label or even most indie label kind.</p>

Were they called Inga Copeland and Roy Blunt? Or perhaps Karen Glass and Roy Nnawuchi? For their debut full-length on <a href=""http://www.hyperdub.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Hyperdub</a>, the duo present themselves as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30373-dean-blunt-inga-copeland/"">Dean Blunt and Inga Copeland</a>. Just don't bank on those being their real names, or any kind of indication of a settled moniker for future releases. Notions of a fluctuating self are a crucial part of the world in which Blunt/Copeland choose to operate, although <i>Black Is Beautiful</i> throws up greater thematic ties than their previous work, with the pair gently reeling in its tendency to shape shift its sound into oblivion. There's still a crude, sun-warped skew to their vision. But releasing this album as Dean Blunt and Inga Copeland makes it feel like a layer of mystery has been removed, and that's mirrored in the subtle erosion of their musical identity crisis. </p>
<p>Despite the lurch toward refinement, there are still acres of ambiguity to get lost in here. Blunt/Copeland don't even pose questions without answers. It's more like getting asked a question that trails off halfway through the conversation, never to return to its original intent. The lack of traditional track titles, aside from the opening ""(Venice Dreamway)"", positions this as a singular work that doesn't lend itself well to being broken down into its various parts. Outside of that opening cut, which begins by slowing down the coughing intro of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/379-black-sabbath/"">Black Sabbath</a>'s <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3YtvuZ2-I0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Sweet Leaf""</a> to an asthmatic wheeze, each track is numbered from 2-15. It's often reminiscent of the dream-pop stencils <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/204-ar-kane/"">A.R. Kane</a> sketched out in the late 1980s, especially when they let dub templates delicately seesaw between the dreamy and the discordant. <i>Black Is Beautiful </i>shares the same kind of chimerical idealization of pop as A.R. Kane’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11653-69-i/""><i>69</i></a>, where everything is set up to shoot into the heavens.</p>
<p>Only three tracks of the 15 make it over the three-minute mark, causing the record to feel like a wander through the fragments of Blunt and Copeland's collective psyches. At times it can be frustrating-- their <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13473-track-2/"">reimagining</a> of Donnie &amp; Joe Emerson's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONIJXHvoynw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Baby""</a> is such a gracefully poised sci-fi torch song that it would surely benefit from being stretched out over a greater expanse of time. ""11"" sparks a similar feeling. Elsewhere, they have a keen sense of how to turn lo-fi tools to their advantage, with the in-the-red vocal cooing on ""5"" matched by the same kind of boxed-in musical ambition <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28716-ariel-pinks-haunted-graffiti/"">Ariel Pink</a> displayed on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6554-worn-copy/""><i>Worn Copy</i></a>. There's a playfulness at work here too, with atom-sized chunks of sound deployed in the shorter tracks, shards of dialogue from sources unknown left to loop into infinity, and plenty of heavily treated audio ephemera cut and pasted into the mix.</p>
<p>But there's a natural path forged between all the shifts, a sense that the abstraction feeds off the structure and vice versa. As such, <i>Black Is Beautiful</i> nears something that could readily be branded as Blunt and Copeland's aesthetic, which is likely to cause them as much consternation as it might pleasure. The key difference is the transformation from throwing a spanner in the works out of a gleeful kind of perversion to that spanner being an integral part of the overall picture. It's there when ""9"" is cut dead in its tracks to bring in a sample of a newsreader, only to quickly resume where it left off. And it's there in the outstanding centerpiece ""10"", which causes Copeland's vocal to disappear in the rearview mirror, getting obliterated entirely when the track is stonewalled by spacious stabs of noise. Occasionally the world needs to be blocked out to make sense of it. <i>Black Is Beautiful</i> undergoes that blocking-out process and finds no kind of sense anywhere, instead focusing on the gloriously messy sift through the clutter we go through just to approach a tiny semblance of meaning. </p></div>"|16566.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16566-black-is-beautiful/|7.4|Nick Neyland

Spx-- the peculiar name is a pseudonym, invented to protect a devout and apparently disapproving family-- has the disoriented air of someone who's come further than she expected, and sooner: In interviews, <a href=""http://www.prefixmag.com/features/cold-specks/prefix-artist-to-watch-cold-specks/64448/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">she's shown some difficulty recalling the names of all her new bandmates</a> and confesses she still occasionally gets ill before live performances.</p>
<p>When she begins singing, you understand the fuss: If you were, say, Frankie Sharp from Sharp Records, this is the sort of voice that makes you whip the big limo around. Rough-edged and dark but still velvety, with fluid hints of gospel-- it's a transfixing instrument, and it's the single ember glowing at the center of her chilly debut, the enigmatically titled<i> I Predict a Graceful Expulsion</i>. Her band, with the ingrained tact of session pros, defer to her, surrounding her with muted-gray washes of piano, guitar, cello, and distant horns. The songs gather weight slowly and gracefully, and the atmosphere feels instantly familiar from the last two <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3006-the-national/"" target=""_blank"">National</a> records. It's similarly comforting; this is a peerless Sunday-afternoon record, the kind you cradle like a chipped mug of tea in a heatless apartment.</p>
<p>What elevates <i>I Predict a Graceful Expulsion</i> above pure comfort food, however, is how it subtly tugs against the big, major-network-drama payoff for which it feels custom-built. There's a naggingly elusive quality to the songs that troubles as much as it soothes; Spx's voice is elemental, and her pleas tap into universal language-- bad seeds, sons and daughters, dying leaves. But there's a sense of snow-blind disorientation, of standing in the middle of a featureless expanse, that deepens the record's loneliness and heightens the sense of emotional stakes.</p>
<p>""Every map is blank,"" Spx mutters on ""Blank Maps"". ""I put my hands over my chest/ Sons and daughters,"" goes the refrain on the swelling, spellbinding ""Winter Solstice"", and though it's howled like gospel, its meaning remains as private as silent prayer. The big chorus to ""Blank Maps"" is Spx howling ""I am, I am/ A goddamn believer,"" and even though you have no sense what she believes, you feel swept up completely, borne along by her strange ardor.</p></div>"|16561.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16561-cold-specks-i-predict-a-graceful-expulsion/|7.7|Jayson Greene

Elverum and Kozelek have maintained comparative levels of prolificacy in recent years, implementing subtle changes to their sounds across frequent releases. Talbot hasn't put out an album since 2007, and his records often seemed to bear a blocky stylistic relationship to each other; the focused, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2801-mogwai/"" target=""_blank"">Mogwai</a>-gone-psych folk of his last album, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10669-the-western-lands/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Western Lands</i></a>, followed the textbook gothy strains of 2005's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3642-fires-in-distant-buildings/"" target=""_blank""><i>Fires in Distant Buildings</i></a>. While <i>The Ghost in Daylight</i> purports to continue Gravenhurst's themes of ""compulsion, degradation, and the possibility of transcendence,"" it represents another transition to a more soothing tone, adding an icy despair to Talbot's earlier folk-oriented releases. </p>
<p>There's a delicate alchemy to <i>The Ghost in Daylight</i> that can feel precious and a tad forced when compared to <i>The Western Lands</i>, which easily navigated torrid intensity and softer sounds within a single song. The mellotrons, optigans, and synthesizers employed here hang like a silvery mist atop the cyclical fingerpicking that makes up the majority of the album, which either soothes or lulls, depending on your predilection for such softness. It's tempting to allude to a kind of ""Instagram effect"" on some of these songs, particularly when you consider how ""(Carousel interlude)""-- the sound of a swirling pump organ obscured by sprays of hiss-- follows ""In Miniature"", the most unaffected track, but which sings of trying to ""capture the face of a killer,"" ""capture and frame every color,"" with ""each portrait a lifetime in miniature."" ""Fitzrovia"" ends talking of riots preserved ""In sepia and monochrome/ Double exposure, stop-motion.""</p>
<p>Much here drags on far too long without capturing any particularly exciting colors-- the alluring <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/"" target=""_blank"">Eno</a>-like waves at the end of ""Islands"" barely compensate for the saggy, burbling drones that sink the endings of ""Fitzrovia"" and ""The Ghost of Saint Paul"", which sounds like a windchime tuned to play modem noises. As has been written before, Talbot's voice is too benign to carry any great import-- at its most potent, it's a distant cousin of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1826-girls/"" target=""_blank"">Girls</a>' Christopher Owens, with the odd chorus key change providing an arresting moment-- meaning the instrumentation has to do the work for him. But happily, Talbot occasionally lets his old aggressive streak in to rough up the end of a few numbers: the swirling psych guitar at the end of opener ""Circadian"" makes like a mythical, masculine beast tramping through a suburban forest's lingering fog. The unusual (for Talbot) spindly electronic grind of ""Islands"" conjures a space for a dramatic vocal like that of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28423-future-islands/"" target=""_blank"">Future Islands</a>' Samuel T. Herring, but instead fills it with a kind of digitized <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4105-slowdive/"" target=""_blank"">Slowdive</a> echo. The end of ""The Prize"" is knotted into bold metallic ribbons by a fierce violin, a rare use of strings from an artist who'd previously intentionally excluded them from his compositions in case of obvious emotional signposting. He pulls them off, too, sounding not mawkish or sentimental, but gracefully triumphant. </p>
<p>If much of <i>The Ghost in Daylight</i> is underplayed, and occasionally overly subtle, one of its successes lies in how Talbot's lyrics celebrate achievements of the human spirit in others, in a gentle and detached fashion. In ""The Ghost of Saint Paul"", Talbot plainly pays tribute to ""the brave/ To all those resisting,"" and counsels against inadvertent collaboration through inactivity on ""The Foundry"" (the opening of which really sounds like something from Mogwai's recent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15810-earth-division/"" target=""_blank""><i>Earth Division</i></a> EP). As a once-in-a-half-decade demonstration of Talbot's vital signs, <i>The Ghost</i> isn't necessarily compelling enough to make you want to hang around for a follow-up, but the vitriol of a line like, ""If you let them burn books, you'll let them burn bodies,"" is a strong sign of life at least.</p></div>"|16560.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16560-the-ghost-in-daylight/|6.2|Laura Snapes

Because isn't <i>Fevers and Mirrors </i>ultimately critic-proof? After all, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/941-fevers-and-mirrors/"" target=""_blank"">while reviewing it</a> 12 years ago for Pitchfork, Taylor M. Clark questioned whether <a href=""http://www.conoroberst.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Conor Oberst</a>'s mortal frame could withstand his all-consuming ambition, called the vocals ""hypothermic,"" and debated whether the record was more narcissistic or solipsistic. I actually agree with him-- I just also happen to think those are some of <i>Fevers and Mirrors</i>' most uniquely compelling qualities. And how can you account for the emotional attachment listeners have to this thing? The symbolic significance of <i>Fevers and Mirrors</i>' title boils down to how, in self-reflection, we reveal only the ailments which we project. And if this is somehow your first experience with Bright Eyes, I'd suggest you take a gander at songmeanings.net, where the dozen songs here are among the most commented-upon in the site's archives. This thing causes our internal mirrors to reflect some <i>fucked-up </i>fevers.</p>
<p>As such, there's the temptation to use this, the culmination of Saddle Creek's reissue of Oberst's earliest Bright Eyes material, as a review of memories rather than music. The worry is that this will somehow be ineffective without my giving you a couple of Facebook pages of girls I knew in college and my scratched CD which skipped about two minutes into ""A Song to Pass the Time"". But, nah. <i>Fevers and Mirrors </i>isn't degraded from being removed from the bullshit of your youth, and in any context it's a tremendous record that is ""critic-proof"" in the same way Violent Femmes, <i>Pinkerton</i>, and, yes, the Smiths are. Scoff if you must, but let me ask you this: How many people do you know got into Morrissey as teens? Okay, now how many got started in their 30s?</p>
<p>That said, Oberst and I are the same age and neither of us has outgrown <i>Fevers and Mirrors</i>: On his end, you'll never hear a live performance of ""The Calendar Hung Itself…"" as something done out of obligation. And in light of recent releases as divergent as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16512-death-grips-the-money-store/"" target=""_blank"">Death Grips' <i>The Money Store </i></a>and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14880-my-beautiful-dark-twisted-fantasy/"" target=""_blank"">Kanye West's <i>My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</i></a>, I've come to understand <i>Fevers and Mirrors</i>' magnetism as an example of how I'm drawn to records where something really feels like it's at stake, records that <i>sound </i>unstable. That's certainly the case here. Up to this point, Oberst had released some decent material culminating in <i>Letting Off the Happiness </i>(his <i>On Avery Island </i>to <i>Fevers' In the Aeroplane Over the Sea</i>)<i>,</i> but beyond that, his work as Commander Venus and solo was mostly notable for the youth of the person who made it. It was all very precocious and little of it stands up now. </p>
<p>Still, in 2000, it put Oberst at the center of concentric, radioactive areas anticipating their impending ""moment"": oversharing culture, emo, Omaha, Saddle Creek, Bright Eyes. It's here where the weight of being essentially synonymous with Bright Eyes starts to dawn on Oberst, and fortunately for the listener, there was no separation between where he was an artist and as a person. Yes, it's a record about breaking up (that is, if your affections are requited in the first place), unfulfilled dreams, real nightmares, the burden of talent, and the encroaching dread of a future where nothing substantial ever changes within you. All of the things that get judged as #whitepeopleproblems by other white people who apparently had their shit together before they could legally drink. Play <i>Fevers and Mirrors </i>for someone who served in a war or underwent a serious medical procedure, and they'd probably tell Oberst to snap out of it. Indeed, you learn later in your years that, as Morrissey put it, ""there are worse things in life than never being someone's sweetie,"" but in the thrall of <i>Fevers, </i>sometimes these are the kind of things that <i>do </i>feel like the end of the world for at least an hour.</p>
<p>Focus on his imperfect pitch, and, yes, Oberst isn't a technically proficient singer. But on <i>Fevers</i>, he became remarkable at controlling <i>how</i> he wants to express himself while appearing no more capable of controlling <i>what</i> he's feeling than he is the sun-- another symbol used throughout <i>Mirrors</i>, mostly envied for the pathetic predictability of its rise and fall. Like many of his LPs that would follow, <i>Fevers </i>begins with a very long and quiet solo performance overlain by sampled dialogue, and within five minutes, Oberst has no idea why he's even bothering, heavily sighing through one of the many perfect syntheses of thought and tone: ""Once the page of a calendar turns it's no more/ So tell me then what was it for?"" This demonstration of nihilism is short-lived obviously, and the rest of <i>Fevers </i>is spent purposefully thrashing within the straitjacket of one's self.</p>
<p>It's unfairly criticized as one-note whining, but on the contrary, <i>Fevers </i>is a record where seemingly every form of self-loathing is in play. It starts immediately after Oberst's premature epitaph with ""The Calendar Hung Itself…"", a streaking, disintegrating comet of emotional immolation. I don't think Oberst ever got as purely angry as he did here, and no matter what vitriol he spewed at the government, the social contract, or an errant lover from there on out, nothing could compare to the hatred he turned on himself. There's a bit of Elliott Smith's plainspoken catatonia on ""Something Vague"", where Oberst sighs, ""now and again, it seems worse than it is/ But mostly the view is accurate."" By ""Haligh, Haligh, a Lie, Haligh"", he manages a chuckle at the futility of trusting in another, but sarcasm proves to be a terrible defense mechanism; a friend tells him on the phone, ""no, it's just some guy she's been hanging out with/ I don't know, the past couple weeks I guess,"" and in repeating those words, Oberst's voice cracks with the quiver of a young man having to carry on a conversation as if he's not being slowly robbed of his will to live.    </p>
<p>So, absolutely-- <i>Fevers and Mirrors </i>is the kind of record you're meant to commiserate with, or at the very least, let its misery make your own seem kinda manageable. But let's be perfectly clear that there's actual music on this thing too, and rarely is it less than fantastic. Thus far, Oberst's career has been bookended by an ambition to tap into the eternal truth of folk music, and there are vestiges of public-domain melodies that can't help but pour out when using a certain progression: ""A Song to Pass the Time"" sidles awfully close to ""The Gambler"", ""Something Vague"" morphs into a close reading of ""No Woman, No Cry"". And yet Oberst, his band, and house producer Mike Mogis create something wholly identifiable as a ""Saddle Creek sound,"" testing their capabilities for a deceptively diverse and always engaging sonic experience.</p>
<p>Looking back, what stands out is how little relation it has to emo or just about anything.  There is no Fugazi in Bright Eyes, no Sunny Day Real Estate, no punk rock, to be honest. And there's no Bob Dylan either and crucially <i>much </i>less Jeff Mangum than in the past, at least musically. Some songs here ride a single melody for their entirety in service of Oberst's words; others explode into nimble choruses, and the arrangements are every bit as volatile as the narrator: ""The Calendar Hung Itself…"" moves in lockstep with Oberst's breathless and nervy howling, its Latin churn interrupted by buzzing G-funk synths, clinking percussion, and before its climactic verse, what sounds like Q-bert falling to his death. ""Sunrise, Sunset"" predates Beirut's fixation with klezmer but finds little comfort in nostalgia, punctuated by distorted pummeling and rupturing <i>Fevers</i>' quieter second half. The opening line of electric piano on ""The Movement of a Hand"" undergoes subtle mitosis throughout its four minutes, accumulating an unnerving alien beauty as it layers over itself. Though hardly a big-budget affair, Mogis' production sounds absolutely perfect in recreating the scenes set by Oberst's lyrics, warm and tactile but with an unsettling cabin fever effect-- long overdue for this vinyl reissue. Intoning, ""this barren land is alive tonight,"" ""Arienette"" reimagines the Omaha plains as a claustrophobic hell filled with bloodthirsty predators and paranoid prey, ""Haligh, Haligh, a Lie, Haligh"" mills about a disheveled apartment, ""When the Curious Girl Realizes She Is Under Glass"" bangs at a piano in drunken disgust. Like many other teen headphone symphonies, from <i>Dark Side of the Moon </i>to <i>Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness</i>, <i>Fevers and Mirrors </i>is a world unto itself, even if it just happens to be a somewhat large city stuck in the middle of Nebraska.</p>
<p>While we're on the subject of how <i>Fevers </i>creates its own universe, at this point, we must talk about ""An Attempt to Tip the Scales"". The song itself is perfectly fine, if one of <i>Fevers</i>' least substantial. Nah, this is all about the radio interview. I debated whether or not to put that in quotes because I think there is value to the fact that some listeners continue to believe it's real. But, spoiler alert: Knowing that the DJ is actually Matt Silcock of labelmates Lullaby for the Working Class and ""Conor Oberst"" is played by Todd Fink of the Faint rightfully puts it alongside ""The $20 Sack Pyramid"" and ""Welcome to Purple Haze"" as one of the funniest skits ever put to tape. The rapport between the sycophantic, unprepared DJ and the pissy, entitled artist gets increasingly more hysterical as it goes along, and for the ease of transcription, I'll quote only the jokes made at Oberst's expense, of which there are many: ""My mother drowned one [brother] every year for five consecutive years. They were all named Padraic… they all got one song,"" ""I want people to feel sorry for me. I like the feel of the burn of the audience's eyes on me when I'm whispering all my darkest secrets into the microphone."" It drives home the point that, like most young adults, Oberst can sense the ridiculousness of his own bullshit even while in progress; earlier on ""The Center of the World"", completely dumbfounded by his own inability to cope with seemingly trivial circumstances, he's left to scream ""THIS ISN'T HAPPENING! HAPPENING! HAPPENING!"" It bears repeating: on a record often accused of taking itself too seriously, its creator allows his friends to conduct what's basically a five-minute roast. As such, it's the ultimate embodiment of the record's title, holding a mirror up to Oberst's critics who said he needs to get over himself.</p>
<p>The <i>There Is No Beginning to the Story </i>EP is included in this reissue, and it functions less as an appendage to <i>Fevers </i>than a commencement speech on a stage of Oberst's artistic development. In very tangible ways, it sets the stage for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/937-lifted-or-the-story-is-in-the-soil-keep-your-ear-to-the-ground/"" target=""_blank""><i>Lifted</i></a>-- for one thing, its title and several lyrics sprinkled throughout are quoted later on, and most obvious is ""From a Balance Beam"", the first song on <i>There Is No Beginning </i>and one that would also appear on <i>Lifted. </i>Though undoubtedly the work of Conor Oberst, it wouldn't fit on <i>Fevers </i>at all-- the production sounds noticeably more expensive, with Mogis learning how to apply a cool shimmer to mandolins, field snares, and most crucially Oberst's voice. More notably, ""From a Balance Beam"" is every bit as wordy and fatalistic as what came before, but whether it's the melody (one of the best Oberst has written) or just the breezy ambience, it actually sounds incredibly optimistic.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">It's by and large the best thing here, which isn't to say the EP's not worth your time. <i>There Is No Story</i> just can't help but be dwarfed by its immediate surroundings. Nonetheless, it does give insight to the places where Bright Eyes would go in the future-- ""Messenger Bird's Song"" anticipates the overreaching, tremulous intimacy of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11683-im-wide-awake-its-morning-digital-ash-in-a-digital-urn/"" target=""_blank""><i>I'm Wide Awake, It's Morning</i></a>, while ""We Are Free Men"" indicates the deeper, more theatrical vocals Oberst would experiment with on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11683-im-wide-awake-its-morning-digital-ash-in-a-digital-urn/"" target=""_blank""><i>Digital Ash in a Digital Urn</i></a>. It also contains seedlings for a couple of melodies he would incidentally reprise. ""Loose Leaves"" is a rare time where he obscures his words with a distorted microphone, which is a shame as the lyrics point toward an incisive snark that outward-looking records like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10095-cassadaga/"" target=""_blank""><i>Cassadaga </i></a>and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15111-the-peoples-key/"" target=""_blank""><i>The People's Key </i></a>couldn't quite manage without sounding pedantic. It closes on a Neil Young cover, which is less important for how it's executed than what it meant: Oberst was starting to place himself within the lineage of rock royalty and deal with the expectations that came from outside his immediate group of friends and collaborators. It's the fissure that ultimately separates everything that came before and after for Bright Eyes.</p>
<p>So is <i>Fevers and Mirrors</i> the best Bright Eyes record? Some days I think it is, but the important thing is that Oberst gives you options, and just about everything he's done since-- even the hamfisted political punk of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1066-desaparecidos/"" target=""_blank"">Desaparecidos</a> and the misguided democracy of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27767-conor-oberst-and-the-mystic-valley-band/"" target=""_blank"">the Mystic Valley Band</a>-- is at the very least an attempt not to repeat himself. He's become oddly undervalued even if I doubt whether he has another masterpiece in him. Depending on my mood, I prefer the monomaniacal scale of <i>Lifted</i> or the electro-goth narcosis of <i>Digital Ash in a Digital Urn</i>, and I get what others see in <i>I'm Wide Awake, It's Morning</i>, a record I find to be highly overrated on account of its playing by someone else's rules for once-- it was there where Oberst really attempted to be the ""next Dylan"" or ""next Gram Parsons"" rather than the only Conor Oberst. Which is exactly what we got on <i>Fevers and Mirrors</i>, a record steeped in roots, yet wholly of the moment, intelligent but prone to indefensible emotion, a very personal work made amongst talented friends. Most people discover <i>Fevers and Mirrors </i>at a time when they're being bombarded with the canon, and the recognition of something that feels utterly <i>yours</i> instead of received wisdom created a true cult of admirers and imitations who had the same white-light experience as myself: When I first heard <i>Fevers and Mirrors</i>, it sounded exactly like the kind of music I'd want to make. Thankfully, Bright Eyes did it, so I didn't have to.</p></div>"|16532.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16532-bright-eyes-fevers-mirrors-there-is-no-beginning-to-the-story-ep/|9.0|Ian Cohen

Because isn't <i>Fevers and Mirrors </i>ultimately critic-proof? After all, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/941-fevers-and-mirrors/"" target=""_blank"">while reviewing it</a> 12 years ago for Pitchfork, Taylor M. Clark questioned whether <a href=""http://www.conoroberst.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Conor Oberst</a>'s mortal frame could withstand his all-consuming ambition, called the vocals ""hypothermic,"" and debated whether the record was more narcissistic or solipsistic. I actually agree with him-- I just also happen to think those are some of <i>Fevers and Mirrors</i>' most uniquely compelling qualities. And how can you account for the emotional attachment listeners have to this thing? The symbolic significance of <i>Fevers and Mirrors</i>' title boils down to how, in self-reflection, we reveal only the ailments which we project. And if this is somehow your first experience with Bright Eyes, I'd suggest you take a gander at songmeanings.net, where the dozen songs here are among the most commented-upon in the site's archives. This thing causes our internal mirrors to reflect some <i>fucked-up </i>fevers.</p>
<p>As such, there's the temptation to use this, the culmination of Saddle Creek's reissue of Oberst's earliest Bright Eyes material, as a review of memories rather than music. The worry is that this will somehow be ineffective without my giving you a couple of Facebook pages of girls I knew in college and my scratched CD which skipped about two minutes into ""A Song to Pass the Time"". But, nah. <i>Fevers and Mirrors </i>isn't degraded from being removed from the bullshit of your youth, and in any context it's a tremendous record that is ""critic-proof"" in the same way Violent Femmes, <i>Pinkerton</i>, and, yes, the Smiths are. Scoff if you must, but let me ask you this: How many people do you know got into Morrissey as teens? Okay, now how many got started in their 30s?</p>
<p>That said, Oberst and I are the same age and neither of us has outgrown <i>Fevers and Mirrors</i>: On his end, you'll never hear a live performance of ""The Calendar Hung Itself…"" as something done out of obligation. And in light of recent releases as divergent as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16512-death-grips-the-money-store/"" target=""_blank"">Death Grips' <i>The Money Store </i></a>and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14880-my-beautiful-dark-twisted-fantasy/"" target=""_blank"">Kanye West's <i>My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</i></a>, I've come to understand <i>Fevers and Mirrors</i>' magnetism as an example of how I'm drawn to records where something really feels like it's at stake, records that <i>sound </i>unstable. That's certainly the case here. Up to this point, Oberst had released some decent material culminating in <i>Letting Off the Happiness </i>(his <i>On Avery Island </i>to <i>Fevers' In the Aeroplane Over the Sea</i>)<i>,</i> but beyond that, his work as Commander Venus and solo was mostly notable for the youth of the person who made it. It was all very precocious and little of it stands up now. </p>
<p>Still, in 2000, it put Oberst at the center of concentric, radioactive areas anticipating their impending ""moment"": oversharing culture, emo, Omaha, Saddle Creek, Bright Eyes. It's here where the weight of being essentially synonymous with Bright Eyes starts to dawn on Oberst, and fortunately for the listener, there was no separation between where he was an artist and as a person. Yes, it's a record about breaking up (that is, if your affections are requited in the first place), unfulfilled dreams, real nightmares, the burden of talent, and the encroaching dread of a future where nothing substantial ever changes within you. All of the things that get judged as #whitepeopleproblems by other white people who apparently had their shit together before they could legally drink. Play <i>Fevers and Mirrors </i>for someone who served in a war or underwent a serious medical procedure, and they'd probably tell Oberst to snap out of it. Indeed, you learn later in your years that, as Morrissey put it, ""there are worse things in life than never being someone's sweetie,"" but in the thrall of <i>Fevers, </i>sometimes these are the kind of things that <i>do </i>feel like the end of the world for at least an hour.</p>
<p>Focus on his imperfect pitch, and, yes, Oberst isn't a technically proficient singer. But on <i>Fevers</i>, he became remarkable at controlling <i>how</i> he wants to express himself while appearing no more capable of controlling <i>what</i> he's feeling than he is the sun-- another symbol used throughout <i>Mirrors</i>, mostly envied for the pathetic predictability of its rise and fall.

This demonstration of nihilism is short-lived obviously, and the rest of <i>Fevers </i>is spent purposefully thrashing within the straitjacket of one's self.</p>
<p>It's unfairly criticized as one-note whining, but on the contrary, <i>Fevers </i>is a record where seemingly every form of self-loathing is in play.

By ""Haligh, Haligh, a Lie, Haligh"", he manages a chuckle at the futility of trusting in another, but sarcasm proves to be a terrible defense mechanism; a friend tells him on the phone, ""no, it's just some guy she's been hanging out with/ I don't know, the past couple weeks I guess,"" and in repeating those words, Oberst's voice cracks with the quiver of a young man having to carry on a conversation as if he's not being slowly robbed of his will to live.    </p>

""I'm so bashful,"" he sings over <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13285-bashful/"" target=""_blank"">a song</a> named for the shy emotion, right before he actually offers the girl in question a cream soda. He's not a twee, toe-digging type, however: His presence and his voice are clear, calm, disarming. ""I mean when I say/ You're beautiful,"" he sings tenderly on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13433-igoyh/"" target=""_blank"">""lgoyh""</a>, and there is a glowing sincerity in his voice. For a soft-spoken 24-year-old, he carries himself with remarkable confidence, which radiates through his music with a kind of healing quality.</p>
<p>His new EP, <i>Meantime</i>, is an unabashedly beautiful, even sensuous 17 minutes of music: Sound layers are introduced like deal clinchers in a slow seduction. Kwes began as a producer of other people's music (Speech Debelle, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27685-micachu/"" target=""_blank"">Micachu</a>) before he decided to become the focus of his own productions, and <i>Meantime</i> breathes quietly with his attention to detail. Beneath a serene surface, all four songs bubble intricately. Listening to it in headphones lets you appreciate Kwes' understanding of spacing in the mix, the comforting swirl of these songs.</p>
<p>To comfort seems to be one of Kwes's main goals as a songwriter. On ""Bashful"", he's meeting the gaze of an older woman head-on and telling her, ""I know I may be young to you, but I want to prove/ You may think what I say isn't true."" On ""lgoyh"", he croons, this time to a seemingly younger woman, ""Don't waste too many tears/ On those energies/ You have too many years ahead of you/ And not too many before you."" He's capable of more than just sweet nothings too: the surreal ""Honey"", the only other full song, appears to be sung from the perspective of a head of cabbage longing for the jar of honey a shelf above it (as Ryan Dombal noted in his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/rising/8784-kwes/"" target=""_blank"">interview</a> with Kwes).</p>
<p><i>Meantime</i> has only four tracks, and one of them is a two-minute sound collage. When Kwes releases more music, he's going to make a formidable impression.

On paper, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28720-light-asylum/"" target=""_blank"">Light Asylum</a>-- the Brooklyn electro-goth duo of Shannon Funchess and Bruno Coviello-- seem to have plenty at their disposal. You can put the rise of their very accessible but aggressive brand of darkwave down to any number of things: from the band's intense live performances to their unique aesthetic that smears smoky blacks with punchy neons. There's enough to go around in Funchess alone, from her bone-rattling vocals to her fashion sense (cyber apocalypse biker priestess comes to mind), and the fact that she's been a fixture of the Brooklyn music scene for years now, having worked with everyone from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4313-tv-on-the-radio/"" target=""_blank"">TV on the Radio</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/916-chk-chk-chk/"" target=""_blank"">!!!</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29470-ford-lopatin/"" target=""_blank"">Ford &amp; Lopatin</a>. In short, Light Asylum have a lot of great things going for them. Two years ago, they proved that they not only had the look and the attitude, but also the songs to boot. The band's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15169-in-tension-ep/"" target=""_blank""><i>In Tension</i> EP</a> was a very promising start, from the manically catchy lead single <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7VrNerrqY4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Dark Allies""</a> to the heart-crushing <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJ6uoSm4XQU&amp;feature=related"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""A Certain Person""</a>, both of which suggested there was no reason that Light Asylum couldn't reach <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28390-sleigh-bells/"" target=""_blank"">Sleigh Bells</a>-levels of notoriety, and not only amongst people who happen to own a copy of <i><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9IDoAPC6Ps"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Hunger</a></i>.</p>
<p>Now that we have the band's first proper full-length, it's with a little disappointment that <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0001783/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jules Winnfield</a>'s usually <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0zJSgHDnpw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">unimpeachable logic</a> proves flawed. Using the same template that springboarded them into the general consciousness, <i>Light Asylum</i> feels trapped by the constraints of the formula they've already established, resulting in a surprisingly resigned, rigid album whose repetitive nature too often registers as glaringly imperfect-- a problem for a band as tightly wound and capable of making explosive music as Light Asylum clearly are. All the elements of the band's personality are most definitely on display here, but are presented in ways that suggest that these songs amount to little more than a collection of very smart demos that ultimately hide behind some clean production and dynamic drum programming. While neglecting to put the focus where it needs to be-- on song craft, tension and release, and jump-out singles-- it's a record that never quite gets off the ground. And though there certainly are plenty of bright patches interwoven throughout, in <i>Light Asylum</i>'s case, personality only gets you so far.</p>
<p>A good deal of the record's problems stem from Coviello's musical contributions. Back in 2010, after <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2598-lcd-soundsystem/"" target=""_blank"">LCD Soundsystem</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14257-this-is-happening/"" target=""_blank"">final album</a> was released, James Murphy expressed an interest in working with Light Asylum during<a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/30/arts/music/30lcd.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> a chat with a New York Times</a>. ""One of the reasons I want to be done with LCD is to be able to produce things like Light Asylum,"" he said, despite admitting that he thought the production was too ""chatty."" ""It's like a room full of people talking-- there's not enough to focus on."" Who knows if Coviello ever read that interview, but if he did, it feels like he misinterpreted what Murphy was trying to say. <i>Light Asylum</i> is indeed a much simpler piece of work, especially when compared to some of the sonic richness that really made <i>In Tension</i> pop. Functional but ultimately flat, Coviello mostly ignores the pop-smart cushioning that a lot of these songs could really benefit from. Tracks like ""Hour Fortress"" and single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13334-ipc/"" target=""_blank"">""IPC""</a> both lack the necessary climaxes needed for these songs to take off (though the latter does have a really great chorus), and more pointedly aggressive material like ""Sins of the Flesh"" and ""At Will"", a missed opportunity at a snarling ""fuck you,"" simply thud along monochromatically. More concerning are the trying, repetitive synth lines that pepper the entire album (see ""Angel Tongue""), which often feel more like looped building blocks rather than the evidence of a finished product. The result is often predictably thin.</p>
<p>It's hard not to see what Murphy was getting at, being so unapologetic in his interest in Funchess' pipes, and not the band as a whole. Part of what makes listening to <i>Light Asylum</i> so frustrating is a nagging want to see her talent mobilized to the fullest, to roll up your sleeves and try to make a Light Asylum in your own image. Coviello is wisely trying to put her voice on display by way of simplifying the music, but in turn it leaves Funchess with nowhere to go. She can often prick the hair up on the back of your neck with a simple scream or bellow, but too often she simply sounds stranded, like on the spacious, squiggling ""End of Days"". It also doesn't help that the lyrical content feels like yet another missed opportunity. Religious imagery and general machine-raging abounds, but when you consider Funchess' own conflicted religious upbringing (she was raised Southern Baptist) and the whole post-New World Order, freedom-fighter thing the group has going on, it feels like she could've used the megaphone to her advantage a bit more. Music like this doesn't always lend itself to being terribly ""open,"" but ignoring coldness for the sake of coolness is a pitfall that this band should be able to recognize.</p>
<p><i>Light Asylum</i> does contain some easily definable highlights, including the unexpected string of ballads that run through the middle of the record, though <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13158-shallow-tears-genesis/"" target=""_blank"">""Shallow Tears""</a> is the real take-away. It's a song that, despite essentially being an <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQSpJfpVHmg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Atmosphere""</a> cover, actually <i>sways</i>. It's stirring and big-- if only there were five more just like it. But the album's best song? ""A Certain Person"", the <i>In Tension</i> highlight which is tacked on here to close the album. The good news is that it gives the track-- a perfect mix of vulnerability and grit-- a second life. But it also means that it further deadens most of the music the preceded it, discordantly suggesting that Light Asylum is by no means a bloodless project, but for the time being, a stalled one.</p></div>"|16550.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16550-light-asylum-light-asylum/|6.1|Zach Kelly

From the very first beat <i>Dark York</i> paints itself as both a sleek, stylish potential soundtrack for the ball and an insistent collection of rap that feels animated by the force of its own movement.</p>
<p>Beats are what first leap out from <i>Dark York</i>: From the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hpnff1guVuc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Juke-like</a> repetitions on ""Emulator"" to the Night Slugs-leaning trio of cuts produced by affiliated artist <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2y8mtRynp60"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Nguzunguzu</a>, this is a tape that feels like a census of right-now sounds. Diouf draws from electronic music styles as much as rap and, despite seven different producers (as well as a whole clutch of his own beats), the tape hangs together impressively. Le1f matches the forward-thinking production punch for punch, coming across as a compelling and provocative rapper at every turn.</p>
<p>On ""Bubbles"", one of the Nguzunguzu-produced cuts, he bounces lines around the beat's effervescent drops, lending the track an untethered feel. The airiness is anchored by his quick-fire, provocative brags like ""straight rappers about to hate me 'cause I'm so good at this"" before warning ""Get out my zone, 'cause it's my bubble."" On moments like this it feels like Le1f is both forging his own lane and owning it all at the same time. His isn't exactly an easy path to tread-- especially in a mainstream rap climate that coined its own term, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUxMuk-T0gk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""no homo,""</a> just to make doubly sure any extravagance wasn't taken the wrong way.</p>
<p>That's not to say that Diouf's music isn't just as playful as that of the mainstream. His dark, chewed-up take on club sounds and party rap might pull <i>Dark York</i> left of center, but on a purely visceral level he also stays way in touch with rap's cathartic allure. So you get a pumped-up moment like ""Fresh"", with its huge synths and a balled-up <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuWMW7hVdTs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Aaliyah sample</a>, that feels tough and club ready, but also has Diouf spitting lines like ""I'm a based goddess dipped in chocolate"" and ""How can I not throw shade with my pompous ass squadron?/ It's a unique look-- I call it 'handsome boy modeling.'""</p>
<p>Yes,<i> Dark York</i> is rough, and at times can feel embryonic, but there's a lot of fun to be had listening to Diouf take on rap taboos with a glint of mischief. There's a shock of the new to Le1f's showboating, too. We must have heard a million cartoonish brags in hip-hop to the point where it can be easy to feel immune to them. It's curious then, and exciting, to hear lines that carry genuine boldness again. In the aforementioned NYC queer rap piece, Diouf says: ""Let's not make gay NYC rap a 'thing.'"" His approach on <i>Dark York</i> follows that advice, never coming across too political or self-serious; instead, Le1f's victories are won on the dancefloor, and through sheer fun.</p></div>"|16557.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16557-le1f-dark-york/|7.4|Hari Ashurst

That album turned out pretty terrifically, with two like-minded parties intertwining their sounds to create something both unified and representative of their respective strong suits. It also helped that it was an awfully pretty record. But with <i>Concatenating Fields</i>, the pair has decided to strike out on their own, unabated by a third wheel. Just knowing that McGuire wouldn't be present felt like an automatic strike against the album, seeing what kindred spirits they ended up being. Instead, Trouble Books just so happen to be a singular act, and the lack of collaboration (though it should be mentioned that Tusco Terror pitch in on a track) fosters a more intimate feel. Though McGuire's presence is felt in swirling electronic blips and bubbles and melancholic guitar tones, Trouble Books' own warmth and heady concepts are able to flourish, unencumbered. For example, there's the album's title, as well as Freund's own mention of abstract geometrical visual artists serving as inspiration. ""But I don't know, it's not supposed to be super conceptual or anything,"" he adds. ""Just a cool album of nighttime grass thoughts."" For someone who struggled with the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concatenation"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">basic definition of ""concatenation,"" </a>I think the latter description suits just fine.</p>
<p>""Grass thoughts"" makes for a nice double entendre, and despite a more pointed focus on the electronic aspect of Trouble Books' music, <i>Concatenating Fields</i> is a surprisingly organic sounding record, as if it just sprouted up in the garden overnight. Synthetic cicada whirs abound, as mechanized lightning bugs blink back and forth at each other. It's a perfect album for the season, with bursts of warmth and color giving way to dark washes of rainy dissonance, both of which feel equally nourishing. Tracks like two-parter ""Aloft/See-Through III"" seem to capture this almost effortlessly, inviting you to tuck yourself inside of them. But as much as <i>Concatenating Fields</i> could be considered a mood record, there is also a refined focus on making honest-to-goodness minimalist pop tracks, like highlight ""Lurk Underneath"". Lejsovka's sleepy-stoned vocals (which are more successful than Freund's similarly-minded vocal approach) help reinforce the overarching feeling of loneliness and peacefulness, demonstrating how these two emotions have more in common than we often recognize.</p>
<p>Freund and Lejsovka are a married couple, something you could probably pick up on having no previous knowledge of the project. It feels like a secret language is being spoken, as guitars playfully nudge up against each other, while at the same time ambient sounds and loops coexist quietly together. Trouble Books have another kindred spirit in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4605-windy-carl/"" target=""_blank"">Windy &amp; Carl</a>, their Michigan neighbors to the North. That married couple's latest record, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16222-we-will-always-be/"" target=""_blank""><i>We Will Always Be</i></a>, focused largely on tumult, but<i> Concatenating Fields</i> feel oppositely blissful. There is a similar voyeuristic quality to it, equally as intimate but also endearing, a testament to shared space that feels tailor made for quiet bedrooms at daybreak and private patches of backyard at sundown. Suffice it to say, this is music you could totally make out to.</p>
<p>Which isn't to say that this is a record that you can't take with you or call your own. In fact, it practically begs that you do. It has a pleasantly lost quality to it, evidenced by the lovely (and aptly titled) ""Cocooning"", which features some <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0dJqlvOSq4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Shields-ian guitar drone</a> that Sofia Coppola would kill to get her hands on. Despite being able to conjure images of flora and fauna with ease, this is music that would work just as well accompanying walks through unfamiliar cities or drunken beach stumbles. It's one of the beauties of music, in that it can become many different thing to many different people, all depending on where you are and who you're with. And with continued successes on the level of <i>Concatenating Fields</i>, there's no saying the same can't be said for Trouble Books.</p></div>"|16559.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16559-trouble-books-concatenating-fields/|7.2|Zach Kelly

The Okie folkie's example has guided many musicians as they set the 99% to song: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19422-tom-morello/"" target=""_blank"">Tom Morello</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/44353-wilco-bun-b-die-antwoord-david-banner-more-support-occupy-wall-street/"" target=""_blank"">wandered Zuccotti Park</a> strumming ""This Land Is Your Land"", which won something called the <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/10/31/idUS86633844620111031"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Occupy Wall Street Award</a> from MTV. Others, including <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6482-jackson-browne/"" target=""_blank"">Jackson Browne</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4053-bruce-springsteen/"" target=""_blank"">Bruce Springsteen</a>, have debuted starkly acoustic, highly rhetorical songs squarely in the Guthrie vein, suggesting that the OWS generation (or, more precisely, the pre-OWS generation with closer ties to the 1960s folkies like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1177-bob-dylan/"" target=""_blank"">Dylan</a>, who considered Woody a secular saint) equates Guthrie strictly with protest music and protest music strictly with Guthrie. On one level it might seem like a colossal failure of imagination: By devising a form of dissent music that relies exclusively on historical examples rather than on the leader-less ethos of OWS, these artists not only dilute their dissent but grasp only one facet of the multi-faceted Guthrie. If you weren't familiar with him, you might think Guthrie was some humorless scold who spoke only in grand pronouncements against The Man.</p>
<p class=""p1"">In fact, Guthrie was a complicated and contradictory artist who explored many subjects and displayed a ribald sense of humor to temper his guiding sense of outrage; in other words, he could be just as silly as he was serious. Crucially, he understood the effect of a constructed public persona, adopting a faux rural accent not only onstage but in his famed autobiography <i>Bound for Glory</i> as well. No other posthumous reconsideration has captured Guthrie in all his compelling contradictions as precisely or as affectionately as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/449-billy-bragg/"" target=""_blank"">Billy Bragg</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4596-wilco/"" target=""_blank"">Wilco</a>'s <i>Mermaid Avenue</i> did in 1998. At the behest of Guthrie's daughter Nora, the UK folk singer and the U.S. rock band, along with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2739-natalie-merchant/"" target=""_blank"">Natalie Merchant</a>, took scribbles of lyrics and filled in the melodies, arrangements, performances and ultimately our understanding of the man himself. As Nora writes in the liners to this new anthology collecting the three instalments of <i>Mermaid Avenue</i> sessions, ""The lyrics exposed him so absolutely it was like walking into a shower and finding him naked. Or like finding his little black book where every confession, every desire, every fantasy, every love, every pain, every hate, every hope poured out through purple and brown fountain pens…. Guess what. Turns out he's just the like the rest of us fools.""</p>
<p class=""p1"">So the man who famously penned <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaI5IRuS2aE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""This Land Is Your Land""</a> and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vLZOKshJPs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Grand Coulee Dam</a>"" also waxed bawdy about Ingrid Bergman and Walt Whitman's niece (who reads aloud from <i>Leaves of Grass</i> in bed). He wrote nonsense verse for his kids and penned a sympathetic ode to exiled Austrian composer Hanns Eisler. He missed California and understood that a movement is only as good as it treats its womenfolk: ""Women are equal and they may be ahead of the men,"" Bragg sings on <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhVXORYHi08"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""She Came Along to Me""</a>-- and that Eisenhower-era proclamation remains remarkably relevant during an election that makes gender such a divisive issue.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The liveliness of Guthrie's lyrics precludes any deadening reverence, and Bragg and Wilco rise to the occasion with music that respects the source material but never sounds beholden to any particular conception of Woody Guthrie. The loping melody and longing vocals by Jeff Tweedy turn <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhm27uXG6bg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""California Stars""</a> into an especially wistful West Coast reminiscence as well as one of Wilco's best songs. Opener <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GDU6ns2mRM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Walt Whitman's Niece""</a> and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn1IjjvA9fI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Hoodoo Voodoo""</a> sound rambunctious and loose, while Bragg turns <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMBvzpCLGHg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Way Over Yonder in the Minor Key""</a>, a duet with Merchant, into a bittersweet reverie about the boldness of youth. ""Ain't nobody that can sing like me,"" Bragg boasts as Eliza Carthy's delicate fiddle colors in the years between adolescence and adulthood. </p>
<p class=""p1""><i>Mermaid Avenue</i> was such a deeply nuanced and humanizing portrait of a larger-than-life character that it significantly shifted how listeners thought of Guthrie, especially at the end of the decade that produced the criminally reverent alt-country movement. It was almost impossible to follow up such a project, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/902-mermaid-avenue-vol-ii/"" target=""_blank""><i>Mermaid Avenue, Volume 2</i></a>, arriving in 2000, lacked the impact and import of its predecessor. Musically, however, it might actually be more expansive, with the hootenanny country of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUmiJcbf8qI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Joe DiMaggio Done it Again""</a> and the somber doom folk of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0JYKOTUdd0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Blood of the Lamb""</a> jostling elbows against the proto-punk of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40ila3Rh9lQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""All You Fascists""</a> and the spry rural blues of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-ffn1uflbs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Aginst th' Law""</a> (sung by Corey Harris).</p>
<p class=""p1"">There's a sense of diminishing returns on <i>Volume 2,</i> as well as on the third volume that fills out the new <i>Complete Mermaid Avenue Sessions</i>. But that's only natural: Of course you put your best material on the initial release. What's remarkable is the wealth of material available to these artists and the number of gems these sessions produced. Taken together, the collected, reissued <i>Sessions</i> may not have the same impact as <i>Mermaid Avenue </i>did 14 years ago, but they suggest a group of musicians emboldened and excited by their shared undertaking and their proximity to Guthrie himself (in reality, the sessions were rumored to be contentious).</p>
<p class=""p1"">And of course, there are a great many songs about the powers that be, about facing down the hypocrites and fascists, the totalitarians and even the Klan. In this context-- alongside so many songs about family, movies, baseball, sex, drugs, and other everyday concerns-- ""All You Fascists"" and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11235-the-jolly-banker-woodie-guthrie-cover/"" target=""_blank"">""The Jolly Bankers""</a> and the Swiftian ""Christ for President"" resonate more powerfully than they might on their own or even sung from a podium before likeminded citizens. By presenting a more rounded portrait of Guthrie in which politics is only one subject among so many, <i>The Complete Mermaid Avenue Sessions </i>shows just what Guthrie was fighting for and provides a persuasive rebuke to anyone who might whittle the man down to just one dimension.  </p></div>"|16518.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16518-the-complete-mermaid-avenue-sessions/|8.1|Stephen M.

<p>He takes every opportunity to enthusiastically serve as a tour guide (""Couple blocks from the sun dial/ Candlestick Park, south one mile/ Alameda, Walnut, St. Anthony""), drop slang, and rhyme over out-the-trunk 808s (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/46211-das-racists-kool-ad-announces-new-album/"" target=""_blank"">""Ticky Ticky""</a>) and near-hyphy rhythms (""Manny Pacquiao"") to let you know he's making himself at home again. Overall, though, <i>51 </i>feels more like a comprehensive California thing, specifically mid-2000s Stones Throw in both sound and structure with the ""for the love"" generosity of recent E-40 tossed in. There's an intelligent stream-of-consciousness here, something along the lines of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3496-quasimoto/"" target=""_blank"">Madlib's work as Quasimoto</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14259-oj-simpson/"" target=""_blank"">Guilty Simpson's overlooked <i>OJ Simpson</i></a>. To isolate a particular five-minute run, the typically dense ""Donda"" (""I'm so emotional like Thursday/ <i>Cherchez</i> anything/ So Diddy with it/ Looking for a check with like 50 digits"") abruptly cuts to a Dylan sample (""Biz vs. Nudge"") and then 15 seconds later, a screwed Young L production named after British art maven and media provocateur Damien Hirst where Kool A.D., Dope G, and MondreM.A.N. are outfitted with aluminum voiceboxes.</p>
<p>It all fits into the ""goin' back to Cali strictly for the weather, women, and the weed"" vibe, too genial and stoned to come off as chaotic as it reads, and even the tracks that initially feel like one-and-done listens-- Kool A.D.'s instrumentals in particularly tend to be longer on ideas than technique-- rarely end up triggering the fast-forward impulse. While a two-minute Huey Newton speech might sound like it clashes completely with the high spirits described thus far, it serves as a reminder of just how deeply felt the experience of recording back in Oakland was for Kool A.D., as well as a bridge between the Boots Riley feature ""Leverage"" and the paranoid ""TV Eye"".</p>
<p>To a certain extent, the presence of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29865-main-attrakionz/"" target=""_blank"">Main Attrakionz</a> is surely something of a selling point-- if not the fact that Kool A.D. is actually rapping for the most part on this one rather than further pursuing the robo-tripping path of <i>Palm Wine Drinkard</i>. It's the outermost he's gone to interact with hip-hop as a whole, both stylistically and geographically, and it's not two worlds colliding so much as comfortably nestling. Neither changes their delivery in the slightest, and it doesn't do much to really put Kool A.D. within the current Bay Area conversation of ""cloud rap"" or #based. In those realms, the actual content takes on a secondary, if not subliminal, effect and even if Victor is mostly in pop-culture-acrostic mode here and occasionally repeats himself (""What the fuck is up, chico man?/ I'm Rico Suave, <i>ya tu sabe</i>/ Jewish Eddie Murphy in your barbershop/ Jewish Mel Gibson/ Black Tintin"" is an example of his doing both), failing to listen closely is a disservice to yourself. Kool A.D. is rarely off-point during these 21 tracks, and I'll leave it to listeners to pick out their own personal gems-- the initial recognizing of the connections made is really where a lot of the thrill is with <i>51</i>.  </p>
<p>It's certainly good to hear Kool A.D. in his zone for an extended period of time again, but the revelation of <i>51 </i>is producer Amaze 88, who's featured on eight tracks. He's definitely a revivalist and his grooves aren't particularly rare-- even beyond the easily ID'd Supremes samples, I imagine he spent a good deal of 2004 listening to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3636-the-pretty-toney-album-as-ghostface/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Pretty Toney Album </i></a>and <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5579-madvillainy/"" target=""_blank"">Madvillainy</a>. </i>But these are beats that Kool A.D. sounds fantastic over, and he's far more amenable to the warm and fleshy soul here than the metal-on-metal abrasiveness of <i>Relax</i>. No matter how dusty his fingers got searching for his material, Amaze lets everything sound alive and airy, with jumpy drum fills and falsetto cooing adding color to A.D.'s lackadaisical monotone.  There's an impressive roster here-- Trackademics, Mike Finito, and Young L in particular-- but any time you hear something that stands out for its enthusiastic take on pre-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4365-donuts/"" target=""_blank""><i>Donuts </i></a>undie-soul, you can accurately guess Amaze 88 was on the beat. While his five-minute instrumental intro initially comes off like an unnecessary hurdle to hearing Kool A.D. drop one quotable after another on ""Electrum"" and ""La Pinata"", after a full listen, you see why he earned it in the first place.</p>
<p>It's the most consistently listenable thing out of the Greedhead camp since <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14662-sit-down-man/"" target=""_blank""><i>Sit Down, Man </i></a>probably because it's the most effortlessly fun since <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14376-shut-up-dude/"" target=""_blank"">Shut Up, Dude</a>. </i>More and more,<i> </i>it seems easy to isolate the combative <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15822-relax/"" target=""_blank""><i>Relax</i></a> as Das Racist using their highest-profile release to play against their strengths and prove some sort of point-- you notice immediately just how much laughter and camaraderie there is on this thing. Lest you think their divergent mixtapes are indicative of an interpersonal schism, they've sounded as good as ever on the same track as of late, and that holds true on ""A Different World"". Like Heems' grittier and grimmer <i>Nehru Jackets </i>tape from earlier this year, <i>51 </i>gets deeper into its creator's hometown roots as something of a fact-finding mission-- Kool A.D. sums up his bicoastal credentials over the slow-coasting ""Oooh"", shrugging, ""My bad I slept through the session yesterday/ But yo you gotta admit, tho-- that's hella Bay/ Moved to New York cause sometimes you gotta get away.""  Reverse the itinerary, and that about describes <i>51.</i></p></div>"|16552.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16552-kool-ad-51/|7.9|Ian Cohen

Never has the phenomenon been more clear than on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16471-pink-friday-roman-reloaded/"" target=""_blank"">Nicki Minaj's <i>Roman Reloaded</i></a>, one of the most anticipated albums of the year from the genre's premier eccentric, but one that has such a clear delineation between out-there rap and bloodless pop conformity that it might as well ask you for your passport halfway through. Atlanta rapper/singer <a href=""http://www.futurefreebandz.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Future</a>, a Dungeon Family blood relative who'd be as at home on ""The Voice""<i> </i>as Cee-Lo, has made it his aim to bridge that gap, and with <i>Pluto</i>, his debut album, he makes his strongest case yet that he is one of the foremost sources of rap that's as peculiar as it is pop.</p>
<p>Future's lineage is easy to follow, and the forebears of <i>Pluto </i>are pop stars that are (or were) divisive weirdos. His music pulls heavily from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2616-lil-wayne/"" target=""_blank"">Lil Wayne</a>'s syrup-soaked ballads, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7337-t-pain/"" target=""_blank"">T-Pain</a>'s robotic rapping turned singing, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7171-akon/"" target=""_blank"">Akon</a>'s illusions of stadium grandeur, but <i>Pluto </i>is far more familiar than it is formulaic. Future's ability to orbit those influences instead of cynically mining them means that his debut is much more an extension of those artists' groundwork than it is a monument built using their blueprints. Where T-Pain gave up rapping for singing or Wayne ping-ponged from one to the other (sometimes within the same song), Future turns the art of singing and rapping at the same time into a science. He also miraculously shows that it's still possible for Auto-Tune to be an interesting artistic tool.</p>
<p>It's the latter that is Future's calling card, and it's what his singularity more or less hinges on. Before it was hijacked by T-Pain, Auto-Tune was initially used to paper over deficiencies in a singer's performance, but on <i>Pluto</i>,<i> </i>Future finds a multitude of ways for the software to accentuate and color emotion. On ""Tony Montana"", his breakout solo hit that is the album's most threatening-- though also its goofiest-- cut, he cuts the buzz of Auto-Tune by rapping with a slight hoarseness in his voice, and it allows the song to be as weary and paranoid as it is chilling. Then there are tracks like ""Truth Gonna Hurt You"" and ""Neva End"", a break up song and love song respectively where Future lets his voice crack and deteriorate. The former is a lament that Future sings with a hint of cheeriness, but the treatment of his voice imbues the song with an unmistakable heartsickness. On the latter he reinforces the strength of a relationship in the face of turmoil, and his raspy singing is the perfect punctuation, making it seem like he recorded the song immediately after an hour-long screaming match. His voice is never perfect, but that's explicitly the point.</p>
<p>This push-pull between computerized precision and soul-baring imperfection has been explored before by other artists. So has Future's use of Auto-Tune as a license to affect street-true hardness while still writing an album that would be plied by ""American Idol"" contestants in an alternate universe where Atlanta swag rap was the biggest music in the country. But arguably no one has explored those contradictions so thoroughly and seamlessly across an entire album, at least since <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12498-808s-and-heartbreak/"" target=""_blank""><i>808s &amp; Heartbreak</i></a>. It shouldn't necessarily come as a surprise either, as Future is a much smarter artist than his music would indicate at first blush. Take ""You Deserve It"", a song about himself that he sings to himself that hilariously comes directly after the stunner about his dream girl (""Turn on the Lights""), or ""Long Live the Pimp"", a Pimp C tribute that eschews the sounds of Texas in favor of being an especially banging Future song.</p>
<p>The result is what may end up being the most singular rap album to hit Billboard in 2012. Future may soon flame out, but his current status as <a href=""http://www.mauricegarland.com/2012/04/its-official-future-is-the-future-of-atlanta/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span class=""s1"">rap royalty</span></a> is one of the best things in recent memory to happen to a genre that has almost wholly succumbed to sucking the singularity out of its nascent pop stars. <i>Pluto </i>is Future's album and no one else's, and though it will sound instantly recognizable, his personality, voice, and skewed take on pop-rap make it instantly different. No Stargate beats necessary.</p></div>"|16554.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16554-pluto/|7.8|Jordan Sargent

When asked if he could see himself in the 26-year old Liverpudlian, Weller said yes, particularly when Kane plays live, and blithely commented, ""It's just good to see someone giving it one."" Having lofty patrons such as Weller is essentially what's brought Kane and his hilariously cheesy, mostly dreadful 1960s pomp pop pastiches this far: He's had nods from the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3129-oasis/"" target=""_blank"">Gallagher brothers</a>, from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2377-kasabian/"" target=""_blank"">Kasabian</a>, and spends equal amounts of time wincing at and exploiting his connection with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/259-arctic-monkeys/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Arctic Monkeys</a>' frontman <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29463-alex-turner/"" target=""_blank"">Alex Turner</a>, with whom he made <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11433-the-age-of-the-understatement/"" target=""_blank"">one brassy album</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12495-my-mistakes-were-made-for-you-ep/"" target=""_blank"">an EP</a> as the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5741-the-last-shadow-puppets/"" target=""_blank"">Last Shadow Puppets</a> in 2008. </p>
<p>The nature of these connections may well give you the notion that Kane is one man's meat (and potatoes), and another's poison, with his UK fame proving the result of some diabolical circumstantial accident or of Kane's being some kind of idiot-savant sage. There's something about this four-track EP-- two new original songs, a Tom Jones cover, and an acoustic cover of the titular cut from his 2011 LP, <i>Colour of the Trap</i>-- that seems horribly appropriate for this year of the Queen's jubilee and the London Olympics, invoking what sound like ham-fisted auditions to write the next James Bond theme tune, and bearing a kind of inadvertent, and truly, amazingly ludicrous <i>Carry On</i>-style way with words. (His pretend, tourist-board, 1960s, Union Jack-waggling Britain goes down a treat in Japan.) Kane fancies himself as a right old lover-man, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23555-mick-jagger/"" target=""_blank"">Mick Jagger</a>, a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/546-the-beatles/"" target=""_blank"">Beatle</a> in a saucy clinch, or even one of the aforementioned Gallaghers on a charm offensive. It goes without saying that he is precisely none of these things; rather, Kane shares a kinship with fellow groovy, smoochy Brit Austin Powers.</p>
<p>And much like the international man of mystery, it's hard to know whether to bother being offended at the pathetic way in which Kane sings about women, or whether to just laugh at the silly little man. Horny bombast dallies around wannabe Beatles-y pastoral strumming on the admittedly compelling, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/14235-skream/"" target=""_blank"">Skream</a>-produced opener ""First of My Kind"", where he and some unfathomable acquaintance are ""crawling through like midnight panthers, growling at the moon."" His kind of girl is ""sub-zero... as cold as ice,"" and her kiss gives him ""frostbite."" Sadly for Kane, he doesn't have the kind of voice-- a Gainsbourgian croon, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1068-destroyer/"" target=""_blank"">Dan Bejar</a>-like wryness, even a deep character brogue like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30159-mac-demarco/"" target=""_blank"">Mac DeMarco</a>-- to carry off clichéd nonsense like this; his voice is painfully nasal and grating, with all the control of a rickety go-kart revving around a hairpin. </p>
<p>Amazingly, ""First of My Kind"" probably represents the strongest songwriting on this EP. ""Night Runner"" is subtler musically, with the verses rolling along on subterraneous bass and fizzy Moog, but the lyrics resemble a song you'd learn in German classes to help you remember the relationship between prepositions and transient/intransient verbs. It's sexy stuff: “I come in/ I come out/ Of a trance/ Take it in/ Took it out/ Took a chance,"" and so on and so on via ""Sing aloud/ Sing it sad/ Sing along"" until Kane ends the song thrutching, ""Night runner! Night runner!"" as if there's some element of espionage and covert thrill to a song that definitely won't make you want to get out the <a href=""http://scarygoround.com/scare/?date=20111202"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">night exciters</a>. </p>
<p class=""p1"">The <i>pièce de résistance</i>, however, is ""Looking Out My Window"", which is frankly astonishing. You perhaps wouldn't have imagined professional perma-tanned ladies' man Tom Jones to be on Kane's list of idols, but here's a song from his 1968 LP <i>Help Yourself</i>, acting as the centerpiece to the EP, its impossibly cliched and convoluted <a href=""http://mileskane.org/forum/threads/miles-kane-first-of-my-kind-ep-lyrics.882/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">lyrics</a> starkly showing up the flimsy, meaningless structure of ""Night Runner"".</p>
<p class=""p1"">On one hand, its inclusion points to Kane's bold sense of humor; on the other, the condescending cry of, ""Looking out my window, <i>woman</i>, trying to find you,"" feels distasteful and misguided. And about halfway through the song, a cascade down the piano keys puts paid to the indignant stomp of the song thus far for Miles to make an excruciating stab at the spoken/scat breakdown, like a working men's club James Brown impersonator: ""I'd like to tell you about a little girl who left me so alone and blue/ Trouble is if I paint a picture too well, you might fall in love with her too/ Oh, she's 'bout 5'6"", a little bag of tricks/ My mother told me to watch my back but I wouldn't listen…""</p>
<p class=""p1"">Weirdly, it doesn't feel a million miles away from the breakdown on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/902-captain-beefheart/"">Captain Beefheart</a>'s ""Too Much Time"" from 1972's <i>Clear Spot</i>, where Don Van Vliet opens up ""some old stale beans"" and a ""can of sardines"" and dreams ""of somebody to cook for me."" Let's be clear: there is no comparison to be made between Beefheart and Miles Kane, but if Kane wants to persist with this horn-accompanied, wannabe lascivious streak, then it might be worth discarding Weller (and Tom Jones) as a hero in favor of Van Vliet in order to learn how to do the thing properly-- and to learn how to get people to laugh with you, rather than at you. </p></div>"|16538.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16538-first-of-my-kind-ep/|3.5|Laura Snapes

Their respective discographies cover everything from grinding, amelodic house to cheery synth-pop. But one thing they specialize in, together and separately, is ambient music that both fulfills the genre's requirements (sounds designed to wash over you as much as be consciously listened to) and subverts them (they might be demanding, however gently, that you actually pay attention to them).</p>
<p>The records Voigt's made as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1686-gas/"" target=""_blank"">Gas</a> are a kind of super-ambient, music that that doesn't fill up the quiet in a room so much as envelop the room entirely, blocking out everything else, allowing you to either lose yourself in the massed clouds of sound or hear something new each time in those endless layers of sampled classical music. And on the reverse tip there's <i>Las Vegas</i>, the 1996 collaboration between Voigt and Burger as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/506-burgerink/"" target=""_blank"">Burger/Ink</a>, a sparkling exercise in stripped-down techno that still outdoes so much of the minimal electronic music that followed it. The velvet-smooth repetition of <i>Las Vegas </i>makes it easy enough to let it recede into the background. Or you can attempt to follow the fractal logic of its sparse melodies, the musical equivalent of flying over a city at night and trying to divine patterns in the lights blinking on and off in the black sea below you.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.kompakt.fm/artists/mohn"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mohn</a> is the latest collaboration between Voigt and Burger, and once again the duo has assembled an ambient record that avoids devolving into the agreeable twinkly mush that so often characterizes the genre at its least creative. In many ways, <i>Mohn</i> is the least dramatic, least immediately gripping ambient record either producer has released so far. Totally absent here is Voigt and Burger's love of a heavy kick drum, the lingering reminder of the traditionalist techno that formed them as producers, the steady thud-thud-thud that occasionally rises up out of the mists of the Gas records and the glittering haze of <i>Las Vegas</i>. There's a surprising lack of any hint of dance music on <i>Mohn</i>, though it still relies heavily on repetition as a structural principle to keep things from dissolving entirely into whoosh and swoosh. The closest Voigt and Burger get to an actual beat is something like the softly brushed drums of ""Ambientôt"", which could be the space-rock/dream-pop of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1673-galaxie-500/"" target=""_blank"">Galaxie 500</a>, if Galaxie's formative influence had been Kraftwerk rather than the Velvet Underground.</p>
<p>This might lead you to think <i>Mohn</i> is the duo's best chill-out record yet. But to its credit, <i>Mohn</i> often follows the same path as Gas, where the materials of easy listening are darkened until they court unease. ""Einrauschen"" immediately strands the listener in a bleak landscape of frost-eaten electronics as forbidding as anything the 1990s school of isolationist ambient sketched out, and parts of ""Schwarzer Schwan"" are like a spooky medieval choral piece hellaciously pitch-wobbled to make it even more unnerving. But like Burger/Ink, even the less-forbidding or downright pretty stuff on <i>Mohn</i> keeps flying at you from unexpected angles. We've probably had enough homage to early-1980s electronic film scores at this point, but ""Saturn"" adds something genuinely new to that chilly metronomic sound via an ever-shifting layer of gentle junkyard percussion, contrasting sleek retro-futurist precision with a kind of fractured anti-rhythm.</p>
<p>""Saturn"" and several other tracks here veer wildly from Voigt and Burger's established tricks, if you think owning a few dozen of their respective releases means you have them all figured out. But plenty of <i>Mohn</i> is still immediately recognizable as Voigt and Burger's handiwork. ""Seqtor 88"" is a dead ringer for the feathery dub techno of Burger/Ink, to the point where it might be mistaken as a <i>Las Vegas</i> outtake. Whatever weird hybrid genres it points to, though, <i>Mohn</i>'s also still essentially an ambient record, even if it manages to avoid the sterility of actual background music. So it's appeal is probably limited, in the grand scheme of pop, but for aficionados, it's a much-needed dose of invigoration. Recent entries in Kompakt's own <i>Pop Ambient</i> series, more or less a decade-long nod to Voigt and Burger's influence, simply drift by anemically, with no sense of building an environment or offering some contrasting edge to what can quickly become bland prettiness for its own sake. If not always up to their previous heights, <i>Mohn</i> highlights why these guys are still the masters, while so many of Kompakt's new-school driftologists are still students at best.</p></div>"|16548.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16548-mohn/|7.0|Jess Harvell

The London-based artist's first two albums as Actress, 2008's <i>Hazyville</i> and 2010's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14375-splazsh/"" target=""_blank""><i>Splazsh</i></a>, sounded like mid-1980s house and techno collaged together and played on a radio from under the freeway. Half of his newest, <i>R.I.P.</i>, doesn't even have beats. Listening to him discuss his process making it-- which included reading John Milton, philosophizing about death, and smoking weed-- you'd think he was a PhD candidate.</p>
<p>""I want to make cool, classical stuff for a modern generation,"" he said in a <a href=""http://www.thestoolpigeon.co.uk/features/interview-actress.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">recent interview</a>. The phrase ""classical stuff"" alone will probably disqualify him from the academy. Good. It's not where he belongs. Like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28187-oneohtrix-point-never/"" target=""_blank"">Oneohtrix Point Never</a>, what makes Cunningham special is that he's an artist capable of referencing extroverted, populist music like house and rap in order to create a meditative, introverted experience.</p>
<p>In general, his productions are less about their build-and-release than their atmosphere, which hovers over the bones of the music like some sick gas cloud. The innovation on <i>R.I.P.</i> is to put as much effort into making things clean as making them dirty, and the result is a sense of contrast: Fog gives way to clarity; fat, puffy synthesizer sounds play off pinprick-sharp ones. Like all good contrasts, it's simple and eureka-like: By bringing the acidic sounds to the surface and keeping the air-conditioner hum somewhere in the depths, Cunningham takes the monolithic sound of his earlier productions and breaks them into layers-- compared to <i>Splazsh</i>, it's practically prismatic.</p>
<p>It's not the sound that makes the music, though, but the structure of it. <i>R.I.P.</i> is a deliberately uncoordinated album. Rhythms, basslines, and melodies slip in and out of line with each other. Comparatively straightforward, house-oriented tracks like ""Shadow From Tartarus"" are situated next to murk and ambience like ""Tree of Knowledge"". The emphasis here, though, is on ""comparative"": Even R.I.P.'s steady 4/4 tracks sound grimy and deconstructed. But there's something almost flirtatious in the way he lets the sounds worm around in the dark, looking to hook up with something firm. When they do, it's both mechanical and mystical, like watching a sculpture cut from raw stone. </p>
<p>The thick crud over Cunningham's earlier albums mimicked a sense of loss and erosion, as though he'd found the music abandoned in an alleyway and brought it back to something resembling life. The disparate sounds on <i>R.I.P</i> don't need resuscitation, just room to breathe. Given that room, they arrange themselves. If the album could be called intimate, it's paradoxically because there's so much distance and disconnect to it. Listening to it can be like seeing the city you live in from a plane: You can't reach out and touch it but you're comforted by how manageable and well-planned it all looks.</p>
<p>Cunningham's scope is already wider than producers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4806-burial/"" target=""_blank"">Burial</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22489-zomby/"" target=""_blank"">Zomby</a>, who tend to keep dance music's vocabulary intact, even at their most abstract. When <i>Splazsh</i> first started going around, Cunningham called it ""R&amp;B concrete,"" which, as marketing speak, was terrific, but as self-description was mostly aspirational. On <i>R.I.P.</i>, the blending between the traditions of techno and the traditions of ambient and minimalist music are more apparent. Until he comes up with something better (or it ends up being used for a soda campaign), ""cool, classical stuff for a modern generation"" will have to work. As for his shift in focus, he confesses to not getting quite as stoned as he used to. The fresh air has done him good.</p></div>"|16544.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16544-actress-rip/|8.5|Mike Powell

His tracks are filled with skittish, hiccuping beats, helium-rush vocals, and vaguely eerie tones that drift in from the corners of the mix. When discussing his influences in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/rising/8816-alunageorge/"" target=""_blank"">a recent interview</a>, he said that he drew inspiration as a producer from a time when ""people weren't... afraid to do something a bit weird."" Was he waxing nostalgic about some obscure, forgotten micro-scene he'd stumbled upon after endless hours of crate-digging? Nope, he was talking about how much he loves <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5205-timbaland/"" target=""_blank"">Timbaland</a> and the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3082-the-neptunes/"" target=""_blank"">Neptunes</a>.</p>
<p>We've heard enough of this refrain recently-- from avant-pop artists like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29568-grimes/"" target=""_blank"">Grimes</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27668-nite-jewel/"" target=""_blank"">Nite Jewel</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29405-purity-ring/"" target=""_blank"">Purity Ring</a>-- that it's starting to feel representative of a sea change. Artists with DIY leanings have been professing their love of the glossy bubblegum pop and R&amp;B that dominated the airwaves when they were growing up-- the sort of music that a previous generation of indie musicians rejected entirely, or at least admired from a distance. Aluna Francis, the 24-year-old singer who certainly plumbs this sound on the group's debut EP, <i>You Know You Like It</i>, admits she used to feel that way too. ""I had a big rejection of R&amp;B for quite a long while, so when I started working for George, I was still trying to be something else,"" she recalls. ""But it was so ingrained in me that our music ended up sounding quite R&amp;B without meaning to."" The three slick, glitchy tracks on <i>You Know You Like It</i> also pull from the left-field sounds associated with the LA label <a href=""http://www.brainfeedersite.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Brainfeeder</a> and the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2378-the-knife/"" target=""_blank"">Knife</a>'s creepily synthetic vibe, but a large part of their appeal comes from their glistening pop sensibility. When Francis coos on the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13212-you-know-you-like-it/"" target=""_blank"">title track</a>, ""You know you like it but you're scared of the shame,"" it feels like more than just a slinky taunt: It's also a pretty succinct summary of her generation's relationship with the mainstream pop that she and Reid so love. Thematically and sonically, that's <i>You Know You Like It</i>'s agenda: to strip away the guilt from the guilty pleasure. </p>
<p>AlunaGeorge share some noticeable similarities with Canadian electro-pop duo Purity Ring: they've got a male/female dynamic, an affinity for manipulated vocals tracks that gurgle and burp, and a baby-voiced aesthetic that suggests they remember exactly where they were when they first heard Timbaland sample a cooing infant (by way of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3397-prince/"" target=""_blank"">Prince</a>'s <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFWpW7B8ucY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Delirious""</a>) on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10601-aaliyah/"" target=""_blank"">Aaliyah</a>'s 1998 hit <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M9BgfSHowg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Are You That Somebody?""</a>. But the two groups explore different tones, and unlike the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kewpie_doll"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kewpie</a>-eyed wonder of Purity Ring's sound, AlunaGeorge's tracks exude a seductive confidence. ""I'm not as hard as a rock, I'm just not easy to break,"" Francis sings on ""Just a Touch"", a hint of cool combativeness in her voice. ""But don't take it as an open invitation to try.""</p>
<p>Though it's definitely not a dud, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13502-just-a-touch/"" target=""_blank"">""Just a Touch""</a> is the least memorable of the three songs, and at worst it feels like a missed opportunity to show some range. But for a debut EP that's just over 10-minutes long, <i>You Know You Like It</i> doesn't last long enough for its aesthetic limitations to become a problem. The commanding and instantly catchy ""You Know You Like It"" is the obvious single here, but the closing track ""Put Up Your Hands"" might just do it one better-- twisting and pulling Francis's vocals into otherworldly sounds. ""I've got a million emails in a box unread from you,"" she exhales, sounding noticeably annoyed. ""What you trying to prove?"" The lyric might look a little banal on paper, but over the course of the song it distends into a bit of dark, fatalistic drama. And that's just what Reid and Francis do on this EP: poke and prod familiar things until they take on the cast of something lustrous, sinister, and ever so slightly weird.</p></div>"|16540.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16540-you-know-you-like-it-ep/|7.7|Lindsay Zoladz

<p>Last week, the California-via-New York label <a href=""http://www.tompkinssquare.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tompkins Square</a> reissued <i>Poor Moon</i> on CD, giving an album that had quickly sold out in its original form a chance to benefit from wider distribution. Tompkins Square is one of the few extant imprints that could give <i>Poor Moon</i> a proper and permanent presence, or one with an aesthetic that fit not only Paradise of Bachelors but also Hiss Golden Messenger. For the last decade, after all, Tompkins Square has dug deep into both the past and present to deliver soulful music in all its numerous guises, whether that's meant box sets of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15861-this-may-be-my-last-time-singing/"" target=""_blank"">astonishing gospel performances</a> or the one-man-string-band exhortations of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15504-out-on-the-open-west/"" target=""_blank"">Frank Fairfield</a>. <i>Poor Moon</i> thrives on an absolute Pan-American musical alchemy, where classic country and bar-band rock, pristine bluegrass and subversive funk whittle their own way into the same perfect grooves. This is new music that uses the past like a catapult-- into songs that understand their pedigrees without kowtowing to them. Tompkins Square is a readymade home.</p>
<p>Hiss Golden Messenger is, at its core, Durham, N.C., songwriter M.C. Taylor and New York multi-instrumentalist Scott Hirsch; in the late 1990s, Hirsch and Taylor anchored San Francisco's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/842-the-court-spark/"" target=""_blank"">the Court &amp; Spark</a>, an intriguing act that attempted to till the soil between indie rock and alt-country scenes long before listeners seemed so Fleet Foxes-ready. <i>Poor Moon</i> is the fourth Hiss Golden Messenger album, but it feels in a sense like a debut, or at least some grand curtain finally being pulled back. By far the band's most developed effort, <i>Poor Moon</i> was recorded with a cast of 16 guitarists, string players, horn players, drummers, pickers, and singers and revisits several tunes from past Hiss Golden Messenger albums-- in effect, funneling the band's widespread oeuvre into this one discrete moment. </p>
<p>It works: <i>Poor Moon</i> is a fantastic, on-repeat record that recalls the aesthetic risks and rewards of the best stuff produced by Laurel Canyon's singer-songwriters and, decades later, the stylistically daring musicians associated with New Weird America. Hiss Golden Messenger pairs an instant accessibility with careful complexity; the hook of opener ""Blue Country Mystic"", for example, is inescapable, but the song's sudden twists and sprints and minute musical details provide a framework of constant unpredictability. There's a beautiful bluegrass trot in the middle and a string-lined country-soul template at the end, but those are exceptions. Instead, <i>Poor Moon</i> largely depends upon the band's ability to hide the seams of its polyglot proclivities. Traces of funk and dub ripple warmly beneath the banjo of ""Drummer Down"" and the keyboard flourishes of  ""Jesus Shot Me in the Head"", while ""Super Blue (Two Days Clean)"" washes psychedelic warmth gently over an incisive bar-rock clip. The sidewinding acoustic guitars of the instrumental ""Dreamwood"" rise from a haze of nocturnal field recordings, suggesting Sir Richard Bishop sitting in with the sounds of a surrounding swamp. These innovative melds put Hiss Golden Messenger in the company of contemporaries like Megafaun, Doug Paisley, and Lambchop, all acts who have lifted from the past with steady visions for the future.    </p>
<p><i>Poor Moon</i> is something of a religious album, but Taylor judiciously applies the same nothing-sacred mentality to his faith that his band delivers to its variegated music. Tying a tight knot between self-definition, self-discovery, and the possibility of self-obliteration, ""Jesus Shot Me in the Head"" slowly reveals itself to not only be a meditation on giving <i>into</i> God but arguably giving <i>up on</i> life, too. ""Daylight"" questions the need for good-versus-evil, light-versus dark binaries, suggesting that essential truths get lost at the border between black and white. The same tension ribbons through ""Super Blue"", the first-person tale of a junkie whose forced sobriety starts to kill him-- at least until he kills it with shots and lines and spontaneous trips down south. ""There's a big black horse on a nice straight course/ My bets are fixed/ All right,"" Taylor sings, his unequivocal sneer embracing and exploring every aspect of addiction all at once. </p>
<p>Taylor uses this album almost like a journal, teasing out various scenarios and debating the proper balance between keeping faith and giving up on it. Musically, for instance, ""Under All the Land"" might be the album's most easygoing tune, cutting an unlikely path between reggae swagger and country sway. But as Taylor works through his religious indecision, that backdrop makes it clear that he's working again through an age-old debate about service versus selfishness, or about the meaning of freedom in the face of commitment. ""It's hard to tell which are kings and which are men,"" he half-moans, revealing some level of discomfort with both classes. That same blue-collar directness shows up again on ""A Working Man Can't Make No Way"", an exasperated acoustic rollick surrounded by sighing steel guitar. Here, Taylor puts the woes of the Bible-reading, all-toiling commoner in the harsh daylight of reality. No matter how much the narrator works, heaven inevitably takes his parents; earning a simple wage strips any leisure time he could have ever had, rewarding his allegiance with no earthly sanctuary. Ever so gently, our man rebels: ""My bosses can just go to hell,"" Taylor sings, easing the imprecation skyward. ""Tell 'em all I don't give a damn.""</p>
<p>It's difficult not to revel in the fortuitous timing of <i>Poor Moon</i>, an album that treats hard times like the only through-line of existence but keeps pressing ahead. At a moment when the international economy seems on the brink of unfathomable faults, when people's rights are being questioned on the basis of religion, and when battles of lesser evils are the only ones seemingly left to be won, <i>Poor Moon</i> offers a steadying sort of balm. Never pedantic or didactic, never extreme or aggressive, <i>Poor Moon</i> is a warm hand on a cold shoulder, a vintage piece of soul music for new times in need.</p></div>"|16546.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16546-poor-moon/|7.8|Grayson Currin

Best known for their schizophrenic depressives (Bethlehem), bloody orthodoxy (Nargaroth), folksy heathens (Nachtfalke), nasty black thrashers (Desaster), and dodgy right wingers (Absurd), as well as its untouchable contributions to thrash metal (Sodom, Destruction, Kreator), the Teutonic states have surely done their part to advance Satan's agenda, but only really produced a small handful of standout bands. Norwegian black metal is an established, documented phenomenon; German black metal really isn't. It's a bit strange, but perfectly in line with that stereotypical German obsession with efficiency. Trim the fat, cut the bullshit, sharpen the blade.</p>
<p>With their latest release, <a href=""http://www.secretsofthemoon.org/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Secrets of the Moon</a> have taken their place amongst that short list of notables. Earlier efforts (especially 2009's inspired if slightly uneven <i>Privilegivm</i>) showed them to be formidable contenders in their own right, but<i> Seven Bells</i> has cemented their dark-horse standing. The words ""accessible"" and ""polished"" are not often used within the context of black-metal record reviews, generally for good reason; any album christened with these dubious adjectives is almost surely being torn apart. However, Secrets of the Moon have figured out a way to write catchy, mid-tempo, well-produced songs without sacrificing any integrity, extremity, or creativity.</p>
<p>Having Hellhammer/Celtic Frost/Triptykon legend Tom G. Warrior behind the mixing board might have had something to do with it. His soot-stained fingers are all over the sound here, especially the guitar tone and overall feeling of the recording, rendering it overwhelmingly dark, brooding, and surprisingly crisp. <i>Seven Bells</i> has more in common with Triptykon than Hellhammer. Instead of raw aggression, there's refinement and melancholia; instead of sloppily battered d-beats, there is doom and gloom. It's not very grim, but it works. Ever since a man with a guitar met a demon at the crossroads, it's been a well-worn fact that the devil's got the best tunes. It's only rock'n'roll, after all, but there's nothing godly in a Delta groove; it's all sex and sweat and gunsmoke. Secrets of the Moon have defrosted their Satanic hymns and amped up the swagger, and are all the better for it.</p>
<p>This is black metal stripped of its pretensions and predatory instincts and left to fend for itself in a strange new world. Here, the longstanding UK gothic doom metal icons Paradise Lost is a more apt reference point than the primitive black vomit of Profanatica. Secrets of the Moon work within an almost constant mid-tempo pocket, and drink deeply from the chalice of velvety British doom as often as they sink their teeth into Nordic blasts. Funeral bells open the album, appearing sporadically throughout (see ""Serpent Messiah"", a slinky black'n'roll number with a soaring chorus). The songs are deceptively simple, slipping interesting elements or chord progressions into the mostly straightforward grooves to make sure you're paying attention. The 11-minute behemoth <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=YdqPAoug07U"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Nyx""</a> closes with four solid minutes of ethereal ambience, then ""The Three Beggars"" kicks back into a more traditional (albeit synth-accented) slice of black malice, tempered with another dose of gothy elegance before fading to black.</p>
<p>With <i>Seven Bells</i>, Secrets of the Moon deviate from the norm on almost all counts, hanging on to a few stalwart standards-- the raspy croaks, requisite blastbeats, and filthy, buried rock'n'roll swing-- but turning their backs on orthodoxy in favor of progression and weirdness. It's a good look for them.</p></div>"|16547.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16547-seven-bells/|7.5|Kim Kelly

Christian Marclay made a ""Record Without a Cover"" in 1985, but there were records without covers in collections all across the land, gathering dirt and becoming cracked and impossible to play. But 1s and 0s are forever, so we yearn for the days of imperfection. <a href=""http://www.preservation.com.au/product/nuojuva-valot-kaukaa"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Nuojuva</a>, the project of Finnish producer Olli Aarni, who previously recorded as Ous Mal, is designed to explore the boundaries between repetition and the unpredictable, analog and digital, clarity and warble. </p>
<p>Tracks on <i>Valot Kaukaa</i> feel like spaces where elements are introduced and allowed to interact instead of compositions where things move from point A to point B. Aarni lays piano, guitar, cello, violin, deeply reverbed and unintelligible vocals, and watery synths on a table and then subjects them to an acid bath of pitch shifts, analog crackle, digital pop, and extreme EQing. While individual sounds are often ""distressed,"" the cumulative effect is lulling and beautiful, making a strong argument for distortion as a reverie-inducing narcotic. </p>
<p>The current figure Nuojuva most resembles in terms of tone and overall affect is <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28640-balam-acab/"" target=""_blank"">Balam Acab</a>, especially given his fondness for liquid sounds that splash against the tracks' container. But where the latter has a strong connection to the beat, Aarni lets his pieces build and unravel away from the rigidity of the grid. So even though Nuojuva shares an approach with Balam Acab, <i>Valot Kaukaa</i> feels less bound to genre, and the introduction of acoustic instruments ties the tracks to a more studied ""new music"" classical air despite the overall sound seeming very much like the product of a laptop.</p>
<p>The best tracks here have an edge where they seem just about to develop and change and build into a melody but they're barely held back by loops and repetition. ""Pihlajan Varjoissa"" has a droney background that sounds like a mixture of symphonic samples and stretched ethereal voices, adds some piano runs that sound like they were recorded on a speech cassette on a half-broken tape recorder from 1978, and folds in a winding melodica line that lingers like a half-remembered fragment of dub. ""Laakso"" has a similar effect, but with the addition of bird sounds and a dollop of vinyl pop. These tracks constantly seem to be gathering themselves to push into something else, a place with linear melodies and chord changes, but they never quite make it there. That lack of fulfillment gives the music a crucial sense of tension, and without it, this stuff would be too pretty and would too easily slip into the background.  </p>
<p>Vocals, by Aarni and Rachel Evans of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29901-motion-sickness-of-time-travel/"" target=""_blank"">Motion Sickness of Time Travel</a>, also occupy an intriguing in-between space. On ""Huominen"", a drone enters and you can't tell whether you are listening to a proper voice, a mellotron, or a sample. They float in and out and give a suggestion of humanity without going all-in. Vocals functioning as an additional texture is nothing new, of course, but there is something about how they just float in and around the instruments and refuse to push themselves to the front. </p>
<p>As lovely as <i>Valot Kaukaa</i> is, it's a crowded field for this sort of blurred ambience, and there's no getting around the fact that the album doesn't stand out in any significant way (given how it functions, ""standing out"" doesn't exactly seem like the point). It's there, but you have to listen hard to find Aarni's voice and how its transmission is garbled in an individual way. </p></div>"|16549.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16549-valot-kaukaa/|6.9|Mark Richardson

A strong look, but there's an element of dress-up to that kind of rock'n'roll posturing. In reality, Gibson was driving trucks, among other things, and while his new solo guise might reflect more honesty or depth, it's no less rugged or brave.</p>
<p><i>All Hell </i>finds Gibson digging through crates of country music past and turning up a wealth of noirish, creepy source material to sample. On <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13152-in-the-beginning/"" target=""_blank"">""In the Beginning""</a>, a dusty piano trapped in its own motion repeats as Gibson croons over the top. It's a simple blueprint but one from which Gibson teases surprise as the song unfolds-- from an electronic whoosh to a single-note female chorus. Those elements lull you further into Gibson's strange dreamworld but at the same time hold you firmly on the precipice of a rude awakening.</p>
<p>Another highlight, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13489-tiffany-lou/"" target=""_blank"">""Tiffany Lou""</a>, plays the same trick: This time a skittering chorus feels like a broken hard drive trying to whirr into life. Pitched down voices start the track, bathing it in a low droning hum as Gibson spins an oddly affecting story. Both here and elsewhere, his characters are washed-up, pathetic, and old. Tiffany Lou's father ""died with his mind on fire, and his jeans half on,"" whilst on ""Ray"", our protagonist ""looked like a movie star, but grew up to be totally worthless.""</p>
<p>As with the gritty country music that Gibson re-imagines, his characters are timeless too-- rural and small-town, still as far away from an iPad as their grandfathers were 50 years ago. But there's nothing mawkish or condescending about <i>All Hell</i>. This record knows how to knock and groove too-- ""Lookin' Back on '99"" is pumped with a 4/4 beat that lurches forward more like a <a href=""http://youtu.be/bfwqOtcy76k"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Matthew Dear</a> track. Here Gibson remembers the good old days, but there's a razor in the candyfloss: ""Don't we love the love we knew/ When it's just an empty glass in the bedroom."" Right at this moment Gibson's good time becomes a fading copy of a copy of a good time. That his revelation comes in an almost dancefloor-ready setting makes this feel more like music for barflies that prefer to lope in dark corners of clubs than sit propped up on bar stools.</p>
<p><i>All Hell</i> is a subtly clever record that pits one type of music that strongly evokes one era-- here, country music-- against another, namely this decade's sample-heavy culture. Gibson does a lot of questioning within that framework, both seriously and tongue-in-cheek. All of that makes for a rewarding record to think about, and to intellectualize, but <i>All Hell</i> wouldn't be nearly so fun to listen to if it weren't for Gibson's ear for melody. His thick baritone breezes confidently over the songs, lassoing hook after hook, redeeming his burnt-out characters through song. As he knowingly sings at one point: ""If I lose you I might/ Write a song about some rain on a highway.""</p></div>"|16466.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16466-daughn-gibson-all-hell/|8.1|Hari Ashurst

As the tale goes, drummer <span class=""st"">Jarrett <i></i></span>Dougherty suffered from tendonitis during the band's infancy, which barred him from drumming for weeks on end. While recovering he spent much time with Michael Azerrad's seminal survey of 1980s indie rock in America, <i>Our Band Could Be Your Life</i>, presumably getting stuck on the ethos, humility, and hybrid rock stylings of the Minutemen.</p>
<p>Quite fittingly, the band recorded its 2006 debut on a shoestring budget in Dougherty's attic. They booked hundreds of shows themselves. In time, the college student who ran the local punk label Don Giovanni threatened suicide if the band didn't sign on for 2009's <i>Power Move</i>, so they did. They were plucked up by the Dead Weather and toted around the States on tour. They were <a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/breaking-screaming-females-20090701"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">written about by a teenager for <i>Rolling</i> <i>Stone</i></a>.

<p>If any Screaming Females record has suggested they may someday become a group worthy of cataloging in a book like Azerrad's, <i>Ugly</i> is it, igniting a classic punk sound with a friction that falls somewhere between SST and PJ Harvey's <i>Rid of Me</i>. The band's sound has always been characterized by frontwoman Marissa Paternoster's fiery howl and brutal guitar work, the latter of which has garnered her <a href=""http://www.villagevoice.com/bestof/2009/award/best-guitar-shredder-1436333/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Best Guitar Shredder""</a> distinctions that never feel hyperbolic. <i>Ugly</i> puts a newfound emphasis on songcraft and sustained momentum. Paternoster has always been an astounding guitarist and performer, equal parts J Mascis and Carrie Brownstein; her songwriting is finally entering the ring.</p>
<p>Given the backstory, it's almost comical that the record begins with the title <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13186-it-all-means-nothing/"" target=""_blank"">""It All Means Nothing""</a>. Much of the discourse surrounding the Females has centered on Paternoster's spectacle: She shreds, she is very short, and she is also female. But here, she equates her self-worth to ""a broken hand"" and makes it clear that she can't buy what people are selling her. There is a fun, anti-commercial sentiment that comes with her dismissal of a commodity for sale, and the song's opening line-- ""You take what's mine, and face me like you're blind/ It all means nothing""-- diminishes the relevance of a visual element.</p>
<p>Of her sonic trademarks, one of Paternoster's most distinct characteristics is her vocal vibrato, which conveys a sense of liberation that is intrinsic to the band; like a maximum-throttled Corin Tucker, little is restrained, and she occasionally dips into a hardcore screech. The chorus of ""Rotten Apple"" finds Paternoster painting words with a broad palette, hitting the many corners of her register over a pointed guitar crunch. Loud, animated shrieks come often at the end of the band's songs-- like the unhinged bellow that helps close out ""Red Hand"" (and that's after three minutes of Paternoster sounding like she could maybe murder someone). The color red is a noticeable motif throughout <i>Ugly</i>, from the ""red ribbon"" and ""red blood"" on ""Slow Birth"", to ""Doom 84"", a heavy seven-minute piece that's true to its name, where Paternoster is ""blinking red fury."" This emphasizes the passion, rage, and aggression on <i>Ugly</i>, qualities that make rock music such a powerful language of freedom, particularly for women.</p>
<p><i>Ugly</i> is the most varied Screaming Females record, as evidenced on tracks like ""Leave It All Up to Me"", which is full of vaguely psychedelic fretboard mystics. Album closer ""It's Nice"" is a real change-up, a proper Screaming Females ballad, with Paternoster's vocals showcased over orchestral strings, as she sings, presumably, about not selling out (""If I'm bought and sold, then I'm cruising in on a dead end street""). Hell hath no fury like Paternoster on ""High"", where she is at her most anxious and intimidating. One of the most frightening moments of the album comes with her roar at the end and its ensuing patch of chaos; it's also one of the many points seemingly designed for a live show. </p>
<p>Visceral lyrics abound elsewhere on <i>Ugly</i>, and Paternoster specializes in violent, abstract musings. She offers plenty of references to death and an undefined ""family curse,"" and all over, there are images of blood and bones, a clenched gun or noose, a burning altar or sun. The earth shakes. The sea recedes. At a point, there is a sour taste in Paternoster's mouth.</p>
<p>But Paternoster also gets quite literal about the radical qualities of what she is doing-- a testament to her growing capabilities as a lyricist. On ""Something Ugly"" she is on the phone with her mother, afraid to die alone; on ""Crow's Nest"", she's trapped in a self-constructed ""prison,"" analyzing her own scars. She burns, throughout, with an earnest desire to quench and feed her own wants and needs. Paternoster is perpetually contemplating her own satisfaction, pleading for help, and presenting clear-headed ideas about defiance, all the while exerting her knack for creating suspense on a song and then, with her band, leaving it entirely obliterated.</p>
<p>One of the record's most surprising moments comes on the otherwise unmemorable ""Help Me"". Paternoster admits she'll ""learn your letters"" and ""rewrite all the books,"" after which, she declares, ""you've been warned."" Screaming Females are a group with a classic rock sound who are expanding our idea of what a rock band can be. They could help redefine it if Paternoster remains true to her word.</p></div>"|16539.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16539-ugly/|8.0|Jenn Pelly

Yes, there are those death and thrash influences-- no denying the air-guitaring solos, Swedish influences, or double leads. But when you listen to the Seattle-via-Bellingham quintet's second full-length, <i>Sentenced to Death</i>, you're just as likely to hear early East Coast hardcore acts like Cro-Mags and a variety of European crust punks as you are Slayer or Entombed (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzr_TFNxW1c"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">from whom they likely snagged their name</a>, via a cover of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GozI-xg6Jk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">an earlier Repulsion song</a>, and definitely nicked their <a href=""http://youtu.be/LS95rMPxr0Q"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">HM-2 guitar tone</a>).</p>
<p>Also, Black Breath feature folks who used to play in groups like the melodic hardcore band Shook Ones and the old-school-style floor-punchers <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/goitalonehc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Go It Alone</a>, <span class=""st""><a href=""http://www.straight.com/article/blue-monday-plays-it-straight"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Blue Monday</a>,</span> and <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/getthemosthc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Get the Most</a>. It makes sense they're working with Southern Lord again, too: SL label head Greg Anderson was in a bunch of straightedge hardcore bands in the early 1990s, including Brotherhood and Amenity and then, later, the post-hardcore group, Engine Kid. You're still a hardcore kid after you grow your hair out. </p>
<p><i>Sentenced</i> follows 2010's <i>Heavy Breathing</i>, an album that didn't hit me as hard as this one. I'm glad folks are ditching the rock'n'roll and going full-on punk in 2012 (see also <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30341-struck-by-lightning/"" target=""_blank"">Struck by Lightning</a>). My favorite song on the last album was ""Fallen"", a blunt track that felt youth crew, in a gone-to-seed sort of way. They continue that here, and without the slower bluesy numbers like the last LP's swollen, almost six-minute ""Unholy Virgin"".</p>
<p>They recorded again with Converge's Kurt Ballou, who again does a great job, and they've upped the pace considerably-- see the excellent standout <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g74LSUiVyf8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Home of the Grave""</a>, perhaps the most ""groove""-oriented song on the album. They also go rapid-fire, as on ""Forced Into Possession"", which blurs by in under two minutes. And ""Doomed"" is doom only in name; close you eyes, and this is fucking Youth of Today (sans cookies) or Gorilla Biscuits. Throughout, the much-improved vocalist Neil McAdams leads plenty of shout-along choruses, like the one on the opener ""Feast of the Damned"" and it's mosh breakdowns.</p>
<p>Not everything is so lean: We get a longer, slower intro on ""Endless Corpse"", ""The Flame"" definitely nods toward the sludgier momentum of 2010, and awesomely huge closer ""Obey""-- something that feels almost <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YR9Bspqbps"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Jane Doe""</a>-like in scale-- opens to gorgeous dual metal guitar soloing; but by and large, there's no ""fucking around"" here. This music won't slow a pit down at the live show, and there are tracks that would fit on a bill with the group's previous bands.</p>
<p>In general, 2012 is sort of like the year mid-tempo died; drop the Black Sabbath nodding and dig deeper into the Discharge, Mob 47, Anti Cimex, and your own past as a hardcore kid. I'm not sure what's inspiring so many metal groups to go the path of d-beat and crust; I'd like to think it has something to do with America's uncertain economic future, or anarchism's relatively high profile in the wake of the Occupy movement. Whatever the case, folks are restless, and it's exciting.</p></div>"|16543.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16543-sentenced-to-life/|7.6|Brandon Stosuy

Born in Idaho, he moved even further west to Portland, Oregon, where he formed <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/horsefeathersmusic"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Horse Feathers</a> in 2004. Embracing a somber sound that proved an ideal setting for his slightly androgynous vocals, he managed to conceive his own personal idea of string-band folk, one that disregarded the technical prowess and lively performance style of East Coast strains. Instead, he emphasized mood and texture over rhythm and melody, as though drawing primarily from the incidental music of soundtracks. His first albums under the Horse Feathers moniker sounded fresh and distinctive, and yet, as the project has aged, its limitations have grown clearer. The band has one mood: minor-key solemnity.</p>
<p><i>Cynic's New Year</i>, the title of Horse Feathers' latest album, implies a new beginning, albeit one for the pessimist in Ringle. His lyrics have always documented the friction between hope and despair, entertaining a tentative optimism and a shrugging fatalism that both sound much bleaker for the band's downcast folk arrangements. For this album, he brought in scores of Portland musicians to add flourishes of piano, reeds, banjo, and horns-- all of which are gracefully absorbed into the band's signature sound. Staccato plucks and percussive strums paint ""Better Company"" as a kind of backwoods noir full of quiet foreboding, and on ""Where I'll Be"", the strings mimic a pedal steel, allowing the band to translate country music to the Pacific Northwest. But Ringle is expanding Horse Feathers' palette, not necessarily its sound. Even with a larger backing band, he's still retracing his own steps, careful to walk in his own footsteps.</p>
<p>In some part, the band's limitations spring from Ringle's voice, a distinctive instrument that's not particularly agile. He gives the impression of chilly distance, of someone singing to himself rather than an audience. There's nothing inherently wrong with that, especially considering Horse Feathers' chamber-folk aesthetic, and he shines on ""Better Company"" and ""Pacific Bray"". But that voice holds each song to the same funereal pace, rendering <i>Cynic's New Year</i> a trudging listen. Similarly, his songwriting is idiosyncratic yet strangely constrained. Ringle writes evocative lyrics that carry a great deal of ominous weight (""something wicked this way is bound to come,"" he warns on ""Nearly Old Friends""), and his best songs are typically the most concrete. ""Every night we all go to a house we'll never own,"" he sings on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13194-fit-against-the-country/"" target=""_blank"">""Fit Against the Country""</a>. ""Every night we are tired, we've been worked to the bone."" Ringle doesn't work to connect the song to current economic woes; the narrator could be one of Steinbeck's itinerant workers or one of Kathryn Stockett's oppressed maids. Instead, he simply lets the implications speak for themselves, rendering the song both timely and timeless.</p>
<p>On the other hand, he tends to treat verses and choruses as unnatural and suspect, like strip malls that have displaced woodlands. His melodies can be so understated that they sound almost amelodic-- just another element contributing to the album's ambience. Ultimately, there's something passive and decorous about <i>Cynic's New Year</i>: Horse Feathers are quick to set a mood and diligent in sustaining it, but it's pretty much the same mood they've struck on all their albums. Would it be so cynical to expect them to work harder for our attention?</p></div>"|16545.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16545-cynics-new-year/|6.3|Stephen M. Deusner

Whether the music should be called hypnagogic is an open question-- ""I don't even know what that word means,"" <a href=""http://the-out-door.tumblr.com/private/18951342896/tumblr_m0kqlqaOWP1qih89p"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ettinger told me</a> in March-- but it turns out the record was a kind of finale. He's moved on from its elongated, abstract sonic adventures to something more pointed-- the unabashed synth-pop of <i>Lifetime of Romance</i>.</p>
<p>Focused on shorter tunes with heavy beats, melodic loops, and the most singing of Ettinger's career, <i>Lifetime of Romance </i>is a decided departure-- especially for someone only in his early 20s. But connections to previous work do emerge. He's still fond of repetition, letting his cycles stretch past the ends of his vocal lines. He still builds layers of sound that intersect without smothering each other. Where droning chords and rippling arpeggios did that job before, now squiggly synth lines overlap with similar alchemy.</p>
<p>Ettinger also hasn't abandoned his knack for telling a story with his songs. The mostly instrumental <i>New Age Outlaws </i>was <a href=""http://getoffthecoast.blogspot.com/2011/01/guest-post-dylan-ettinger.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">purportedly</a> the tale of a futuristic cop battling corruption. On <i>Lifetime of Romance</i>, Ettinger's thematic intentions are clearer. These are tales of failed love, cataloging the frustrations and disappointments of relationships past. While it's not always easy to glean literal meanings, each tune oozes with barbed emotion-- a gothic angst that evokes the brood of Bauhaus and the catchier gloom of Gary Numan or early Depeche Mode.</p>
<p>What this album reminds me of most, though, is the Cure. Not in terms of literal sound-- Ettinger uses only synths and pedals, no guitars-- but in the way Robert Smith and company turn repetition into trance, without letting a structured song become a wandering jam. So where <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ycl_ayPHU0&amp;ob=av2n"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Fascination Street""</a> feels both like a pop hook and a mantra, so do <i>Lifetime of Romance</i> tracks such as the soaring <i>Neuromancer</i>-referencing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/tv/musicvideos/1792-wintermute/"">""Wintermute""</a> or the buzzing <a href=""http://w.mulletover.co.uk/DYLAN-ETTINGER-ARCO-IRIS/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Arco Iris""</a>. The result is music that's tight yet open, compact yet expansive. And Ettinger injects it with so much character that even his coldest grooves feel personal.</p>
<p>All of which leaves him in a kind of no man's land relative to his peers. He's certainly no longer classifiable as chillwave or hypnagogic (if he ever was), nor can he be lumped into a new New Age. Even on a diverse label like Not Not Fun, his sound stands alone. It's a good sign-- Ettinger seems willing to follow his own muse rather than fly where the wind's blowing. And even though <i>Lifetime of Romance </i>has its influences and antecedents, what impresses most is its individuality.</p></div>"|16542.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16542-lifetime-of-romance/|7.9|Marc Masters

It's unclear why. But their thirst for vengeance, their monomaniacal desire to visit fiery destruction on the powers-that-be, is crystal-clear on <i>The Money Store</i>, even if nothing else-- where the hell this album came from; who plays which instrument; what the lead singer is yelling about; and what on earth this band of insurgents is doing signing an Epic Records contract with L.A. Reid-- makes much sense at all. When playing this album, the only thing I'm sure of is my overwhelming desire to split my forehead open on a cinder block.</p>
<p>The Sacramento group seems to have landed from an alternate planet, or at least an alternate decade when defiantly mutant outfits like this were occasionally given major-label backing. They've been persistently tagged as ""rap rock"" for context, but it's not a very useful description of their music. For starters, not much of <i>The Money Store</i> scans as rock: It's confrontational, abrasive, and chaotic, but only one of its 13 tracks includes a remotely guitar-like noise (""I've Seen Footage"") and even that turns out to be a bent, sickly synthesizer. Most of the album is an alien swarm of buzzing and sputtering noises. Death Grips' Zach Hill, a drummer for the fiendishly technical noise-rock band <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2003-hella/"" target=""_blank"">Hella</a>, has also chewed his way through numerous projects, including work with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5136-marnie-stern/"" target=""_blank"">Marnie Stern</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19280-boredoms/"" target=""_blank"">Boredoms</a>, and bits of all this float through <i>The Money Store</i>'s wildly unpredictable 41 minutes.</p>
<p>Whatever L.A. Reid was thinking when he signed these guys, he surely didn't meddle in their creative process. Sometimes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15413-goblin/"">this hands-off approach backfires</a>, but Death Grips have actual designs to be left to, and <i>The Money Store</i> is a million-mph blur of ideas. One can only imagine how many hours it took to make Hill's drums sound like they're traveling inward from every corner of the mix toward its center, but the music seems to be constantly lunging out at you from all sides. A Bollywood vocal sample on ""Punk Weight"" is obliterated by a mortar-round hailstorm of viciously treated percussion. On ""Hustle Bones"", a tar-thick drone of indeterminate origin (guitar? computer?) pops into a glitter of synthesized voices. And ""Hacker"", the final track, hits a peak that the entire album seems to gather towards: With its simple chorus chant (""I'M IN YOUR AREA"") and uncharacteristic amount of empty space, it's the only song Death Grips have recorded so far that tugs at your hips as much as it bludgeons your skull.</p>
<p>As for ""rap"": To call what lead vocalist Stefan Burnett (aka MC Ride) does ""rapping"" stretches the definition of the word beyond what even an avowed Lil B and Waka Flocka Flame fan like me can endorse. Burnett's deranged shouting brings a lot of things to mind-- Mark E. Smith with his mouth full, Jim Jones during an air raid, Sloth from <i>The Goonies</i>-- but rapping isn't one of them. Follow his lines closely and you'll slam up against the realization that you're largely transcribing word salad: ""The fuck you staring at/ You know I'd be so quick to flash/ Terrified of the way a basilisk come out and skin so fast,"" Burnett barks on ""The Cage"". But his hoarse, panicked voice functions as primal fight-or-fight communication: Things Are Not All Right.</p>
<p>The clearest link through all the pop-culture static to the music Death Grips make is back to the ultra-aggressive, defiantly ignorant, and proudly dumb American hardcore punk-metal moment of the 1980s-- right along the Suicidal Tendencies/Fear/Cro-Mags axis. I don't watch a lot of skate videos these days, but I know a great highlight-reel song when I hear it, and every moment of <i>The Money Store</i> qualifies. Like those bands, Death Grips appeals to the knuckle-dragging troglodyte and the smirking smart kid in us: thick-headed goonery and bookish, viscera-free nerdiness, making beautifully misanthropic music together. Granted, <i>The Money Store</i> is about as intellectual an experience as a scraped knee. But it's just as good at reminding you that you're alive.</p></div>"|16512.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16512-death-grips-the-money-store/|8.7|Jayson Greene

It just wasn't one that gave him much incentive to get retrospective: Whenever his excellent sophomore LP <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15129-underneath-the-pine/"" target=""_blank""><i>Underneath the Pine </i></a>and the subsequent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15785-freaking-out-ep/"" target=""_blank""><i>Freaking Out </i>EP </a>were deemed ""progressions,"" it felt like backhanded praise for the artistic distance he was creating from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13931-causers-of-this/"" target=""_blank""><i>Causers of This</i></a>, an album that's become weirdly underrated as its chillaxed aesthetic is seemingly blamed for everything from the death of indie rock to LeBron James' laissez-faire attitude in crunch time. So, at the very least, you have to admire the audacity of Bundick dipping into his personal stash for <i>June 2009</i>, a collection of singles written around the same time as <i>Causers of This</i>.</p>
<p>While they're not the proverbial naked baby pictures, <i>June 2009</i> doesn't dispute the idea of Bundick as someone who ultimately profited from our collective deadbeat summer at the outset. You sense that Bundick had a clear idea of the kind of songs he wanted to write, but there's also the enormous strides he was yet to make as a producer, as an arranger, as a full-blown <i>artist. </i>It's not too hard to view the propulsive, clean melodic lines of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13080-dead-pontoon/"" target=""_blank"">""Dead Pontoon""</a> (his strongest early single) as a preview for <i>Underneath the Pine </i>rid of that record's newfound Eurocentric influences. But early on, Bundick used his immediate surroundings as topical inspiration for mundane songs: vehicles, geographic proper names, ""Girl Problems"". Considering the self-consciousness that's crept into his artistic process, it's impossible to imagine him ever being in a mindset where he'd write something like ""Ektelon"", an incredibly literal recollection of a river tubing expedition. </p>
<p>As expected, Ariel Pink is namedropped as the major influence, but when Bundick fails to hit some hilariously amateur falsetto notes on ""Best Around"" or ""Take the L to Leave"", it's more reminiscent of Rivers Cuomo's strangely fearless <i>Alone </i>tapes-- this isn't the work of a visionary weirdo but rather a guy who sees benefits in the mere archival and procedural aspects of creation. The immediacy and economy of Bundick's songwriting extended to his recording at the time as well. The songs are very short and structurally unfussy, while production values are basically nil, relying on the kinds of tricks familiar to anyone fucking around with their first four-track: doubling vocals in octaves, letting the entire mix submerge under the bass, the R&amp;B and pop of one's youth channeled through Casio presets. </p>
<p>With that in mind, <i>June 2009</i> almost has to be chronologically sequenced in light of just how jarring ""Sad Sams"" turns out to be. Up to that point, it's mostly hummable, punchy guitar music with some bubble-funk affectations, pleasant if not particularly unique amongst the scores of lo-fi artists doing the same thing. The roller-rink pop of ""Drive South"" hints at Bundick starting to get a grasp for rhythm and texture but ""Sad Sams"" sounds like the first clean break-- the drum machines are still crudely recorded and might be overcompensating in terms of volume, but you can hear in the slick harmonies and wobbly arrangement that it's where Toro Y Moi really started to take shape. Immediately thereafter, ""Talamak"" offers a means of direct comparison: Both the ""First Version"" and the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/tv/musicvideos/367-talamak/"" target=""_blank"">one that appeared on <i>Causers of This </i></a>were subject to Dilla-esque warping and tape degradation, but the latter showed evidence of Bundick's incredible progress as a sound crafter. The pops and hisses sounded very intentional and smartly deployed, whereas here, ""Talamak"" just sounds like it was dubbed to an old cassette.</p>
<p>Still, there's no getting around the fact that <i>June 2009 </i>acquires most of its value, if not all of it, in context with <i>Causers of This </i>and <i>Underneath the Pine</i>. But it allows you to think ""big picture"" not only about Bundick, but the role of production and atmosphere in general. The most common criticism of Toro Y Moi is that it's more ""vibes"" than ""songs,"" which assumes a false binary. Don't get me wrong, I love me a raw and dead-sober Steve Albini production, but it would completely negate the effect of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11375-blessa/"" target=""_blank"">""Blessa""</a>, where Bundick's woozy, almost drunken ambience coincided with that song's bittersweet resignation-- you could easily envision someone in a humid South Carolina apartment, beer in hand, shirt untucked, at the end of a long day in the office. By the same token, I wouldn't want to hear a Toro Y Moi remix of a Bill Callahan song. The bustling anti-chillwave cottage industry could certainly look at <i>June 2009 </i>as a ""gotcha"" moment for Bundick-- as far as typical ""songwriting"" metrics go, it's pretty thin.  But I say that's bullshit, and <i>June 2009 </i>in its own way makes an even better case for Toro Y Moi as a band that may have initially benefited from good timing, but also has the ambition and learning curve to keep improving on an already impressive catalog.</p></div>"|16520.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16520-toro-y-moi-june-2009/|6.0|Ian Cohen

Sure, it's never been music's most commercially viable subgenre, but I suspect an element of cosmic doom, too. Bios of the guys who've devoted entire careers to multi-tracked harmonies, anthemic choruses, and Pete Townshend windmills all seem to take the shape of rocketships cocked for the moon but fatefully, eternally stalled on the launch pad. Michigan-born <a href=""http://brendanbenson.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Brendan Benson</a>'s no exception. His best record, 1996's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/656-one-mississippi/"" target=""_blank""><i>One Mississippi</i></a>-- the one that was supposed to launch him into the alt-rock stratosphere-- has one of those classic mid-1990s major label tales: Virgin Records didn't hear a hit and made him re-record it, scrimped on the promotional backing once he did, and promptly dropped him when the record failed to chart. Though Benson found relative success playing second fiddle to Jack White in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3674-the-raconteurs/"" target=""_blank"">the Raconteurs</a> in the mid-aughts, this initial bummer seems to have set the tone for his career; his four solo albums of energetic, serviceable power pop have flown under most people's radars.</p>
<p>His fifth, <i>What Kind of World</i>, finds him playing the rock'n'roll loser once again, and occasionally meriting the Alex Chilton haircut he sports on its cover. ""Here it goes again/ Another losing streak,"" he drawls on ""Bad For Me"", the pleasantly melodic if aurally nondescript lead-off single, ""Guess I'm on a roll."" On the more keyed-up title track, he barks a similarly discouraged refrain, ""What kind of world/ Would take me apart/ Before I can start?"" As that lyric (in addition to plenty others) implies, Benson is not the sort of writer who makes very deep dives into the ol' rhyming dictionary. But he possesses a knack for melody-- and even more importantly, a dutiful belief in the cathartic potential of an explosive chorus-- that usually renders his barebones lyrics forgivable. Indebted to songwriters like Todd Rundgren, Chilton, and occasionally Elvis Costello (there's a mod-ish, ""Watching the Detectives"" quality to tracks like the shuffle-footed ""Keep Me""), Benson's melodies aim for timelessness rather than cling to any identifiable trends.</p>
<p>Even in its brighter moments, though, <i>What Kind of World</i> makes it no easier to pick Benson out of a Scraggly-Haired Dude With a Guitar police line-up (hint: Ben Kweller's probably the one in the dumb hat). Benson has never exactly been Mr. Personality, but his early records were not without the sort of eccentric charms of songs like the goofy Brit-inspired ditty ""Tea"". His thematic concerns have matured since his days of writing songs like <i>One Mississippi</i>'s ""Maginary Girl"": <i>World</i> tracks like the piano-driven closer ""On the Fence"" candidly explore its narrator's reluctance to commit to a stable relationship (""Never been the type to want to settle down/ But never had the nerve to ramble on"").</p>
<p>Still, largely devoid of lyrical texture and detail, the universe conjured by <i>World</i> often feels bland to a fault. ""I can't decide on this way or another/ So I live my life just sitting on this fence,"" Benson sings on that closer; if only it didn't feel like such a fitting theme song for <i>What Kind of World</i>. Failing to assert a distinct identity, over the course of the song Benson instead enumerates the things he's not: ""a lover,"" ""a fighter""-- and in the end, he doesn't even really own the loser epithet either: The record feels too well-mannered to express much genuine disappointment or rage. Which makes <i>World</i> feel like a missed opportunity more than anything else: When you're already the loser, what else have you got to lose?</p></div>"|16528.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16528-brendan-benson/|6.2|Lindsay Zoladz

It's not nostalgia, really-- it's finding ways to simplify and navigate the present. For the past few months it's been a certain kind of hardcore, metal, and punk, both older (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22512-tragedy/"" target=""_blank"">Tragedy</a>, Dystopia, <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/features/show-no-mercy/8777-build-no-system/"" target=""_blank"">Stormcrow</a>), newer (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5631-disfear/"" target=""_blank"">Disfear</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30079-trap-them/"" target=""_blank"">Trap Them</a>), and 2012 modern. As far as the most recent stuff, <a href=""http://www.blackbreath.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Black Breath</a>'s <i>Sentenced to Life</i> and the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16494-split-cranium/"" target=""_blank"">Split Cranium LP</a> do the trick, as does <i>True Predation</i>, the second album from <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/struckbyfuckinglightning"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Struck by Lightning</a>. Like Split Cranium-- which features Aaron Turner from Isis and <span class=""st"">Jussi Lehtisalo of Circle dialing things up a bit-- this Columbus, Ohio, quartet isn't your ""typical"" punk group. They do, however, stick close enough to the script to remain perfectly familiar.<br/></span></p>
<p>Struck by Lightning feature vocalist and guitarist Gregory Lahm, who previously played in the Dayton post-metal group Mouth of the Architect, a band that stretches atmospheric sludge compositions beyond the 10-minute mark with the help of keyboards and samples. You don't get that here, but you do get subtle ""progressive"" and other unexpected elements working their way into the mix: the backward loops at the end of ""Sickening Reality""; the dark and almost black metal tones of ""Rabid Hysteria""'s opening guitars; the icy, avalanching implosions on ""Slavocracy"". In some respects, they're a bit like Josh Smith's post-Weakling band <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/futurskullz"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Futur Skullz</a>, a Bay Area trio that deals in super-techy riffs over full-throttling. In both cases you get a real sense of experience and a varied résumé adding distinctive moments to a genre too often about line-toeing-- it's clear these aren't kids banging it out in a basement.</p>
<p>There are flourishes-- basically traces of something broader outside the frame-- but don't look too far into it: The band is mostly focused on angry, dirty, d-beat. They're good at this sort of thing, and they're getting better. Their 2009 debut, <i>Serpents</i>, didn't feel complete to me. It was tentative in some ways, uninterestingly ambitious in others; it wasn't full enough, and it didn't feel resolved. Here, they've slowed things down, streamlined their songwriting, cut back on the ambient wanking, axed the piano, added a sludgier vibe, and have let grim and frosty influences slip into the mix. (You can't really compare them to early Mastodon now, which is a good thing.) Last time it was 11 songs in 46 minutes. Here, it's 10 in 33. They have more momentum, piss, and bile. You still get the shout-along choruses, heavy bass, and rolling drums, but producer Eric Cronstein's made it a dense, pristine swamp of crust and muck. He also got the vocals to sound rawer, murkier, and twice as huge.</p>
<p>Good bands change and refine what they do over time; it's not surprising I wasn't moved by <i>Serpents</i> and find myself returning to this one regularly. What's more unexpected is how life-affirming <i>True Predation</i> is-- <i>very much</i> in spite of itself. I'll bet a song titled <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13401-we-are-all-just-rotting-corpses/"">""We Are All Just Rotting Corpses""</a> isn't the most chipper thing you'll come across today, nor is the refrain of ""fuck you forever"" on ""Mindfucker"" or ""no fucking future"" in ""Slavocracy"" or the very idea of an ""Extinction Event"", but there's something compelling about the raw honesty of Struck by Lightning's straight-up, pissed-off catharsis. And, you know, it's also just satisfying to see a band trim the fat and wind up even bigger.</p></div>"|16531.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16531-true-predation/|7.0|Brandon Stosuy

Their knack for marrying the absurd to the sublime places them in the eccentric lineage of art-rock bands such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3563-the-residents/"">the Residents</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1924-henry-cow/"">Henry Cow</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4216-this-heat/"">This Heat</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3079-nurse-with-wound/"">Nurse With Wound</a>. As with those spiritual comrades, Volcano the Bear have amassed a discography that's easy to get lost in, and <a href=""http://freemusicarchive.org/music/Volcano_the_Bear/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">most of which</a> is now available for free from <a href=""http://wfmu.org/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">WFMU</a>'s excellent <a href=""http://freemusicarchive.org/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Free Music Archive</a>.</p>
<p>What's kept me from getting as lost in Volcano the Bear as I have in the other acts above is their tendency to sound mannered. At times they are so in control that sterility creeps in, and it feels like you're listening to a diagram instead of a song. My favorite moments come when they get woollier and looser, letting the sound guide them rather than the other way around. And when they strike a balance between chaos and order, as they did on 2006's epic <i>Classic Erasmus Fusion</i>, their work becomes profound.</p>
<p><i>Golden Rhythm/Ink Music</i>, Volcano the Bear's first studio album in five years, tips more toward the controlling side. As a result it sits in the middle of their oeuvre in terms of how compelling it is, and lower on the scale of surprise. Crafted by a duo version of the group (with multi-instrumentalists Aaron Moore and Daniel Padden), its more predictable moments lean too heavily on blunt rhythms, mannered vocals, and a tonally flat trumpet. When those three elements occur simultaneously, the album feels somewhat stilted.</p>
<p>Almost as often, though, <i>Golden Rhythm/Ink Music</i> finds sonic angles that are less expected. Usually this is the product of Moore and Padden giving percussion prominence over singing and trumpet-playing. Their beats acquire a junk-shop/kitchen-sink quality that evokes rattling <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4544-tom-waits/"">Tom Waits</a> grooves. Take <a href=""http://soundcloud.com/grim-marseille/volcano-the-bear-baby-photos"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Baby Photos""</a>, whose off-kilter rhythm makes the duo's vocals richer and more responsive. Even better are tunes that dart between disparate moods, be it the schizophrenic ""Spurius Ruga"" or sound-poems like the staccato ""Quiet Salad"" and the cathartic ""Golden Ink"".</p>
<p>Volcano the Bear close <i>Golden Rhythm/Ink Music </i>with a 10-minute cut called ""Fireman Show"". As the record's longest piece, it feels like a summation, containing both unexpected tonal shifts and run-of-the-mill passages of nondescript trumpet and vocals. But the track is more intriguing than ineffective, especially when heard after what's come before. Perhaps it's best to think of the album that way too-- not as isolated statement, but another chapter in an saga still being penned.</p></div>"|16536.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16536-golden-rhythmink-music/|6.7|Marc Masters

Two signs sandwich his reflected face. They read: ""IF YOU TALK TOO MUCH... THIS MAN MAY DIE!"" The image references <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:If_You_Talk_Too_Much_This_Man_May_Die_mirror.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">an actual WWII poster from 1943</a> that encouraged soldiers to be mindful of giving up important information. And, for White's first proper solo endeavor, the image couldn't be more suiting and cleverly self-aware; will his entrance into the typically-confessional solo realm effectively kill the mythical Jack White, the red, white, and black virtuoso who's captured our imagination more than any other rock star over the last 10 years?</p>
<p class=""p1"">Fittingly, the answer isn't short. The fascination with White has endured partly thanks to his mastery of traditional rock'n'roll skills: power, volume, dexterity, charisma. But his talent for untangling and confusing those same tried-and-true ideas is just as vital. He's playing a frightfully sincere take on the blues wearing frightfully silly outfits. He's singing truth and authenticity while fibbing about his backstory. He increasingly seems like a legacy-minded, Rock and Roll Hall of Fame buff, and yet is prone to whimsical novelty like <a href=""http://youtu.be/szoIcNykCc0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">releasing a single via balloons</a> and <a href=""http://youtu.be/OyzjVL5tFn0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">working with Insane Clown Posse</a> (on a profane Mozart redux, no less). He's famously tough to pin down and, at a time when more people are going out of their way to define themselves on a minute-to-minute basis, this slipperiness holds a heightened currency. </p>
<p class=""p1"">So while <i>Blunderbuss</i> is the first album with the words ""Jack White"" on the spine, it's not exactly a great unveiling. After all, Jack White was born John Anthony Gillis; White's idol and friend (and fellow confuser) Bob Dylan was born Robert Allan Zimmerman. Talking about reading Dylan's memoir to <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/apr/13/jack-white-solo-project-blunderbuss"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>The Guardian</i></a>, White said, ""It was painful-- it would bring me to tears or it was like looking in the mirror. It was like a son that had never met his dad."" Considering the kinship, an old Dylan quote from 1978 seems particularly relevant; when he was <a href=""http://www.interferenza.com/bcs/interw/play78.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">asked</a> about his ""purpose,"" Bob quoted Henry Miller: ""The role of an artist is to inoculate the world with disillusionment."" And indeed, <i>Blunderbuss</i> is filled with White's own disenchantment. He's loathe to talk about the personal-life specifics behind his songs, of course, but it's hard to ignore two major events that occurred in the months leading up to the album's creation last year: the dissolution of the White Stripes as well as his marriage to model and singer Karen Elson. As White skips eclectic through early rock, folk, and country styles in a casual and capable fashion reminiscent of <i>The White Album</i>, he moans of voids and angst and violence. Just as we're sucked in by his unknowableness, this meticulous artist is drawn to the things he can't quite get his head around, too. </p>
<p class=""p1"">In <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/08/magazine/jack-white-is-the-savviest-rock-star-of-our-time.html?pagewanted=all"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Josh Eells' brilliant recent <i>New York Times Magazine</i> profile</a>, White opened up about the inner workings of his old band. ""Meg completely controlled the White Stripes,"" he said. ""She's the most stubborn person I've ever met, and you don't even get to know the reasons. [...] That band is the most challenging, important, fulfilling thing ever to happen to me. It's something I really, really miss."" That kind of poignant frustration can be heard throughout <i>Blunderbuss</i>, though, true to form, White often masks these crushed feelings with bouncy instrumentation and arrangements. This juxtaposition is most pronounced on the album's most hummable track, ""Hip (Eponymous) Poor Boy"", a self-deprecating juke-joint number in which he manages to kiss off himself and, quite possibly, his former bandmate/sister/wife. Along with mentions of ""using your name"" (Jack got his surname from Meg), he sings, ""And you'll be watching me, girl/ Taking over the world/ Let the stripes unfurl/ Gettin' rich, singin' poor boy."" Only a few people know precisely how cutting the song is, but its playful defensiveness carries an undeniable sting. It also features the best and simplest explanation for White's extreme work ethic thus far: ""But I can't sit still/ Because I know that I will."" </p>
<p class=""p1"">More often, though, White sings about a vaguer, deeper emptiness. ""But sometimes these feelings can be so misleading,"" he admitted on ""Fell in Love With a Girl"". Now, he sounds like he's through being misled-- he's more fallen than fell. On the simmering, slyly threatening ""Love Interruption"", he's fed up: ""I want love to grab my fingers gently/ Slam them in a doorway/ And put my face into the ground."" It isn't some masochistic fantasy as much as a form of self discipline. ""I won't let love disrupt, corrupt, or interrupt me anymore,"" he concludes. The sentiment dovetails with another quote from the <i>Times</i> piece. ""I've always felt it's ridiculous to say, of any of the females in my life: You're my friend, you're my wife, you're my girlfriend, you're my co-worker,"" he said. ""This is your box, and you're not allowed to stray outside of it."" But this post-love ideal sounds like wishful thinking in the context of <i>Blunderbuss</i>-- not to mention White's well-noted affection for hard structure and self-limitation-- which uses the breakup emotions of hurt and fear to get its best points across.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Opener ""Missing Pieces"" has White bleeding and losing appendages after an unwanted departure, all while a Rhodes skips along without a care. He's beaten up and forced to walk on salt with bottomless feet by what seems like the entire iPhone generation on the rumbling ""Freedom at 21"", a song that perfectly fits the video for ""Sixteen Saltines"", which has him consumed by a chaotic world filled with kids. At 36, this is Jack White battling with his encroaching elder-statesman role, knowing the odds aren't in his favor. He's trembling in front of an almighty Delilah on a cover of the Little Willie John track ""I'm Shakin'"", a song that-- like much of the album-- finds White backed by a group of highly qualified women (including Elson). Though the high-wire element that fueled the White Stripes is absent here, the female accompaniment suggests White knows what brings out the best in him-- even when he's pleading about the infinite pain brought upon him by the opposite sex. He might be vengeful but he's not dumb.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Within White's oeuvre, <i>Blunderbuss</i> hangs in a kind of limbo-- it's closer to earth than his fantastic White Stripes yet further away than the sometimes-pedestrian Raconteurs or Dead Weather. It's got some of his best pure songwriting yet, but no earth-cracking riffs. Still, as a treatise on loss and its schizophrenic aftermath, <i>Blunderbuss</i> is a purposeful success. The eloquent title track dreams up a love affair where White, finally, gets the girl. But there are complications-- she already happens to be spoken for. Slide guitar smudges the picture as White wishes for a world based on desire instead of consequence. Throwing his hands up, he finishes the song: ""Doing what two people need is never on the menu."" The veracity of the tale is anybody's guess. Its disillusionment, though, is real.</p></div>"|16534.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16534-blunderbuss/|7.8|Ryan Dombal

Their third album, <i>Harmonicraft</i>, is a summation of in-flux firsts: This is Torche's first full-length since the wonderful 2008 breakthrough, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12020-meanderthal/"" target=""_blank""><i>Meanderthal</i></a>. It's also their first for Volcom Entertainment after stints on Hydra Head, Robotic Empire, and Rock Action. And it's their first since the departure of lead guitarist Juan Montoya and the addition of Andrew Elstner. You'd be forgiven, then, for expecting something fresh.</p>
<p>But given all <i>Harmonicraft</i>'s inherent turnaround, it's surprising to hear just how codified and predictable Torche sound at this point. The band's early works (and live shows) came possessed by extreme senses of adaptability and possibility, with heavy lumber erupting from heartfelt limber without notice, and vice versa. On <i>Harmonicraft</i>, those assets are subsumed largely by structures and strategies that feel settled from the start. ""Reverse Inverted"" comes off like a song Torche simply forgot to put on any of their previous releases; the chug of ""Skin Moth"" picks up the pace and even adds a bit of falsetto at the start of the hook, though it otherwise might as well be mimeographed from Torche's seven-year-old debut. Despite the new member, the group's stylistic approach feels petrified here, with frontman Steve Brooks constantly staggering his way through mid-tempo verses before shouting mantras above harmony-heavy choruses. Though it's less than 38 minutes long, <i>Harmonicraft</i> starts to mire in monotony before it is half over. As bassist Jonathan Nuñez told <i>Spin</i> in a track-by-track preview earlier this month, ""I don't know, man. They all kind of blur together after you've been talking about them. For me this song is just solid, intense Torche."" He was, mind you, only on track eight of 13.  </p>
<p>That's not to say that <i>Harmonicraft</i> is an unequivocal loss. Despite their proclivity for change, Torche have always embraced a good time, smiling and maybe shirtless on stage, even as they growled through their most viscous marches. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13153-kicking/"" target=""_blank"">""Kicking""</a> is the sort of ricocheted anthem that deserves an arena lights show and a mass of gleeful people singing along, while the chromatic psychedelics and malevolent pulse at the start of ""Snakes Are Charmed"" create thrilling juxtaposition. Brooks lifts his voice a bit for opener ""Letting Go"", thinning his tone until it nears a yelp, suggesting Wayne Coyne with actual blood on his face. Elstner's solo at the start of 90-second ricochet ""Walk It Off"" affords Torche's hum a surprising, delightful squeal, as do his heroic spirals throughout ""Sky Trials"". Time and again, however, these songs skip back to the same middle ground of insistent throb and itinerantly thick vocals, stunting the surprises with typecasts.</p>
<p>With tracks named ""Letting Go"", ""Walk It Off"", ""In Pieces"", and ""Solitary Traveler"", <i>Harmonicraft</i> feels thematically like an attempt to make a break with the past, to show that Torche have survived their split with Montoya and an indecisive EP as a trio to emerge as a renewed recording-and-touring quartet. There are bursts that certainly suggest they want to do that, but others that indicate they might not be able to, at least not yet. The title track, after all, is a roaring Neu! recast, with the motorik beat hitting a little harder, with the guitars tuned to sound a little meaner, the pedals programmed so as to drown the rest of the sound. It's the cleanest break Torche have ever made with their reputation and probably the best thing here; it's unfortunately the outlier for a record best summarized by its own orthodoxy. Maybe this is Torche again dealing with a state of transition, wheels spinning deep into the rut as the band tries to push toward something new. <i>Harmonicraft</i> is not without its moments; it's just that, sometimes, spans of monotony and predictability make remembering or caring for those moments more work than they're worth.</p></div>"|16533.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16533-harmonicraft/|6.5|Grayson Currin

That little curio, oddly enough, might just be the clearest statement <i>Candy Salad</i> makes amidst its 45 twisting, turning minutes. While puzzling it out, I kept coming back to this line, an indication that, hey, maybe this stuff isn't the hardest to grok. At their best, Suckers' songs-- rousing post-Arcade Fire uplifters, vitamin E-soaked sunbeamers, and the occasional yearning ballad-- match ornate instrumental flourishes to rousing, roundabout melodies. But Suckers are tinkerers at heart, and with producer Matt Boynton behind the boards this time out, no sound on <i>Candy Salad</i>'s left untweaked, untreated, or untroubled. It's a real surplus of sound, but sometimes the songs themselves feel a little lost amidst the shuffle.</p>
<p>More than likely, <i>Candy Salad</i>'s surface pleasures wil be enough to draw you in: the wriggly guitar fissures that open ""Charmaine"", the underwater gurgle that multi-instrumentalist Pan applies to much of his low-end bass work, the snatches of Tropicália that surround the glinting <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13280-turn-on-the-sunshine/"" target=""_blank"">""Turn on the Sunshine""</a>. 2010's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14346-wild-smile/"" target=""_blank""><i>Wild Smile</i></a> didn't shy away from this slip-sliding instrumentation, but 10 seconds into opener ""Going Nowhere"" and it's clear Suckers and Boynton spent much of their time in the studio settling on pedal settings and the like. When Suckers' early buzz was peaking around the time of their stellar single ""It Gets Your Body Movin'"", much was made of their connections with legit weirdos Yeasayer, MGMT, and others. But, a couple of lines about ""bodies in the basement"" and serving as somebody's concubine aside, Suckers mostly relegate any oddness to these perpetually unfurling production flourishes.</p>
<p>The songs underneath, then, are left to provide the sturdy canvas upon which Suckers can splatter. That, they do; get past the triumphant whistle that kicks of ""Chinese Braille"", and you're left with a pretty standard-issue mid-tempo pop-rocker that wouldn't be out of character for the likes of Ben Folds or pre-opera Rufus Wainwright. ""Bricks to Bones"" has a nice bend-and-build to it, and ""Lydia"" is a rousing ballad that captures some of the glass-in-the-air, last-minutes-of-prom feel of ""Body"". Sonically, obvious single ""Turn on the Sunshine"" is among the busiest of the bunch, yet the song, underneath all its intemperate intricacy, is something of a breeze. Topping relatively straightforward songwriting with busy production has a tendency to topple over, but to Suckers' credit, the pairing mostly works; in complicating its sounds rather than its songs, <i>Candy Salad</i>'s an easy, inviting listen with plenty of rewards for the closely cocked ear.</p>
<p>A few of the fuller-throated ballads aside, Walker and (especially) Austin Fisher's love-'em-or-leave-'em vocals-- a popular source of contention circa <i>Wild Smile</i>-- are dialed back several notches, resulting in swaths of overly polite undersinging. The trickiness of Boynton's production helps Suckers breeze through the lesser moments, but at times Suckers seem to be busying stuff up simply because they can; the tunes underneath<i></i> seem strong enough to stand on their own, though that's not always easy to see through the dressing up they're given. More than once, I've found myself absentmindedly whistling the towering lead-in to ""Chinese Braille"" or a snatch of swooping harmony from any number of these songs; the actual verses and choruses, while solid enough, aren't nearly as memorable as the stuff surrounding them. And, with many of the songs topping out over five minutes, they've got plenty of room to elaborate, though with much of that effort spent on instrumental left-turns, the more straightaway songs get to feeling like awfully long hauls around minute four. The richly produced, melodically generous <i>Candy Salad</i> is plenty to chew on, but one can't help wishing its songs could be as vibrant as its sounds.</p></div>"|16526.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16526-candy-salad/|6.7|Paul Thompson

Unlike so many bands swept up in the 1990s major-label alt-rock signing blitz, they survived a decade-long stint on Capitol with their sanity intact. Though they haven't scraped the top 40 charts in any country for almost 10 years, they can still tour respectably sized 1,000-capacity clubs around the world. And, having built their own studio in their hometown of Portland, they can produce albums and art projects at their own leisurely pace.</p>
<p>However, as the Dandys' case illustrates, there's a fine line between self-sufficiency and purgatory-- at this point, they're no longer a threat to the mainstream, nor an influential force in any indie micro-scene of note. At their turn-of-the-millennium peak, the Dandy Warhols represented a cheekily decadent antidote to the sincerity and self-importance of cardigan-clad indie rock, but as those orthodoxies have waned, so too has the Dandys' power of provocation. Their nebulous standing is best measured by the fact there's now <a href=""http://www.ifc.com/shows/portlandia"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a whole TV show devoted to skewering Portland hipsterdom</a> that hasn't even deigned to make them a target.</p>
<p>But Dandys frontman Courtney Taylor-Taylor is nothing if not a keen observer, and the band's latest album offers up a surprisingly self-effacing line: ""I used to be cool."" Sure, he sings it in a droll, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bc80tFJpTuo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tim Curry-esque</a> drawl that suggests he's singing in the voice of another, but the song from which it originates, ""Enjoy Yourself"", seemingly makes peace with the fact that his life-of-the-party days are behind him; to wit, the song's title is rhymed with ""enjoy your health."" It's an early indication that <i>This Machine</i> is indeed the most sober Dandy Warhols album to date, reining in the stoner-rock sprawl, the curled-lip snark, and bad puns endemic to so many Dandys releases. At 43 minutes, it's their shortest album yet and, mercifully, about half an hour shorter than 2008's endless <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12100-earth-to-the-dandy-warhols/"" target=""_blank""><i>…Earth to the Dandy Warhols...</i></a>.</p>
<p>Where Dandys records tend to hew strongly toward either droning 1960s psychedelia or synth-powered new wave, <i>This Machine</i> attempts to reconcile the two by homing in on that mid-80s moment when post-punkers started to bask in psychedelic sunshine; one of the key instigators of that movement-- David J of Bauhaus-cum-Love &amp; Rockets-- even chips in with a co-writing cameo on ""The Haunted Carnival"". It's a good look for the Dandys: On that song and the opening ""Sad Vacation"", Taylor-Taylor maintains a coolly unobtrusive presence, singing in hushed tones as shocks of feedback attempt to destabilize their steady backbeats, while the moody ballad ""Well They're Gone"" successfully pulls off a deft balance of Parisian chanson and dubby rhythms. And if the robo-punk instrumental ""Alternative Power to the People"" undermines its intensity with a flurry of annoying faux record-scratch effects, at the very least, it'll give you something new to mix out of Tones on Tail's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_zNg__isZQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Go!""</a> the next time you spin at your local pub's Goth Night.</p>
<p>Given its promising start, you might be inclined to place <i>This Machine</i> on the level of the Dandy's superior first three albums-- but doing so will make you feel like a touchdown-bound wide receiver who <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIWWrdDNBRU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">drops the ball before hitting the end zone</a>. The Dandys' have never been an especially political band, and while their cover of Merle Travis' ""16 Tons"" may give them a backhanded way to address America's economic troubles, its bump-and-grind swing-- featuring Los Lobos' Steve Berlin on sax-- is incongruously hammy to the point of making light of the working-class woe described within. And where Taylor-Taylor has traditionally used his elastic voice to communicate various degrees of disaffection, on <i>This Machine</i>'s would-be power-pop pick-me-ups, ""SETI vs the WOW! Signal"" and ""I Am Free"", he just sounds bored-- ""there's music deep inside of me,"" he claims on the latter, but his monotone delivery suggests he's really singing about embalming fluid. ""Don't Shoot She Cried"" attempts to save face by hearkening back to the Dandys' hazy, psych-drone roots, and yet this six-minute non-starter serves only to remind you that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16503-sweet-heart-sweet-light/"" target=""_blank"">there's a new Spiritualized album out</a>. At the outset, <i>This Machine</i> seems like an apt title for a record that surges forth with a wiry, motorik momentum; by the end, it becomes an all-too-fitting descriptor of a band going through the motions.</p></div>"|16529.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16529-the-dandy-warhols/|5.1|Stuart Berman

When the music bubbled up out of Chicago's South and West Sides two years ago, listeners took notice in part because of the undeniable newness of the sound. Since then, conversation has focused on where footwork is going, especially on where forward-thinking artists both here (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16062-sepalcure/"" target=""_blank"">Sepalcure</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2630-machine-drum/"" target=""_blank"">Machinedrum</a>) and across the Atlantic (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29925-kuedo/"" target=""_blank"">Kuedo</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30012-addison-groove/"" target=""_blank"">Addison Groove</a>) are taking the sound. Planet Mu releases by Chicago artists like DJ Diamond, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14868-da-trak-genious-the-crack-capone/"" target=""_blank"">DJ Nate, and DJ Roc</a> ensured that the scene's progenitors got their due, but those albums-- especially Diamond's <i>Flight Muzik</i>-- strove for rhythmic and melodic complexity foreign to the scene's established M.O.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.planet.mu/artists/traxman"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Traxman</a> is the latest Chicago artist to record a full-length for Planet Mu. <i>Da Mind of Traxman</i> is notable in part because it's an album more concerned with footwork's past than its future. A godfather of the style, Traxman came up in the 1990s ghetto-house scene and fostered the genre through collaborations, DJ sets, and mixes without building up much of a catalog under his own name. <i>Da Mind of Traxman</i> sounds like its title, the pent-up musings of a veteran spilling onto wax. The conversational powers of footwork shouldn't be underrated: Those whirring vocal samples are a language game waiting to happen, and the genre's unapologetic, unmonitored sampling culture allow it to interact with other musics in ways that house and techno often can't.</p>
<p>Traxman syncs footwork to its Chicago lineage-- juke and house-- but more interestingly to soul, funk, and rock. Opening track ""Footworkin on Air"" features what sounds like a wooden xylophone competing with a pointillist sequencer and blocky bass. It's as light and frothy as footwork gets, and it has as much to do with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/110-aphex-twin/"" target=""_blank"">Aphex Twin</a> as Dance Mania. Traxman often downplays his drum machines; I get the impression he cares as much about Rhodes pianos as he does 808s. ""Itz Crack"" and ""Rock You"" contrast lilting jazz/soul melodies with quick, non-invasive percussion. On the infrequent occasions where he slips into vulgar ghetto-house mantras, he sets them against his weirdest compositions. ""Going Wild"" (a collaboration with Rashad and AG) is schizophrenic, vacillating between chirpy irritants and half-time bass distensions, all keeping uneasy pace with a wordless, Eastern vocal melody. It sounds like paint flakes off of Flying Lotus' drywall. ""1988"" pays homage to the sci-fi synth ropes of vintage Detroit techno. </p>
<p>Of course, there's nothing particularly ""footwork"" about the Dilla-isms of ""Lady Dro"" or the tin-roof patter of ""Sound Filed"", but that hardly seems the point. When, on ""Lifeeeee Is For Ever"", he stirs Prince's organ-backed monologue from ""Let's Go Crazy"" into a stuttering frenzy, it feels less like album-closing pathos and more like a producer saying, ""oh yeah, I forgot, I really love Prince, too."" Listening to <i>Da Mind of Traxman</i> is a little like staring at a page of .gif images: Those short, repeating animations have a way of revealing detail. And when they don't it's still comforting to know that they'll spin there in perpetuity. <i>Da Mind of Traxman</i> is Traxman's musical history set on loop, a conversation held in stunted, loving bursts.</p></div>"|16530.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16530-the-mind-of-traxman/|7.1|Andrew Gaerig

With the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/34765-coyne-on-arcade-fire-theyre-pricks-so-fuck-em/"" target=""_blank"">possible exception of Arcade Fire</a>, everyone loves Wayne-- from the executives who've let the Flaming Lips follow their madcap muse on Warner Brothers' dime for 20 years now, to the Oklahoma legislators who named ""Do You Realize??"" the official state rock song, to <a href=""http://www.hipsterrunoff.com/altreport/2011/05/flaming-lips-lead-singer-wayne-coyne-spotted-bronoodling-nba-superstar-kevin-durant.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kevin Durant</a> and <a href=""http://www.mobypicture.com/user/waynecoyne/view/12356115"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the tall one from LMFAO</a>.</p>
<p>On paper, <i>The Flaming Lips and Heady Fwends</i>-- a Record Store Day round-up of various collaborations conducted over the past year-- doesn't appear to be the next official chapter in the band's ever-evolving history so much as a tribute to Coyne's skills of diplomacy, like his hyperactive <a href=""http://twitter.com/#!/waynecoyne"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Twitter feed</a> brought to life. The internet may have splintered the pop monoculture into myriad musical streams, but <i>Heady Fwends</i> provides as inclusive a congregation of the entire, circa-2012 under-to-overground spectrum as you can muster in a single album, with a guest list that spans top-40 stars (Ke$ha, Chris Martin) and noise-rock extremists (Lightning Bolt), anarchic avant guardians (Nick Cave, Yoko Ono) and chilled-out indie new-schoolers (Bon Iver, Neon Indian), electronic experimentalists (Prefuse 73) and hip-hop heroes-cum-children's-television hosts (Biz Markie). Really, all you need to complete the picture is a Pauly D remix.</p>
<p>When the Lips started plotting these collaborations last year, they seemed like the latest in a growing line of guinea-pig projects that have kept the band busy since 2009's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13522-embryonic/"" target=""_blank""><i>Embryonic</i></a>, click-bait novelties to be filed alongside <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtiVedrPIOE&amp;feature=relmfu"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the six-hour songs</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/41760-the-flaming-lips-are-making-gummy-skulls-now/"" target=""_blank"">gummy-skull-encased USB sticks</a>. And while the first of these pairings to surface-- EPs with Neon Indian, Lightning Bolt, Prefuse 73, and Yoko Ono, each represented here with a single track-- yielded interesting moments of aesthetic intersection, their free-form nature didn't exactly demand repeat listens. The songs on <i>Heady Fwends</i> are likewise rife with indicators of their hastily cobbled-together origins: flubbed vocal cues, songs obviously constructed via email file swaps (Ono's ""Do It!""), goofy lyrics that sound like they were written seconds before recording (""You always want/ To shave my balls/ That ain't my trip""). But here's the craziest thing about the whole project: This piecemeal patchwork of tracks hangs together amazingly well as a front-to-back album-- to the point where, if the band had released this as the official follow-up to <i>Embryonic</i>, without the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/44227-flaming-lips-collecting-collaborations-for-record-store-day-release/"" target=""_blank"">public stunt-casting campaign</a> and Record Store Day tie-in, no Flaming Lips fan would feel short-changed.</p>
<p>If anything, <i>Heady Fwends</i> is arguably an even more wiggy experience than <i>Embryonic</i>, an album that marked the Lips' return to brain-bending, fuzz-covered psychedelia, but was still very much beholden to the record-collector canon of Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, and Can. <i>Heady Fwends</i> immediately adopts a more sacrilegious tack. Not only do the Lips lead with their most unlikely and unapologetically obnoxious collaborator, Ke$ha, they let her run roughshod on a classic Stooges song: ""2012"" presents a mutant, robot-rock rewrite of ""1969"" that cranks up the original's Bo Diddley beat into an industrial-strength stomp and sees Ke$ha appropriating Iggy's ""oh my and boo hoo"" sneer as her own. But as chaotic and scatterbrained as the track is, it effectively sets the all-bets-are-off tenor of the record, and actually serves to introduce the predominant themes of science fiction and global apocalypse that run through many of the tracks here. And therein lies the key to approaching <i>Heady Fwends</i>: What at first seems rather silly actually proves to be quite purposeful.</p>
<p>The subsequent synth-smeared ballad ""Ashes in the Air"" further reinforces this logic, with Coyne offering an almost comically grave account of being chased by ""robot dogs"" through some post-war wasteland, while Justin Vernon echoes each line with his best <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDojwQ8cJC4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rick Moranis-doing-Michael McDonald</a>. But then the song blossoms into a disarmingly elegiac chorus that makes the scorched-earth scene suddenly feel very real and despairing. Taken back-to-back, ""2012"" and ""Ashes in the Air"" provide a handy microcosm of the emotional extremes between which the Flaming Lips vacillate on <i>Heady Fwends</i>. Fortunately, the album's expert sequencing makes the shifts between the two poles feel natural, and puts tracks that wouldn't necessarily stand on their own to effective transitional use. The Prefuse 73 collab ""Supermoon Made Me Want to Pee"" doesn't amount to much more than three minutes of manic, percussive propulsion, but, coming between the epic, Edward Sharpe-assisted folk reverie ""Helping the Retarded to Know God"" and the sun-kissed Tame Impala tryst ""Children of the Moon"" (the purest pop song in the batch), it serves an adrenalizing role akin to the one ""On the Run"" plays on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13836-the-dark-side-of-the-moon/"" target=""_blank"">the Lips' favorite Pink Floyd album</a>.</p>
<p>And you can thank Nick Cave for casting some of the Lips' previously released collaborations in a more favorable light: in the aftermath of the delightfully gonzo, Grinderman-in-space splatter of ""You, Man? Human???"", the Lightning Bolt-bolstered epic ""I'm Working at NASA on Acid"" assumes the mantle of <i>Fwends</i>' centerpiece track, with ominous acoustic-driven passages bookending an ecstatic, blast-off guitar jam that hearkens back to the Lips' <i>In a Priest Driven Ambulance</i> days. (The squelching, slow-motion Neon Indian entry ""Is David Bowie Dying?"" also feels much more dramatic in the context of <i>Heady Fwends</i>' more somber second act, rather than as the lead-off track to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15286-the-flaming-lips-with-neon-indian/"" target=""_blank"">an EP</a>.) But where most of the <i>Heady Fwends</i> collaborations up to this point have yielded outcomes where you can easily parse out what each party's bringing to the table, the late-game Erykah Badu appearance counts as the real revelation here. On their droning, distended 10-minute cover of the Ewan MacColl/Roberta Flack standard ""The First Time I Ever Saw Your Face"", the two entities blur into something nigh unrecognizable: The Lips' bombast is tempered into soothing gusts of distant distortion, while Badu's commanding presence is refashioned into that of a ghost communicating through a shortwave radio frequency.</p>
<p>This stunner is unfortunately answered by <i>Fwends</i>' one out-and-out dud, ""Thunder Drops"", a piece of spaced-out Bowie karaoke (courtesy of Polyphonic Spree/Lips sideman Daniel Huffman, aka New Fumes) that never achieves the lift-off its grandiose intro suggests. But <i>Heady Fwends</i>' comes to a peaceful conclusion with ""I Don't Want You to Die"", a mournful piano ballad boasting a liberal quote of John Lennon's ""Imagine"" and a tasteful, middle-eight assist from Chris Martin. With Coyne reverting back to the creaky, Neil Youngian croon he hasn't really adopted since the 90s, the song presents a fearful rumination of death that feels like the more vulnerable flipside to the life-affirming gospel of ""Do You Realize??"" But it's also a welcome reminder that, stripped of all their spectacle and high-concept strategies, the Flaming Lips can still win you over the same way they did 20 years ago, with a sweet, sad melody and simple, affecting sentiment. ""I love the Flaming Lips,"" Martin blurts out in the recording's dying seconds-- and, really, that's the only thing on this surprisingly substantial album that feels obvious.</p></div>"|16522.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16522-the-flaming-lips/|8.2|Stuart Berman

Not that they planned on it, presumably, but when you have people getting into endless flamewars about exactly what kind of metal the Swedish act performs-- or even if they're metal at all, thanks especially to last year's release of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15866-heritage/"" target=""_blank""><i>Heritage</i></a>-- then they've done what any reasonable band should by not caring what they're called so long as it's out there. Doubtless bandleader/mastermind Mikael Åkerfeldt loves that fact, even as he's on the road now on tour with Mastodon, probably hip-deep in comparing notes on King Crimson bootlegs with Brann Dailor.</p>
<p>That Åkerfeldt says, in the liner notes to <i>Blackwater Park</i>, that he's ""reluctant to do reissues for no reason whatsoever"" might explain why this particular clutch of rereleases-- three studio albums and a live DVD, <i>Lamentations</i>, from the early years of the millennium-- is essentially no more than a basic repackaging of what Sony had already done a couple of years previously in Europe, given that the original domestic issues here had already fallen out of print. (<i>Lamentations</i> provides a little bonus in that a separately released full CD version of the same show is now included with the DVD.) But perversely the time may be right for this kind of past focus where 10 years ago it was next to impossible to see bands like Opeth discussed outside of metal-centric circles to start with.</p>
<p>The reissues do reconfirm that Åkerfeldt and the band's then line-up-- currently only bassist Martín Méndez also remains, guitarist Peter Lindgren and drummer Martin Lopez having departed in recent years-- were perfect products of their death-metal-obsessed time and place regardless, with guttural singing and powerful riffing and more besides at work. The band had been going in one form or another for a decade when 2001's <i>Blackwater Park</i> came together, thanks in large part to a mutual admiration society with Porcupine Tree's leader Steven Wilson. His production help and encouragement teased out the band's explorations of acoustic-led arrangements as much as electric ones while further showcasing Åkerfeldt's sweet, clear singing as much as the roars on songs like ""The Leper Affinity"" and the title track.</p>
<p>In turn, the follow-up was even more ambitious, with <i>Deliverance</i> and <i>Damnation</i> originally planned as two halves of a big release then split into two albums that appeared in 2002 and 2003 respectively-- the first a ""heavy"" release, but following the same general blend as <i>Blackwater Park</i>, the second, also co-produced by Wilson, a thoroughly moody but never explosive album that ditched any expected death-metal touches entirely. Hearing songs like ""Closure"" and ""In My Time of Need"" from the latter is pretty well designed to make you think of contemplative classic rock melancholy rather than anything close to blast beats, while the title song of <i>Deliverance</i> showcases how skilled the band was at perfecting where calmer drift evolves into a full band crunch ridiculously well. The concluding half of that song is probably more monstrously memorable than anything on <i>Blackwater Park</i>.</p>
<p>The fact that the band covered Iron Maiden a couple of years before this run is as much of a sign as anything-- like the UK stalwarts and its guiding figure Steve Harris, not to mention his own contemporary Wilson, Åkerfeldt is openly enthralled with that era of the 1960s into the 1970s when it seemed like all kinds of riffage would rule the earth, often in tandem with whatever reflective, dazed, sorrowful, or just plain stoned routes progressive rock was creating. He's a stone-cold fanboy and doesn't hide it at all-- <i>Blackwater Park</i> takes it name from an obscure German band, <i>Deliverance</i>'s ""For Absent Friends"" borrows the title from a Genesis song from <i>Nursery Cryme</i>, and so forth-- and he is serious, at times painfully so, about it.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Throughout all three albums, Opeth are about explicit formalism as stirring power via the rock gods-- the goal is far from new, but it's done so expertly that it's hard not to be impressed. Given just how equally formal and specific Porcupine Tree have become over the years, Wilson's influence on these albums is evident throughout, even on <i>Deliverance</i> where he only guests rather than also producing. Åkerfeldt says as much in the <i>Blackwater Park</i> notes, but you get a sense that a sheer level of obsessiveness on Åkerfeldt's part would have always been there, a desire to make everything sound just absolutely correct, huge and momentous when needed, controlled and calm otherwise.</p>
<p>Opeth's saving grace in this regard is that no one song on any album quite sounds like anything else on it-- there's certainly a defined range that's being explored intensely, but <i>Blackwater Park </i>has the reputation it does in large part because none of the songs follow the same songwriting formula, instead looking toward variations within general themes that all build to a dramatic conclusion in the title track. Yet <i>Damnation</i> may simply be the clearest statement of intent as well as the most surprising and entertaining album just because it flat-out goes for it-- hints of nearly everything on it can be heard on the two albums preceding it, but by eschewing the formalities of death metal entirely it also clearly demonstrates the abilities of all four players plus the constantly guesting Wilson as accomplished performers in general. </p>

Doubtless bandleader/mastermind Mikael Åkerfeldt loves that fact, even as he's on the road now on tour with Mastodon, probably hip-deep in comparing notes on King Crimson bootlegs with Brann Dailor.</p>
<p>That Åkerfeldt says, in the liner notes to <i>Blackwater Park</i>, that he's ""reluctant to do reissues for no reason whatsoever"" might explain why this particular clutch of rereleases-- three studio albums and a live DVD, <i>Lamentations</i>, from the early years of the millennium-- is essentially no more than a basic repackaging of what Sony had already done a couple of years previously in Europe, given that the original domestic issues here had already fallen out of print. (<i>Lamentations</i> provides a little bonus in that a separately released full CD version of the same show is now included with the DVD.) But perversely the time may be right for this kind of past focus where 10 years ago it was next to impossible to see bands like Opeth discussed outside of metal-centric circles to start with.</p>
<p>The reissues do reconfirm that Åkerfeldt and the band's then line-up-- currently only bassist Martín Méndez also remains, guitarist Peter Lindgren and drummer Martin Lopez having departed in recent years-- were perfect products of their death-metal-obsessed time and place regardless, with guttural singing and powerful riffing and more besides at work. The band had been going in one form or another for a decade when 2001's <i>Blackwater Park</i> came together, thanks in large part to a mutual admiration society with Porcupine Tree's leader Steven Wilson. His production help and encouragement teased out the band's explorations of acoustic-led arrangements as much as electric ones while further showcasing Åkerfeldt's sweet, clear singing as much as the roars on songs like ""The Leper Affinity"" and the title track.</p>
<p>In turn, the follow-up was even more ambitious, with <i>Deliverance</i> and <i>Damnation</i> originally planned as two halves of a big release then split into two albums that appeared in 2002 and 2003 respectively-- the first a ""heavy"" release, but following the same general blend as <i>Blackwater Park</i>, the second, also co-produced by Wilson, a thoroughly moody but never explosive album that ditched any expected death-metal touches entirely. Hearing songs like ""Closure"" and ""In My Time of Need"" from the latter is pretty well designed to make you think of contemplative classic rock melancholy rather than anything close to blast beats, while the title song of <i>Deliverance</i> showcases how skilled the band was at perfecting where calmer drift evolves into a full band crunch ridiculously well. The concluding half of that song is probably more monstrously memorable than anything on <i>Blackwater Park</i>.</p>
<p>The fact that the band covered Iron Maiden a couple of years before this run is as much of a sign as anything-- like the UK stalwarts and its guiding figure Steve Harris, not to mention his own contemporary Wilson, Åkerfeldt is openly enthralled with that era of the 1960s into the 1970s when it seemed like all kinds of riffage would rule the earth, often in tandem with whatever reflective, dazed, sorrowful, or just plain stoned routes progressive rock was creating. He's a stone-cold fanboy and doesn't hide it at all-- <i>Blackwater Park</i> takes it name from an obscure German band, <i>Deliverance</i>'s ""For Absent Friends"" borrows the title from a Genesis song from <i>Nursery Cryme</i>, and so forth-- and he is serious, at times painfully so, about it.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Throughout all three albums, Opeth are about explicit formalism as stirring power via the rock gods-- the goal is far from new, but it's done so expertly that it's hard not to be impressed. Given just how equally formal and specific Porcupine Tree have become over the years, Wilson's influence on these albums is evident throughout, even on <i>Deliverance</i> where he only guests rather than also producing. Åkerfeldt says as much in the <i>Blackwater Park</i> notes, but you get a sense that a sheer level of obsessiveness on Åkerfeldt's part would have always been there, a desire to make everything sound just absolutely correct, huge and momentous when needed, controlled and calm otherwise.</p>
<p>Opeth's saving grace in this regard is that no one song on any album quite sounds like anything else on it-- there's certainly a defined range that's being explored intensely, but <i>Blackwater Park </i>has the reputation it does in large part because none of the songs follow the same songwriting formula, instead looking toward variations within general themes that all build to a dramatic conclusion in the title track. Yet <i>Damnation</i> may simply be the clearest statement of intent as well as the most surprising and entertaining album just because it flat-out goes for it-- hints of nearly everything on it can be heard on the two albums preceding it, but by eschewing the formalities of death metal entirely it also clearly demonstrates the abilities of all four players plus the constantly guesting Wilson as accomplished performers in general. </p>

Whether in a two-hour mix or a singular seven-minute production, dance music's visceral properties are highly effective when spread evenly. Earlier in the last decade, minimal techno had a brief above-ground moment; the words ""Villalobos"" and ""percolating"" became synonymous, and slow-burning cuts that began with little more than clicks and whirrs often opened up into blooming, evocative moments that were well worth however long it took to get there. Two years into this new decade, there are still a few producers taking the slow, steady, sparse route-- the oft-dubbed ""Villalobos heir"" <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29422-nicolas-jaar/"" target=""_blank"">Nicolas Jaar</a> being one of the most notable-- but immediacy is of-the-moment these days, with big, bold sounds pouring out of speakers both festival-tent large and club-night small. Even bass music artists, who at times catch an unfair rep for humorlessness, are starting to embrace the giddily dumb neon sounds out there (see: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23840-scuba/"" target=""_blank"">Scuba</a>'s excellent new LP, this year's boldly positive <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16341-personality/"" target=""_blank""><i>Personality</i></a>).</p>
<p>Manchester producer Rupert Taylor walks a fine line between the ""now"" and the ""then."" Under the chromosome-happy moniker <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/triplexy"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">xxxy</a>, Taylor's spent the last few years circling different sounds-- rubbery glitch, dubstep's broken rhythms, UK garage's skipping, echo-dusted gait, and so forth-- while making his work sound more emotive, melodic, and colorful. His 2010 EP for Fortified Audio, <i>Every Step Forward</i>, is an able display of his talents, as is that year's Radiohead rework ""Straight to Video""-- but Taylor's ""moment"" truly arrived with the release of last year's ""You Always Start It"" b/w <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12096-ordinary-things/"" target=""_blank"">""Ordinary Things""</a> single on fellow bass traveller Doc Daneeka's Ten Thousand Yen label. While the A-side was reliably solid, ""Ordinary Things"" was the release's winner, a seven-minute neck-whip of an UKG ride that sounds so explosively, sensually chaotic, it's easy to overlook how expertly <i>put together</i> the whole thing is.</p>
<p>Dilettantes and beatheads alike will often single out cuts they deem unworthy for being ""one idea, and nothing else""-- is it a song, or just something to put in your next set? ""Ordinary Things"" lands squarely in the former camp, and so do the productions captured on Taylor's latest, <i>Everything</i>. Rupert Taylor's newest follows a string of releases from last year that, while evenly constructed, felt more functional in form: the party-hardy ""Kerpow"" b/w ""Down With U"", as well as the acid nostalgia of ""You Gotta Do You"", were interesting genre detours that just didn't quite stick as strong as you would've wanted them to. By comparsion, <i>Everything</i> is total Gorilla Glue, its earwormy hooks burrowing deep into your brain. The material may lack the general ""surprise factor"" that bowled over so many on ""Ordinary Things"", but overall it's his most consistently pleasurable release to date.</p>
<p>House music's the name of the game on <i>Everything</i>-- the warm, colorful 4/4 bleat of the opening title track spells that out, and Taylor offers his own tweaks on the genre throughout the rest of the EP's three productions. By and large, house music lends itself quite well to the art of the build, which means there's plenty of room here to place tons of little dots and squiggles throughout without letting things get too overwhelming. With its wild-eyed, unhinged sample of Anthony White's 1977 single ""I Can't Turn You Loose"" (skip to 1:25 or so), ""Everything"" risks ending up as the kind of aforementioned bleating, one-trick cut that folks scoff at-- then, the beat jacks up, cymbals go off like car alarms, and before the whole six-and-a-half minute trip is taken, the track's been emptied out, shook up, and spread out again, lushness still intact.</p>
<p>If ""Everything"" succeeds based on its organized chaos, the EP's centerpiece, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13400-i-know-this-cant-be-love/"" target=""_blank"">""I Know This (Can't Be Love)""</a>, makes its bread on pure elegant pleasure, its skipping beat and wavy synths ebbing and flowing over a chipmunk'd snippet from cultishly beloved R&amp;B singer Cassie's ""Must Be Love"". It's the type of loop-happy track that could go on for 10 more minutes without overstaying its welcome. ""I Can't Stop"" appears only on the vinyl edition of the EP, and it acts as as a reverse palate-cleanser, with fizzy synth bombs and a shouty vocal sample effervescing within the cut's vaguely funky-esque stumble.</p>
<p>It's easy to underrate <i>Everything</i>, and by extension, Taylor as an artist. He's not doing anything <i>new</i>. These tunes are very easy to like and even easier to take for granted because of that. So you could nitpick this stuff to death for sounding ""safe"" and, if not typical, then exactly what you'd expect it to sound like-- or, you can let go extra-musical concerns for a minute or two and just reap the benefits of Rupert Taylor's generously patient producing hand. No harm in enjoying stuff just because it's <i>enjoyable</i>.</p></div>"|16521.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16521-everything-ep/|7.7|Larry Fitzmaurice

These characteristics have not always proven to be entirely compatible in creating a unified body of work. Few of us do anything quite as well as Blackshaw plays 12-string guitar, but by his own admission <a href=""http://www.welistenforyou.blogspot.com/2012/03/from-cedar-box-james-blackshaw.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">in a recent interview conducted by singer Marissa Nadler</a>, after several brilliant albums he began to struggle to find anything new to say with the instrument. So on the recent records <i>All is Falling</i> and <i>The Glass Bead Game</i> he has largely abandoned the 12-string in favor of a more minimalist piano-based style and small ensemble chamber work. Though his albums have been consistently likable, there have been points where he has seemed to be deliberately working against his own strengths, pushing his sound in directions not clearly distinctive as his own.</p>
<p>In some respects, then, Blackshaw's latest album <i>Love Is the Plan, the Plan Is Death</i> is both a continuation of his tinkering and a slight return to his past solo work.The first big difference here is that his primary instrument of choice is a nylon 6-string rather than the steel 12-string guitar. This switch gives his new pieces an earthier, more exotic flavor than the celestial overtones of his orchestral 12-string style. And though Blackshaw's previous work has occasionally featured counting or other wordless vocals, <i>Love Is the Plan</i> includes his first recorded lyrical performance with a vocalist, Geneviève Beaulieu of drone/black metal outfit <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/24563-menace-ruine/"" target=""_blank"">Menace Ruine</a> and the folkier drone project <span class=""st"">Preterite</span>. These subtle changes seem to have re-energized Blackshaw's expressive powers, and as a result <i>Love Is the Plan</i> is his most immediately satisfying album since 2007's masterful <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10287-the-cloud-of-unknowing/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Cloud of Unknowing</i></a>.</p>
<p>As has been his habit, Blackshaw again draws inspiration from the literary world. The album title and all of the song titles here are borrowed from those of short stories written by Alice B. Sheldon, who published sci-fi and speculative fiction under the pseudonym James Tiptree Jr. For most of her writing career, Sheldon kept her gender a secret, and many of her stories concern issues of identity and alienation. Her style could be poetic and elliptical, and her themes abstract enough for readers to project multiple interpretations onto her stories. In other words, it is not hard to see how Blackshaw, a composer whose pieces are still predominantly instrumental and open to broad emotive interpretation, might be drawn to Sheldon's work and see parallels with his own.</p>
<p>At any rate, Sheldon's evocative titles are a perfect fit for Blackshaw's songs. Of the album's solo guitar tracks, the melodic ""We Who Stole the Dream"" stands as the highlight, and as one of my favorite things Blackshaw has yet done. His playing carries some of the echoes of his ornate 12-string flourishes, but here there is a grittier edge, with bent notes and the audible sound of his fingers sliding on the strings, his winding melodies casting out concentric smoke rings that call to mind Ben Chasny's acoustic work in Six Organs of Admittance.<span>  </span></p>
<p>Harder to classify is the vocal and piano track ""And I Have Come Upon This Place by Lost Ways"", which functions as a true duet between Blackshaw and singer Beaulieu, with each performer given equal weight in the mix. In contrast with his sublime guitar playing, Blackshaw's work on piano is more direct and measured, and on this track his blocky, almost jazzy chords storm behind Beaulieu's agile vocals. It is a mesmerizing performance, yet if listened to in a blind test there is no way it could be immediately identified as a Blackshaw piece. The same goes for the album closing ""The Snows Are Melted, the Snows Are Gone"", a melodic piano instrumental that seems to owe almost equally to Erik Satie and George Winston, and which seems tailor-made to have had vocals added to it as well.</p>
<p>In <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/6863-james-blackshaw"" target=""_blank"">a 2008 interview with Pitchfork's Grayson Currin</a>, and again in his interview with Marissa Nadler, Blackshaw specifically mentions his fondness for Big Star and the Beatles, and for singer-songwriters like Harry Nilsson and Judee Sill. On <i>Love Is the Plan, the Plan Is Death</i>, for the first time in his career it becomes easy to see him taking a lead from those influences and moving further into more song-based material and/or future collaborations with vocalists. Then again, trying to predict Blackshaw's next musical progression has always been a poor idea, and all that can be reasonably said for certain is that it will be worth some attention.</p></div>"|16527.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16527-love-is-the-plan-the-plan-is-death/|7.9|Matthew Murphy

After all, collaboration is the closest we'll probably get to intervention for a group who has no incentive to alter its behavior: Deer Tick's star has risen in a manner directly proportional to their willingness to get as ornery about abusing alcohol and women as possible, and their most mean-spirited record to date (2011's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15965-divine-providence/"" target=""_blank""><i>Divine Providence</i></a>) ended up getting them more ""spirit of rock'n'roll"" praise than ever.</p>
<p>So while prime Deer Tick songwriters John McCauley and Robbie Crowell ultimately play a heavy role here, there are guest spots from better bands which make a ton of sense (Ian St. Pé of Black Lips), a good deal of sense (Hardy Morris of Dead Confederate), and almost none at all (Steve Berlin of Los Lobos, Bryan Dufresne of Six Finger Satellite). But in the end, <i>Diamond Rugs </i>mostly answers the question of ""when is a Deer Tick album <i>not </i>a Deer Tick album?"" tracing back to why those of us can find McCauley to be intolerable but redeemable: Some of the best songs on <i>Diamond Rugs </i>are his, most of the worst songs too, and between them, pretty much all of the memorable ones.</p>
<p>If it seems like the conversation is skewed toward one band's influence, let me just point out that two of the first four songs go by ""Gimme a Beer"" and ""Call Girl Blues"". So yes, Deer Tick's input is the greatest not just in terms of personnel, but in attitude as well. In name alone, that should give you an indication of what to expect, but digging into the substance sets the rules of engagement. ""Gimme a Beer"" is evidence enough of things McCauley has a knack for-- shredded vocals, a ragged Westerberg melody, and a lack of decorum that can be charming.  And hey, the lyrics about all manner of wish fulfillment are funny enough to excuse the Geto Boys reference that serves as the money shot. It's actually a Geto Boys song that most people first heard in <i>Office Space</i>, which leads me to what's problematic about the song. As with people whose conversations consist almost entirely of quotes from movies or TV, McCauley is so reliant on blue-collar rock tropes that he's almost incapable of expressing anything real here. So maybe the chorus of ""Who cares?/ Gimme a beer"" is supposed to be some sort of fatalistic ""fuck it,"" yet it feels less like an extension of the narrator's emptiness and more like a tic of McCauley's songwriting, taking the path of least resistance.</p>
<p>Likewise, the title of ""Call Girl Blues"" suggests some kind of empathy or at least insight to its subject, but judging from lines like ""Now where did she come from?/ Why should you care?/ Man, you oughta see her when she lets down her hair,"" you figure McCauley just relished the opportunity to write a song about a prostitute. At the very least, ""Call Girl Blues"" is willing to acknowledge a woman as a corporeal being and in a weird way, it's actually the most flattering McCauley gets about females, if only because they're seen as more admirable than the chumps who fall in love with them (""She ain't yours/ You can't hold her,"" McCauley hectors on the chorus). Women don't break up with the guys in these songs, they hightail it out of town, they find comfort in the arms of another man, like, <i>immediately</i>. But above all else, they always leave and you always end up taking their side; how could you not when McCauley exacts revenge on ""Tell Me Why"" by snarling ""I got sweeter things in my mouth/ I swallow them and then I shit them out""? In theory, <i>Diamond Rugs </i>should prove extremely comforting, a celebration of rawk and male friendship in the face of vaguely rendered but all-consuming sexual denial. And yet, there's no catharsis or viscera; writing about down-low women serves as some sort of Mad Lib-ish Oblique Strategy for Diamond Rugs or lyrical gambit similar to Thom Yorke throwing pieces of paper in a hat. It's not so much phony as it is perfunctory, but in this vein of songwriting, both of those terms essentially mean the same thing.</p>
<p>Still <i>Diamond Rugs </i>is occasionally enjoyable if you have no investment in what it ""means"" either for rock as a whole or any of its participants. If you somehow used alt-country as an entryway to indie rock, Diamond Rugs might be up your alley: ""Hightail"" likeably kicks up dust bounding down the same roads traveled by Los Lobos, ""Country Mile"" actually turns out to be dense swamp rock, and, altogether, it finds a nice textural common ground between the more far-flung acts involved here. In terms of the Hank Williams lineage, <i>Diamond Rugs </i>mostly sticks to Bocephus' party-preparedness and the III's lowest-common-denominator appeals to ""authenticity,"" so its nice they honor the patriarch by dropping in ""Totally Lonely"", which contrasts producer Justin Collins' baritone warble with an electronic drone that almost passes for musique concrète. But the keg's kicked long before <i>Diamond Rugs </i>comes to a close, a point made abundantly clear by the final one-two of ""Hungover and Horny"" and ""Christmas in a Chinese Restaurant"". Credit where it's due-- that's some serious truth in advertising right there.</p>
<p>That Diamond Rugs are far longer on camaraderie than inspiration is hardly unique to them; collaborations ranging from Traveling Wilburys to <i>Watch the Throne </i>invariably deal with the difficulty of juggling how much they want to express personally outside of ""wow, this was sure fun for <i>us</i>."" I don't doubt for a second that Diamond Rugs was a blast-- there are too many goofy horn charts and ""<i>guitar</i>"" exhortations to think otherwise-- and surely some of these songs got knocked out in the time it for the assistant engineer to make a beer run. But most of <i>Diamond Rugs </i>is like that woman in ""Call Girl Blues""-- it's not yours, so you can't hold it.</p></div>"|16525.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16525-diamond-rugs-diamond-rugs/|5.1|Ian Cohen

For these maximalist-minded artists, traditional melodic structures are never enough: Why not have six synths playing three melodies out of step with each other, and throw a cluster of guitar and drum solos in there, too? It's a trend that parallels rapid advancements for both digital production and consumption. It's also the perfect soundtrack for a current generation who live (and, sometimes, dance) on the internet. In terms of scope and notability, these producers run the gamut from big-box (Skrillex, Rusko, Dillon Francis) and small-scale (Lunice, Damu, the cross-continental Night Slugs/Fade to Mind crew).</p>
<p>Over the last year, Glasgow's Russell Whyte, aka <a href=""http://warp.net/records/rustie"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rustie</a>, has been a key figure in this loose movement due to his ingenuity and raw talent. While likeminded fellow Glaswegian and Warp labelmate <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22485-hudson-mohawke/"" target=""_blank"">Hudson Mohawke</a> offers a colorful take on disparate strains of hip-hop and R&amp;B, Rustie's manic, overstuffed work defies categorization. It's dubstep, it's hair metal, it's jazz fusion, it's pop played at 140 bpm, it's the <i>Final Fantasy VII</i> soundtrack, it's classical music filtered through the bombast of Southern hip-hop's grandest moments-- all of which could be happening either separately or all at once. </p>
<p>Both of his official releases for Warp, 2010's <i>Sunburst</i> EP and last year's singular <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15937-glass-swords/"" target=""_blank""><i>Glass Swords</i></a>, sound something like being locked inside an arcade that's harnessing its electricity from the sun. <i>Glass Swords</i> is way too much fun to listen to, like overdosing on sugar-- but it's <i>a lot</i> to take in, too, and perhaps best enjoyed in controlled doses for potential motion-sickness victims.</p>
<p>That potential for sonic overload might make some listeners feel trepidation when approaching Rustie's contribution to the BBC's long-running Essential Mix program. As is Essential Mix protocol, Rustie's mix runs just a little under two hours, which will prove a mind-boggler of a listen for many. But though it nearly triples <i>Glass Swords</i>' running time, it's also, weirdly, more compulsively listenable. If you have two hours to spare, take the plunge and find choon after gob-smacking choon. And if you got shit to do, that's fine-- just jump to any random point, listen for a bit, and leave wherever you like. </p>
<p>Though it seems like all his fingers are on 10 different buttons at once, Rustie's Essential Mix is several cuts above because of how expertly paced and curated it is. The wide variety of material culled for this mix-- much of it unreleased-- can be divided into three large categories: dreamy, gold-glistened synth bangers, the type of bass-rattling beat workouts that shake fillings out of teeth, and a selection of R&amp;B and hip-hop both new and not-too-new that's accompanied by Rustie's distinctive production touch.</p>
<p>He drops a ton of his own new material too, work ranging from a-thousand-sunsets gorgeous (""Reflector"") to the type of flaming-keyboard workouts that he seemingly pulls off in his sleep (""Cat Nip"", ""Frazzle"", ""Ooompa""). Rustie's stuff wows, but he's willing to cede the floor to other euphoric up-and-comers, from Dorian Concept's fat, juicy synth-walloped remix of Cid Rim's ""JazzJazzJazz"", to Lone's latest slice of beatific rave revivalism, ""Dream Ache"", to ""R U Ready"", a cooking dance-worthy slice of head-fuckery courtesy of Hudson Mohawke and Lunice's promising TNGHT project.</p>
<p>Tracks arrive with the expected chaotic abandon but the flow is what makes the set work, from the gorgeous, sighing ""VIP"" version of Rustie's own <i>Glass Swords</i> cut ""City Star"" that breaks up a particularly dark and clubby run, to Rick Ross's titanic ""The World Is Ours"" steamrolling through the mix's opening minutes, flattening the awesome ostentatiousness that preceded it. The whole thing breathes evenly, which gives Rustie plenty of space to go wild elsewhere. Everything's a sound effect with this guy-- wolf noises, stoned exhortations, 8-bit video game samples, creepy helium vocal samples, Trapaholics mixtape drops, creepy giggling, and Kanye West, whose presence on this thing is exactly as ""HANH?!?""-filled and fitting as you'd expect it to be.</p>
<p>Kanye shows up twice on Rustie's Essential Mix: once in vocal form, on your favorite weed carrier's weed carrier Big Sean's ""Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay"", and once behind the decks on his recently circulated remix of Cassie's ""King of Hearts"". Both sound better here than they do isolated-- the latter's aided greatly when paired up with the <i>Glass Swords</i> highlight ""Hover Traps"", but the former's low-end oddball charm is given new life here, a previously mediocre tune that's finally found a home. Within 24 hours of when this Essential Mix went to air, Kanye's new single with 2 Chainz, Pusha-T, and Big Sean, ""Mercy"", also dropped-- which featured an ""additional instruments"" credit given to Hudson Mohawke. Kanye's interest in this new maximal wave of electronic music makes a lot of sense-- why <i>wouldn't</i> the guy who loves The Biggest Things want to work with young guns that are just as sonically greedy?</p>
<p>On a more genre-wide level, though, Rustie's Essential Mix draws a line tying electro-maximalism's pilled-up attitude and modern hip-hop's own druggy eccentricities. The yo-yo hook behind A$AP Twelvy's ""Our World"" fits in so perfectly that the line between where it ends and Rustie's own ""Eyezz"" begins to blur, while Wiz Khalifa's ""Guilty Conscience"", which appears  in the middle of the mix's closing third of Rustie-contributed explosives, provides one of the set's more glassy-eyed moments. Perhaps the biggest surprise here is the appearance of Destiny's Child's 1999 single ""Get on the Bus"", featuring a start-snap production job from Timbaland that sounds so ""now,"" it serves as a bittersweet reminder of how ahead of the game this guy was at his prime. The fact that almost all of the hip-hop and R&amp;B cuts that appear on this mix remain untouched, yet still contribute greatly to its uniformity, speaks greatly to the texturally varied sonic patchwork that Rustie's weaved here, comparable to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12371-uproot/"" target=""_blank"">DJ /rupture's <i>Uproot</i></a> in its functionality as a primer for different sounds existent and being made all over the world-- as well as a killer party playlist, too.</p>
<p>Rustie clearly values an off-the-moment sort of chaos, the idea that it's possible to travel from point A to point B <i>and</i> make a thousand zig-zag pinball-machine detours along the way. That's how a lot of people <i>live</i> these days. As a snapshot of a young artist seizing a moment to offer an overview of a scene, Rustie's Essential Mix is the most perfectly taken picture. As a pure, positive, party-hardy mega-statement on digital (and music) culture's total stimulus overload, it's a joyously fun trip. </p></div>"|16498.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16498-essential-mix/|8.1|Larry Fitzmaurice

How else to explain his attraction to workhorses like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29523-stalley/"" target=""_blank"">Stalley</a>? The talented but decidedly dazzle-averse Ohio rapper traffics in straight-ahead sincerity, rapping entirely in pained, vague clichés about making it through struggles, staying free of temptation, and striving for success. He has built up a dedicated fanbase with the same kind of dauntless diligence required to run for city alderman, and displays an equal level of magnetism. Ross collects these guys: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10147-wale/"" target=""_blank"">Wale</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28441-pill/"" target=""_blank"">Pill</a>, now Stalley. He reupholstered Wale into a strip-club rapper and dropped Pill. What he's going to do with Stalley remains to be seen, but if this lushly appointed new mixtape is any indication, Stalley's having his moment in the boss' favor.</p>
<p>Stalley's alliance with Ross makes for an interestingly muddled listening experience. Stalley has cut himself out as struggling everyman, but here he's rapping on behalf of an imprint named for a high-end car line so prohibitively expensive that it actually <a href=""http://www.newsday.com/classifieds/cars/maybach-brand-will-be-discontinued-in-2013-1.3361814"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">went out of business</a> because so few could afford it. He tries to justify this dissonance on a song called, of all things, ""Island Hopping"": ""I was underground then, still underground now/ Difference is I'm under palm trees, not trying to be found,"" he insists. Besides the fact that the line is nonsensical, it falls prey to what I call rap's ""Stillmatic Rule"": the minute a rapper has to claim they're ""still"" something, they're obviously no longer that thing.</p>
<p>The production is where Stalley's <a href=""http://mishkanyc.bandcamp.com/album/lincoln-way-nights-intelligent-trunk-music"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Intelligent Bass Music</a> most clearly meets up with his boss' <a href=""http://maybach.spreadshirt.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Maybach Music</a>. He has always relied on beats to do all the melodramatic work his small, boyish voice can't do, and here, he leans heavily on the work of the Huntsville duo <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/blockbeattaz"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Block Beattaz</a>, who have spent years draping the humble, blue-collar sentiments of G-Side in 6,000 astral planes of glimmering synths. They provide the same sonic transformation here, deploying an arsenal of rippling harps and orchestral presets to lend weight to Stalley's abstracted musings. Their ""Petrin Hill Peonies"" starts with a straight chop of a gritty soul song by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29876-charles-bradley/"" target=""_blank"">Charles Bradley</a>, a James Brown impersonator-turned-belter signed to Daptone, before they smear the vibe with low, pummeling drums that move the track to woozier, druggier places. ""Route 21"" outfits Stalley in a sumptuous orchestral reimagining of Jay-Z's ""Imaginary Player"". Stalley picks judiciously from other producers, too: ""Everything New"" invites Chad Hugo, aka The Half of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3082-the-neptunes/"" target=""_blank"">the Neptunes</a> You Forgot Existed, to remind us of his brain-puncturing way with a Korg. As a collection of beats, this mixtape is impeccable.</p>
<p>As a rapper, however, Stalley is a pretty reliable momentum-douser. He likes to dangle his rhymes just over the bar lines, like he's got one lazy leg draped over the track, but his voice carries the strained urgency of a baby Freeway. Pair this with his tendency to willfully mix up his gangsta-rap stock imagery (women are gold diggers, he will shoot you if pushed) with conscious-rap boilerplate (like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28901-big-krit/"" target=""_blank"">Big K.R.I.T.</a>, Stalley's songs are full of nameless supporters thanking him for saving hip-hop, begging him not to lose his soul in the Big Old World), and you have one confused non-persona. His best moments are small, plainspoken observations that sound like they come from a singular, careful mind: ""I keep my circle small, so I'm hard to leech from,"" he tells us on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13344-hammers-and-vogues-ft-curreny/"" target=""_blank"">""Hammers and Vogues""</a>. Occasionally he roams across a nice image, but he has a distressing tendency to rattle off entire 32-bar verses without once pricking up your ears.<i> Savage Journey</i> ends with the song off of Rick Ross' <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16172-rich-forever/"" target=""_blank""><i>Rich Forever</i></a> mixtape that featured Stalley prominently, the left-field electro-rap jam ""Party Heart"", produced by Chuck Ingrish. It's one of this tape's more arresting moments, but on <i>Rich Forever</i>, it stopped the momentum dead. The contrast is telling.</p></div>"|16487.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16487-stalley-savage-journey-to-the-american-dream/|6.2|Jayson Greene

House music, at least, has always had a taste for mixing religious ecstasy into worldly grooves, even if house producers have tended to draw more from the uplifting end of the gospel spectrum. But there's also been a side of house that's reveled in sampling hellfire condemnations and apocalyptic oratory from folks who probably wouldn't set foot in the secular houses of sin where dance music lives. With his pulpit-rocking cadences and brimstone tone, Nick Cave would fit perfectly in this tradition, even if no one's had the sense (or lack thereof) to take him to that particular river just yet.</p>
<p>One look at the tracklist for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5203-grinderman/"" target=""_blank"">Grinderman</a>'s <i>2 RMX</i>, eleven tweaks on the band's second (and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/44873-grinderman-its-over/"" target=""_blank"">supposedly final</a>) album, 2010's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14622-grinderman-2/"" target=""_blank""><i>Grinderman 2</i></a>, should tell you that this isn't <i>that</i> kind of a remix project. The dream of Nick Cave as hectoring house music queen will have to wait a little while longer. Grinderman was Cave's noisiest and most truculent project in years, but also his wittiest and most sensual. Especially on <i>Grinderman 2</i>, the band had perfected a sound that was equal parts dirty-minded groove, ear-scourging feedback, and mordant-past-all-normal-measure wordplay. If much of Cave's love of blues had focused on the genre's vein-opening confessional side, Grinderman found him returning to its other roots, as a soundtrack for drunken house parties and semi-legal gatherings in sweaty speakeasies. It was a glorious (if often brutal) and <i>physical </i>sound, real body-moving stuff, as well as a cerebral one.</p>
<p>And so while this swan-song compilation is unsurprisingly helmed by peers young and old, from the noisier and more aggressive end of rock music with a few beat-minded ringers thrown in, the assembled musicians don't often seem to get what made Grinderman great (or simply don't care). These are not, for the most part, radical reconstructions, but the best are often the most simple. Or the most sympathetic, however far afield they get from Grinderman's world. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6049-robert-fripp/"" target=""_blank"">Robert Fripp</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/39754-listen-grinderman-super-heathen-child-featuring-robert-fripp/"" target=""_blank"">""Super Heathen Child""</a> is exactly what the name implies, not doing much to the original except cranking it a few notches, including (naturally) the guitars, with the blues raunch being eaten away at by Frippertronics excess. It's one of the few tracks on <i>2 RMX </i>that I'd listen to over one of Grinderman's non-remixed songs. Not only because it makes the original <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/39550-listen-grinderman-heathen-child/"" target=""_blank"">""Heathen Child""</a> bigger and badder and more swaggering, but because it does so without getting in the way of that too-hot groove.</p>
<p>The individual entries on <i>Grinderman 2 </i>are all over the map quality-wise, from inert and utterly ignorable (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30051-factory-floor/"" target=""_blank"">Factory Floor</a>'s <a href=""http://soundcloud.com/muterecords/grinderman-evil-factory-floor-remix-2"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">mush-headed clichés</a> when they take on ""spooky"" industrial ambiance) to half-brilliant reframings of pretty singular material (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4423-unkle/"" target=""_blank"">UNKLE</a> slamming acid house silliness into chunky surf-rock pastiche until they come up with the perverse idea of <a href=""http://soundcloud.com/muterecords/grinderman-hyper-worm-tamer-unkle-remix"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Grinderman-goes-big-beat</a>). But these remixes are undeniably at their weakest when they dull the band's get-down-get-dirty instincts, defang their attack, and/or smother Cave's self-lacerating humor under a ton of ""atmospheric"" murk. And even the like-minded remixers occasionally fall short. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3494-queens-of-the-stone-age/"" target=""_blank"">Queens of the Stone Age</a> aren't musically a million miles from what Grinderman were attempting to do during their too-short career, but <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7676-josh-homme/"" target=""_blank"">Josh Homme</a>'s tepid <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2psEYDPhrAQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Mickey Bloody Mouse""</a> is a damn shame when you consider the kind of motorik monster he could have pulled off.</p>
<p>Still, occasionally someone strays from the Grinderman template and actually scores. For a glimpse at what a wholly beautiful Grinderman might have sounded like, look to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/20-barry-adamson/"" target=""_blank"">Barry Adamson</a>, who tarts up the already pretty swoony <a href=""http://soundcloud.com/muterecords/grinderman-palaces-of-montezuma-barry-adamson-remix"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Palaces of Montezuma""</a> with his usual Bacharach-gone-badass bells and whistles. And while I've never been much taken by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5424-a-place-to-bury-strangers/"" target=""_blank"">A Place to Bury Strangers</a>' empty cacophony, maybe all they needed all along was a great singer: There's no sex in their rhythm, another <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2186-the-jesus-and-mary-chain/"" target=""_blank"">JAMC</a>-in-a-tsunami attack that's been bleached of all blues, but it's definitely a groove, however manic and relentlessly forward-charging. Plus Cave's voice adds an urgency and human grit that's almost always been missing from the band's original material. It's a shame that more acts here, given the platform, didn't choose to exercise Adamson's craft or APTBS' intensity. As a farewell-cum-summation, <i>2 RMX</i> could have been worse.

Rainfall is a given, pine scents the air, the cities and wilderness are painted in bleary soft and decaying grays, and a pervading gloom settles over the people there like funeral fog. Culturally speaking, it's maybe best known for its heroin casualties and negative creeps; in other words, it's not exactly a bastion of shiny, happy music. It is, though, a perfect breeding ground for ugly, sad, fucked-up music, and has spawned plenty of it.</p>
<p>That a band like <a href=""http://anhedonist.blogspot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Anhedonist</a> calls Seattle home is yet another testament to its downcast charms. The overwhelming bleakness and raw elegance of the quartet's recording could have only been spawned beneath cold Northwestern skies. Anhedonist's initial offering, a 2010 demo aptly titled <i>The Drear</i>, provided ample hints of the greatness that was brewing, but the cloudy apocalyptic visions they conjured up on that first release have since been refined and rendered blindingly clear on <i>Netherwards</i>. It's rare enough to find a traditional doom band that truly deserves to be dubbed ""epic,"" let alone a death/doom monolith, yet there is no more fitting descriptor for so much of Anhedonist's songwriting. This is epic in the way of an <i>Odyssey</i> or a<i> Kalevala</i>; powerful, complex, and overwhelmingly dense. There is no solace here. There is only a sprawling narrative of sorrow and malice, humanity's fall, and the cruel light of morning. Distortion and despair. Beauty and brutality. Melancholia and menace.</p>
<p><i>Netherwards</i> is a triumph of death/doom. For such an inherently simple style-- death metal meets doom metal in a ruined Gothic cathedral-- there are an infinite number of ways to do it wrong: too sloppy, too forced, too wimpy, too bad. Luckily, we have bands like Anhedonist to carry the torch sparked by the likes of Disembowelment, Celestial Season, Skepticism, and Thorr's Hammer and fan the flames with their own tormented take on the sound. <i>Netherwards</i> begins with silence, as ""Saturnine"" slowly slithers into earshot, then pulls the trigger with a merciless blast of crushing, lurching death. The rest of the record follows suit, alternating hammerblows of sepulchral, endlessly satisfying old-school death metal riffs with shades of mournful grace, like the clean, plaintive chords that open the aching <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13478-estrangement/"" target=""_blank"">""Estrangement""</a>.</p>
<p>Those who follow the regressive occult transgressions of Incantation, Grave Miasma, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29977-necros-christos/"" target=""_blank"">Necros Christos</a>, and especially the hideous joylessness of Loss will approve. When Anhedonist sink into total death, the riffs pummel and sway with the best of them, but their strength lies most within their more melodic passages. Anyone can flail and blast and scream, but it takes care, understanding, and wells of patience to create this kind of well-wrought extreme metal. Slowly rotting tempos interchange with full-on thrashing; riffs careen between vintage Morbid Angel sludginess and My Dying Bride's sophistication; a 15-minute song leaves you dying to hear more.</p>
<p>Atmosphere is everything, and <i>Netherwards</i> is coated in layers of cobwebs and bone meal. The vocals shake and thunder, calling up from the depths in guttural chorus. The drums take a back seat, working with the understated basslines to support the weight of the guitars. You can see them sweat, watch them bleed. <i>Netherwards</i> will draw you in entirely, drag you down into the yawning abyss, and make you wonder why anyone would ever want to listen to anything else.</p></div>"|16517.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16517-netherwards/|8.2|Kim Kelly

The lack of fanfare that heralds the band's releases, of which there are many, mirrors the quiet, introspective nature of the group members themselves. Records from Woods come often, rarely dropping below the impressively high bar they've set for themselves despite their tap never being fully turned off. It seems likely the band members are too hard at work on their next project(s) to care too much for the conversation surrounding their current release. So here we are with another Woods record, this time a self-titled split LP with folk-noise experimentalist Henry Barnes, better known for his highly erratic output under the name <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/87-amps-for-christ/"">Amps for Christ</a>.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The work is carved up neatly over this album, with four Amps for Christ tracks, four from Woods, and one collaborative effort. Barnes' recordings, made up of three instrumentals and one vocal composition, are all over the map, as anyone who has paid close attention to his output has come to expect. ""When"" manages to pull a kind of sickly lo-fi sweetness from his jarring and occasionally sloppy playing. It's recorded to make him feel like he's right there in the room with you, fluffing chords and tripping over the rush of ideas pulsating through his brain. Barnes' work has a childlike wonder to it, ranging from endearing, naif-like approaches (the ramshackle ""Roto Koto in C Major"") to grating, sub-par noise aberrations (the aimless electronics of ""Native Chantz""). On ""Lord Bateman (Child #53)"", he demonstrates his superior skills as a craftsman of jolly folk songs juxtaposed with quietly screaming guitars-- a move that immaculately paves the way for Woods' similarly minded pieces. </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">There's little mistaking these as Woods songs once Jeremy Earl's caterwauled falsetto sinks in, although this is a stripped-back version of the band. Mostly they forgo electric guitars altogether, instead settling on a roughly hewn form of acoustic bonhomie. There's plenty of space in these recordings, making it sound like you're sitting on Earl's porch, listening to his group cobble together songs with little or no finesse. You can practically smell the marshmallows getting toasted over a crackling campfire in the background. The only exception is <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13269-wind-was-the-wine/"">""Wind Was the Wine""</a>, a vigilantly assembled Woodsian take on pop that would effortlessly fit alongside ""Pushing Onlys"" and ""Death Rattles"" should this band ever assemble something like a greatest hits album. Elsewhere it's much more opened-ended, with the music leading them down knotty, freeform paths (""September Saturn"") and encroaching on the kind of crackpot takes on rootsy Americana <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/351-bonnie-prince-billy/"">Will Oldham</a> often attempts (""Brothers"").</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">So this feels less like an ""album"" in the traditional sense and more like a loose string of unconnected ideas, pieced together with little thought for direction. As such, it just about works, with the lack of production values helping convey the spirit of adventure in which it was no doubt conceived. That feeling is typified by the collaboration between the two artists, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13176-from-oatmeal-to-buttermilk/"">""From Oatmeal to Buttermilk""</a>, which is dominated by what sounds like a warily plucked sitar (or perhaps one of Barnes' homemade instruments). It's constantly teetering on the brink of implosion, nearly sticking to its shabby meter, with all the players sounding like they're barely in control of what they're doing. But in many respects that's what a project like this is for, to suss out potential directions, to push forward into new areas. John Peel always said he was disappointed if a band recorded a Peel Session and just stuck to what they were already good at. Sometimes you've got to take the machine apart and figure out a new way to put it back together. </p>

There was the soulful work on Junior Byles' <i>Beat Down Babylon</i> and George Faith's <i>To Be a Lover</i>, Doctor Alimantado's raucous <i>Best Dressed Chicken in Town</i>, the drum-drug of Ras Michael &amp; the Sons of Nagus' <i>Love Thy Neighbour</i>, Junior Murvin's trenchant and keen <i>Police and Thieves</i>, Max Romeo's loverman-cum-revolutionary on <i>Revelation Time</i> and <i>War Ina Babylon</i>. And then there was the epochal <i>Heart of the Congos</i>, the 1977 album cut by the Rastarian duo of the same name.</p>
<p>""Ashanti"" Roy Johnson and Cedric Myton formed as a vocal duo, but to their already celestial vocal harmonies (perhaps if Curtis Mayfield and Barry Gibb had intermingled their throats), Scratch added the thunderous baritone of Watty Burnett to the <i>Heart</i> mix, which at times also included the harmonized mewl of a zombie cow. Now is not the place to unpack the majesty that is <i>Heart of the Congos</i> (where a song like ""Ark of the Covenant"" sounds exactly like that). Suffice to say it placed higher than any other reggae album in Pitchfork's survey of the 1970s, and former editor Scott Plagehoef waxed rhapsodic on those angelic voices that ""contemplate spiritual awakening, cultural pride and human weakness (while) Perry practices a sort of addition by subtraction.""</p>
<p class=""p1"">Even if he does put incants to Stevie Wonder, Bo Diddley, and Don Cherry on his most dubbed-out albums (see my personal highlight, <i>Heavy Deeds</i>, where the flange <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_Dressed_Chicken_in_Town"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">droops like Dr. Alimantado's zipper</a>), Sun Araw's Cameron Stallones hews closest to Perry's cosmic swamp noise. Having Stallones-- with fellow West Coast noisenik M. Geddes Gengras-- venture to the wilds of Jamaica to record with the Congos (a four-piece now with the addition of touring member Kenroy Fyffe) makes a strange sort of sense. As long as you don't think too hard about stoned white guys tripping down to a third-world country seeking spiritual communion.</p>
<p>""With the Congos, if we had gone there and tried to be 'Hey, we're coming to you as white musicians from America... and we're going to do it in this way...' [we'd have been] setting up a hierarchy,"" Stallones told the<i> Wire</i> in a recent cover story. ""As if [we're] understanding the situation more clearly than they do. And that's incredibly condescending. And incredibly false."" There are moments of each party feeling the other out, resulting in an album that grows more assured only as it goes deeper. And for this collaboration, it sounds like Sun Araw are practicing sonic subtraction rather than addition. </p>
<p class=""p2"">""Happy Song"" squiggles around Johnson's unwonted high register, guitars snake like something out of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/751-creature-comforts/"" target=""_blank"">Black Dice's <i>Creature Comforts</i></a>, all of it underpinned by massive hand-drum bass drops. Between those canyonesque drops and the Nyabinghi drums that open ""Invocation"", this might spur UK dubstep producers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14947-fabric-55/"" target=""_blank"">Shackleton</a> and T++ to book the next flight to Kingston. A paean to ""Sunshine"" slinks at a crawl, the Congos incanting that it's ""time to make a move, time to get you in the groove"" while Gengras and Sun Araw instead proceed like a Pocahaunted acid folk processional. </p>
<p>In that same article, Stallones hints that even he was uncertain of how the Congos might react to the alien, non-roots music presented before them. And at the fore of the album, there are instances where the Congos sound hesitant on such terrain. Peak-wise, there are more transcendent vocal harmonies to be heard on <i>Heart</i>'s bountiful ""Fisherman"" than on the entire first side here. But then a shift occurs: ""At some point a little bit further into the recording though, [Ashanti Roy] turned to me and said, 'Oh, they're like chants.' And from that point it made so much sense to everyone."" So as the album closes on ""Invocation"" and the ethereal lagoon drift of ""Thanks and Praise"", the symbiosis between both parties levitates to another plane, beyond dub, dancehall, roots, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15771-ancient-romans/"" target=""_blank""><i>Ancient Romans</i></a>, never really sounding like anything of the aforementioned genres. It's not the best reggae album of 2012, nor the best noise album, but it's undoubtedly the best psychedelic gospel album you'll hear all year.</p>
<p class=""s1"">What makes this, if not the most fully realized, then the most rewarding entry in RVNG's already ambitious FRKWYS series (see <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15654-frkwys-vol-7/"" target=""_blank"">here</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16056-frkwys-vol-8/"" target=""_blank"">here</a>) is that it doesn't sound like noise dudes just trying to make the simulacra of a dub reggae album. Nor is it a recording-artists-of-a-bygone-era-aligning-themselves-with-youth project. While <i>Heart of the Congos</i>' most repeated refrain remains ""we've got to reach a higher ground,"" when <i>Icon Give Thank</i> succeeds, it's when the six men instead find common ground.</p></div>"|16513.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16513-icon-give-thank/|8.1|Andy Beta

Between two live albums (one of which was a double-length <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11020-rufus-does-judy-live-at-carnegie-hall/"" target=""_blank"">tribute to Judy Garland</a>), a startlingly immodest and premature career retrospective (a whopping 19-disc limited-edition box set called <i>House of Rufus</i>), and a collection of ponderous and meandering Shakespeare-influenced piano demos (2010's studio album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14156-all-days-are-nights-songs-for-lulu/"" target=""_blank""><i>All Days Are Nights: Songs For Lulu</i></a>), the casual fan might be forgiven for wondering if Wainwright had any interest in expanding on his uniquely composed and orchestrated brand of pop.</p>
<p>The answer is, well, sort of. While <i>Out of the Game</i> certainly represents Wainwright's return to more formal song structure, it marks a clean break from the florid and operatic pop that more or less defined his first five albums. Thanks in no small part to the presence of producer Mark Ronson, the bombastic orchestral pieces and the fluttering ariettas have been swapped out with an armory of peeling guitar licks and 1970s-inflected AOR grooves. Anyone with a mildly frayed birth certificate and a passing history with FM radio will get the touchpoints; Steely Dan, 10cc, Wings, ELO. If we were on a boat, you know what kind it'd be.</p>
<p>It's a look that Wainwright wears well, not only because he's always worked partly in the tradition of the very literate and offbeat <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/underscore/8786-nilsson-newman-and-some-other-la-weirdos/"" target=""_blank"">West Coast 1970s singer-songwriter Randy Newman</a>, but also because the relatively tighter forms of these songs prevent him from indulging in the pomp and grandiosity that often undermined his recordings. <i>Game</i> is certainly no less produced than any of his previous albums, but there's a lightness of touch throughout that nicely offsets its bigger moments. The sound's inherent moldiness also allows the 38-year-old Wainwright to stretch more fully into a pose he's been toying with for a decade; that of the cynical and conflicted older guy increasingly perplexed by a younger generation. Take the lead single, a statement piece that shows him proudly wearing his fusty new threads while simultaneously thumbing his nose at the hipster set: ""Look at you, look at you, look at you-- suckers!"" he sneers. ""Does your mama know what you're doing?""</p>
<p>While it's a welcome update to his sound, <i>Game</i> isn't a straight genre exercise either. In fact, some of the album's best moments come from the songs that edge just outside of the blueprint. Boasting a pipe organ and a wormlike hook, the three minute ""Bitter Tears"" is an arch pop song that channels Wainwright's inner Falco; the simple ""Sometimes You Need"" is a surefooted ballad that rests on an acoustic guitar arpeggio before gently layering on the strings; and album closer ""Candles"" is a slow-burning torch song that's been re-routed through a Scottish pipe band.</p>
<p>When Wainwright falters, it's for familiar reasons, usually some combination of overindulging and oversharing. With its drain-circling piano arpeggios, fussy falsettos, and mildly cringeworthy lyrics (""One day you will come to Montauk/ And you will see your Dad wearing a kimono""), ""Montauk"" is the worst offender in this regard. Ultimately, though, it seems a bit churlish to ding someone for being uncool on a record celebrating that very fact. Even with a producer like Ronson at the helm, Wainwright will never be cool, or even popular. One thing's clear, though: He doesn't mind if you don't.</p></div>"|16516.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16516-out-of-the-game/|6.8|Mark Pytlik

There's a lot in it: rueful, grown-folks honesty, a helpless embrace of sensual pleasures. But mostly, there is irrepressibility, a simple inability to stop. For most artists, the 42-song salvo of <i>Revenue Retrievin'</i> would have been a once-in-a-career indulgence. For E-40, it was a throat-clearer: he dropped 44 more songs in 2011. A few weeks ago, he made 60 more-- three full albums-- available to his audience with <i>The Block Brochure: Welcome to the Soil</i>. His appetite for life, as for rap, appears to be fearsomely bottomless.</p>
<p>Let's start with the obvious question: do you <i>need</i> all this? E-40 is a personal favorite of mine, and upon hearing <i>The Block Brochure</i>'s length, my heart lifted and my stomach sank simultaneously. It was like learning that your best friend is coming to stay with you for three consecutive weeks. You might want to sit down for this, but not all sixty of these songs are equally good. The middle third bogs down. ""Mary Jane"" is a rote weed tribute; the song with Twista and T-Pain is forgettable. The inspirational joint ""Be You"" with Too $hort never needed to be recorded, nor did his ""kids these days"" rant ""What Happened to Them Days"". But here's the astonishing truth: Not only are none of these songs bad, two-thirds of them range from good to mind-blowing.</p>
<p>The production on <i>The Block Brochure</i> series roams a little wider and farther than the <i>Revenue Retrievin</i> series did, which helps when approaching such a seemingly undigestible block of music. E-40's stable of producers, which includes his son Droop-E, continue spit-polishing the sounds of Bay Area hip hop so that they gleam fresh. Droop-E's talkbox-heavy beat for ""Bust Moves"" sounds like a DJ Quik production being boiled to a reduction sauce. The civil-disturbance-creating ""Slummin'"" is like three beats arguing with each other, a collision of tubas, robot voices and choirs. The snare clap on ""Outta Town"" hits like a handful of stones splashed in a creek. The producers, like the guest rappers (Suga Free, Celly Cell, B-Legit: the same people, mostly, who have been with E-40 since 1994's <i>Federal</i>), are almost entirely unique to E-40's albums at the point: for E-40's longtime listeners, they are like a rowdy congregration of old friends.</p>
<p>That sort of regional tang is alpha and omega of 40's music. On ""I'm Laced"", he tells of reading ""the hood Wikipedia,"" and his Indian-summer streak might be an attempt to create something sprawling and definitive enough to warrant that title, an update of the hoary old Chuck D ""rap is the black CNN"" chestnut. In <a href=""http://www.spin.com/articles/e-40-block-brochure-sucker-repellant-cologne-and-raising-droop-e"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">an interview with <i>SPIN</i></a> earlier this month, E-40 said, ""It ain't just my story, that's somebody else's story I'm telling... I got raps to uplift a female. I got raps that I've done that made killers cry. It's like that to this day; it's like that because I tell the real."" A lot of rappers say this sort of thing, but E-40 is a uniquely conscientious street reporter. Gangsta rap has an endless catalog of songs about childhood friends torn apart by the streets, for example; it's practically a mini-genre. But E-40's version on <i>The Block Brochure</i>, ""What Is It Over?"" doesn't include him-- he's the observer. And yet his rhymes are too detailed and compassionate to be an outsider's: ""I don't know why it's the childhood friends always end up beefin' and warrin' and funkin'/ Fallin' out with each over some money, or a woman/ At first nobody dies, just a couple of fights and shit talking/ But once somebody dies, it's almost impossible to solve a problem."" There's no head-shaking or disapproval in his tone, just a long sigh.</p>
<p>A few big-name visitors stop by. Kendrick Lamar, notably, on ""Catch a Fade"", and Snoop Dogg, less notably, on ""What You Smokin On"". But as always, they sound just like that: visitors. The world belongs to E-40, and it's one he's built and rebuilt so endlessly since the mid-1990s that it's become his <i>Our Town</i>. His Bay Area is more palpable than Dre's cartoon Cali; it bustles with smells, with arguments, with small characters chasing odd dreams. It's real, down to the tiniest details like the ""Moneygrams [and] Walmarts,"" the ""bootleg man with DVD burns,"" and the ""soul food shops [and] barbershops"" that E-40 ticks off, lovingly, on ""In the Ghetto"". Over the course of three straight hours, he never trips or offers a half-baked line (excepting, perhaps, ""I ain't a sandwich/ But I used to be a po' boy."")</p>
<p>E-40 has already promised that the following three volumes of <i>The Block Brochure</i> may be ready for public consumption within the next six or seven months. If this seems like Ahab-level insanity, consider this: <i>The Block Brochure,</i> sold separately as three volumes and as a single 60-song package, occupied <a href=""http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2012/04/e-40-hits-billboard-200-four-times-with-block-brochure-trilogy-this-week/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">four distinct spots</a> on this week’s Billboard Top 200, selling a combined 32,000 units. He sees no reason not to deploy all of this material, and his energy and creativity is such there's little reason to think he won’t continue rapping well until the sun burns out. ""I'm hella long-winded/ I'll talk your ear off,” he says on ""Blame It on the DJ"".  As long as he's got it within him to be this absurdly generous with his musical gifts, I'll be sure to clear a spot on my plate for him.</p></div>"|16509.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16509-e-40-the-block-brochure-welcome-to-the-soil-vols-1-2-3/|7.9|Jayson Greene

The 28 year-old singer, born Elizabeth McChesney, boasts elite art-school bona fides and has modeled for the likes of <i>Elle</i> and <i>Vogue</i>. After starting her recording career with a promising teaser of an EP (<i>Self-Taught Learner</i>) in 2009, Trullie's eponymous full-length debut has been fashionably late in arriving. The first single to be released from the record was <a href=""http://soundcloud.com/lissytrullie/madeleine"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Madeline""</a>, an exhausted dirge that plays up husky-voiced Trullie's uncanny ability to channel another model-turned-chanteuse, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3039-nico/"" target=""_blank"">Nico</a>, complete with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4469-the-velvet-underground/"" target=""_blank"">Velvets</a>-y guitars. </p>
<p>Fortunately, Trullie isn't really interested in being a po-faced artiste. The majority of the album's other 10 songs are no less derivative than ""Madeline"", yet Trullie deserves credit for displaying the good sense to at least diversify her stylistic take-offs. More importantly, she's not nearly so self-regarding as to stand in the way of a good hook. The biting ""It's Only You, Isn't It?"" may drip with unearned affect, but it also gladly gives way to an irresistibly raucous refrain. Trullie lets a nice bassline do most of the heavy lifting on ""You Bleed You"", while horns cheekily undercut her sober verses on ""Wearing Blue"". Better still, the jittery post-punk rush of ""Caring"" and ""I Know Where You Sleep"" gets kissed with a pop sweetness that explains the frequent comparisons that Trullie has elicited to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8008-chrissie-hynde/"" target=""_blank"">Chrissie Hynde</a>.</p>
<p>Occasionally, Trullie even evinces a willingness to stretch beyond strictly late-70s/early-80s confines of verisimilitude, particularly with the horn-laden indie pomp of opener ""Rules We Obey"" and the loose-limbed, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3006-the-national/"" target=""_blank"">National</a>-esque ""Spit You Out"". Unfortunately, these chameleonic sonic tendencies don't manifest themselves in any facility for adding variety to the stories Trullie's lyrics tell. Mostly the words either broadly suggest some downtown licentiousness or function as meaningless placeholders to serve Trullie's sneer or the music's evocation of reckless anomie. Luckily, Trullie's in expert hands here with producers John Hill (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27635-santigold/"" target=""_blank"">Santigold</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2935-mia/"" target=""_blank"">M.I.A.</a>) and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4313-tv-on-the-radio/"" target=""_blank"">TV on the Radio</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6770-dave-sitek/"" target=""_blank"">David Sitek</a>, and like any poseur worth her salt, she can make a superficial costume seem compelling without drawing too much attention to the fact that the person inside of it may not have a whole lot to say.</p></div>"|16515.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16515-lissy-trullie/|6.0|Josh Love

A backhanded compliment of the highest order, it suggests, among other things, that here's an act that lacks a definitive sound, hides behind rudiments, and is mostly incapable of eliciting any sort of feeling or triggering any sort of real surprise. But, you know, they can play. So it's with trepidation that we're introduced to Bellingham, Washington, prog-metal freakazoids <a href=""http://dogshredder.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dog Shredder</a>; after releasing only five songs across two EPs, Pitchfork's Brandon Stosuy <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13292-battle-toads/"" target=""_blank"">noted</a> of them, ""you'll have an idea why it takes them so long to learn their parts."" But for all of its technical proficiency, the <a href=""http://dogshredder.bandcamp.com/album/brass-tactics"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Brass Tactics</i> EP</a>-- the trio's riotously complex, three song follow-up to 2010's <a href=""http://dogshredder.bandcamp.com/album/boss-rhino-ep"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Boss Rhino</i> EP</a>-- is the mark of an exhilarating new voice that's fun, ferocious, and ultimately exhausting in the most satisfying kind of way.</p>
<p>Opener<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13292-battle-toads/"" target=""_blank""> ""Battle Toads""</a> is as good a place to start as any, a neck-breaker of a track that perfectly carves out the band's aesthetic: Turn-on-a-dime changes (roughly 300 per track), stretches of gleeful thrash that headbangers of all walks could enjoy, and a bracing interplay between lightning fast drumming, pogo-worthy bass work, and quick-fingered guitar burn that would appease even the shrewdest math-rock snobs. Evoking post-emo outfits like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/396-the-blood-brothers/"" target=""_blank"">the Blood Brothers</a> and metallic progsters like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1583-the-fucking-champs/"" target=""_blank"">the Fucking Champs</a>, these references feel surprisingly fresh for revisitation, especially when considered alongside the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16158-attack-on-memory/"" target=""_blank"">return of</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13363-the-house-that-heaven-built/"" target=""_blank"">anthemic pop-punk</a> of the same era. There may very well may be too much being piled on at once here, but to complain about getting tangled in Dog Shredder's hectic webs would be to miss a pretty obvious point. It's sort of akin to those <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_Mouse_roller_coaster"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Wild Mouse"" roller coasters</a> you find at low budget amusement parks: Just when it looks like you're about to tip right over the rails and into oblivion, you're automatically jerked 90 degrees in the next direction. The feeling that the bolts may be coming apart beneath you is part of the appeal.</p>
<p>As if titles like ""Battle Toads"" (you may remember <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battletoads"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">this TMNT knock-off</a>) and ""Battle Snake"" (probably not a reference to <a href=""http://www.addictinggames.com/action-games/battlesnake.jsp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">this</a>, but what the hell) weren't enough of a giveaway, <i>Brass Tactics</i> feels very much indebted to video games in general. ""Snake"" is somehow faster and more fervent than ""Toads"", with guitarist Josh Holland's manic finger-tapping sounding like the gathering of so many pixelated coins. ""Battle Snake"" captures a rare moment where the band feels as if it may trip over its own feet, but in keeping all of this energy tightly bundled, it feels like a novice player's panicked mashing of a button pad that, unexpectedly and triumphantly, executes a graceful but fatal blow onscreen.</p>
<p>Which isn't to say that these tracks can't put on a straight face, albeit in monitored doses. With almost every brain-slurrying crescendo, there's a four-on-the-floor tension-reliever to cushion the fall, like the bruising <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7759-motorhead/"" target=""_blank"">Motörhead</a>-cribbing cow-punk sprints on ""Battle Snake"" that lesser bands would not only kill for, but would likely drive into the ground. If they so pleased, there's no saying that Dog Shredder couldn't be a really exciting metal or punk band proper (the proof is in the hooks), but you get the impression that the challenge (and the reward) lies in finding ways in and out of the labyrinth with athletic execution. Bear in mind that this is a band that formed after drunkenly deciding they should learn Yes' <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utBOYUw0YUw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Heart of the Sunrise""</a> in its entirety.</p>
<p><i>Brass Tactic</i>'s biggest surprise is saved for last in ""Battle 07"", an out-of-nowhere gothic ballad that dials the BPMs back by at least half. It features a languorous, aching breed of psychedelia that's as elegantly dreadful as a cathedral fire, thanks in large part to those howling organs and Holland's strained screams. <i>Brass Tactics</i> really has only two big problems, and one is that it could use more of Holland's vocals. The other problem, of course, is that it's just too damn short. Some would argue that this level of intensity would be hard to stomach over the course of a full-length album, but with all due respect, speak for yourself. <i>Brass Tactics</i> is proof that ambition and skill don't automatically cancel out heart.</p></div>"|16508.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16508-dog-shredder-brass-tactics-ep/|7.6|Zach Kelly

You could see it in the way Ian Williams was moving in between two keyboards, his porn star moustache twitching, in how Dave Konopka playing with hunched intensity. And then there was John Stanier, destroying the drums in a way that said, ""I could definitely kill a man with these hands."" </p>
<p class=""p1"">Everyone knows by now that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/461-tyondai-braxton/"" target=""_blank"">Tyondai Braxton</a> left on bad terms in the middle of making what became Battles' second album, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15469-gloss-drop/"" target=""_blank""><i>Gloss Drop</i></a>, and that the remaining members were forced to redefine what the group meant for themselves and for their audience. They managed it admirably, with the shaky live shows at the start of the cycle morphing into unequivocally brilliant outings such as the above-- all of which makes it interesting to wonder why a remix album distorting the band's identity 12 different ways seemed the logical next step. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Each member of Battles has said in interviews that there's a version of <i>Gloss Drop</i> that will never see the light of day. It's an album built on possibilities, one that had a number of distinct incarnations prior to the one we know, which in itself possesses at least three outward personalities. In his review of <i>Gloss Drop</i>, Jess Harvell commented on the album's propensity for pitching virtuosity against silliness, and blurring the lines between human and machine sounds, which are relationships explored-- and sometimes to really great effect—on <i>Dross Glop</i>, this intriguing, rewarding remix collection. </p>
<p class=""p2"">It's an obvious point than when stood against a number of minimal techno rejigs of the source material, it's the playful, borderline daft moments that stand out the most, riding the gamut from fun to flipping nuts. At the milder end of the scale, there's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22485-hudson-mohawke/"" target=""_blank"">Hudson Mohawke</a>'s take on <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cofswLqmfc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Rolls Bayce""</a>, an unexpectedly soft and emotive take from the Glasgow producer. He plays on the prettier, chiming parts of the original, buffering the steel drum warmth with pillows of sustained, complementing pastel synths. <a href=""http://www.hyperdub.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Hyperdub</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22051-kode9/"" target=""_blank"">Kode9</a> turns <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/45560-shabazz-palaces-the-field-boredoms-gang-gang-dance-kode9-on-battles-remix-collection/"" target=""_blank"">""Africastle""</a> into a seven-minute, house-focused mini set of sorts, fizzing and grinding ominously before slamming into a kind of chiptune dancehall dance party. Most strikingly fun of all is <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1831-gang-gang-dance/"" target=""_blank"">Gang Gang Dance</a>'s Brian Degraw's reworking of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOb6IC3LQTI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Ice Cream""</a>. <a href=""http://thequietus.com/articles/06144-battles-interview-gloss-drop"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">In one interview</a>, Ian Williams said that the original reminded him of a Bollywood song before <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/251-matias-aguayo/"" target=""_blank"">Matias Aguayo</a>'s vocals were involved, and here, it's a strutting global magpie, stuttering with rudimentary synths that you might hear at an <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27844-omar-souleyman/"" target=""_blank"">Omar Souleyman</a> show, dallying with a little dancehall, and ending with Aguayo's sexy grunts looped to lunacy. </p>
<p class=""p2"">While Pat Mahoney (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2598-lcd-soundsystem/"" target=""_blank"">LCD Soundystem</a>) and Dennis McNany's version of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3075-gary-numan/"" target=""_blank"">Gary Numan</a>-featuring <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/43915-watch-the-new-battles-video-for-my-machines-ft-gary-numan/"" target=""_blank"">""My Machines""</a> isn't as nakedly playful as the aforementioned, it's one of a handful of tracks here that amplifies Battles' renowned humorous streak. An itchy stomp at the beginning, by the end it's a distant cousin of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2950-giorgio-moroder/"" target=""_blank"">Moroder</a>'s disco work, where it's not hard to imagine Numan busting out the chorus of ""I feeeeeel looooove."" <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28847-shabazz-palaces/"" target=""_blank"">Shabazz Palaces</a> turn <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13137-white-electric-shabazz-palaces-remix/"" target=""_blank"">""White Electric""</a> into a coolly loping presence, repurposing the song's bass into what sounds like a horn section, again blurring that line between organic and synthesized sounds. Even though <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6765-the-alchemist/"" target=""_blank"">The Alchemist</a>'s interpretation of ""Futura"" is ominous, hanging heavily around a Dilla-style beat, his inclusion of one of science fiction author Arthur C. Clarke's famous quotations feels knowing and delivered with a raised eyebrow, all things considered: ""If a futurist could, by some miracle, predict the future, his prediction would sound so absurd and so far fetched, that everybody would laugh him to scorn."" </p>
<p class=""p1"">In contrast to this collection's more boisterous efforts, it would be easy to overlook some of the subtler, more cerebral moments here, one of the finest examples of which comes with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5179-the-field/"" target=""_blank"">the Field</a>'s remix of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/45223-listen-the-field-gui-boratto-remix-battles/"" target=""_blank"">""Sweetie and Shag""</a>. Axel Willner's last album, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15790-looping-state-of-mind/"" target=""_blank""><i>Looping State Of Mind</i></a>, was his most varied collection yet, but this redux is disarmingly simple, paring the chiming, furious clank of the original down to something many half-lives removed, recalling the sense of decay that Willner demonstrated on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12338-then-its-white/"" target=""_blank"">""Then It's White""</a>; <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/13799-kazu-makino/"" target=""_blank"">Kazu Makino</a>'s vocal turn is reduced to a series of gasps in among tight snares. At their finest, these quieter moments touch on the emotive slant of Hudson Mohawke's remix: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1348-cluster/"" target=""_blank"">Qluster</a>'s ""Dominican Fade"" pairs prim horns with beautiful organ glimmers, sounding nothing like the source material but no worse for it. The same can't be said for Kangding Ray's <a href=""http://youtu.be/B6o9woP0n4A"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Toddler""</a>, which is four minutes longer than the original, sounds nothing like it, and resembles a steady, dull rave on an active helipad at its most exciting; elsewhere, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5140-gui-boratto/"" target=""_blank"">Gui Boratto</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/45223-listen-the-field-gui-boratto-remix-battles/"" target=""_blank"">""Wall Street""</a> feels blocky in comparison to the way some of these remixes play with differing tempos, like the anxiously palpitating grind of Silent Servant's <a href=""http://soundcloud.com/sputnika/battles-inchworm-silent"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Inchworm""</a>.</p>
<p class=""p1"">While a few songs here feel like very distant relations of the originals that inspired them, there's only one remix present that lives up to the full inversion promised by the album's title: unsurprisingly, that comes from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19280-boredoms/"" target=""_blank"">Boredoms</a>' Eye, enlisted to remix his own <i>Gloss Drop</i> appearance, ""Sundome"". Where the original was neatly sparkling and contained in its final bout of explosiveness, Eye's own version is elephantine, blown out, and cacophonous, with his tentacular mind throwing all sense of structure against the wall. It's a thrilling look inside his brain, a microcosmic version of this peep under the hood that Battles have allowed with <i>Dross Glop</i>, showing off the constituent parts that now make their machine a smooth, assured, and always giddily exciting ride. </p></div>"|16514.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16514-dross-glop/|7.8|Laura Snapes

Her high harmonies take a number of the songs from sloppily catchy to pop-friendly. Her bass playing often provides the most hummable melodies. At shows, while frontwoman Cassie Ramone plants herself at stage right, practicing strangulation on the neck of her guitar and testing the limits of her reverb pedals, Goodman can be found stage left, stepping to the mic for those aforementioned harmonies, jumping up and down, and smiling broadly. As gratifying as all of that sounds, Goodman had the understandable impulse to create things on her own: Last year found her taking the reins on a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15108-la-sera/"" target=""_blank"">self-titled album</a> as <a href=""http://www.freewebs.com/iamkatygoodman/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">La Sera</a> with mixed results. It was a pretty album, one that felt speckled with glitter, and it was faithful to the girl-group bliss for which her main group is known, but at times it felt a little <i>too</i> faithful-- catchy but lacking a distinct identity, airy and pleasant almost to the point of superfluousness.</p>
<p>These problems have been more than corrected on on her sophomore La Sera collection, <i>Sees the Light</i>. Take <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13164-break-my-heart/"" target=""_blank"">""Break My Heart""</a> and lead single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12940-please-be-my-third-eye/"" target=""_blank"">""Please Be My Third Eye""</a>. Delivered at warp speed and full volume, both songs are punchy punk numbers that sound like well-produced takes on Goodman's short-lived <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/28969-all-saints-day/"">All Saints Day</a> project. But while those older songs clearly invited comparisons to the buzzsaws-cutting-through-corroded-metal sound of Vivian Girls and plenty of bands that came in their wake (particularly early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27600-dum-dum-girls/"" target=""_blank"">Dum Dum Girls</a>), these new tunes benefit from how Goodman separates herself from the pack. Her smooth alto-- pushed refreshingly high in the mix-- is a perfect fit for some of the record's other tracks. Here, the elegant, almost ethereal singing contrasts with the fuzzy distortion in a way that's infectious and unique. There are other departures as well: ""Drive On"" adopts a spaghetti-western guitar line that plays out dramatically, and ""How Far We Come Now"" is measured and heavy-- both sonically and emotionally-- sounding like a grunge band covering Carly Simon. </p>
<p>As a result of Goodman's knack for classic pop melody and structure, even the songs that bear a resemblance to <i>La Sera</i> are an improvement. They burst with personality and feeling: Closer ""Don't Stay"" carries a particularly lonely drift, while the blooming arrangements and Shop Assistants-indebted feel of ""I'm Alone"" nestles closely to the same C86 and twee comparisons her Vivian Girls bandmate so <a href=""https://twitter.com/#!/cassieramone/status/172893943623729152"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">vehemently</a> <a href=""http://www.cityartsonline.com/blog/2011/05/vivian-girls-talk-new-record-burt-bacharach-and-changing-all-time"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">rejects</a>. Songs like ""Love That's Gone"" and ""It's Over Now"" coast gorgeously with an acrimonious undercurrent. These ballads find Goodman dismissing herself from a relationship in a way that's heartbreakingly apologetic, the musical equivalent of sending a Dear John letter attached to a floral arrangement.</p>
<p>At a lean half-hour, there's no room for filler here. Every song on <i>Sees the Light</i> is exquisitely crafted and overflowing with personality. It's a record so enjoyable and expertly sequenced that it demands repeat listens before it's even over. But most importantly, it shows Katy Goodman can translate what she brings to Vivian Girls into top-shelf songwriting.</p></div>"|16511.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16511-sees-the-light/|7.5|Martin Douglas

Using pop music from the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6809-the-shangri-las/"" target=""_blank"">Shangri-Las</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23642-a-ha/"" target=""_blank"">A-Ha</a>, and others, she has said she hopes to convey an unruly humanity she believes is too often missing from contemporary art. ""It's cool, it's measured, it's outside of things, and I think that's a complete delusion,"" she explained in the latest issue of the <i>Wire</i>, suggesting art should instead relate to our ""actual social lives.""</p>
<p>That's a useful prism for approaching <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28963-allo-darlin/"" target=""_blank"">Allo Darlin'</a>, the best new group in recent years from a pop tradition that attempts to counter what its members might perceive as the market-corroded fantasy of corporate pop and the detached insularity of many underground records. Led by Australian-born Elizabeth Morris, who previously played with ex-Talulah Gosh frontwoman Amelia Fletcher in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4192-tender-trap/"" target=""_blank"">Tender Trap</a>, the London foursome established themselves as worthy heirs to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/324-belle-and-sebastian/"" target=""_blank"">Belle and Sebastian</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/662-camera-obscura/"" target=""_blank"">Camera Obscura</a>, and the <a href=""http://home.clara.net/koogy/sarah/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sarah Records</a> roster with their 2010 <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14354-allo-darlin/"" target=""_blank"">self-titled debut</a>, all hummable melodies, clap-along rhythms, and poignantly turned phrases. <i>Europe</i> maintains these qualities and improves upon its predecessor in almost every way.</p>
<p>Their second album's title refers to the group's ill-fated van tour through Germany and beyond in 2011, clocking in at five weeks and more than 12,000 miles. From the debt crisis to the broadening, increasingly politicized definition of ""Europe,"" the continent remains as ripe for artistic exploration, but Allo Darlin' filter any subliminal economic malaise through clear-eyed observations of what feel like genuine everyday experiences. Where on their debut it was easy to match up individual songs with their specific historical and cultural inspirations, here the band sounds confidently itself, with any pop-culture references wrapped up naturally into the emotional lives of the characters in the songs.</p>
<p>The songs are richer both instrumentally and lyrically: Strings dress up the breathless title track, and the steel guitar of the debut's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-T1yJl7b1hw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Heartbeat Chilli""</a> returns to lend a bittersweet twang on occasion. But more remarkable is the band's core, which shines brighter than ever. Morris' high, bell-like, lightly accented vocals have gained new assurance, and although her ukulele gets its stripped-down showcases, mostly it's an understated complement to the fluid jangle-pop of guitarist Paul Rains, bassist Bill Botting, and drummer Michael Collins. Collins, especially, has grown more consistent since his first go-round without losing that in-the-moment vitality.</p>
<p>Which is crucial, because dizzying impermanence is what the album simultaneously celebrates and preemptively mourns. Morris' lyrics, her most heartbreaking yet, are at once alive with excitement and shrouded with the knowledge that this, too, is fleeting. From the first verse of cautiously optimistic opener ""Neil Armstrong"", <i>Europe</i> confesses to yearning for ""a simpler time,"" and while the precocious narrator certainly suffers her bouts of homesickness, what the record is really nostalgic for is the ever-passing present. Morris dreams of her native Australia on sunny first single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/tv/musicvideos/1872-capricornia/"" target=""_blank"">""Capricornia""</a>, and elsewhere she avails herself of snail-mail options for communicating with a faraway romantic interest. But no matter how broken she feels on ""Europe"", another character is at pinch-me levels of giddiness, telling her, ""This is life/ This is living.""</p>
<p>That youthful joy blooms throughout the album, and it's contagious. ""I have a feeling that this day will be amazing,"" Morris proclaims unaffectedly on gorgeous, midtempo falling-in-love song ""Some People Say"". ""This is the year we'll make it right,"" she further declares, on the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2550-the-lucksmiths/"" target=""_blank"">Lucksmiths</a>-style leap of ""Northern Lights"". On the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1737-the-go-betweens/"" target=""_blank"">Go-Betweens</a>-gone-Beatles-in-Hamburg romp ""Wonderland"", the world feels like it's ""ending,"" but only ""when I'm with you""-- and happily, she doesn't care. Before the rousing call-and-response outro of the boozy ""Still Young"", Morris warns they shouldn't carry on like this, but you suspect they do anyway. Sure, there are a few lyrical over-reaches, but as with the debut's accelerating tempos, they're a testament to the energy captured here, and to dwell on them would be missing the point.</p>
<p>In <i>Europe</i>'s world, pop songs are almost characters in their own right. Melancholy, uke-oriented finale ""My Sweet Friend"" recalls meeting a friend in the park ""on the day a famous pop star died,"" and talks about how records can accrue extra-musical value through their significance in our lives. ""Some People Say"" hints at this idea early on, mentioning ""the song that to me has a hidden meaning."" But on sparse, vividly detailed stunner ""Tallulah"", run-ins with fortuitously familiar tunes-- Talulah Gosh, the Maytals-- prompt Morris to wonder ""if I've already heard all the songs that'll mean something,"" or worse, ""already met all the people that'll mean something."" When, on wistful midtempo affair ""The Letter"" she confides to a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3786-silver-jews/"" target=""_blank"">Silver Jews</a> obsessive, ""What if I told you I was never cool/ And all I wanted was just to have you,"" there's no need to worry.</p></div>"|16502.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16502-europe/|8.1|Marc Hogan

What many of us didn't realize was that, aside from Maus' vocals, it was an almost note-perfect rendition of a track from <i>These Things Take Time</i>, a CD-R Nilsson self-released in 2008. Since then the interview-shy, Berlin-based songwriter has written and home-recorded no fewer than three LPs, and put all of them out on her own <a href=""http://darkskiesassociation.org/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dark Skies Association</a> imprint. Like Maus', her songs are built primarily from vocals and vintage electronics, with a comforting patina of false age.</p>
<p><i>History, </i>her fourth full-length, is an 11-track collection of power ballads and off-kilter dance-pop, carried by the commanding, almost Nico-like ominousness of her voice. Synthetic, darkly romantic, and full of grandiose swells, her songs are likely to sound self-consciously 1980s without reminding you of any artist in particular. They also feel slightly awkward, as though she were struggling to reproduce the ecstatic pop vision inside her head using the antiquated tools at her disposal. Should there be any doubt that Nilsson's notion of <i>History </i>is partly about the relationship between humans and technology, anthemic opener ""In Real Life"" cuts straight to the chase with an existential meditation on the unreality of life in the internet age: ""Online I never feel alone. I never feel alive."" ""Hotel Home"", another anthemic standout, sees Nilsson comparing herself to a ""satellite,"" and warning us that she's ""never at home, so call on Skype.""</p>
<p>There is a sort of wide-eyed innocence to statements like these, a guilelessness that feels equivalent to the cheesy synth presets she unleashes from the opening note. Susan Sontag once defined camp as ""art that proposes itself seriously, but cannot be taken altogether seriously because it is 'too much.'"" Album standout ""I Hope You Die"" demonstrates the over-the-topness of Nilsson's aesthetic most forcefully, combining a bouncy dance beat, swirling synths, and the sort of tragic romanticism that would make Morrissey proud: ""I hope you die, by my side, the two of us at the exact same time."" The key here is that Nilsson's music feels celebratory even at its darkest moments, chock full of auto-harmonies and dramatic tempo changes and eager remind us that ""too much"" can be very satisfying sometimes.</p>
<p>For the most part, <i>History </i>unfolds with the theatrical pacing of a rock opera, alternating between large-sounding anthems and more stripped-down, slow-paced asides, usually with Nilsson singing over elementary piano melodies. Even with these variations, everything <i>does</i> start to feel a little bit the same, but you probably won't mind if you're easily enchanted by the album's overall gloss of elegiac, glam-rock decadence, enhanced by Nilsson's deadpan delivery, and lyrics that revolve around doomed love, lost worlds (see: ""The City of Atlantis""), and ""chances... blown"" (""Hotel Home""). Even if you're not, there's still something charming about the sound of a person trying to make ""big"" music with wonky drum machines and limited keyboard technique. When she doesn't quite pull it off, there's a beauty to the sound of a person trying, failing, and letting us bear witness to the whole thing. When she does, we're smitten.</p></div>"|16510.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16510-molly-nilsson-history/|7.0|Emilie Friedlander

The most basic is the arrival of new guitarist and vocalist, Ashley Thomas. The other? Their sound. Here are two choice quotes from Larry Fitzmaurice's take on last year's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15063-friends-for-now/"">Friends For Now</a></i>: ""It seems the band forgot that while you're making music, it's a good idea to have some hooks,"" and, ""just the fact that you need a Google search to tell that more than one person sings in Young Prisms is the reddest of red flags."" Lacking hooks and vocal distinction is not a problem for <i>In Between</i>, but in the case of the former, those that fill the void don't do so with any particular aplomb.</p>
<p>So while they're still shoegazing, there's a bigger emphasis on catchiness and clarity; there's an easy comparison to be made between <i>In Between</i> and the music of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/24033-mazzy-star/"" target=""_blank"">Mazzy Star</a>. That's largely because the fuzz clears the way to showcase Stefanie Hodapp's somewhat <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3693-hope-sandoval-and-the-warm-inventions/"" target=""_blank"">Hope Sandoval</a>-ian vocals, apparent on album opener ""Floating in Blue"". That said, this album doesn't put the Mazzy Star-level of focus on the vocalists-- even while it's a huge step up in clarity, the real star here is the wistful haziness in the album's cold jangle. There are some noteworthy exceptions-- ""Gone"", by contrast, has a legitimately sunny riff leading it off, immediately followed by Gio Betteo's clear voice. It's a revelation for this band, sounding beachy and joyous.</p>
<p>While Young Prisms are no longer smothered by fuzz, that doesn't mean they're any more assertive. Most of these songs on <i>In Between</i> are so unassuming they're hard to remember minutes after they're over. (The band's proximity to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29667-youth-lagoon/"" target=""_blank"">Youth Lagoon</a> in iTunes doesn't help-- Trevor Powers is killing the ""assertively quiet"" game right now.) Even when a song decides to stick in your brain, it's usually for the wrong reasons-- there are a handful of examples where their newfound catchiness keeps churning for a bit too long. ""Dead Flowers"" has a limber riff and a pleasant chorus, but it's four minutes long when it could easily be two.</p>
<p>That's not to say every time the band plots out a four-minute song, they end up repeating themselves. ""Better Days"" is a fine example of being repetitive (and threatening to outstay its welcome), but it has enough varying elements and quietly elegant guitar work to stay interesting for the full song. While the track's slight warble and gentle vocals mimic the album's overall tone, the small varying elements and changes in texture keep it from falling into the trap of sameness. And there are some moments that completely shine-- ""To Touch You"" is an example of using the slow burn to your advantage, opening with a slow, assertive guitar strum and springboarding into a sweeping synth. It's also a testament to their way with guitar layering, giving an otherwise quiet song some much-needed underlying texture.</p>
<p>The best compliment to be thrown at <i>In Between</i> is that it's the most essential step the band has taken to date at defining a sound. Yes, there are well-trod lyrics like ""she's always on my mind"" and song titles like ""Dead Flowers"" and ""To Touch You"", but it's easy to get the sense that the intent is to let the jangling shoegaze wash over you, and if some of the lyrics stick, that's fine. But that's the thing-- they rarely do, and neither do several of the songs.</p></div>"|16505.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16505-young-prisms-in-between/|6.0|Evan Minsker

The frontman has always weaved rock'n'roll history into his tunes, but this was different. The last few years saw Pierce reissuing his defining 1997 monument <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13984-ladies-and-gentlemen-we-are-floating-in-space-collectors-editon/"" target=""_blank""><i>Ladies and Gentlemen We Are Floating in Space</i></a> as a boxed set and playing the grandiose album in full at a handful of memorable shows. The redux was a welcome reminder of that album's strung-out, gospel-blues magnificence; <i>Ladies and Gentlemen </i>aimed for the heavens, always, and reached them more often than not. But it also reminded us of how his ensuing three albums haven't quite stacked up, how his psychedelic take on early rock may have nowhere else to go. As he told me earlier this year, revisiting his past masterpiece had Pierce thinking: ""If I'm going to make new music now, it better be fucking good."" </p>
<p class=""p1""><i>Sweet Heart Sweet Light</i> fits that description. Yet it's not a drastic transformation as much as an acute refinement. Pierce is still using large orchestras and choirs to take his Robert Johnson blues way past the crossroads, to vistas that are as endless as they are empty. He's still singing his own rock'n'roll gospel: Jesus, fast cars, girls named Jane and Mary, pimps, death, fire, freedom, and God all show up, giving life to Pierce's alternate-universe Eden, inhabited by Lou Reed, Iggy Pop, self-loathing, and a spitty syringe. He's still his own genre-- this tiny voice elevated by the super-church-sized arrangements in his head. ""I want to make music that catches all the glory and beauty and magnificence, but also the intimacy and fragility, all within the space of the same 10 seconds,"" Pierce has said. It's a mad goal. But it's also an inherently intriguing and universal one, just as ancient myths or Biblical tales can be. Pierce isn't religious, but he uses Christian language and figures as a thematic shorthand. ""As you have a conversation about Jesus, you know you're talking to him about how it is to be fallible and question yourself and your morals,"" he told me. ""When I sing, 'Help me, Jesus,' you know I'm not asking for help fixing the fucking car."" Such an all-or-nothing attitude is risky, but that's the whole point.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Pierce mixed <i>Sweet Heart </i>over eight drawn-out months under something of a drug-induced stupor. But it wasn't the kind of drug-induced stupor Pierce is known for. At the time, he was being hit with experimental chemotherapy treatments to combat a degenerative liver disease. (Three doctors are thanked in the liner notes; Pierce is apparently OK now.) During this album's creation, the singer referred to it as <i>Huh?</i>-- a nod to his jumbled mental state. All of which would make one assume that <i>Sweet Heart </i>would be messy, fucked-up, and completely depressing. That is not the case. This is probably the most uplifting album of his career. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Relatively speaking, that is. ""Sometimes I wish that I was dead,"" he sings on ""Little Girl"", ""'Cause only the living can feel the pain."" Safe to say: Jason Pierce will not be singing next to Big Bird on ""Sesame Street"" anytime soon. This is an end-of-your-rope, nothing-left-to-lose kind of comfort marked by equal doses of fierce distortion and sentimental strings. And there's more reflection here, too. ""All I want in life's a little bit of love to take the pain away,"" he famously sang, starkly vulnerable, on <i>Ladies and Gentlemen</i>'s title track. Here, though, he's more considered. On the lovelorn ballad ""Too Late"", most of the movie-score violins drop out as Pierce sighs out the kind of profundity perhaps only age can offer: ""This is dedicated baby, what more can I say?/ I won't love you more than I love you today/ And I won't love you less, but I've made my mistakes/ Stay away from love dear if that's what it takes."" Naturally, he doesn't take his own advice and can't help but fall in love on the track anyway. But the disclaimer adds another layer to Pierce's from-the-vein emoting. </p>
<p class=""p1"">This wiser perspective is also found on the nine-minute first single ""Hey Jane"", where the titular rock'n'roll hellion is given some shade. Though the song's narrator is taken with the fast-living Jane, he <span class=""s1"">""</span>ain't got time to waste my time with you,"" too. Meanwhile, the music piles up into a car crash before returning as a sky-bound motorik pulse, like a Cadillac going 110 straight into the atmosphere. The scathing ""Get What You Deserve"" pairs ""Kashmir""-like strings with what sounds like a guitar being popped in and out of its socket as Pierce offers a biting critique of rock'n'roll excess (and, by extension, the entire capitalist enterprise). ""Gonna shoot you while you're laying still/ I lost all of my emotion,"" he sings, taking the role of too-far-gone rock star/hedge-fund manager/corrupt politician, while the song's nagging dissonance suggests a chaos just beneath the surface.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Similarly, Pierce uses his deadpan to great effect as he casually dismisses the whole lot of humanity on the tremendous ""Headin' for the Top Now"": ""In our haste to find a little more from life/ We didn't notice that we'd died."" Once again, not too life-affirming on paper. But the song's mash of angry feedback and a rumbling juke-joint piano/bass/drum backbone locates the unpredictable excitement of our collective folly. The song's outro, which has Pierce's 11-year-old daughter Poppy singing of pimps and hustlers in a rhyme reminiscent of ""Mary, Mary, Quite Contrary"", only adds to the bizarre (and bizarrely joyful) disorientation. </p>
<p class=""p1"">So it makes strange sense that this exhilarating album about death and destruction should end with ""So Long You Pretty Thing"". The title references Bowie's glam-generation anthem ""Oh! You Pretty Things"", but this is no simple tribute. It's a eulogy to those classic rock'n'roll dreams, as Pierce sings over and over: ""So long you pretty thing, God save your little soul/ The music that you played so hard ain't on your radio/ And all your dreams of diamond rings, and all that rock'n'roll can bring you/ Sail on, so long."" Which, coming from this 46-year-old who's never exactly set the charts ablaze, sounds like a terrible finale. And yet, backed by that choir and those horns, this is the finest, most enduring refrain Pierce has ever written-- a goodbye you never want to end.</p></div>"|16503.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16503-sweet-heart-sweet-light/|8.8|Ryan Dombal

Since then, the grand theme of his catalog has been the tension between the world in his head-- which is peopled by dragons, courtesans, and kings-- and the persistent, alarm-clock nag of the world around him. In his work with prog-pop juggernauts <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4660-wolf-parade/"" target=""_blank"">Wolf Parade</a> and his more fanciful onetime solo project <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4126-sunset-rubdown/"" target=""_blank"">Sunset Rubdown</a>, Krug has fashioned himself a kind of indie rock Don Quixote: a raving, good-natured lunatic more comfortable in the realm of metaphor and myth than physical world. And for the same reason that Don Quixote would have been a shitty boyfriend, a Krug song very often ends in heartbreak. In an <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1juxbgwPiM0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">early Wolf Parade track</a>, his companion complains about the din of city buses, and he tells her to ""pretend [they're] whales, keeping their voices down."" She will do no such thing. Yelps our hero, ""Such were the grounds for divorce.""</p>
<p>The title doesn't lie: Heartbreak is once again the main preoccupation on Krug's latest record as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28467-moonface/"" target=""_blank"">Moonface</a>, but <i>With Siinai: Heartbreaking Bravery</i> continues the recent forays he's made into more literal, brick-and-mortar storytelling. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12208-fast-peter/"" target=""_blank"">""Fast Peter""</a>, the strongest track on Moonface's largely lackluster 2011 release, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15674-organ-music-not-vibraphone-like-id-hoped/"" target=""_blank""><i>Organ Music Not Vibraphone Like I'd Hoped</i></a>, told a story about a friend's long-distance romance in brutally clear language. (The opening couplet: ""So Peter loves a girl/ The way that only Peter does/ He told me all about it on the balcony when we were high on drugs."") ""I would like to be able to do more of that sort of writing,"" Krug said about the Spartan approach of ""Fast Peter"" in a recent <a href=""http://www.undertheradarmag.com/interviews/moonface/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interview</a>. And most of the time, <i>Heartbreaking Bravery</i> makes good on that promise: There's a purposeful simplicity to its narrative approach and a concreteness to its imagery-- even when our narrator sounds less than engaged. ""The bed looked like a butcher's block/ And you liked it better when I was on top,"" he drones on ""Yesterday's Fire"", his indifference backlit by a swirling, sky-on-fire soundscape, ""And I thought about nothing at all.""</p>
<p>The Siinai of the title is a Finnish band that sounds like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4171-tangerine-dream/"" target=""_blank"">Tangerine Dream</a> meets <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1388-explosions-in-the-sky/"" target=""_blank"">Explosions in the Sky </a>atop a mountain that is particularly prone to lightning strikes. As their name implies, these guys rarely hit a note that's not epic (their most recent album was a grandiose, kraut-indebted affair called <i>Olympic Games</i>), and their chugging, apocalyptic compositions mostly provide a nice undercurrent to Krug's brooding wordplay on hypnotic slow-burners like ""Heartbreaking Bravery"" and ""Quickfire, I Tried"". Krug's arrangements with Sunset Rubdown in particular married the arty ambitions of prog rock with the crayon-bright, glockenspiel-dappled aesthetic of mid-2000s indie rock, but Siinai are more about swirly, molten swaths of gray. It's a decidedly more mature sound for Krug, which echoes the record's thematic concerns with aging. ""I'm too old for you, anyway,"" he sings to the love interest on ""Yesterday's Fire"". <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13352-headed-for-the-door/"" target=""_blank"">A few songs later</a> he seems to have learned his lesson: ""She was only 23, or she was only 24/ I headed for the door.""</p>
<p class=""p1"">Krug's retreat from flowery metaphor is occasionally too extreme: The chorus of ""Shitty City"" actually goes, ""And it's a shitty city now/ It's a shitty/ City/ Now."" That track in particular finds the Moonface and Siinai symbiosis to be a little disjointed: The instrumentation is fiery and volatile, but Krug's efforts there feel perfunctory and a little uninspired. Thankfully, those tracks are few and far between, and overall this collaboration with Siinai proves to be one of the more compelling Moonface records to date.</p>
<p>Though <i>Heartbreaking Bravery</i> is an improvement on <i>Organ Music</i>, it's a little misleading to speak of Moonface in linear, progress-oriented terms. The project is amorphous on purpose, a sort of open-ended mantle for whoever Krug feels like collaborating with in the future. ""I want to make it impossible to get stuck in a rut,"" he's said, ""wherein any one sound or image is expected by anyone from Moonface."" Still, given how inside his own head Krug can seem, his inclination towards collaboration-- and letting other people into his dreamworld-- seems like a progression in and of itself. ""I'm not the phoenix yet,"" he howls in clipped syllables on the album's titular track. Maybe so, but given the guy's prolific output, it's only a matter of time before he burns this particular sound to ash and revives Moonface as something completely new.</p></div>"|16495.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16495-moonface-with-siinai-heartbreaking-bravery/|7.1|Lindsay Zoladz

The desire to distinguish one's art from the physical self could explain her move from an angelic moniker (Halo is an adopted name) to a more fierce and masculine one. And this idea is central to the new Mute imprint Liberation Technologies, a label founded to free artists of a sense of expectation, for which <i>Spring</i> is the premiere release.</p>
<p class=""p1""><span style=""background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.917969); color: #222222;"">Following a pair of 12"" EPs for the boutique electronic outpost Hippos in Tanks, as well as a cassette for micro-label NNA Tapes, </span><i>Spring</i><span style=""background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.917969); color: #222222;""> stands as Halo's most accessible and aggressive work to date, a case of masterful brain-space music that employs frightening bits of suspension at one moment and a more conventional, club-oriented 4/4 click at the next. Quickly paced, the EP is characterized partially by its movement and immediacy, with </span><span style=""background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.917969); color: #222222;"">a sublime sonic build that finally harnesses the intensity of what Halo has achieved live for several years. The enormous organ samples that open ""SPRING 01"", reminiscent of those found on Klaus Schulze's </span><i>Trancefer,</i><span style=""background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.917969); color: #222222;""> pave the way for visceral beats that anchor the track's engrossing texture with jolting razor-sharp rips. </span> </p>
<p class=""p1"">On Halo's first release, the avant-pop <i>King Felix </i>EP, she said she used lyrics to ""inject feeling"" into electronic music; her voice then was widely compared to Enya. By her own standards, the instrumental <i>Spring </i>feels a bit less human and perhaps more mechanical. A warped vocal sample early on in ""SPRING 01"" seems to confirm that with its vocoded aesthetic, but it's a fleeting addition to the song, contributing just a bit of metallic mood. That the layers on <i>Spring</i> are so purposeful and well-edited enhances the sense of retro-futurism, sometimes bringing to mind first-wave jungle and later darkwave offshoots.</p>
<p class=""p1"">This is especially apparent on ""SPRING 03"", an alternate version of ""SPRING 01"" that expands the track with added breathing room and recurring, primitive breakbeats. Because Halo is working on <i>Spring </i>within the context of science fiction-- ""King Felix"" is an allusion to the author Philip K. Dick's 1981 novel <i>VALIS</i>-- ""SPRING 03"" reminds me of a time loop, the broken-record sci-fi plot device where we re-live the same experiences (think <i>Groundhog Day</i>). The track's percussive focal-points emphasize that feeling of entrapment. And this sense of drama is heightened on the collection's final track, ""Freak"", a paranoid, experimental drone collage that presents three minutes of haunted, quavering synths. It feels not so much an afterthought as an afterword, with choral vocals lost under the noise.</p>
<p class=""p1"">""SPRING 02"", a classically structured ambient dance track with a futurist sheen, points to another time and place, specifically early R&amp;S and Detroit techno. <i>Spring</i>, then, presents multiple personas over four tracks while still feeling coherent-- a skill that's becoming a signature across Halo's discography. The Philip K. Dick novel <i>VALIS </i>also deals with the shifting identities of a near-schizophrenic narrator, as well as the potential for pure, rational information to save man from the noise of everyday life. Halo said she tried to channel this ""rational energy invasion"" on the first <i>King Felix</i> release, and while <i>Spring</i> is a far cry from that EP's echo-laden synth pop, the connection is there, and the concept does feel newly interpreted. That clear-headed approach also makes <i>Spring</i> function similarly to the most accessible tracks from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16031-replica/"" target=""_blank"">Oneohtrix Point Never's <i>Replica</i></a>.</p>

His style trades heavily in authenticity, an anathema to many critics who don't understand the way ""realness"" helps drive hip-hop's ethical worldview, defining the genre's parameters. But in the unflinching, unapologetic descriptions of the drug dealer's day-to-day, Boldy James reinvigorates a familiar template by coming up with a more effective and moving method to convey his truths with magnetic, powerful style.</p>
<p>His debut album, 2011's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/staff-lists/8743-you-can-find-this-on-the-internet-mixtapes-you-might-have-missed/"" target=""_blank""><i>Trapper's Alley: Pro's and Cons, the Quikcrete Mixtape</i></a>, was actually recorded over the course of many years. Some of the verses had been written by the 29-year-old-artist when he was still a teenager. <i>Consignment: Favor For a Favor, The Redi-Rock Mixtape</i> is only a slight step down from his debut; although the guests-- there are many-- add to the overall feeling that he has drawn the listener into his Detroit world, not all of the rappers who make this tape have the same presence as James. Despite this and its 26-track-length, the album is incredibly consistent.</p>
<p>Paradoxically, what's made his work feel so honest is the energy he puts into its artfulness, the striking moments of poetic license. On ""Graze the Top"", an album highlight, Boldy's figurative language is almost anachronistic: ""Even if the cops flick/ Got my gunpowder and my musket/ Trust and believe that you'll be bleedin' like a stuck pig."" It's these kinds of writerly details that make his work stand apart, that give it a personal stamp. There's a sense that only Boldy James would choose to express himself this way, which helps transcend the signifiers of particular hip-hop eras or subgenres.</p>
<p>From the queasy discomfort of ""White Dresses"" to the reinvention of a Mobb Deep classic on ""The Last Two Days"", James is as much a songwriter as he is a lyricist. Perhaps the most impressive highlight, ""Jackie Brown"", samples a 1970s funk song performed by James' uncle; the flawless execution of its gun-personification concept would make Nas jealous. But even if the occasional beat doesn't quite connect like it should, or a guest rapper doesn't completely deliver, it's difficult to discount any tracks because of how powerfully Boldy's lyrics operate in even the album's rare weak moments.</p>
<p>His verse on ""Nothing Can Save Us"" is an example of how an uncomplicated, straightforward style can leave a deep impact: ""I grew up a fuckin' screw-up, got introduced to the game watching my grandmother shoot up/ In her veins, poppin' the skin, pull out the syringe, head-nodding again."" But with this kind of hyper-specificity, the goal isn't to shock or to manufacture reality-porn; instead, it's almost as if he lends horrific events some dignity by putting them to paper. It's a continuation of the evocatively rendered tragedy of <i>Trapper's Alley</i>'s ""There Goes the Neighborhood"", a song that simply listed the names of incarcerated associates, known to the outside world only through Boldy's music. Boldy James manages to weave such compelling narratives that the listener feels bound to follow them, to make it so the lives the artist renders aren't left invisible to history.</p>
<p>There's a lot to say about a record like <i>Consignment</i>, because there are so many songs and his personality is so purposefully conveyed. He's said that for him, the recording booth was a kind of therapy, a way to stay sane and let off steam while dealing with some particularly stressful life experiences. Boldy's drug dealing lifestyle never leads to lavish club-hopping, and despite taking on street rap's occupational core cliché, he sketches it in an uncompromisingly confident way. One gets the sense that if James didn't have so much to get off his chest, his rapping wouldn't be quite as invigorating; he's a rapper for whom content is style, whose subtle poetic gifts are dependent on the seeming veracity of the concrete heart of the stories he tells.</p></div>"|16491.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16491-boldy-james-consignment-favor-for-a-favor-the-redi-rock-mixtape/|7.8|David Drake

The <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp_k6aQrF3A"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">''As Heard on Radio Soulwax''</a> discs were essential party soundtracks, and a quick flick through music video channels yielded endless <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzkbHrbxAz0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Britney</a> and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShPPbT3svAw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Christina</a> mash-ups.

Fast-forward to the present, and Lushlife-- aka producer/MC Raj Haldar-- still seems to be investigating that contrast.</p>
<p>That's not to say there's anything crude about the way Halder mixes up genres on <i>Plateau Vision</i>, but what you do get is an <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjIYNy0SFL0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Andrew Cedermark</a> (of <a href=""http://underwaterpeoples.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Underwater Peoples</a>) guest spot on a rap record. That appearance comes on ''The Romance of the Telescope"" where Cedermark is enlisted to sing the hook from the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3151-orchestral-manoeuvres-in-the-dark/"" target=""_blank"">OMD</a> song of the same name (over a sample also culled from the song). The beat hangs in air, spectral and melancholy as Halder points his telescope at South Philly, name-dropping <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2231-joy-division/"" target=""_blank"">Joy Divison</a>, Maxi Priest, and spitting ""coke rap but sprinkled with the right emotion.""</p>
<p>Rap can often be pretty meta with references within references, often to cartoonish real life events (Killa Cam patenting his own color, Kanye's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1z8gCZ7zpsQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Taylor Swift-gate</a>), and pinpointing submerged narratives is sometimes half of the fun. Halder litters his music with references too, but with the absence of an outré personality, he relies on unexpected name-drops to establish his character-- <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbYWkegobTU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Burt Bacharach</a> and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HY9WUZZrTpw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Zola Jesus</a> are both invoked on opener ""Magnolia"", for instance. These nods make this feel like a nerdy, insular record, and more than anything Halder often comes across like an enthusiastic music fan. There's a lot of heart to this record too, not least in <i>Plateau Vision</i>'s dewy-eyed beats: from the gorgeous guitars of ""Big Sur"" to the drumless, music box glow of ""Gymnopedie 1.2"". </p>
<p>Halder's nasal rasp sounds good as a counterpoint to his lush, textured beats, and his vocal style harks back to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3599-the-roots/"" target=""_blank"">the Roots</a>' <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXEqklUX4zE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Black Thought</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3002-nas/"" target=""_blank"">Nas</a>. ""Hale-Bopp Was the Bedouins"" is where he shines brightest-- a dark, rumbling beat opening up just enough space as a canvas so his verses stand at the fore for the first time. He nods to the classics, invoking Nas as he posits himself as ""half-Delorean, half-rap historian"" while sounding more aggressive than anywhere else on <i>Plateau Vision</i>. Das Racist's Heems completes an already dark picture, sounding ragged and tough as he finishes the track up.</p>
<p>There's probably a little too much emphasis on cultural currency for Halder to ever define himself as a character on <i>Plateau Vision.</i> Regardless there's enough of a sweet spot in the clean, backward-leaning production and offbeat samples to allow the record to distinguish itself as more than a sum of disparate parts.</p></div>"|16500.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16500-lushlife-plateau-vision/|6.9|Hari Ashurst

Early singles and EPs focused on scream-laden hardcore and mixed noisy electronics with traditional guitars and drums. By the time of their proper full-length debut, 2002's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/748-beaches-and-canyons/"" target=""_blank""><i>Beaches &amp; Canyons</i></a>, they had become psychedelic explorers who smashed gentle drones against noise and turned it into something both violent and graceful. In the years since that masterpiece, they've cut a stumbling but consistent path through bad vibes electronics, mixing dark humor, broken beats, and generally disorienting drugginess to create a sound that they pretty much own. And though recent records like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12907-repo/"" target=""_blank""><i>Repo</i></a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10825-load-blown/"" target=""_blank""><i>Load Blown</i></a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/752-broken-ear-record/"" target=""_blank""><i>Broken Ear Record</i></a> have a fair amount of variety, you'd never mistake them for anything early on in the group's history.</p>
<p>Since Black Dice are no longer as interested in formal innovation, the best way to evaluate their new music is to just think of it in terms of tunes. Are the riffs good? Do the melodies take some nice turns? Do they use the right textures to suit the track's overall thrust? On <i>Mr. Impossible</i>, the answer to all three of these questions is yes. At nine songs in 46 minutes, <i>Mr. Impossible</i> feels like a collection of instrumentals that has a clear if seriously bent relationship to pop music.</p>
<p>Black Dice's sound is resolutely urban, conjuring images of percussion pulled from junkyards, strange music leaking from a broken speaker in a bodega, the bass-heavy thud of a mobile subwoofer that happens to have an automobile wrapped around it. Regardless of how this music was created and which actual instruments were used, if any, <i>Mr. Impossible</i> feels organic in its own rusted-out way, wholly of this polluted earth. Black Dice get <i>funky</i> here, too, offering up something like a lo-fi, low-technique variation on the rubbery, densely textured grooves of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1023-miles-davis/"" target=""_blank"">Miles Davis</a>' <i>On the Corner</i>.</p>
<p>Since Black Dice's M.O. has always been at least partly about chemical-laden anxiety, it's easy to forget that they can be pretty funny, and <i>Mr. Impossible</i> in particular is filled with playful silliness. The ""lead"" voice on ""Outer Body Drifter"" basically sounds like a couple of fun-loving dudes trying to get a party started, but their voices have been ripped from their throats and packed together into a single gooey, wholly unintelligible ball. The absurdity of these sorta-chants over the stomping, buzzy beats sounds both darkly fucked up and also hilarious. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12948-pigs/"" target=""_blank"">""Pigs""</a> is a static-soaked, very distantly countrified tune with a 4/4 thump and snarling vocal that sounds like Billy Gibbons from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7321-zz-top/"" target=""_blank"">ZZ Top</a> with a bloody mouthful of broken teeth. The eight-minute ""Carnitas"" is the most free-floating thing here, a rush of awkwardly tumbling drum hits, sax blurts, and watery vocals that flows and careens and seems constantly on the move. ""The Jacker"" is downright <i>jazzy</i>, with a beat that actually swings and a bouncy little distorto-rhythm and a snaking wah-wah'd lead melody. Even with all the unease, there's real joy in this stuff, an infectious sense of discovery as Black Dice find ways to make bizarre music into something tightly structured and fun. </p>
<p>In other places, though, <i>Mr. Impossible</i> is a little more abstract and experimental and also a bit less interesting. ""Spy vs. Spy"", which has squelchy synths and a vocal loop consisting of a single chipped syllable, is Black Dice by numbers, the kind of thing that seems to come almost too easily to them; listening to it, it's hard not to feel a bit wistful for when they seemed to re-write the rules every time. Still, on the evidence of <i>Mr. Impossible</i>, they still sound like no one else and they're still thinking hard about music and texture. When you're craving something trashy and tripped-out in this very particular way, they still deliver the properly damaged goods. </p></div>"|16499.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16499-mr-impossible/|7.7|Mark Richardson

While not always explicitly paying homage to sounds from the London hardcore rave scenes of the early 1990s-- in addition to breakbeats, their approach folds in amorphous elements of electro-pop, jungle, drum'n'bass, and hip-hop samples-- <a href=""http://elitegymnastics.tumblr.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Elite Gymnastics</a>' recent one-off tracks and <i>Ruin</i> series continue to honor the method of passing material around a like-minded group of electronic musicians and building on it the way Reynolds describes.</p>
<p>With each iteration of the ongoing <i>Ruin</i> project, numerals and parentheticals are added to the base tracks to a point where it doesn't so much matter where they began, only that there are still ways to build upon them, and minds wanting to do that expanding and molding. On <i>Ruin 3</i>, the Minneapolis duo of James Brooks and Josh Clancy have invited six artists to offer up their takes on three of their tracks-- here we find extended remixed versions of the breathy, breakbeat-heavy originals ""Here, in Heaven"", ""Minneapolis Belongs to You"", and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12270-so-close-to-paradise/"" target=""_blank"">""So Close to Paradise""</a>. The remixes on <i>Ruin 3 </i>don't all hold up on their own, but for anyone who enjoyed the first two installments of the project, they're satisfying additions-- not merely excess or supplement-- to a collection that somehow seems to have a lot of inspirational juice left in it. </p>
<p>The term ""remix"" is used to the full range of its definition. On one hand, How to Dress Well's Tom Krell takes <i>Ruin 1</i> highlight ""Here, in Heaven"" and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12500-here-in-heaven-cover-by-how-to-dress-well/"" target=""_blank"">strips it down</a> to its glacial church-organ core, cooing lyrics that were previously difficult to make out in his trademark almost-falsetto: ""Is it okay to go through life being untouchable?/ Is it okay to be in love with something dead?"" he whimpers, giving any listener who'd considered Elite Gymnastics' lyrics unimportant a new perspective on the original version of the song. (He later offers what's possibly a sly wink in singing, ""oh, oh, oh, oh, oh"" in a way that immediately calls to mind the hook on <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rywUS-ohqeE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Alicia Keys' 2007 hit ""No One""</a>.) On the other end of the spectrum, an Anime Skyscraper remix of the same song brings it to a place of bloated, ambient unrecognizability that doesn't do much besides add filler to the collection. But if you're still left longing for yet another rework of ""Here, in Heaven"", you can't do much better than Montreal producer CFCF's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13370-here-in-heaven-4-5-cfcf-remix/"" target=""_blank"">slow-burning finger-snap version</a>, which recreates (and possibly upstages) the original altogether. And that's not even counting yet another remix by Natalie Bootleg, Physical Therapy's drum'n'bass <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12741-so-close-to-paradise-3-physical-therapy-remix/"" target=""_blank"">retooling of ""So Close to Paradise""</a> or the LOL Boys version of ""Minneapolis Belongs to You"". There's a lot of ground covered here.</p>
<p>But that's not to say that <i>Ruin 3</i> is a typical exercise in remix miscellany-- if anything, the way Elite Gymnastics create and solicit remixes feels like a constructive counterpoint to the growing trend of artists slapping anything and everything over a blog hit and uploading it to SoundCloud to increase pageviews or follower counts. It's the songs themselves that grow bigger and more evolved with each additional edition (""Here, in Heaven"" being the most notable example), not the level of name-brand recognition of the artists doing the remixing. Brooks and Clancy have done well to carefully draw in collaborators and cultivate a project that is outward-looking and communal.</p></div>"|16496.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16496-ruin-3/|7.2|Carrie Battan

He pointed to the floaty, celestial presence of her vocals, that ghost in and out of her music but never quite settle in place. On <i>Violet Replacement</i>, a two-track CD-R released by Harris to support a Grouper tour of the same name, she's boxed her vocal work into a corner, with only light fragments of her voice occasionally hovering above the semidarkness. Instead, she leans hard on an array of tape loops, Wurlitzer loops, and field recordings, all mixed live through a series of dictaphones and tape players. <i>Violet Replacement</i> provides a large sweep of space for Harris to stretch out in, to see how far out she can push her central aesthetic before the brittle harmony she amasses gradually cracks and blisters into a form of disunity.</p>
<p>The two tracks here, ""Rolling Gate"" and ""Sleep"", fall just a couple of minutes shy of the hour-and-a-half mark. At times it feels like Harris is delicately stacking up a house of cards, with each element gently added on top of the other with great care and precision. As such, it closely aligns this work with her other output under this name, where it feels like every detail has been agonized over, only slotting into Grouper world after undergoing a great process of attrition. On this release, everything just happens at a more lethargic pace than usual. It's like waiting around for a star to burn out, or watching an entire film reveal itself in slow motion. The surprisingly agitated crescendo each track reaches is analogous to the work of artist <a href=""http://oppositionart.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jonathan Schipper</a>, who recently wreaked slo-mo havoc upon a car by having it crash into a wall at 7mm per hour over a month-long period. </p>
<p>Schipper says his piece displays ""a dramatic inevitability that reflects our own mortality,"" and <i>Violet Replacement</i> lands in a similar place. When Harris allows the world she so painstakingly built up to ignite and burn apart in front of our eyes, it makes it easy to get lost in feelings of self-doubt, destruction, fatality. That power of suggestion Harris possesses is her biggest strength, whether she's working over 52-minute pieces such as ""Sleep"" or through the more refined songs on her 2008 album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12119-dragging-a-dead-deer-up-a-hill/""><i>Dragging a Dead Deer Up a Hill</i></a>. There's nothing overtly defined; instead, Harris offers a series of nebulous textures, sometimes heavily layered, at other times bearing a few faint traces of sound. From there it's like being immersed in a dense bank of fog rolling in off the coastline, where only you can make sense of the world that's been temporarily thrown up around you.</p>
<p>Much of the suggestion presented in <i>Violet Replacement </i>comes from Harris's supreme patience as a player. She's got an intuitive grasp on how to let her loops buckle and coil, phasing elements in and out with a keen eye for pacing and execution. These tracks are long, but never meandering. It always feels like there’s a place they're heading, a loose destination in mind. At times it's reminiscent of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5820-popol-vuh/"">Popol Vuh</a>'s ""Affenstunde"", where repetitive elements are strung out over a boundless timeline, and key shifts are made to gently prod the listener out of any one particular headspace. <i>Violet Replacement </i>may not be a space to return to often, mainly due to the sheer scale of the project. But it's a logical stretch for Harris, a place akin to the contrasting mix of sharp focus and heady improvisation that marked the production of Terrence Malick's outstanding <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077405/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Days of Heaven</i></a>.</p></div>"|16493.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16493-violet-replacement/|6.8|Nick Neyland

I suspect this was the ideological heart of Diddy's Dirty Money project: an insistence that R&amp;B's sonic adventurism and its emotional intensity are in a relationship of mutual necessity, each offering a frame through which the other can be perceived in its best light. Dirty Money is apparently defunct now, but Richard has absorbed, and built on, its aesthetic to the point where she can match or even surpass the heights of 2010's <i>Last Train to Paris</i>, the project's sole album release. </p>
<p>Where <i>Last Train </i>came on like a glittering chorus line of guest stars, electronic costumes, and emotional poses, Dawn's solo work is rigorously private and individual. Last year's mixtape <i>A Tell Tale Heart</i> was modern R&amp;B stripped to its essentials, with almost every song built around muscular rhythm tracks and layers of Dawn's vocals. Dawn's voice often resembles that of a more accomplished <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10563-brandy/"" target=""_blank"">Brandy</a>, combining swooping harmonies with a spare central vocal frequently on the verge of choking up. It's as if everything in her music can be divided between the absolutes of the aggressively mechanical and the nakedly, vulnerably human.</p>
<p>Dawn's new release <i>Armor On </i>is billed as an EP, but its 36-minute expanse is longer than many albums and more impactful than most. The collection makes the contrast between the mechanical and the human its central theme, aspiring to steely invincibility as an escape from the frailties of the flesh, with the constant danger of placing one's happiness in the hands of another. Dawn and her producer Druski-- who's responsible for all but one of the tracks here-- frequently turn to dance music in order to express this contrast, but <i>Armor On </i>largely eschews the banging wall-of-sound approach of contemporary dance-pop. Instead, its vision of dance music is one of vast, grandiose structures anchored by persistent repetition, like a vow of survival or fidelity in a rainstorm.</p>
<p>On <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWBnNOk1_Vs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Black Lipstick""</a>, quicksilver drum'n'bass beats are deployed like landmines, tripped by the twists and turns of this deeply ambivalent song of obsession. I'm guessing that for Dawn the appeal of drum'n'bass is less the accelerated tempo than its facility for layering rhythms to create a sense of ever-deepening complexity and force. This approach matches her vocals, building into complex tapestries of interwoven harmonies, while the songs plummet toward a melodramatic core of regret, of abandon, of anger-- the tenor of the emotions may change, but the intensity is a constant. ""Black Lipstick"" may be more unexpected, but the by turns sensuous and haunting ballads <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4ZQseLyMYE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Scripture""</a> and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9JXm-csjQg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Save Me From U (Remix)""</a> are similarly accomplished and seductive. </p>
<p>Surprisingly, Dawn's distance from the compressed build-up/break-down cycles of commercial dance pop carries over to <i>Armor On</i>'s house-influenced tracks. On the devotional <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESodEc4s8YA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Change""</a>, a syncopated kickdrum groove gathers percussive snare rolls around it like fairy floss, until the song's percussive density becomes unbearable (echoing Dawn's romantic absolutism: ""If he was religion, I'd be the faith,"" she declares, sounding like she's watching her lover's execution), while on <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcBInf3czyE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Heaven""</a> a seductive tabla-sampling house groove becomes submerged like a fossilized imprint under successive layers of pummeling drums. Even <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVRfXCmyRv0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Faith""</a>, the EP's one concession to contemporary R&amp;B mores, is a masterpiece of build, spiraling ever upward toward an anthemic, explosive release.</p>
<p>Dawn's stylistic promiscuity may be <i>Armor On</i>'s key talking point, but its most remarkable quality is its essential unity, always returning to her vacillations of defiance and surrender in the face of love's promise and its deceptions. ""I feel so artificial when loving you,"" she accuses a callous, uncaring lover over the rigid robo-groove of ""Automatic"", then sighs, ""I wanna be human…"" Her dilemma remains endlessly sympathetic, but it's hard not to hope she remains stuck in this bind when the results are so spectacular.</p></div>"|16486.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16486-armor-on-ep/|8.2|Tim Finney

In chillwave and drag house, in post-dubstep and R&amp;B, in neo-IDM and electronic psychedelia, palsied drum machines lurched and staggered. Ailing synths with gummy keys coughed out sickly pitches. As the precision of machines tightened around us, we forced them to be everything that didn't come naturally to them: faulty, erratic, human. But the robots decisively rally on the new album by <a href=""http://www.120days.no/120days.no/_.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span class=""s1"">120 Days</span></a>, where an armada of hardware fires on all circuits, larger than life and possibly out for revenge.</p>
<p><i>120 Days II</i> is contiguous with the Norwegian electro-rockers' <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9451-120-days/""><span class=""s1"">eponymous 2006 record</span></a>, where they built the gleaming chrome architecture of optimistic krautrockers such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5754-neu/""><span class=""s1"">Neu!</span></a> on the scorched earth of nihilistic droners <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4048-spacemen-3/""><span class=""s1"">Spacemen 3</span></a>. But this time, the emphasis is definitely on the electro side, as announced by opening track ""Spacedoubt"", where a discreetly grinding guitar is dwarfed by a glowing, rippling grid straight out of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/20555-jan-hammer/""><span class=""s1"">Jan Hammer</span></a>. Throughout the record, rapacious currents of house and trance, blasted out with pre-minimal Teutonic bluster, relegate the guitar to a more supportive role. The drums thunder along on motorik rails, but they're intricately syncopated with miles of arpeggiated synthesizer. 120 Days aren't just pulling this stuff off a spool. Instead, they tie space into strange loops and curves, fanciful and whooshing like baroque banisters. Which is a relief, since it took them six years to make. </p>
<p>120 Days are attracted to some of the same tropes as their countrymen <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10316-casiokids/""><span class=""s1"">Casiokids</span></a>: the oily skid of a bass synthesizer, the tropical melody couched in a wintry timbre. But where Casiokids are all light and fun and humility, 120 Days are much darker and grander; a jam band for stern-faced MPC wizards. But for all their hellbent grandiosity, they think to provide a little something for everybody. Like to hear tensions gathered and discharged at great, spine-tingling length? There's ""Dahle Disco"", a lunging house track wrapped in a growling and shimmering FX fantasia. Prefer to dive into the rainbow? ""Lucid Dreams Part 1"" is a pleasantly streaky drone interstitial. Fiery prog, pitch-shifting bass workouts, dreamy interludes; they're all here, finely sequenced into one mammoth arc. The dark euphoria notably dips on ""Sleepless Nights #4"", a Beatles-y longueur, but it gets fizzy again on ""Sunkissed"", where popping bubbles serve as a delightful and untypically delicate kind of percussion. </p>
<p>The machines on <i>120 Days II</i> are so holographically vivid that the human element can't help but seem wan, especially since Ådne Meisfjord is such a nondescript singer whose vocal presence does neither harm nor good. The exception to the rule is closing track ""Osaka"". With nasty synthesizers hammering away at snarled boasts such as ""5:15, I'm sharp and clean,"" it's like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3961-the-strokes/""><span class=""s1"">the Strokes</span></a> as Scandinavian electro-rockers, and has tons of the personality lacking elsewhere. Still, it's not just the record's title that smacks of an underdeveloped conceptual imagination, however well-compensated by a robust technical one. Though it's a ripping good time, this Krauty idiom already has the propensity to feel dated. Such a towering and square-cornered version feels especially so, in this time of mechanical plague.</p></div>"|16492.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16492-120-days-ii/|7.0|Brian Howe

""MTV Unplugged"" was once a showcase for pop culture writ impossibly large-- a place where the entire world could gasp at Gene Simmons' bare face or where Kurt Cobain could introduce over five million record buyers to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnGc-6GHQps"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span class=""s1"">the Vaselines</span></a>. But in recent years, the show's institutional power has fizzled, and its most recent installments have featured tepid, obligatorily low-lit performances from are-they-really-<i>that</i>-famous? acts like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19465-30-seconds-to-mars/"" target=""_blank"">30 Seconds to Mars</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29404-young-the-giant/"" target=""_blank"">Young the Giant</a>. Which is why <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26688-florence-and-the-machine/"" target=""_blank"">Florence and the Machine</a>'s <i>Unplugged</i> instalment feels so promising. One of the more compelling pop acts to spring up in recent years, it's hard to imagine a voice more equipped to puff new life into the series than that of celestially soulful frontwoman Florence Welch. As on mega-hits like <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWOyfLBYtuU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Dog Days Are Over""</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12525-shake-it-out/"" target=""_blank"">""Shake It Out""</a>, Welch has displayed a talent for sprawling her demons and heartbreak across canvases bigger than the sky: Every song she's ever sung has been writ large.</p>
<p>And occasionally, that's the problem. While her promising 2009 debut, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13372-lungs/"" target=""_blank""><i>Lungs</i></a>, had the skittish, genre-hopping restlessness of an artist still settling into her sound, the 12 tracks on its followup, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16004-ceremonials/"" target=""_blank""><i>Ceremonials</i></a>, came in only one size: gigantic. Even the ballads beat with earth-shaking percussion were gilded with epic, Greek choral background vocals and all other varieties of sonic baubles. Though Welch's voice is undeniably powerful, the songs beneath it all <i>seemed </i>well-composed and deeply felt, but their emotional impact was often blunted by producer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6145-paul-epworth/"" target=""_blank"">Paul Epworth</a>'s unrelenting maximalism, ramped up from his work on Welch's debut. Which makes them perfect candidates for the classic scaled-back, stripped-down approach, right? You'd think so.</p>
<p>In quite a few cases, the <i>Unplugged </i>treatment does work wonders. The opening number, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkJK2KVFsi0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Only if for a Night""</a>, is more arresting here than it is kicking off <i>Ceremonials,</i> where its haunting power (the song is about being visited in a dream by the ghost of a loved one: typical Florence stuff) was interrupted by a superfluous, glitchy beat. The <i>Unplugged</i> version gives the song much-needed room to breathe, and with fewer distractions the searing imagery of Welch's lyrics have a chance to float to the surface. ""And the grass was so green against my new clothes,"" she trills, losing herself in the song's second verse, ""And I did cartwheels in your honor dancing on tip-toes/ My own secret ceremonials before the service began/ In the graveyard, doing handstands."" It's an oddly joyous funeral rite, but it's Welch articulating the feeling she plumbs best-- deriving light from the deepest darkness and feeling more at home in the world of spirits than the corporeal one. Same goes for ""Breaking Down"". On <i>Ceremonials</i>, that song's edges are padded with stately chamber-pop echoes, as though to protect Welch from bruises as she wrestles her demons to the ground. The sparse arrangement of the <i>Unplugged</i> version allows Welch to find deeper and even more unsettling emotion in the song, transforming the chorus from a pop hook to something like a moaning, seasick dirge.</p>
<p>Some of the greatest ""MTV Unplugged"" moments have been somewhat unlikely covers (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-4qv6n0MAg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span class=""s1"">Maxwell doing Kate Bush!</span></a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcXYz0gtJeM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span class=""s1"">Nirvana doing Lead Belly!</span></a>), and here we get Welch adding to this enduring trope with her take on <a href=""http://vimeo.com/39940719"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Try a Little Tenderness""</a>. It's a lovely vocal performance (she hits a note early on that will probably prompt someone to book her for an upcoming Whitney tribute), but it also brings into focus the problem with her <i>Unplugged</i> as a whole: Its emotional range is decidedly limited. Welch's ""Try a Little Tenderness"" is mournful and utterly devoid of playfulness, and-- though no one's going to fault her for her putting her own signature spin on a classic-- so is every other moment of this performance. Which means that ""Tenderness"" bleeds right into the song after it, an acoustic arrangement of the power-ballad <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGH-4jQZRcc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""No Light, No Light""</a>. Her <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swrp5mmdzG0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">twangy duet with Josh Homme</a>, a cover of the Johnny Cash and June Carter song ""Jackson"", provides a little deviation, but not much.</p>
<p>Many of these songs might sound good on their own, but listening to them one after the other exposes their repetitions. There's only a certain number of times you can listen to Welch feeling lost in the verse and then found, transcendently, in the bombast of the chorus before it all starts to feel like a package of ""Amazing Grace""-themed magnetic poetry, with each new track shuffling the elements around just so. Unlike one of Welch's songs, though, <i>Unplugged</i> is a decrescendo, and the performance runs out of steam by the time she gets to two of her best songs, ""Dog Days are Over"" and ""Shake it Out"". The latter, a torch song that has enough oomph not just to move mountains but to pick them up and punt them, peters out into a disappointingly tepid finale.</p>
<p>No one who listens to <i>Unplugged</i> will accuse Welch of being an untalented singer, but they might be left wanting more from the material she lends her voice to. Fans will enjoy hearing Welch's songs opened up in this format, but her <i>Unplugged</i> definitely doesn't rank among the classics of the series. The artists who have been responsible for the best and most enduring <i>Unplugged</i> albums-- <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3046-nirvana/"" target=""_blank"">Nirvana</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1944-lauryn-hill/"" target=""_blank"">Lauryn Hill</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2173-jay-z/"" target=""_blank"">Jay-Z</a>'s collaboration with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3599-the-roots/"" target=""_blank"">the Roots</a>-- all used the candle-lit stage to explore new directions in their respective sounds. For Welch, it serves the opposite end: It displays the boundlessness of her vocal talent but finds her tethered to a frustratingly limited aesthetic.</p></div>"|16480.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16480-florence-the-machine-mtv-unplugged/|5.9|Lindsay Zoladz

Considering Keef is 16 years old, you could almost use the world ""child"" literally. But for all its familiarity, the mixtape is noticeably alien, with the young Keef leaving behind Flocka's headbanging intensity for a delivery and presence that is unsettlingly calm and unemotional.</p>
<p><i>Back From the Dead</i> likely refers to Keef's recently being released from prison, where he served a few weeks for allegedly firing a gun at Chicago police officers. But if you read the title more literally to mean that Keef is something like a zombie, it's maybe even more appropriate. Surrounded by beats from producer Young Chop that are stuffed with the sound of gunshots and Keef's choice ad-lib, ""bang bang,"" he's close to stoic throughout, stalking expressionless through the streets. We usually think of this type of music as fight music or party music, and though Keef's singles certainly don't inspire people to stand and stare at each other, his dead-eyed delivery gives post-crunk music a decidedly new vibe, one that goes about threatening the listener not through aggression, but the chilling lack thereof.</p>
<p>The aggressive antisociality that fueled <i>Flockaveli </i>or the 2004 self-titled debut album from Atlanta teens Crime Mob is internalized and subsumed on <i>Back From the Dead</i>, and it's evident immediately on the lead-off track ""Monster"", where amongst a hail of bullets and rolling hi-hats Keef coolly raps, ""We just do our thang, and the feds watching/ All we do is turn up, we some damn monsters."" It continues from there-- on ""My Niggas"" he more or less talks his way through the chorus (""Please don't disrespect my niggas/ Cause we gon' squeeze a lot of fucking triggers"") and on ""Winnin'"" he issues the album's most direct threat: ""Fuck with my family, and you are finished."" Neither the sentiment nor the wording is unfamiliar in the context of street rap, but Keef's laissez-faire approach to the type of things that most rappers seethe about has breathed new life into a sound that is still dominating rap despite a stretch of diminishing returns.</p>
<p>Keef's calling card is his innate laid-back aura, but the mixtape succeeds thanks to more than just that. For one, he may just have one of the most singular flows in rap, a bouncy cadence that often finds him trampolining on the last syllable of his lines. He displays this best on the single ""I Don't Like"", where he uses Young Chop's bass drum as a springboard to punctuate what may be the catchiest rap chorus of the year. Rappers such as Pusha T, Meek Mill, and Wiz Khalifa have all already taken to Twitter to shout out Keef's music, and it wouldn't be a surprise to hear his flow slowly infiltrate the rap world. Then there's Young Chop, who recently signed a publishing deal with Warner Bros., and with good reason. His beats are as musical as they are hellbent on destruction, and many of the tape's best songs (""I Don't Like"", ""Save That Shit"") are driven by his melodic ear.</p>
<p>Keef is on the verge of becoming a very big deal, and <i>Back From the Dead </i>will serve as a visible reflection of both a city that has seen an <a href=""http://homicides.redeyechicago.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span class=""s1"">obscene number of murders</span></a> in 2012, and the sound that has been the backbone of rap music for years running. As sociology, the mixtape reinforces just how and why violence is rooted in underclass communities, and though Keef has <a href=""http://smokingsection.uproxx.com/TSS/2012/03/gawker-calls-chief-keef-hip-hops-next-big-thing"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span class=""s1"">already been blamed</span></a> for its perpetuation, at the age of 16, he's still years away from fully understanding the context in which his music exists. As art, the tape shows that, despite continued oversaturation, the music that Waka hath wrought still has interesting places to go.</p></div>"|16497.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16497-back-from-the-dead/|7.9|Jordan Sargent

He's still working hard, but he's about done paying dues, and he makes magazine covers and the top of year-end lists routinely. The man is one of the best in the world at what he does, and he has one of the finest piano sounds, too, mixing big sheets of sound with blood-rush passages of intricate staccato patterns; he also frequently puts the real action in the left hand while the right holds down the harmonic fort, giving him a thundering, heavy sound when he wants it.</p>
<p>Iyer seems to like the trio format-- he cut a great trio record called <i>Tirtha</i> last year with two musicians originally from India, guitarist <a href=""http://guitarprasanna.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Prasanna</a> and tablaist <a href=""http://nitinmitta.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Nitin Mitta</a>-- and he sounds very good in a small combo setting, where he gets to ride or at least hit back at a rhythm section, but also gets to handle the melody. <i>Accelerando</i> is his hardest-hitting trio album yet, loaded as it is with compact, forceful pieces of music. Iyer's own production gives a lot of stereo real estate to Gilmore's kick drum and Crump's bass, meaning that every fast, hard passage hits with a bang, and the quieter, sparser sections, such as the tumbling melodic hook of their version of Michael Jackson's ""Human Nature"" (which Iyer <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7gkzJQzoFs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">tackled on his own</a> two years ago on <i>Solo</i>), feel lighter than air by comparison.</p>
<p>The closing interpretation of Duke Ellington's ""The Village of the Virgins"", which the group infuses with a sort of gospel energy, is one of those lighter moments, and when it arrives, it feels as though the band is dusting all those aggressive block chords and tone clouds off of itself and readying for the next challenge. That aggressive stuff is fantastic, though. ""MmmHmm"" (a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5058-flying-lotus/"" target=""_blank"">Flying Lotus</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uCyv05SG1g"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">cover</a>) hangs together loosely as it flies along, and it doesn't even bother with a bassline-- Crump instead plays arco, bowing patterns and melodic answering statements on his bass. The song features an accelerando in the true meaning of the musical term, beginning slow and moody and gradually speeding up until it sounds like even the piano is out of breath.</p>
<p>The word that keeps coming to mind as I listen to this album over and over again (and then again) is power. Everything about it projects power-- emotional power, the power of brute physical force, musical power. It runs on every available cylinder, and if you're out there looking for a path into modern jazz from the world of rock or hip-hop, this record speaks with a directness and verve that may make it an ideal introduction. From the first shudder of the keyboard and crack of drums to that last, celebratory walk through the village of the virgins, Iyer, Crump and Gilmore keep things spellbinding.</p></div>"|16483.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16483-accelerando/|8.2|Joe Tangari

Nobody's keeping secrets; the writer in question just hasn't been digging deep enough. And the band isn't part of a silent movement deadset on keeping its every move hush-hush-- that sort of behavior would be a bit self-defeating, no? Plus, messageboard culture wouldn't allow for it: too many territorial pissings over who's heard things first and who was able to grab the demo before it disappeared. Cult is as cult does.</p>
<p>That said, it's almost certain a good number of <i>Monnos</i> reviews will describe <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30315-conan/"" target=""_blank"">Conan</a> with that very phrase. After all, how else to explain the fact that a band this good is so unknown on this side of the pond? Joining a proud tradition of English doom, Conan have been smoldering away in the trenches since 2006, tantalizing the faithful with sporadic live gigs and a minuscule discography. All's been quiet on the northwestern front since their 2011 split with Slomatics, but they've returned with a vengeance, wielding a crushing new full-length. From the first moment of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13327-hawk-as-weapon/"" target=""_blank"">""Hawk as Weapon""</a>, it's clear that this is no ordinary doom album.</p>
<p>Many are those who have sacrificed years of their lives to the search of the perfect guitar tone, and this Liverpudlian trio has put them all to shame with a note. The thick, suffocating, undeniable heaviness is distorted to death and resurrected over and over again. Stoner doom lords Electric Wizard also understood the idea of tone as a weapon, and Tom G. Warrior achieved a similar feat with Triptykon's bleak, unrelenting heft. In the world of doom, tone is worshiped and revered, lusted after and idolized, and Conan have found their holy grail. Conveniently enough, the riffs sepulchered within that blissed-out fuzz are minted from pure gold as well. Simple yet effective, hypnotic without overstaying their welcome, burly without overstepping bounds, the guitars drip with distortion and waver between shades of Electric Wizard and Sleep's acid stomp and a stripped-down take on the mournful chords of their forebears My Dying Bride and Anathema. The rhythm section is infinitely important here and makes its presence known. (You can almost see the bassist pounding away at the low end, flinging drips of sweat across the stage as the drummer deals out punishing blows from behind his jeweled throne.) Again, simplicity is the key. Sometimes it's not about what you're playing, but how you're playing it. Conan understand this.</p>
<p>The tone does the talking. Vocals are sparse but engaging, floating above the murk, acting as a complement to the guitars rather than a centerpiece. A higher-pitched stoned wail is accompanied by a deeper intonation; both are drenched in unholy amounts of reverb and are also allowed to breathe. It's a similar approach to what's transpired in Georgia trio Zoroaster's more recent material or even a bit of the Brooklyn doomhaulers <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29872-hull/"" target=""_blank"">Hull</a>'s sound-- the lost soul in a wind tunnel approach. <i>Monnos</i> is uniform in execution; each song follows a similar pattern, and there are no massive surprises or unexpected flourishes. They have no time for such things. ""Golden Axe"" is the only track to break the mold, offering a lush, plaintive instrumental break from the constant wall of sound. The eye of the storm.</p>
<p>To strip the flesh from the bones is to find a band bent on replicating and revering the heavy sounds that came before them. To label them ""stoner doom"" does them a disservice. At their core, Conan are a doom band with repetitive song structures, and windswept clean vocals; the devil, however, is in the details, and the extra layers of effects and mechanical wizardry they heap upon their pure-hearted compositions elevate them to the next level.<i> Monnos</i> is their most solid, well-developed, and impressive effort yet, and those who walk the doomed path would do well to join their ranks.</p></div>"|16489.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16489-monnos/|8.0|Kim Kelly

Presumably, a lifetime of saying the name ""Oberhofer"" has made him particularly fond of the sound of the letter ""O"": Not a song goes by on his eponymous band's debut album without him embellishing a chorus with an ""oh oh oh,"" massaging a jaunty piano line with an ""oooh oooh oooh,"" or adding extra syllables to words like ""know"" and ""gold."" He even pays tribute to the letter and its sonorous tones with a centerpiece track titled ""oOoO"" that, true to its alternating capitalization, pits the ""oh oh ohs"" against the ""oooh oooh oohs"" to determine which makes the ultimate ""O"" sound. (It ends in a draw.) For Oberhofer, these O-gasms are like a facial tic or a very twee form of Tourette's-- something he seemingly just can't help. But in traversing <i>Time Capsules II</i>'s 10 tales of lost love and the struggle to win it back, it becomes increasingly apparent that Oberhofer isn't prone to these utterances because all this inner turmoil has left him at a loss for words. Rather, they sound more like crafty attempts to invest basic sentiment with forced, festival crowd­-baiting grandeur.</p>
<p>You can't blame Oberhofer for trying: After releasing two promising singles last year, the 21-year old Brooklyn-via-Tacoma songwriter has already scored a deal with <a href=""http://glassnotemusic.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Glassnote</a>, and had his debut album produced by U2 go-to guy <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/artist/Steve+Lillywhite"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Steve Lillywhite</a>. That would make <i>Time Capsules II</i> the umpteenth example of a once-modest indie band swinging for the fences in hopes of cracking the big leagues. Lead-off track <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13009-heart/"" target=""_blank"">""Heart""</a> proves to be a textbook case of overreaching, introducing an oppressively serious, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHTTr9y9ObE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Supertramp-worthy</a> piano motif before piling on all manner of Epic Statement signifiers (marching-band drums, melodramatic pauses, wordless choral crescendos) to convey the sensation of emotion being felt very deeply.</p>
<p>But the album's undoing isn't its ostentatious dressing; for all the gratuitous glockenspiel, strings, and candelabra-lit piano flourishes at work here, Oberhofer the band retains a refreshingly raucous presence. (Drummer Pete Sustarsic in particular sounds like he's waging war against the ornate instrumentation with his urgent, smash-and-bash style.) No, the real culprit is an unflattering mix that pushes Brad Oberhofer's over-excited voice too far in front of the music, to the point where he often sounds like the sore thumb in his own band. When he exclaims ""I know you! I know you!"" on ""I Could Go"", it sounds less like an intimate exchange between two soulmates than Christopher Guest coaching Harry Shearer and Martin Short in <a href=""http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=4122944961711350389"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">that old ""SNL"" synchronized-swimmers sketch</a>.</p>
<p>Oberhofer's calling-card singles <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/16274-gotta-go/"" target=""_blank"">""Gotta Go""</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11911-away-frm-u/"" target=""_blank"">""Away Frm U""</a> (re-recorded for the album) posited them as mildly flamboyant fops in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28199-the-drums/"" target=""_blank"">the Drums</a> mold, mixing 1950s-prom balladry and 1980s new-wave in a manner that drew out the playfulness in their lovelorn narratives. There are songs here that retain that spirit: ""Cruisin' FDR"" possesses a winsome <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2Ta0qCG8No"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span class=""s1"">""Crocodile Rock""</span></a> quality; ""Landline"" is <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3414-pulp/"" target=""_blank"">Pulp</a>'s <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38by00DGid0&amp;ob=av2e"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Babies""</a> given an <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/221-arcade-fire/"" target=""_blank"">Arcade Fire</a> makeover. But compared to the wool-sweater warmth of those early recordings, Oberhofer's sad-sack persona and yelping vocal ad libs come off here as less endearing and more desperate, like someone trying to oversell simple songs with eccentric affectation. We all want to root for the lovable loser, but <i>Time Capsules II</i> takes the Lloyd Dobler act too far: Instead of trying to win the girl back with <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-j379JbL-xM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a boomboxed window serenade</a>, it crates a grand piano right onto the fucking lawn.</p></div>"|16481.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16481-oberhofer/|5.0|Stuart Berman

Now there's a fair amount of background detail to roll out when it comes to the latest <a href=""http://www.stonesthrow.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Stones Throw</a> release-- an indie rap committee project assembled by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3374-portishead/"" target=""_blank"">Portishead</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7210-geoff-barrow/"" target=""_blank"">Geoff Barrow</a>, abetted by co-producers 7-Stu-7 and Katalyst, and given over to everyone from abstract-rap vets to obscure, googleproofed MySpace MCs. But above everything else, those numbers still jump out more than anything. Again: 41 tracks, 69 1/2 minutes. Oh, yeah-- and 30-plus different names listed after the ""ft.""s. That's a whole lot of one-verse wonders, interstitial skits, hidden segues, thematic 180s, abrupt mood swings, and beat-the-clock lyrical scrambling. How do you keep an over-the-top battle royale like this from falling apart completely? The glib answer would be to crack wise about most tracks ending before any flaws show up to tear them apart, but that'd be shortchanging an album that's actually got some engaging weight behind it.</p>
<p>As the most recognizable name, it might be tempting to see Barrow as the creative driving force behind this record, and if heads remember how much <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp2hKfi1B60"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Elysium""</a> sounded like the best beat the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3623-rza/"" target=""_blank"">RZA</a> never made, they might adjust their expectations accordingly. But the three-man production team doesn't shine the spotlight on any particular member, so it's best to think of the beat-crafting braintrust of Quakers as some sort of hivemind hydra, siphoning the weirder corners of underground hip-hop source material into an unpredictably heavy-hitting body of work. Everything from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3512-radiohead/"" target=""_blank"">Radiohead</a>-via-marching-band (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13156-fitta-happier-ft-guilty-simpson-and-med/"" target=""_blank"">""Fitta Happier""</a>) to Rachmaninoff-via-soul (""Oh Goodness"") gets incorporated into a repertoire that occasionally skews toward the smart-ass eclectic. (The over-the-top Moog prog of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/tv/musicvideos/1946-russia-with-love/"" target=""_blank"">""Russia With Love""</a> and the Moroderized synthpop grandeur of ""Dark City Lights"" also make for attention-getting diversions.) And if that down-for-whatever approach keeps things from feeling entirely cohesive, the team does find paydirt when they approach a common denominator-- the musty-basement vibe of Nixon-era soundtracks and soul-jazz curios turned feral, another valiant entry in the race to find out just how much contemporary pull you can get from a vintage-minded production arsenal.</p>
<p>There's some real inspired filthiness here, too. The Drummers of Burundi around which <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6841-joni-mitchell/"" target=""_blank"">Joni Mitchell</a> built ""The Jungle Line"" get refitted to give Phat Kat and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5639-guilty-simpson/"" target=""_blank"">Guilty Simpson</a> something to barrel through, and it's one of those drum breaks that has a real supple liquidity even as it knocks, like a torrent of running water that leaves bruises. (The tendon-severing clavinet is a bonus.) The more acidic side of early 1970s R&amp;B is done justice by the slinky fuzz guitar on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1193-dead-prez/"" target=""_blank"">Dead Prez</a> feature ""Soul Power"", the elephant-bell jumpsuit strut of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13314-smoke-ft-jonwayne/"" target=""_blank"">""Smoke""</a> covers the rubber-band funk of the decade's second half, and the all-exclamation-point Memphis horns of ""What Chew Want"" would be all sorts of 1995 even without the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3214-ol-dirty-bastard/"" target=""_blank"">ODB</a> singalong. Hell, even the interstitials bump. A skeptic could question why tracks like the seething boom-clap <i>Drive</i>-gone-g-funk ""The Lo"" or the two-ton analog-synth lurch of ""Kreem"" were left as segues, rather than getting fleshed out into full-length beats that would make even the most sluggishly zoned-out MC sound diabolical. But listening to the album in sequence, as attention-dividing as it might be, at least makes these sub-minute interludes feel integral.</p>
<p>It would've been easy for a high-profile all-star project like this to just call up a handful of already-established MCs, throw in one unexpected up-and-comer for tastemaker cred, and take that to the bank. But it wouldn't have the bewildering but endearing clusterfuck personality that makes it engagingly weird. A few of Stones Throw's usual suspects show up with their A-game-- that ""National Anthem""-via-""Tusk"" beat on ""Fitter Happier"" is absolutely annihilated by Guilty Simpson in peak shit-talk mode, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2960-med/"" target=""_blank"">M.E.D.</a> holds his own on the subsequent verse, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5045-aloe-blacc/"">Aloe Blacc</a>'s turn on ""Sign Language"" is the coolly self-assured reminder we need that the man who gave us the retro-soul <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14695-good-things/"" target=""_blank""><i>Good Things </i></a>can rap his ass off when he feels like it. Organized Konfusion's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3442-prince-po/"" target=""_blank"">Prince Po</a> (""Rock My Soul""), <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10146-the-pharcyde/"" target=""_blank"">the Pharcyde</a>'s Booty Brown (""TV Dreaming""), and the aforementioned dead prez round out a reliable set of verses that feel like welcome extensions of the retrofitted <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7234-krs-one/"" target=""_blank"">KRS</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/24430-audio-two/"" target=""_blank"">Audio Two</a> drops scattered throughout the record-- reverent toward veterans, but still willing to integrate them into a project with a lot of new blood.</p>
<p>All those unknown (or at least under-known) quantities can take some getting used to, however. Not that they're not ready for prime time or anything-- it's just that some of them either have difficulties establishing a unique spark with the limited time they're given, or inversely make such an odd impression that they feel like weird outliers. As much as the whole lyrical-lyricist battler style has struggled with cliché, there's nothing flagrantly corny dropped by the likes of Synato Watts (""Big Cat""), Quite Nyce (""Jobless""), or Buff 1 (""Sidewinder"") – just some solid-enough verbiage that gets lost in the shuffle amidst a cast of dozens. And the stuff that jumps out does so to an almost disruptive extent. Emilio Rojas's <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BART_Police_shooting_of_Oscar_Grant"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Oscar Grant</a>-invoking anti-police-brutality verse on ""Belly of the Beast"" takes up maybe 80 seconds, but its righteous-fury venom is enough to erase any impression that the previous few tracks might have made. ""What Chew Want"" features a Brooklynite named Tone Tank whose casual ethnic jokes and self-aware faux-stoopidity feel like he's aiming for white-dude <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27916-das-racist/"" target=""_blank"">Das Racist</a>, while recent Stones Throw signee Dave Dub carries over that ODB energy and grafts it with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2902-biz-markie/"" target=""_blank"">Biz Markie</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29-aesop-rock/"" target=""_blank"">Aesop Rock</a> on the woozy ""My Mantra"". Katalyst collaborator Coin Locker Kid shows up on three different tracks, and the impression the Fayetteville MC makes-- bundle-of-nerves crazy in 7/8 over ""Russia With Love"", arrogant velvet on ""The Beginning"", <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2838-mos-def/"" target=""_blank"">Mos Def</a>-as-Bobcat Goldthwait on ""Get Live""-- shows mere hints of what feels like a limitless reserve of strangeness.</p>
<p><i>Quakers</i> is kind of a mess, and odds are that a not-insignificant number of people are going to find the beats more consistently entertaining than the verses. (The CD version of the album includes a full instrumental version as a bonus disc, so no worries there, at least.) But ambitious messes are the best kind, and riding out the less-interesting moments is worth it in the long run. It's a sprawling, overstuffed deluge that feels longer than it is, but can't really be pared down or scrapped for parts. Best to just let it go start-to-finish and have its constant changes of scenery dart past until you can find something to linger on.</p></div>"|16464.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16464-quakers-st/|7.1|Nate Patrin

Around that time, in November 2009, Circle were playing shows with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2122-isis/"" target=""_blank"">Isis</a> as part of the L.A.-via-Boston post-metal band's final European tour; during this span of gigs Lehtisalo and Isis vocalist/guitarist Aaron Turner talked about starting a band. Samae Koskinen from one of Lehtisalo's projects Steel Mammoth joined the fold as bassist, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30256-split-cranium/"">Split Cranium</a> was born.</p>
<p>Even if you weren't aware of the origin tale, it would still be impossible to judge the quartet's self-titled debut as a straight-up collection of crust punk. Turner and Lehtisalo are both known for stretching and imploding genres, and as you might expect, this eight-song, 25-minute Kurt Ballou-produced ""LP"" isn't a spattering of your typical d-beat. We get three songs under two minutes and a few others only slightly longer, but we also get a layered eight-minute ""post-crust"" closer, the tellingly titled ""Retrace the Circle"", that goes out with a batch of meditative incanting and howling set to locked-in drums and feedback. It's as much heady, restive psychedelia as it is a punk rager.</p>
<p>There's that, but even when they're not pushing durational extremes, the band manages to incorporate unexpected twists: We get a straight-up ZZ Top ""Legs"" lick on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13207-tiny-me/"">""Tiny Me""</a>, Gregorian chants on ""Yellow Mountain"", ominous throat singing on ""Blossoms from Boils"", and more than a minute of <i>Metal Machine Music</i> on the brief anthem ""Black Binding Plague"", and, in the digital version, a remix of ""Sceptres to Rust"" by Portland-based electro-acoustic tweaker <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2889-daniel-menche/"" target=""_blank"">Daniel Menche</a>. And Turner has more control and variation in his howls than most folks in this situation, giving <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5631-disfear/"" target=""_blank"">Disfear</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/show-no-mercy/6815-show-no-mercy/"" target=""_blank"">Tomas Lindberg</a> a run for his money in the raw shredding, but also going for those clean, uplifting harmonies. Not that this is an experimental record: Those details surface alongside very catchy, speedy punk riffs (which are stellar throughout), chant-along group vocals, and rolling drums. It's old-school in spirit, new-school in execution.</p>
<p>A colleague of mine referred to the various unexpected bits as ""Motorhead-via-Hawkwind territory."" That makes a lot of sense, especially considering Lemmy's work in the two groups, and how hindsight offers overlaps for creative listeners. In that spirit, it's hard not to find Isis-like details here, to smile at a meta title like ""Retrace the Circle"". And, sure, when you have someone as high profile as Aaron Turner giving a go at ""underground"" crust, you're bound to get scene kids on the defensive. The thing is, Turner also gave an honest go at black metal in the super group <a href=""https://twitter.com/#!/brandonstosuy/statuses/13137361474"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Twilight</a>, handles experimental ambiance with his wife, pianist and artist <span class=""st"">Faith Coloccia,</span> as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26804-mamiffer/"" target=""_blank"">Mamiffer</a>, drifts into dark ambient/drone with <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pages/House-of-Low-Culture/109752899050706"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">House of Low Culture</a>, and runs two labels, Hydra Head and Mamiffer's imprint, SIGE. What we have here is a restless artist and mind, not an opportunist, and I think that spirit is part of what makes Split Cranium work as well as it does. And, fuck, on a more basic level, it's hard to be cynical when you're pumping your fist along to this stuff.</p></div>"|16494.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16494-split-cranium/|7.7|Brandon Stosuy

Their latest, the stellar <i>The Lost Entrance of the Just</i>, is (arguably) their 10th full-length album within a sea of (<a href=""http://www.discogs.com/artist/Circle+Of+Ouroborus"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">an estimated</a>) 30 releases. Rather than taking to the music press to explicate their strangely unstable mix of black-metal saturation, post-punk alienation, and pop magnetism, Circle of Ouroborus have simply allowed their voluminous output to weave its own web-like story. By rarely giving interviews and hopscotching between labels, they've avoided aligning themselves with any particular aesthetic framework. They've sounded loud, heavy, and mean or soft, disorienting, and almost amicable; on last year's quietly oppressive <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15815-eleven-fingers/"" target=""_blank""><i>Eleven Fingers</i></a>, they were all of those binaries at once. They've maintained mystery by simply putting out a diverse lot of records. By ignoring the tendency of contemporary bands to create a larger, sellable narrative, they've allowed the music itself to function as the hook.</p>
<p>Which is why it's worth noting that last month the great metal review-and-interview depot the Inarguable Magazine published <a href=""http://www.theinarguable.com/2012/03/skyline-painter-interview-with-circle.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a lengthy interview</a> with Klemi in advance of <i>The Lost Entrance of the Just</i>, the duo's second album for <a href=""http://www.handmadebirds.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Handmade Birds</a>, a sterling new American outlet of weird. Klemi addressed the lack of interviews, saying that the dearth was less about fostering wonder and more about saying something only when he had something to say: ""I want to challenge myself when I make interviews: if I don't have to ponder or even doubt my thoughts and doings, there isn't any use for writing answers that are just verbiage. (Self-) promotion hasn't ever been the goal in these interviews."" Klemi's other answers solved some logistical puzzles about the band's production and productivity; the music isn't released in the order in which it was recorded, for instance, and the band's constant wobble between sounds is less a piece of a broad plan and more a heuristic approach to making whatever seems most appropriate at the moment. </p>
<p>Mostly, though, Klemi's responses confirmed what Circle of Ouroborus' expansive catalog had long suggested: This band, its music, and its movement aren't meant for easy interpretation or classification. ""We throw different messages, visions, and feelings in the air and people pick their own from the flock-- in one form or another. How do they interpret our music and lyrics doesn't bother me at all,"" he said. ""This band is a tool and an opportunity to look this world and also myself from different angles."" That variegated approach aptly describes <i>The Lost Entrance of the Just</i>, a record that trades the relative frisson of black metal, post-punk, and pop for an amorphous and subtle union of gorgeousness and ghoulishness. From the warm keyboard wind intro of ""Ride the Wolf"" to the slow sublimation that ends <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13287-toivosta-syntynyt/"" target=""_blank"">""Toivosta Syntnyt""</a>, <i>The Lost Entrance</i> pushes the boundaries of pretty, brightening the corners of very dark music with a faded glow. ""The Way of the Will"", for instance, races from the gates like prototypical black metal. But like Klemi's serrated, Fenriz-like tone, the music is softened somehow, as though played and heard within a room of padded walls. The theme behind opener ""Cast in Clay"" seems sighed by keyboards and a chamber ensemble, breathing from the background as if it's an old jazz theme Philip Jeck mixed into one of his austere vinyl collages. </p>
<p>To an extent, that consistent feeling of immersion is a byproduct of the rudimentary writing and playing that's such a foundation of Circle of Ouroborus. Klemi told the Inarguable that he's not a musician, that he can't even tell when he's singing on or off key-- think Craig Finn, drunk on Mark E. Smith's blood. Atvar, he suggested, is the true musical mind behind the band. In truth, Atvar himself serves more as a role-player, meaning he's competent and functional but certainly limited. His drumbeats are crude, and his effects-laden riffs are simple themes that are deliberately played. That's actually an asset. Because nothing ever needs to leap forward from the mix, like a great guitar solo here or a masterful dream roll there, Circle of Ouroborus create a cradle for total absorption. That's certainly not a new element of this duo's music, but the perfectly gray metal of <i>The Lost Entrance</i> does it about as well as it's ever been done. It's a crypt meant for climbing inside.</p>
<p>""I am not one of those who seek only life,"" growls Klemi at the start of ""The Way of the Will"", this record's would-be single. ""Nor one of those obsessed with death."" That kernel of self-explanation serves as a fitting credo not only for <i>The Lost Entrance</i>, but also for Circle of Ouroborus as a whole. They are, after all, a band that has remained interesting across several dozens of quickly made, quickly sold-out releases by avoiding easy circumscription-- lyrically, stylistically or ideologically. In a market of one-sheets auto-posted to hundreds of music blogs, Circle of Ouroborus offers a proud, stubborn vortex of the undefined.</p></div>"|16490.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16490-the-lost-entrance-of-the-just/|8.2|Grayson Currin

""We got Sandy Bull on rhythm guitar (he whistles and impersonates the crowd's roars), we got Sandy Bull on bass, and Mr. Rhythm Ace playing the kick-ass drum part."" The crowd laughs, as no doubt the only sight is of Mr. Bull on his lonesome up on stage, with guitar, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oud"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">oud</a>, four-track machine, and the Rhythm Ace as accoutrement.</p>
<p>That his humor remains intact is evident, and as this rare concert document (rescued by <a href=""http://plasticcrimewave.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Steve Krakow</a> and released on his Galactic Zoo Disk label, an imprint of Drag City) can attest, Bull was physically intact in the 1970s as well. Much like the Kottke crowd on that night, you could be forgiven for thinking that Sandy Bull had already expired from a drug misadventure earlier in that decade. Although I already knew that Sandy Bull had passed away in the early 2000s, I mistakenly assumed that this live document would have shown Bull deep down in a hole. Aside from the unfocused and muddled 1972 studio album, <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/Sandy-Bull-Demolition-Derby/release/1536627"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Demolition Derby</i></a>, not a note of his had been recorded in that decade as he grappled with serious drug issues that irredeemably waylaid his promising career.</p>
<p>A contemporary of steel-string virtuosos like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1437-john-fahey/"" target=""_blank"">John Fahey</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4935-robbie-basho/"" target=""_blank"">Robbie Basho</a>, and Kottke, Bull's recorded work in the 1960s outstripped those of his peers for their singular vision and sense of adventure. Take <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3HuHV00DMI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Blend""</a>, the side-long tour de force from his 1963 debut,<span class=""apple-converted-space""> </span><a href=""http://www.discogs.com/Sandy-Bull-Fantasias-For-Guitar-And-Banjo/release/1921469"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Fantasias for Guitar and Banjo</i></a>. While his aforementioned peers navel-gazed and wove solo acoustic guitar music well into the 70s (though Fahey did take a few whimsical detours), Bull enlisted jazz drummer Billy Higgins for his first recording date. By that point in 1963, the crossover between folk and jazz was non-existent, the worlds of white and black barely engaged in dialogue. At that time, Higgins worked primarily with the likes of Donald Byrd and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/793-ornette-coleman/"" target=""_blank"">Ornette Coleman</a>, so it says something of Bull's adroit skills on acoustic guitar that he not only enlisted but matched Higgins' powerful and free rhythms note for note. For 10 minutes or so, Bull casts a spell on his steel-string, but when Higgins' toms thunder in, these two master musicians flash a level of telepathy that still astounds. Elsewhere, he fused banjo and ""Carmina Burana"" and juxtaposed Bach with Bo Diddley, Indian raga with the reverb of Roebuck ""Pops"" Staples. His subsequent records were diminishing returns as his drug use increased (and while it remains a bit of a mess, I have a soft spot for the writhing snakepit of sound that is his 1968 album, <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/Sandy-Bull-E-Pluribus-Unum/release/1488317"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>E Pluribus Unum</i></a>) before he dropped out altogether.</p>
<p>Unlike another posthumous live album of Bull's recorded in 1969 (opening for Fahey),<span class=""apple-converted-space""> </span><i>Live 1976</i><span class=""apple-converted-space""> </span>finds Bull in full command of his live setup, tape, and drum machines buoying his flights. His eight-minute oud improvisation is mesmeric, and on ""Driftin'"", he teases salsa rhythms out of an homage to doo-wop group the Drifters, all while garlanding steel guitar figures atop it. His vocal turn on <a href=""http://www.dragcity.com/products/sandy-bull-and-the-rhythm-ace-live-1976"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Love is Forever""</a> proves that for all of this instrumental prowess, none of the steel-stringers should have ever been let near a microphone.</p>
<p>And after an anecdote that somehow ties together rehab, snake farms, and masturbation, Bull snarls ""Swamp Music! Watch that gator!"" launching into a funky 9-minute improvisation that stomps through wetlands situated right near Sly Stone's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsZIsWMwoH0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Thank You for Talkin' to Me Africa""</a>. More laconic and distended cosmic slop follows on the closing ""New York City"", and as his set ends, Bull need not impersonate a roaring crowd; they're more than happy to oblige.</p></div>"|16473.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16473-live-1976/|7.6|Andy Beta

That line pops up on the first proper track of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30350-big-baby-gandhi/"" target=""_blank"">Big Baby Gandhi</a>'s <i>No1 2 Look Up 2</i>, and its impact is crucial for two reasons. The first is pretty obvious, but what's more interesting to me is who actually says it. Though <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27916-das-racist/"" target=""_blank"">Das Racist</a>'s Heems casually spits that aforementioned lyric on his guest verse, it's a heavy acknowledgment of the alienation that courses through everything his truly singular group does. Whether racially, culturally, or intellectually, Das Racist continually struggle with the ""otherness"" levied on them as rappers, as Americans and as human beings. So it's actually ironic that Gandhi's first Greedhead release takes its name from that line: Heems runs the label on which this is being released, and Das Racist are clearly role models for the 21-year old Queens MC.</p>
<p>After the ""once and never again"" listen of ""Long Ass Intro"", ""Blue Magic"" gives you an idea of what Das Racist see in Gandhi, as his flow is almost 100% influenced by that of their frequent collaborator <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29257-danny-brown/"" target=""_blank"">Danny Brown</a>. But where tracks like ""Power"" and ""The Last Huzzah"" showed Brown's livewire and Das Racist's deadpan styles deployed with equal skill, Gandhi flails for punchlines and gets calmly and completely overwhelmed by his mentors. Both Heems and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30151-kool-ad/"" target=""_blank"">Kool A.D.</a> have taken things to interesting places since <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15822-relax/"" target=""_blank""><i>Relax</i></a>, and this is the best they've sounded together on the same track since their unbeatable 2010 run. If not for Heems' repeating one of Gandhi's lines, you'd forget he actually showed up. ""All Over These Titties"" achieves the same result in a completely different way. Initially another display of Greedhead's weakness for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4159-spank-rock/"" target=""_blank"">Spank Rock</a>-style party rap, it instead becomes a showcase for chirpy no-hoper Chippy Nonstop and a warning that if crews are going to insist on having their own <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29697-kreayshawn/"" target=""_blank"">Kreayshawn</a>, they should at least be expected to come up with their own catchphrases. That Chippy seems to have picked her name simply to rhyme it with ""trippy mayne"" just makes you hope she doesn't have too many student loans.</p>
<p class=""p1"">For anyone who's doubted Das Racist's staying power, they now have a clear stylistic descendant-- although Gandhi mostly steamrolls his predecessors' idiosyncrasies by making his delivery louder, and more awkward. His lyrics tend to downplay the ""Wikipedia it if you didn't know it"" factor in exchange for plainspoken demands of blowjobs and beer, remaining heavy on sneaky ethnocentric volleys, homages to mid-1990s NYC rap, repetition and ""all that smart shit that's actually stupid."" That said, no amount of reverse psychology makes lines like ""call me gay rapper the way I get in that ass"" and ""I love you like a fat kid loves cake or how a lot of wack kids love... <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake/"" target=""_blank"">Drake</a>"" any less eye-rolling. And while he manages to tone down the nasal stridency that makes the Brown comparisons unavoidable, Gandhi is still locked into all-caps yelling sprees that run roughshod over the beats, showing little ear for flexibility, cadence or melody-- which is fairly strange since a lot of the production is his own. He's got plenty of work to do in that area too-- whether it's the <i>Big Willie Style­ </i>pop-rap of ""Boogie Nights"" or the Def Jux arrhythmia of ""Stack City"", you can immediately spot Gandhi's beats as the ones that sound like they were mastered on an laptop speakers.</p>
<p>The potential's there, though, and you can sense it particularly towards <i>No1</i>'s promising back half when Gandhi drops his implausible pose as a hip-hop savior and raps as himself-- an overstimulated yet bored young adult. It comes through when he guilelessly references how ""I'm a grown man, I cry my own tears/ Buy my own beers/ Drink my own beers,"" raps about being ignored by women of various races on various NYC subway lines (""Drink a Lil Pepsi""), and admits to the dangers posed by very real economic factors more pernicious than any pre-Giuliani bogeyman. Though nowhere near guys like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29952-mr-muthafuckin-exquire/"" target=""_blank"">Mr. Muthafuckin' eXquire</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29708-action-bronson/"" target=""_blank"">Action Bronson</a> in terms of skill, through equal parts self-loathing and self-deprecation, New York is similarly rendered as a shithole of dumpy apartments, racial misunderstanding, broke overachievers, and nonexistent opportunity. It's something that's fairly easy for anyone of a certain age to relate to, even before you take into account how it's compounded by Gandhi's ethnicity being lumped into a post-9/11 ""other"" if it's even acknowledged. As such, ""money on my mind"" tracks like ""Get $$$$"" and ""Post Nihilism"" have a grubby realness, as Gandhi acknowledges the incremental but important financial gains made by him and his family-- ""Used to be all sad because I had to wear a rag/ In trends I would lag/ My friends they would laugh/ Everybody copped prints all I had was a plaid."" Meanwhile, ""Eulogy"" might just be enough to redeem the entirety of <i>No1, </i>a staggering memorial for Gandhi's uncle where he tries to sort out complex feelings for a complex man whose deplorable actions had their own survivalist wisdom: ""If you was here right now/ You'd call me a bitch/ Like 'why you cryin' in front of all these people talkin' about your feelings and shit?'""</p>
<p class=""p1"">Moments like those feel like signs of a promising voice coming into his own, whereas obvious money shots like ""a long time ago I ain't even wanna flow/ My peoples gettin' locked up in Guantanamo/ My peoples still up in Guantanamo/ But I fell in love with the gold and designer clothes"" ring hollow. Granted, it's worth applauding any acknowledgment of the unyielding philosophies that spur the War on Terror, but context matters: Gandhi's been rapping since his teens and when you consider the anti-commercial<i> </i>prospects of <i>No1 </i>and the situation that allows him to make it, how are we supposed to get a real sense of conflict or compromise? Gandhi doesn't have the gravitas or platform to pull off that sort of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92FCRmggNqQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Diamonds From Sierra Leone""</a> bluster, so a simply rendered line like, ""When I was 16, I rhymed about society, poverty and other shit that bothered me/ Now all I know is no dough, I can't go to sleep,"" hits harder. </p>
<p class=""p1"">And ultimately, that's the sort of thing that hamstrings Gandhi. <span class=""s1""><a href=""http://thebrownnoise.posterous.com/the-brown-noise-interview-big-baby-gandhi-tal"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">When clarifying a harshly worded, still kinda vague line</a> from his <i>Big Fucking Baby </i>tape to the <i>Brown Noise </i>blog</span>, he said, ""It's a shot at the white rap journalists who are the biggest reinforcers of these stereotypes through their limited understanding of the culture and environments they write about."" White rap journalist or not, it's depressing to read these kind of things because this sort of attitude almost always stifles discussion rather than fostering understanding. But it's more depressing for someone who's in an expressive artform to preemptively shift the blame to the listener in case he can't get his point across. It's a shame too, since Gandhi does represent an interesting voice that deserves to be heard, and judging from <i>No1</i>, he's very much aware of <i>what</i> he wants to say. The problem is <i>how </i>he says it.</p>

Ward</a> record called <i>A Wasteland Companion</i>. The man's songs-- so deeply focused on God and faith and love and time and unspooling so steadily and reliably for more than a decade now-- can be especially useful when life feels bleak, lonely, or reduced to an irradiated landscape of smoldering ash-piles. What does not seem quite right is that this particular album is the one that has been given that particular name. Of all Ward's efforts, the one now called <i>A Wasteland Companion</i> actually seems the least interested in offering any kind of existential salve, largely too preoccupied with making sense of its own self to forge any bridges outward.</p>
<p>As always, these new songs <i>sound</i> immaculate. Divorced from all sense of the English language, listening to M. Ward is nowadays perhaps more deeply pleasurable than it ever has been, with glistening strings and big slabs of piano occupying more and more of the terrain once almost entirely populated by his nimble fingered guitar, trashcan percussion, and creaky room noises. Ward is almost more song stylist than a producer or arranger, taking bits and pieces from his attic stash of well cared-for musical props (blues, countrypolitan, AM pop) and situating them all just so within two to four minutes of sturdy square walls. And he generally knows, too, when to fully pare back to just his voice and a guitar (sometimes recorded so closely, in such fine fidelity, that the sound of his finger-flesh scraping the strings is audible, or at least easily imagined). Opener ""Clean Slate"" (with its dedication ""to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/534-big-star/"" target=""_blank"">Alex</a> [Chilton] and El Goodo"") and the too-brief title track are enough to make you think maybe he doesn't need much else.</p>
<p>A couple of tracks tread further into the unusually giddy territory of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11081-never-had-nobody-like-you/"" target=""_blank"">""Never Had Nobody Like You""</a> from his 2009 release <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12681-hold-time/"" target=""_blank"">Hold Time</a></i>, an original that sniped a riff from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3941-steely-dan/"" target=""_blank"">Steely Dan</a> and, with a glittery, glam-rock smear, marked one of the more overtly poppy moments in Ward's catalog. ""Sweetheart"", approximately the 97th <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2202-daniel-johnston/"" target=""_blank"">Daniel Johnston</a> cover Ward has committed to tape, slides in after the urgently surreal ""Me and My Shadow"", shattering the crushing gloom with randy drums and piano ribbons, jumpy handclap breaks, and a slight clutch of reverb-laden <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6017-zooey-deschanel/"" target=""_blank"">Zooey Deschanel</a> cooing the refrain. (There's something to be said about Ward's attraction to both Johnston and Deschanel as lyricists-- about the overlapping tendencies of their generally earnest, sweetly clunky lines and their respective brands of wide-eyed wonder, which come from such different places but which are regularly funneled through Ward into songs often deeply charming and occasionally quite moving.) After ""Sweetheart"" comes a cover of old tango standard ""I Get Ideas"", on which Ward splits the difference between <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23497-peggy-lee/"" target=""_blank"">Peggy Lee</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/132-louis-armstrong/"" target=""_blank"">Louis Armstrong</a>'s respective takes by throwing in some flailing drums, a grimy rockabilly guitar break, and backing vocals from Rachel Cox of Brooklyn folk-rock resuscitators <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3210-oakley-hall/"" target=""_blank"">Oakley Hall</a>. Her delivery is distant and just biting enough to easily imagine her as the object of said ideas, sweetly playing along but rolling her eyes when Ward scampers off to collect their one soda/two straws at the sock-hop concession stand.</p>
<p>That <i>Wasteland</i>'s two covers, both chipper dalliances in puppy love, are slotted back-to-back so early on is one of a few oddities of sequencing and arc that plague the record. Twinkling lead single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13199-primitive-girl/"" target=""_blank"">""Primitive Girl""</a>, a good-natured but head-scratching ode to some manic pixie dream girl just doing her own entirely unspecified thing (""She don't like to boast/ From her natural head, to her natural toes""), is stitched together with a trembling, seemingly unrelated coda about staring down disaster; a meandering outro is pinned onto the waif of a title track, too, a hovering string patch drawn out over a distant sample of crowd noise. That leads into the weird, blighted moment that is ""Watch the Show"", on which Ward sings as a disgruntled, lower-rung TV station employee, one Billy R. Boroughs (no relation to William S.), who hijacks himself some airtime to dole out a mess of ominously non-specific threats. Buroughs doesn't seem to have a beef with the one percent or the soul-crushing mechanizations of the mainstream media or anyone, really, despite originating in a cultural moment that would most certainly sympathize if he did. He just kinda hates his job and doesn't really like how his life's turned out. ""Tomorrow on your way into work, who'll be wearing the emperor's clothes?"" he leers, voice dripping with all the portent of a sophomore film-studies major who just watched <i><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074958/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Network</a></i> for the first time. The overblown self-importance is abetted by rubbery layers of acoustic and electric guitar and hollow, militaristic drums (delivered by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3872-sonic-youth/"" target=""_blank"">Sonic Youth</a>'s Steve Shelley, though you'd hardly know).</p>
<p>The three songs that come next each mine bungled connections-- a continental divide, a desperate introduction, a wild goose flown-- and are lovely enough, contemplative, and well-considered. ""Crawl After You"" is especially fine, a restrained piano lope that blooms into dizzying waltz and gets spiked with an electric-guitar scorch at just the last second. But then ""Pure Joy"", the album closer, sounds exhausted, like a 5K jogger dragging himself to the finish line, relishing the moment of collapse before bare knees scrape the blacktop: ""Ain't no other way to say just what this feeling is/ Pure joy, pure joy, pure joy,"" Ward sighs away the album's final lines. On his previous releases, graceful final tracks have been named ""Outro"" and ""Afterword""; this one might as well be called ""Eh, I Give Up (Maybe I Should've Just Made an EP)"".</p>
<p>Thinking about<i> A Wasteland Companion</i> and its title, the idea of desert-island discs comes to mind. Music fans still bat around this hypothetical to distract from the terrifying fact that if you were ever really marooned-- on an island, in a fallout shelter, wherever-- you wouldn't have any say in who or what you're stuck with, let alone the soundtrack of all your lonely days to come. What you'd really have would be some slapdash amalgam of humanity, assembled by chance and nothing more, the best and worst parts of your fellow survivors all immediately and painfully present, immutable and magnified by proximity and lack of all other options. So maybe the name is perfect after all.</p></div>"|16460.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16460-a-wasteland-companion/|6.3|Rachael Maddux

Violet Clark is more explicit about her work with husband Frank Black. Describing the difference between their first two records collaborating as <a href=""http://grandduchymusic.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Grand Duchy</a>, she explains ""if <i>Petit Fours </i>was missionary, <i>Let the People Speak </i>needs to be doggystyle."" Point taken, but mind you this is a record meant for public consumption and money that could otherwise be spent on beer and shoes, not illicitly acquired boudoir photography. So I don't think I'm casting aspersions on the domestic life of Black and Clark by saying that even if <i>Let the People Speak </i>feels utterly passionless and perfunctory, it doesn't even qualify as masturbation-- they certainly don't sound like <i>they're </i>enjoying it.</p>
<p>Forgive me for the vulgarity; the mind tends to wander during this thing. With its 15 tracks clocking in at over an hour, <i>Let the People Speak </i>is either utterly unconscionable in its length or laughably and endearingly audacious in the way Lil B mixtapes are. Either way, it<i> </i>certainly gives you plenty of opportunities to wrangle with its intentions without any strong hooks or riffs bugging you. At least it's somewhat conceptual: As with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6606-songs-for-the-deaf/"" target=""_blank"">Queens of the Stone Age's <i>Songs For the Deaf</i></a>, <i>Let the People Speak </i>is arranged like a radio rock block, interrupted by fake callers who exclaim, ""I love the Grand Duchy,"" in terrible European accents and interstitial jabber courtesy of Phoenix DJ Jonathan L that ranges from NPR-droll non sequitur to baffling song-specific commentary. The dime-thin disco of ""Silver Boys"" puts him in ""a Warhol-esque kind of mood,"" even though I swear there's a Bloodhound Gang song I can't immediately recall that that sounds just like it-- I can't tell whether it's more embarrassing if L is being serious or if he's joking.</p>
<p>I'm sure it was fun to plan out, but the formatting generates an ironic heft as <i>People </i>trudges forward. Combining granule-free guitar distortion, Clark's half-sassed vocals, and ""electronica"" touches wholly uninformed by actual electronic music, Grand Duchy is essentially a later Buzz Bin revivalist act-- a substitute for any number of bands who'd sign to Lava or Sony 550, have a cute <a href=""http://www.mvdbase.com/tech.php?last=Kohr&amp;first=Mark"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mark Kohr-directed video</a>, and namedrop Pixies as an influence in interviews despite having learned nothing from them. Though melodically and rhythmically deficient, most of the Clark-fronted songs are still technically ""dance rock"" in the same manner Republica were, and if the bullish insistence of ""See-Thru You"" and ""Geode"" manage a fraction of ""Ready to Go""'s licensing legs, more power to them. ""White Out"" has a decent shot if there are music coordinators out there who haven't already passed on the last three Metric albums, since it's the most uptempo thing here and I have an inkling it might be about cocaine as a social lubricant. It's catchy enough before Clark spends its last minute and a half chanting, ""go get the white out!"" ad nauseum like a college girl who could not be more proud of her own drug euphemism.</p>
<p>Taking his snoozier solo material into account, I'm not gonna act like Black could've saved this by exerting his will as more than just a capable rhythm guitarist. Not when he makes an ""appearance"" and little else on the songs he fronts. Right around the midpoint of his Magnetic Fields karaoke on ""Annie Bliss"", <i>Let the People Speak </i>feels fucking endless and you're no more comforted by seeing the seven-minute runtime of ""Dark Sparkles and the Beat"" lying immediately in wait. Meanwhile, Black sounds more like himself on the junkyard blues of ""Shady"", but still mostly like Patton Oswalt's Tom Waits impression: ""I knew a guy named Drew/ Who had a friend named Katie/ And they were made in the shade/ Because they were shady, shady, shady, shady."" That's when the cowbell comes in. Look, there are worse crimes than making a boring alt-tronica record, but if you're responsible for <i>Doolittle </i>and <i>Surfer Rosa </i>and <i>Trompe Le Monde, </i>you're beholden to a certain set of expectations. If this is the music he's inspired to make with the people he loves, I'll stick with the music he made with people he hated.</p></div>"|16488.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16488-grand-duchy-let-the-people-speak/|3.8|Ian Cohen

But the rising D.C. rapper is blessed with a classic ""Fat Guy"" personality, at least as defined by decades of frat-boy comedy stereotypes: On record, he comes off as generous, irrepressible, self-deprecating, and instantly likeable. With his big smile full of broken teeth, mangy facial hair, and scraggly dreadlocks, Trel cuts a memorable figure, and seems to know it: Like Rick Ross, he <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-TPqz-gNL0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">usually</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2jH7fqu7cU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">appears</a> in <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcq3VC1GmCQ&amp;feature=fvst"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">videos</a> shirtless. Also like Rick Ross, he pumps his music with an enormous sense of gusto, as if gangsta rap were an extended buffet and he were planning to plow right through it. You can practically hear him licking his chops before beginning a verse.</p>
<p>He is the polar opposite, in other words, of D.C.'s <i>other</i> hometown hero, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10147-wale/"" target=""_blank"">Wale</a>, despite having spent a year or two on Wale's Board Administration label. Wale is the type who could find things to grouse about in a VIP lounge; Fat Trel, meanwhile, remains a sunny presence even when he's talking about crushing your kneecaps. Trel released a slew of mixtapes, including high-water marks <i>No Secrets</i> and <i>April Foolz</i>, that mixed some local-D.C. flavors-- woodblocks and congos in the music, intensely regional references in the lyrics-- into standard street-rap songs, and then spiced them with his happily libidinous personality. Here's a typical Fat Trel line, from the otherwise-routine ""girl-at-a-club"" song ""Angel"": ""When I met her she was dancing/ I was prancing around with a drink in my hand, all handsome."" Trel's a guy who raps very often, and graphically, about visiting personal violence upon you: he is also perfectly willing to depict himself, on record, as ""prancing.""</p>
<p>Now that Trel has done what breakout stars inevitably do-- separating from Board Administration, striking out on his own-- his career is approaching the precarious divide separating hometown hero from national presence. In between these two points lays a chasm of mortification and pain: We watched Wale flail through this gauntlet for four years before he recovered his footing, utterly transformed, as a member of Rick Ross' Maybach Music Group. Trel's latest mixtape, <i>Nightmare on E Street</i>, bears some of the worrying marks of encroaching industry bullshit: a guest appearance by Diddy indentured servant and NYC-rap non-entity Red Cafe, for instance, a sure sign of major-label favor trading. But by and large, <i>Nightmare</i> is another generous helping of what made Trel noticeable in the first place.</p>
<p>For one, Trel remains a spectacular rapper, with a full and chesty voice and an elastic, invigorating delivery. You can hear him relishing the sound of his words: he's a great savorer of plosives, and his verses snap hard with internal rhythms: ""Whippin it, baggin it, paper bag magic,"" goes the hook to ""Paper Bag Magic"", and to hear him utter this phrase just once is to feel it tattooed indelibly on your cortex. His ear for hooks is like that, and his fondness for chewy word sounds makes his verses almost as memorable. On ""Geetchie"" and the lurching ""Deep in the Game"", Trel's perpetual-motion flow lands unerringly on every sharp consonant, giving the impression of a Gucci Mane suddenly and miraculously cured of mush-mouth.</p>
<p>He is also savvy about splitting the tape's production between new names and the team who helped define his sound. He picks an uncharacteristically menacing beat from Big K.R.I.T. for ""Swishers and Liquor"", for instance, one that sounds like it would otherwise be more at home on a Juicy J tape, but also makes sure to make room for a beat from the D.C. production duo and old collaborators the Basshedz for ""On Top of Your Girl"". ""Deep in the Game"", from French Montana's secret-weapon producer Harry Fraud, strings a chopped-up Rick Rossbellow over some queasily burbling guitars. On tape highlight ""Devil We Like"", everything comes together: a mournful, muted beat produced by Boss Major; a wry sung chorus (""We pray to God, but it's the devil we like"") and crisp, economical rapping: ""what you takin' home with you tonight, your life or your fleece?"" he demands. It's one of the best, most distinctive songs Trel's yet made, and it's comforting. Trel's alluded to the fact that an infusion of major-label money made some of the higher-profile guests on <i>Nightmare</i> possible. Hopefully, he'll manage to continue spending corporate money as wisely in the future as he does here.</p></div>"|16482.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16482-fat-trel-nightmare-on-e-street/|7.4|Jayson Greene

Rather, the most visible of the contemporary torch-bearers have subjected that classic pop sensibility to corrupting influences: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27600-dum-dum-girls/"" target=""_blank"">Dum Dum Girls</a> toughen it up with a 1970s CBGB spirit, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19442-vivian-girls/"" target=""_blank"">Vivian Girls</a> smother it in the the haze of C86-era indie, while <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28665-cults/"" target=""_blank"">Cults</a> play up the connection between booming <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-0upHlWfQ4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Be My Baby""</a> kick drums and hip-hop breaks. Vancouver's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30048-chains-of-love/"" target=""_blank"">Chains of Love</a>, however, present no such immediately differentiating characteristic or subversive streak. Their press materials drop names like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/853-the-cramps/"" target=""_blank"">the Cramps</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2186-the-jesus-and-mary-chain/"" target=""_blank"">Jesus and Mary Chain</a>, but punk rock and transgressive noise terrorism aren't really part of their program. What they offer instead is a faithful, playful recreation of familiar period details: reverb-heavy guitar jangle, snake-like tambourine rattles, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgfnCTp3p7U"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">? and the Mysterians-style organ doodles</a>, Motown basslines, and, yes, more blatant appropriations of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzhbGaCwBzs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the greatest percussive intro in pop history</a>.</p>
<p>Chains of Love do filter these sounds through proudly grimy production-- courtesy of guitarist Felix Fung, the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Diamond_(music_producer)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jim Diamond</a>/<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liam_Watson_(record_producer)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Liam Watson</a> of the Vancouver garage-rock scene-- though that simply serves to enhance, rather than undercut, the band's retro qualities. Instead of approximating the cathedral-sized grandeur of a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8663-phil-spector/"" target=""_blank"">Phil Spector</a> single, <i>Strange Grey Days</i> imagines what it sounds like to hear one blasting out of a cheap transistor radio on a hot August night in 1965. But while the scruffy surface may lend <i>Strange Grey Days</i> the patina of a dust-covered, decades-old, crate-digger find, it doesn't provide the best showcase for vivacious vocalist Nathalia Pizarro, the undeniable focal point of their live shows and, as such, the person in the best position to distinguish Chains of Love from the 60s-throwback pack.</p>
<p>As <i>Strange Grey Days</i> illustrates, Pizarro can cover the full emotional terrain of girl-group pop, as she (with the able assistance of guitarist/partner-in-harmony Rebecca Marie Law Gray) convincingly embodies the many shades of desire, from territorial possessiveness (the seething standout ""All the Time"") to post-break-up longing (""I'd Rather Be Crying"") to vengeful accusation (""Lies Lies Lies""). But the four-track fidelity and crowded mix don't give her the space to fully command your attention as she does in concert; hearing Pizarro trying to assert herself amid the relentless drum fills and omnipresent organ blare of ""He's Leaving With Me"", it feels as if Chains of Love are batting their clean-up hitter in the number six slot.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the last song here offers up some breathing room. In the same fashion that the Dum Dum Girls' closed out their rough'n'tumble 2010 full-length debut, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14054-i-will-be/"" target=""_blank""><i>I Will Be</i></a>, with a downcast cover of Sonny &amp; Cher's ""Baby Don't Go"", the otherwise feisty <i>Strange Grey Days </i>signs off with its atypically haunting eponymous track, a chilly, piano-led ballad on which Pizarro and Gray's vacant voices ominously summon the grim titular weather forecast. It is, of course, too soon to say whether the song constitutes a one-off digression or a gateway to more exploratory mode of songwriting, but it's a promising sign that Chains of Love aren't afraid to break free of their well-worn aesthetic.</p></div>"|16485.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16485-chains-of-love/|6.6|Stuart Berman

On <i>Rock and Roll Night Club</i>, he gets weirder and churns out an unsettling brand of soft rock. Take the album's second track: ""You're rockin' straight through midnight with me, Dojo Daniel, on 96.7: The Pipe. Up next, we've got a triple shot of Mac DeMarco comin' at ya, <i>stuffin' it down the chute</i>."" That skit is delivered by an unsettling, near-demonic voice. It's a jokey moment, but it plays an unexpectedly crucial role for the rest of the EP: It makes the rest of the songs sound comparatively not-creepy. With vaguely grimy imagery like ""standing on the corner/ Tryin' to keep it clean,"" delivered in his deep, breathy, sleazy voice, it's easy to get weirded out by the album's focal point, which is DeMarco. But stacked against a fictional DJ saying ""stuffin' it down the chute"" in an even deeper, even sleazier voice? DeMarco goes from being the sleaziest guy in the room to an outright Lothario.</p>
<p>Obviously, the tone here is both goofy and surreal if <i>Night Club</i> can support a creepy DJ skit near the beginning of the album. That weirdness also spills over into his lyrics. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12934-babys-wearin-blue-jeans/"" target=""_blank"">""Baby's Wearin' Blue Jeans""</a> has DeMarco fixated on a woman specifically because of her pants, namedropping both Wrangler and Lee in the process. ""Straight leg or a boot cut/ I'm begging darling please/ Stay with me forever/ And don't take off those jeans."" His smoky voice and denim infatuation is complemented by an echoing, light guitar, which throws in a surprisingly welcome yacht rock aesthetic.</p>
<p>Sometimes, it's difficult to parse his irony from his sincerity, especially in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/tv/musicvideos/1890-shes-really-all-i-need/"" target=""_blank"">""She's Really All I Need""</a>, which mixes <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Partridge_Family"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Partridge Family</a> optimism with harsh realities. (""I feel like I'm dying"" and ""Don't bring me down man/ Wearin' that frown man."") It's probably safe to assume that at least 80% of <i>Night Club</i> is laced with a meta joke that nobody's in on except DeMarco. It's usually still pretty funny, or in the very least, intriguingly odd.</p>
<p>He's got a good ear for hooks, too. Behind the hazy, warbling sound quality of the title track, ""Blue Jeans"", and ""European Vegas"", there are some excellent, albeit simplistic, guitar hooks. For songs with a fairly limited set of instrumentation-- one guitar, minimal percussion, a quiet undercurrent of bass, the occasional second guitar-- he pulls out some lovely, shimmering melodies. On the same coin, every now and then, he pushes one hook way too far. ""Moving Like Mike"" is the worst offender, and not only for its <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0308506/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lil' Bow Wow-reminiscent title</a>. The song just repeats the same three phrases over an uninspired Jimmy Buffett acoustic guitar riff.</p>
<p>The biggest surprise comes at the end of the album with ""Only You"" (which is lifted from Makeout Videotape's <a href=""http://makeoutvideotape.bandcamp.com/album/ying-yang"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Ying Yang</i></a>) and ""Me &amp; Mine"", the pair presenting an entirely different aesthetic than the sleazefest that dominates the record's first half. They introduce a jangling, breezy assertiveness that's normally reserved for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27602-real-estate/"" target=""_blank"">Real Estate</a> songs. Gone is the deep voiced, jean-focused weirdo from 20 minutes earlier. Here's a guy who's singing in a sincere-sounding pained falsetto over sunny guitars. One song earlier in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13135-im-a-man/"" target=""_blank"">""I'm a Man""</a>, he sang, ""I've been creepin' around"" in his go-to lower register. On ""Only You"", he asserts, ""Here I am, brand new day,"" and he sounds like a new man.</p>
<p>It's tough to say which DeMarco is preferable: the swooning clear-eyed baritone of the last two songs or the unsettling deep-voiced emoter of the first eight. Really, I'm a fan of both versions-- the goofy creep and the straightforward crooner. Ultimately, even if one side's more of a caricature, it's a relatively short jump between the DeMarco who sings that ""the boogie woogie woman keeps lookin' my way"" and the DeMarco who sings, ""I'm done crying over her.""</p></div>"|16476.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16476-rock-and-roll-night-club/|7.2|Evan Minsker

It certainly wasn't with the notion of breaking into her hometown's music scene-- in Athens, Ala., there's not much of one to break into. So she and her friends Steve Johnson, Zac Cockrell, and Heath Fogg made do playing cover-band gigs in dive bars, occasionally slipping their raggedy garage-soul originals in among the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2439-led-zeppelin/"" target=""_blank"">Led Zeppelin</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22438-acdc/"" target=""_blank"">AC/DC</a>, and eventually making enough to warrant some studio time up in Nashville early last year. Those sessions produced the 11 tracks of Alabama Shakes' debut LP, <i>Boys &amp; Girls</i>, which they shopped around for a while and finally released on <a href=""http://atorecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ATO</a> (<a href=""http://www.roughtraderecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rough Trade</a> in the UK) this week.</p>
<p>Things are now moving fast: The band has hit the late-night TV circuit, they followed <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/45758-report-fiona-apple-at-sxsw/"" target=""_blank"">Fiona Apple's headlining slot</a> at NPR's big <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/festivals/sxsw/2012/3/"" target=""_blank"">SXSW</a> showcase last month, their upcoming shows are almost entirely sold-out, and they've been booked as openers for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4638-jack-white/"" target=""_blank"">Jack White</a>'s spring solo tour.</p>
<p>Of course, because Alabama Shakes boast these fairly aw-shucks origins, lyrics that seem deeply felt, multiple sonic reference points predating 1975, an affinity for analog, and more than one guitar, by default they've been thrown like chum into the shark tank that is ""real music,"" where fans and critics with false memories of rock's pure and noble past-- and others with aversions to earnest craft both feigned and actual-- gnash out their differences.</p>
<p>But engaging with these paranoid extremes bypasses the whole middle swath of the matter-- the weird, beautiful part, where all the blood and guts are. Here's what seems real enough to me: <i>Boys &amp; Girls</i> is a solid debut, really good but not earth-shifting, a record clearly (blessedly) recorded before anyone much cared who they were or weren't, possibly even before they were entirely sure themselves.</p>
<p>The album is largely confessional-- not in the singer/songwritery sense, but in that it's riddled with admissions that probably wouldn't have been made by any other means, words that feel lighter sung than spoken. Album opener and lead single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/tv/musicvideos/1937-hold-on/"" target=""_blank"">""Hold On""</a>, its central guitar riff ribboning and pooling like slow-poured honey, is the first of many tracks where it's not entirely clear if Howard is singing to, about, or as herself, God, or some boy as she rips through the chorus: ""Yeah, you got to wait/ But I don't want to wait!"" ""I feel so homesick/ Where is my home?"" Howard wonders on <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNxWyVAtBiU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Rise to the Sun""</a> before the song dips into a coda of timorous guitar and crashing drums. On the shadowy, fingersnapped <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZioAZ83hv4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Goin' to the Party""</a> she sings about running around town, getting wasted, and taking care of some drunk boy; when she woozily coos, ""gotta take me back now, I'm still somebody's daughter,"" she sounds half-annoyed and half-comforted in that very particular way that comes from being young and restless and knowing there's someone waiting up for you, but at least there's someone waiting up for you.</p>
<p>Howard's pain feels raw, but like it won't always be-- as if once these first scrapes heal, her skin will be good and tough, but right now they smart like hell. ""Heartbreaker"" is staggering, gut-punched, a shiny organ weeping and straining away as she laments, ""Oh, I wanted to grow old with you/ You told me so, but then you go/ How was I supposed to know?"" But later on the slow-boiling <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yq9wIb0AKg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Be Mine""</a> she's regained her footing-- she's direct, nearly petulant: ""If they wanna fight/ They done started fucking with the wrong heart."" Three minutes in the song shifts focus to a single demand, Howard crowing and screaming, ""Be my baby, be my baby!"" over and over as the band spins out, crashing and bumping, then circles back home as she loosens into a string of cries and hoots.</p>
<p>Live, Howard often plants her feet flat onstage before bellowing out a line, as if bracing herself against the force of what's to come, and it's easy to imagine her doing that in the studio, too. Most of the time there's a payoff, but sometimes the build-up dwarfs the delivery, her voice coming out thinner and tighter than you'd expect; maybe she needs a vocal coach, or just a little more time to work out exactly how those pipes of hers like best to blow. For now, though, flashes of more contemporary analogs (Macy Gray, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5185-amy-winehouse/"" target=""_blank"">Amy Winehouse</a>) swirled in among the more obvious classic-soul vocal touchstones keep her Janis Joplin tendencies from curdling into <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackie_Jormp-Jomp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Jackie Jormp-Jomp""</a>.</p>
<p><i>Boys &amp; Girls </i>was recorded live in the studio, but the power of the band's stage show hasn't fully carried over-- at times their delivery also seems thin and tight. Perhaps it's a matter of timing, the number and profile and intensity of the gigs the band has played in recent months solidifying their groove to a degree that outstrips what they were capable of throwing down on tape this time last year. Or maybe it's the production-- a little muddled, and not always in the cozy, old-school way they may have been going for. So many bands get churned out of the hype machine seeming either too fully formed or too ephemeral to get attached to, but Alabama Shakes have sparked, in me at least, a degree of ownership, and one that urges, ""work with Jack White."" Maybe sometime this summer, after the tour, he could work his analog-only magic and coax some big, crunching, whalloping mess out of them--something to ensure they get to stick around for a while, and on their own terms: weird, sweaty, desirous.</p></div>"|16479.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16479-boys-and-girls/|7.8|Rachael Maddux

What seems thrilling and new one moment will be inherently familiar and maybe even boring the next."" That's Mike Powell, fielding a reader-submitted question regarding musical progression and innovation from Pitchfork's new mailbag feature, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/inbox/8795-the-curious-case-of-lil-b/?utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=ticker&amp;utm_name=features"" target=""_blank"">Inbox</a>. Thanks in large part to the internet, the hype cycle's velocity can be so oppressive, mere curiosities can <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/04/fashion/Seapunk-a-Web-Joke-With-Music-Has-Its-Moment.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">morph into punchlines</a> literally overnight. And while many artists have made not only careers but some truly memorable and exciting music, too, by staying in their respective, unchanging lanes, those riding the crests of new waves are usually placed under more scrutiny. And once that wave has crashed, your best bet is to make like a shark, remaining in constant motion in order to survive.</p>
<p>Christopher Dexter Greenspan, the San Francisco producer who records as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28736-ooooo/"" target=""_blank"">oOoOO</a> almost automatically has some scrutiny reserved for him right off the bat. Lumped in with the burgeoning witch-house trend of a few years ago, his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14674-ooooo-ep/"" target=""_blank"">self-titled debut EP</a> managed to skirt some of those still amorphous genre restraints of the time that his peers inevitably fell victim to. To use another time-honored animal metaphor, Greenspan is a bit like the frog in the pot: Tossed into the boiling water, he was smart enough to hop right out and carve a more unique path for himself, where unluckier zeitgeist chasers testing the still-lukewarm waters were unwittingly cooked as the temperature slowly rose. Some members of the Drag Class of 2010 managed to leap even further and more quickly, evidenced in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28640-balam-acab/"" target=""_blank"">Balam Acab</a>'s aquatic, glowing odyssey of a second album, 2011's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15766-wander-wonder/"" target=""_blank""><i>Wander / Wonder</i></a>. With the <i>Our Love Is Hurting Us</i> EP, the second oOoOO release to date in almost as many years, Greenspan has a chance to make a similar leap to try and revitalize or recontextualize his eclectic, seductive spook-outs. But where <i>oOoOO</i> felt fresh and ahead of the curve thanks to its pop gestures and nods to contemporary urban music, <i>Our Love Is Hurting Us</i> has more in common with the boiled frog than many had hoped.</p>
<p>By almost all accounts, <i>Our Love Is Hurting Us</i> is almost completely indistinguishable from <i>oOoOO</i>. And when you're offering less than 18 minutes of new music after almost two years of silence, the problem kind of speaks for itself. Greenspan's formula remains unchanged: Ghosted vocal warps, doom-y ambience, and hip-hop- and R&amp;B-indebted rhythms all swirled together with the intent to create something sexy and secretive. He's still good with drum programming (note the percussive sharpenings of a rusty sword on opener ""TryTry"") and the occasional detail (like the guitar-solo-in-the-driving-rain on ""Starr""), but these five songs are so closely tied to the material on this previous EP, you wonder why he simply didn't glue the two together and make a proper album. Here, it seems that Greenspan's only approach was to ensure that his established sound remain unfettered. Instead of focusing on refinement, he's begun to suffocate himself by way of replication.</p>
<p>Obviously, what Greenspan was flirting with on his debut was beholden to a certain time, and at that time, he managed to separate himself from the pack by implementing a refreshing set of outside influences, ranging from trap-centric Southern rap to lullabied R&amp;B ballads and world music signifiers. However, in his absence, reconstituting stitches of R&amp;B and hip-hop has become almost de rigueur for up-and-coming producers from all walks. He might be a victim of circumstance, but the staleness of these tracks can't be chalked up to a sort of right place/ wrong time scenario. You can actually hear snippets of what sounds like Mariah Carey's voice arbitrarily spliced into ""Starr"", and that might even be Ashanti on ""TryTry"".</p>
<p>In the case of both applications, you might think that Greenspan is trying to play catch-up, highlighting the trendier and more rhythmic facets of his personality to remain relevant in an ever-crowding marketplace. But for an EP as flat and, well, just plain <i>stuck</i> as <i>Our Love Is Hurting Us</i> sounds, playing catch-up would've been preferable to taking a promising but not wholly memorable debut and simply offering it up a second time, in hopes that it might have a better chance to thrive in a more hospitable, less saturated climate. With this in mind, it's probably best not to close things with a track titled <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13086-nowayback-ft-butterclock/"" target=""_blank"">""NoWayBack""</a>, because in the case of <i>Our Love Is Hurting Us</i>, backward is unfortunately the only direction the oOoOO project seems to have in its sights.</p></div>"|16462.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16462-ooooo-our-love-is-hurting-us-ep/|5.7|Zach Kelly

Drawing on the music of the U.S., UK, and Jamaica, this music can lean in a number of directions, from the laid-back reggae of Caroll Thompson's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtpGzzDsRK4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Sing me a Love Song""</a> to a track like <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRj9RSpXQHo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""All Night Long""</a>, a Mary Jane Girls cover by La Famille that's driven by an R&amp;B beat.</p>
<p><i>Harmony, Melody and Style</i>, a new compilation on <a href=""http://www.souljazzrecords.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Soul Jazz</a>, showcases this music, that of the first generations of British West Indians, many of whose parents had crossed the Atlantic, stepping off the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MV_Empire_Windrush"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Empire Windrush</a> to look for work in post-war England. Whereas reggae soundtracked the post-independence years in Jamaica, it was lovers rock that provided romantic respite from the racial tensions, riots, and oppression of the 70s and 80s in the UK. The voices of young women like Mark dominated the genre, reflected in this 25-track, 2xCD compilation, which contains but five songs voiced by men.</p>
<p>Soul Jazz has released a number of excellent collections-- helping to illustrate narratives in particular types of music by providing valuably comprehensive and illuminating context.<span class=""apple-converted-space""> </span><i>Harmony</i><span class=""apple-converted-space""> </span>is no exception. There's over 40 pages of liner notes penned by label boss Stuart Baker, complete with interviews and photos that reach back to the 50s, setting the stage and moving through to the mid 80s. Each page illustrates elements of the rise of lovers rock in sound system culture while at the same time discussing the realities of racism in Britain.</p>
<p>The notes feature first-person accounts from producers like second generation British Jamaican <a href=""http://www.anthonybrightly.com/Anthony_Sir_George_Brightly/Welcome.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Anthony Brightly</a> and legendary UK sound system boss <a href=""http://current.com/entertainment/88952327_sir-lloydie-coxsone-speaking-about-himself-and-the-1st-uk-reggae-heritage-awards-presentation-2008.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lloydie Coxsone</a>. They explain their desire to please audiences with the kind of creative and unique selections for which the Jamaican sound system tradition was known, and with which the kind of lovers rock that grew out of Britain was directly associated. Reggae artists had long covered love songs, and from as far back as the 50s, Jamaican figureheads such as rivals <a href=""http://vimeo.com/28686029"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Count C</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_Reid"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Duke Reid</a> appropriated U.S. R&amp;B into their own material. The liner notes also provide intriguing background information on vocalists Louisa Mark, <a href=""http://www.janetkay.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Janet Kay</a>, and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carroll_Thompson"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Caroll Thompson</a>, providing insight into how this music was made especially for soundsystem play, with producers seeking out girls with the kind of voices that could capture the experience of young love.</p>
<p>This is important, as lovers rock is not ""message music"" in the outward sense. Beyond the empowerment of Kofi's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFilXgf3PiQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Black Pride""</a>, the songs on Soul Jazz's set are distinguished by lyrics of longing, loss, and heartbreak; the smooth vocals and rhythms are perfect for close proximity couples' dancing and synchronized hip sway. In Menelik Shabazz's 2011 documentary <a href=""http://www.bfi.org.uk/live/video/657"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>The Story of Lover's Rock</i></a>, the explanation for this ever-so-slow slow dancing has to do with the shift from the outdoor parties possible in Jamaican climes to the indoor dances and house gatherings necessary in the chilly UK. But in this celebration of human connection there's the palpable message that if solace and unity can be found in the dance, maybe it might also be available in society. Tracks like <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=banitPdvpTw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Feel No Way""</a> by sugar-voiced Janet Kay and the <a href=""http://www.thestylistics.org/1.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Stylistics</a>' <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J51HSCM1PYM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Stop Look Listen""</a> as produced by the Guyanese-born <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/madprofessordub"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mad Professor</a> and performed by <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/paulettetajah"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Paulette Tajah</a> would be ideal as accompaniment to this type of revolutionary romance.</p>
<p>The dulcet tones of Legato on ""I Cares"" are a highlight, as is <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clement_Bushay"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Clem Bushay</a>'s sparkling dub production of the Louisa Mark's cover of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5968-jackson-5/"" target=""_blank"">Jackson 5</a>'s <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqVKQg3lyUw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Even Though You're Gone""</a>. However, the collection works best as a whole; listening to it from beginning to end gives more of a sense of how lovers rock is not necessarily about listening to one song, but rather getting into a groove.</p>
<p>If viewed as a history of the genre, there are certainly some missing artifacts here-- for instance, the most successful lovers rock single, Janet Kay's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cG-e4cf39E"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Silly Games""</a>, though mentioned in the notes, is not included. Brown Sugar's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBlUPXse2A8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I'm in Love with a Dreadlocks""</a> is also conspicuously absent, as is any tune from <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bi8pXxlE-Ug"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Am I the Same Girl""</a> star Winsome. It's hard to fault the collection for these omissions, as the last line of the notes makes it clear that this is the first of many potential volumes. That being said, perhaps a chronological sequencing might have been helpful, and although it fits the general sound, Wendy Walker's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSV6rQdRzO8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""We've Got One""</a> might have been left out given that it dates five years after every other track on the compilation.</p>
<p>At a time when today's dancehall is charged as being the provenance of men and misogyny, Soul Jazz's <i>Harmony</i> provides a glimpse into a time when reggae music, in the UK at least, presented the voices of women and narratives of love. This is, in Jamaican parlance, ""big people music""-- perhaps teenagers testing out what it's like to be adult or, today, adults trying to recapture the innocence of youth.</p></div>"|16446.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16446-harmony-melody-and-style-lovers-rock-and-rare-groove-in-the-uk-1975-92/|8.0|Erin MacLeod

Yes, it's a first effort-- a three-song, 22-minute EP by the Melbourne metal band <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30328-inverloch/"" target=""_blank"">Inverloch</a>-- but it's also a very conscious sequel: a follow-up to 1993's <i>Transcendence Into the Peripheral</i>, the eerie, agonized lone full-length by <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disembowelment_(band)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">diSEMBOWELMENT</a>, an arty extreme-doom band that featured future Inverloch guitarist Matthew Skarajew and drummer Paul Mazziotta. Fans of the earlier group aren't likely to shed their preconceptions when encountering Inverloch, and it's apparent that the band isn't asking them to.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Inverloch began life in 2010 as d.USK. That name (the title of a 1992 diSEMBOWELMENT EP) and the trademark lowercase ""d"" (seen in diSEMBOWELMENT's strangely un-metal-ish logo) were a tip-off to the cult following that had steadily accrued in the wake of <i>Transcendence</i>: d.USK were a tribute band, plain and simple. ""Keep in mind that d.USK is purely a live realization of the classic diSEMBOWELMENT songs,"" the band's bio stipulated. ""With only two original members, we feel it would be a travesty to pretend to anything else."" (Given that Renato Gallina, diSEMBOWELMENT's frontman and conceptual mastermind, is absent from Inverloch, they were right to issue a disclaimer.) </p>
<p class=""p1""><i>Dusk | Subside</i> announces a name change-- <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hXXUci-gSg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Inverloch""</a> was the title of a piece by <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/trialofthebow"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Trial of the Bow</a>, a soundtracky side project featuring Skarajew and Gallina-- and a shift in intent. Skarajew and Mazziotta aren't distancing themselves from diSEMBOWELMENT; Inverloch tour Europe this month, drawing on both their new material and <i>Transcendence Into the Peripheral</i>. At the same time, <i>Dusk</i> finds them beginning to turn their attention toward the future.</p>
<p class=""p1"">If the songs on <i>Dusk </i>are new, the sonic palette isn't. For the most part, Inverloch employ the same mixed signals that helped <i>Transcendence</i> achieve its disorienting power: the juxtaposition of death metal's clenched-teeth blastbeats and beastlike growling with doom metal's forlorn trudge, guitars that alternately snarl with distortion or chime like distant bells, and transitional passages of unsettling ambience. As intense as <i>Dusk </i>can be-- the EP's beefy, organic sound easily tops the reverby murk of <i>Transcendence</i>-- it's hard to forget that Inverloch are reading from a two-decade-old script. Even today, <i>Transcendence</i> sounds genuinely radical, a sprawling, ugly record that tests your patience as it captivates you with its grotesque moodcraft. In comparison, <i>Dusk </i>registers as well-executed comfort food, with hints of innovation to come.</p>
<p class=""p2"">The EP's opener, ""Within Frozen Beauty"", serves its ice-breaking purpose but suffers from a lack of personality. The track's sudden shift from a gothy, hypnotic vamp to a raging, uptempo firestorm would make it a powerful live-set opener. Yet once the shock of the kick-in wears off, you're left with fairly generic modern death metal: a driving, turbulent sound that bands like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2090-immolation/"" target=""_blank"">Immolation</a> perfected in the early aughts.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Fortunately, <i>Dusk </i>improves from there. Second track ""The Menin Road"" is as potent a diSEMBOWELMENT homage as you could hope for, a Sisyphean mini epic that conceals a wealth of detail beneath a monolithic death-doom facade. Mazziotta's drum beat employs chasms of empty space and skillful snare syncopations, lending an unlikely sense of swing to the song's super slo-mo groove. Meanwhile, Skarajew and Mark Cullen's guitars move from tranced-out crunch to a clean-toned melody that sounds like organ accompaniment for a church processional. As Gallina often did on <i>Transcendence</i>, Inverloch vocalist Ben James shows off his command of multiple registers here, building from a guttural bellow to a glass-gargling shriek.</p>
<p class=""p1""><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30328-inverloch/"" target=""_blank"">""Shadows of the Flame""</a> serves as a strong closer, sustaining the oozy monotony of ""The Menin Road"" while pointing the way to a fresher sound. Compared to the two preceding tracks, this piece is incredibly eventful, finding Inverloch shifting tempos and juggling riffs with prog-like precision. Throughout, Mazziotta catches the ear with odd flourishes-- chaotic fills on the uptempo sections, bass-drum-less blastbeats underneath the guitarists' half-time plod-- while Skarajew and Cullen contrast straightforward riffage and shoegazey leads. When, after five-and-a-half kinetic minutes, the band settles into a swaggery groove that's more straightforwardly rocking than anything in the diSEMBOWELMENT catalog, it becomes clear that Inverloch are striving for more than just a resurrection of the past. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Overall, <i>Dusk | Subside</i> succeeds in its modest ambitions. The release functions well as a concise ""we're back"" dispatch from Skarajew and Mazziotta, an announcement to the metal underground that they can perform convincingly in an old style, paying tribute to an aesthetic that their former band helped to shape. At the same time, ""Shadows of the Flame"" hints at something new around the corner, the possibility that Inverloch might soon step out from under diSEMBOWELMENT's long, dark shadow.</p></div>"|16474.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16474-dusk-l-subside/|6.7|Hank Shteamer

After playing a final gig in their native San Francisco last August, the <a href=""http://www.monamierecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mon Amie</a> indie pop five-piece decided to hang it up after seven years of jangle. <i>Much Ado About</i>, their new EP, will serve as the band's farewell (for now, at least), offering one last rattle through Anglophilic guitar pop for us all to remember them by. Magic Bullets' previous release, their solid, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14373-magic-bullets/"">self-titled second effort</a>, found their name being uttered in the same breath as like-minded acts <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28353-wild-nothing/"">Wild Nothing</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27360-the-pains-of-being-pure-at-heart/"">the Pains of Being Pure at Heart</a>, another addition to a very gentle C86 revival.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Alas, it was not meant to be (though to be honest, aren't we always kind of in the midst of a C86 revival?). So if this is the Bullets' <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16027-the-smiths-complete/""><i>Strangeways Here We Come</i></a>, the feeling is much more <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBc_iyDvs4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Death at One's Elbow""</a> than <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_qPTyy4itI&amp;noredirect=1"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Last Night I Dreamt That Somebody Loved Me""</a>, for better or worse. Whereas <i>Magic Bullets</i> was multifaceted in its ability to impart some of its thematic lovesickness into the actual music, <i>Much Ado About</i> is a more blatantly sunny affair. So for those who found a melancholy kind of joy in being barely able to scrape themselves off the floor to the tune of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bWVT_RVWbs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""They Wrote a Song About You""</a>, it should be noted that there is precious little time for that here. The seven (very similar) songs offered up are unguardedly sweet, with their tumbling drums and sprightly guitars. This is, by all accounts, music made for Sunday bike rides, and it's hard to actively dislike in the same way that it's hard to actively dislike watching a three-legged race. So needless to say, if you don't care for Sunday bike rides or three-legged races, stay the hell away from this.</p>
<p>But no matter your disposition, do stay for the guitars. Corey Cunningham is still able to take time-honored licks (yes, there's a lot of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2684-johnny-marr/"" target=""_blank"">Johnny Marr</a> tucked into these songs) and make them sound unique and refreshing. If only the remaining Bullets had followed suit: Lead singer Philip Benson seems to go out of his way to avoid the more theatrical phrasings that helped give the material on <i>Magic Bullets</i> some bite, and the rest of the band seems to join in, taking a more direct, color-by-numbers approach. Which isn't to say that it's an unwelcome thing: ""Time and Again"" has a good-natured vibe that wouldn't feel out of place on a <a href=""http://www.woodsist.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Woodsist</a> comp, where <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13011-what-took-you-so-long/"" target=""_blank"">""What Took You So Long""</a> adopts an almost <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3768-the-shins/"">Shins</a>-y look and ""Common House Cats"" translates as affable prom pop. But a lot of these songs have a weird jam-band quality that deprives them of any real depth or contrast-- tracks like opener ""Unlearned"" sound as though they were more inspired by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7986-dave-matthews-band/"" target=""_blank""><i>Under the Table and Dreaming</i></a> than anything to come out of dear ol' Blighty in the last 25 years.</p>
<p><i>Much Ado About</i> is an EP that requires the right kind of climate, and in all honesty would probably work best in the context of a mumblecore movie or, perhaps more troublingly, a ""How I Met You Mother"" montage. But it leaves on a real high note with the organ-augmented ""If You Touch Her"", which distills the EP's charms while imparting a needed edge. ""If you love her then stay away/ If you touch her there will be hell to pay,"" Benson sings. It's a good note to go out on, even if most of the teeth-baring here was the result of a mile-wide smile that, depending on your mood, would more readily invite a fist than a reciprocal grin. As a final statement, <i>Much Ado About</i> doesn't mean that we'll be missing Magic Bullets as terribly if they had called it quits in 2010, but it also doesn't mean that we won't be wishing them well on their way out.</p></div>"|16475.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16475-magic-bullets-much-ado-about-ep/|6.2|Zach Kelly

The moment occurred while she was recording an evil moonwalk of a rap song called ""Come on a Cone""-- after verbally shitting on any and all competition for two minutes, she peaks with, ""If you weren't so ugly, I'd put my dick in your face."" And then something special happens. She pauses the track and starts to sing ""dick in your face"" all melismatic, like she's vying to stay alive on ""American Idol"". She's skewering tired pop-star singing styles, hip-hop masculinity, and maybe even herself, because while her major-label debut turned out to be a star-making success, it often traded in Nicki's trademark, potentially-game-changing eccentricities for something smoother, blander, and more radio-ready. Reminiscing on the ""dick in your face"" breakthrough in a <a href=""http://www.complex.com/music/2012/03/video-nicki-minaj-roman-reloaded-complex-10th-anniversary"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Complex</i></a> interview, she recently said, ""That's when it was like [<i>makes soda-can spritz noise</i>]-- explosion, <i>Roman Reloaded </i>is here!"" </p>
<p>And that sound-effected bit of self-promotion proves to be true on the album. Well, on some of the album, at least. Those who buy this thing based on the delirious bubblegum hit <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12196-super-bass-ft-ester-dean/"" target=""_blank"">""Super Bass""</a> or the CD's kindergarten-art-class via <i>Maxim</i> cover will likely be quite vexed by an extended opening salvo of minimalist, futurist hip-hop that recalls nothing less than Clipse's devilish opus <i>Hell Hath No Fury</i>. This streak includes two brilliantly off-kilter songs from ""Niggas in Paris"" producer Hit-Boy, the livewire ""Cone"" along with ""I Am Your Leader"", featuring verses from rap-cred stampers Rick Ross and Cam'ron. There's the effortless, pinging schoolyard taunt <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13368-beez-in-the-trap-ft-2-chainz/"" target=""_blank"">""Beez in the Trap""</a>, and the hyped ""HOV Lane"", which ends up pretty vicious considering its beat vaguely recalls the ""Inspector Gadget"" theme song. And the instrumental for ""Roman Reloaded"" employs safety-clicks and bullet booms for percussion as Nicki flips the sellout claims on their head: ""Nicki pop?!/ Only thing that's pop is my endorsement op."" On all of these songs, Nicki is dartboard focused-- she's rapping harder here than on almost anything from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14898-pink-friday/"" target=""_blank""><i>Pink Friday</i></a>; the verses are akin to those on her breakout mixtape, <i>Beam Me Up Scotty</i>, or the myriad song-stealing guest shots she worked to leverage her big break in the first place. Listen to this album's first seven tracks, and it would be completely understandable to think that Nicki was using her first-class pop status to infiltrate and innovate with the playful abandon of prime-era Missy Elliott or Busta Rhymes. </p>
<p>But the next 12 tracks (15 on the deluxe version) by and large find Nicki doing exactly what she just said she wouldn't: going pop. Which, to be clear, is a perfectly fine (and admirably ambitious) idea-- in theory. Talking to <a href=""http://www.complex.com/music/2012/03/nicki-minaj-cover-story"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Complex</i></a> about her perfectionist streak, she said, ""I'm doing it to prove to... myself that I don't have to settle for less because I'm a female rapper or because I'm black."" And what was so great about ""Super Bass"" was how it married Nicki's inherent weirdness (see: flinging pink goop at muscle-bound dudes in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/tv/musicvideos/800-super-bass/"" target=""_blank"">the song's video</a>) with a hook that reached everyone from Taylor Swift to little girls who have no idea who the eff Slick Rick is.</p>
<p>That kind of complementary appeal is missing in these new songs, which range from brittle Euro-trance to milquetoast R&amp;B to washed-out balladry. Take lead single ""Starships"", produced by RedOne, whose bass-first style played a large role in making Lady Gaga the world's preeminent pop star on songs including ""Bad Romance"" and ""Just Dance"". The track throttles, its sky-aimed maximalism clearly designed to overtake the radio via pure volume. It seems to be born out of a creatively hobbled beer company's marketing team (an idea supported by the grossly pandering mention of ""Bud Light"" in the song's first few lines) rather than Nicki's gloriously odd brain. ""Starships"", along with the four club-ready tracks that come in its wake, do something that should be difficult; in her quest to avoid becoming just another female rapper, she inadvertently settles for being just another pop star. And the harsh truth is that she needs work in that department.</p>
<p><a href=""http://youtu.be/1lN7xlw5syM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Just look at her recent ""American Idol"" performance of ""Starships""</a>. Sure, she doesn't even attempt to sing most of the song live-- though, usually such blatant and high-profile lip-synchs are coupled with intense dance moves, or something to make up for the lack of in-the-moment vocals. But while Nicki's simplistic dancing has been endearing in other venues, it's less so when she's trying to sell a stupidly massive dance tune. So, on ""Idol"", she was essentially relegated to playing hype-woman to her own song. While she'd never be able to get away with her ""Idol""-satirizing ""dick in your face"" theatrics on the show (though I'd love to see Seacrest's reaction to that), playing to both sides of the aisle sends a terminally mixed message. </p>
<p>Which brings up another inconvenient reality: Nicki's singing voice is a limited instrument, especially when contrasted with her limitless rapping. It can be shrill when it's not oddly blank or sounding like Rihanna (""Beautiful Sinner"") or Ke$ha (""Young Forever""). But it's not hopeless; on the anguished ""Fire Burns"", Nicki embeds a palpable emotion into the song. She meets the track smolder for smolder, and her delivery on lines like, ""You piece of shit, you broke me down/ Thought you said you, would hold me down,"" is more powerful than a thousand puddle-rumbling bass kicks. More common, though, is ""Right By My Side"", where Nicki flatly pines for a guy-- then again, her lackluster performance is somewhat understandable considering her duet partner is perennial asshole Chris Brown.  </p>
<p>Nicki is well aware of the potential criticisms of her pop turns. On the confessional 2009 mixtape track ""Can Anybody Hear Me"", she recalls a disappointing label run-in: ""When it rains it pours for real, Def Jam said I'm no Lauryn Hill: 'Can't rap and sing on the same CD, the public won't get it they got ADD.'"" And on a defensive (and funny) 20-minute interview that closes out the deluxe <i>Roman Reloaded</i>, she takes on hip-hop diehards by recounting the unfortunate fate of many a 1990s female rapper: ""These other bitches that only did rap and now they live in low-income housing-- is that winning? Just so that a nigga in the street can give me a fucking dap? Get the fuck outta here."" Clearly, she's branching out to avoid that sad story. But, at the same time, this album's shortcomings are not the fault of a label or an attention-deprived audience or close-minded rap fans. Making a strong artistic and commercial statement that's true to (yet also more than) hip-hop is not easy in this climate, but it's definitely possible, a fact Nicki's friend Drake proved with last year's <i>Take Care</i>. But much of <i>Roman Reloaded</i> sweats with a too-big-to-fail desperation. ""I'm a brand, bitch, I'm a <i>brand</i>,"" she raps. She's not wrong.</p></div>"|16471.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16471-pink-friday-roman-reloaded/|6.7|Ryan Dombal

The title references a fictional magic book created by the writer Robert Bloch and later employed by H.P. Lovecraft in a number of his stories. Then there are the songs themselves. In the words of HoF frontman/guitarist/stoner-philosopher Matt Pike, the album's content is framed by a couple of theoretical questions: ""What if Jesus had a twin who died at birth to give Jesus his life? And then what if the twin became a time traveler right then?"" Listening to this blistering 52-minute set, though, you're better off forgetting all of that and just enjoying the group's raw, rollicking return to form.</p>
<p>Not that they've ever really fallen off. Rick Rubin pal Greg Fidelman, who worked on Slayer's<i> World Painted Blood</i> and Metallica's infamous <i>Death Magnetic</i>, gave an unwelcome glossy sheen to 2010's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13966-snakes-for-the-divine/""><i>Snakes for the Divine</i></a>: The songs were there, but his approach sucked the air out of them. You come to Pike and co. for their sweaty, thrashing, chipped-tooth sludge; on that record, when they tore into a song that rattled the speakers in a live setting, it came off a bit lifeless. <i>De Vermis</i> is also quite different from 2007's excellent Jack Endino-produced <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11021-death-is-this-communion/"">Death Is This Communion</a></i>: Instead of folding in raga-style/acoustic-experimental twists, you get straightforward-- albeit mighty, masterfully executed-- stoner metal. Imagine 2002's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3863-surrounded-by-thieves/"" target=""_blank""><i>Surrounded by Thieves</i></a> played by a band with another decade's worth of experience under their belts and whisky in their guts.</p>
<p><i>De Vermis </i>was produced by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/823-converge/"" target=""_blank"">Converge</a>'s Kurt Ballou; the results are dirtier, looser, scrappier, warmer, more soulful, more immediately invigorating than on <i>Snakes</i>. He also gets Des Kensel's drums right. On <i>De Vermis</i>, High on Fire sound like a band that's been playing and traveling in a van together for more than a decade not rock stars relegated to different sections of a studio, and there's space here for improvisation and chance. (Bassist Jeff Matz, who became a full-time player on <i>Death is the Communion</i>, gets an honorary old-timer medal because he locks in with drummer Kensel like a lifer.)</p>
<p>That's the major difference here from what we got a couple of years ago: The band seems to be taking their time and letting things open up and go wherever they may want to go. The first track, ""Serums of Liao"", a hulking, six-minute rager, sets the tone, and unlike the past couple of records, they don't slow things down much for the remaining nine tracks: It's fitting the next track is a Motörhead headlock called ""Bloody Knuckles"". This really is visceral, ecstatically grimy heavy metal, and trying to parse each reference to Lovecraft, Bloch, ""Quantum Leap"", or ""ancient Chinese alchemists"" detracts from the face that something like the shredding <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13243-fertile-green/"">""Fertile Green""</a> feels like a HoF classic (and, really, is probably, more or less, just about getting high).</p>
<p>Things don't let up. There's the sludgy, fuzzed-out feedback of the almost seven-minute ""Madness of an Architect"", a standout that hints at slow-burn Sunn O))) until Pike breaks the trance at the two-minute mark, the group finding a groove that's more bayou than Oakland. It bleeds into ""Samsara"", a late-night, solo-happy instrumental that feels like the finale of a leaving-it-all-on-the-stage set, not anything <span class=""st"">interstitial</span>: It offers a moment to catch your breath before the battering ram of ""Spiritual Rites"", but doesn't slow down the action or get too cute. Basically, it's something they could pull off live without reaching into a bag of alternate tunings or miscellaneous tricks.</p>
<p>You get more of that after-hours feel on the album's best track, ""King of Days"", a dark, seven-minute dose of progressive psychedelia that will have you mentioning Sabbath and, amid its mountainous peaks and solos, Pike's earlier band, doom legends <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23954-sleep/"" target=""_blank"">Sleep</a>. Interestingly, High on Fire are making some of the best music of their career just as Sleep's in the midst of a reunion (which began in 2009) and getting set to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/45743-sleep-to-reissue-dopesmoker/"" target=""_blank"">reissue</a> their 2003 ritualistic, epic-as-fuck, one-song stoner classic, <i>Dopesmoker</i>.</p>
<p>Who knows what all of this means for the profile of either act. High on Fire are still probably too aggro for your casual listeners, and Sleep are too expansive with their wild-green incantations. But Pike is a legend in underground metal circles, and it's great hearing him strut on <i>De Vermis</i> (for my money, he's the one who should be the one representing ""rock"" at the Grammys). His solos are getting more stop-in-your-tracks audacious. His songwriting's sharper. The trio, using age and experience to a positive end, feels comfortable, but far from complacent. They've found a way to be ambitious while also elemental, a difficult trick that Sleep pulled off on <i>Holy Mountain</i> and <i>Dopesmoker</i>, and one that High on Fire have nailed here.</p></div>"|16478.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16478-de-vermis-mysteriis/|8.2|Brandon Stosuy

After a few years of letting that low end ride on UK dubstep labels like Dub Police and Sub Soldiers, Leeds-hailing first-wave wobbler <a href=""http://www.ruskoonfire.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rusko</a> released his debut LP, the intermittently interesting crossover attempt <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14399-omg/"" target=""_blank""><i>O.M.G.!</i></a>, in May of 2010. Another, more culturally resonant bass-heavy release emerged that year: <i>Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites</i>, the breakout second EP from the ever-polarizing skronkmeister and recent triple-Grammy winner Skrillex. By the end of the year, Rusko was not only castigating the absurdly named ""brostep"" sub-genre affixed to artists like him and Skrillex-- he was taking responsibility for the whole thing. ""Brostep is my fault, but now I've started to hate it, in a way,"" he told BBC 1Xtra DJ MistaJam. ""I kind of took it there, and now everybody else is taking it too far."" A year later and he was still on one, telling <i>SPIN</i> that the follow-up to <i>O.M.G.!</i> would be ""a reaction to the masculine, dance-floor orientated, distorted mess that is the current state of dubstep.""</p>
<p>Really, it's strange Rusko was stuck with the ""brostep"" tag to begin with: The closest association he has with Alpha Wub Delta types is the liberal sampling of dialogue from Guy Ritchie's rough-and-tumble frat-arthouse touchstone <i>Snatch</i> found on his and dubstep mainstay Caspa's 2007 <i>Fabriclive</i> mix. He is more than familiar with letting that bass run wild, albeit in less aggressive ways than his HARD Fest contemporaries-- but you either have to be narrow-minded or just plain ignorant of dance culture as a whole to think that rocking a system with cavernous rumble is a <i>new</i> thing.</p>
<p>All of which is to say Rusko's sour-grapes exhortations were probably a tad reactionary, the type of thing you might expect from a guy who recently threatened to leak his own record after his label, Mad Decent, arranged for a now-industry-standard online stream of it a few weeks before its release. Either way, we win, since on this sophomore LP, he's made some seriously twisted hooch from that puckered vine: A five-mile sprint away from easy categorization, <i>Songs</i> is a nasty carnival of electronic pop that giddily hops between styles-- jungle, rave, dub, purple, reggae, pure Guetta-fied pop, and so on-- like a broken radio. The nondescript album title refers to Rusko's nearly exclusive focus on vocal-heavy cuts, following <i>O.M.G.!</i>'s track-y vibe. There's a lot of toasting and wailing alike on this record, even if the former edges out the latter in terms of consistency.</p>
<p>""Proper"" songs aren't a new look for Rusko; along with a fair share of pot-haze dubplate cuts that are reprised in spirit here, <i>O.M.G.!</i>'s broader gestures featured collaborations with Gucci Mane, Dirty Projectors' Amber Coffman, and Ben Westbeech, among others. In terms of melody-making, though, there's little on that album that matches the sticky one-two that kicks off <i>Songs</i>, ""Somebody to Love"" and ""Pressure"". The former is a rave-revivalist update of the Cofffman-sung <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/14226-hold-on-ft-amber-coffman/"" target=""_blank"">""Hold On""</a> that bests its predecessor; the latter is the album's big, early peak, a breezy treat of a song stuffed with handclaps, tart synth stabs, squiggly bass, and light-bathed keys. Dirty Radio's commanding vocal performance gives the song's first half a summery feel that wouldn't have sounded out of place on UK dubstep vocalist Katy B's excellent 2011 LP <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15254-on-a-mission/"" target=""_blank""><i>On a Mission</i></a>, but the pyrotechnics <i>really</i> arrive during ""Pressure""'s back half, where a heady flurry of chopped-up vocal hiccups tornado through the scenery. The whole thing just might end up being the best Basement Jaxx single put to tape this year.</p>
<p>Some might find the assertion to be heresy, but the Jaxx's legacy is invoked frequently throughout <i>Songs</i>-- not necessarily through sound itself, but compositionally. Felix Buxton and Simon Ratcliffe's whole-kitchen-sink-inside-the-kitchen-sink approach has always provided plenty of chewy stuff for those who love details; if Rusko's not an admirer of the pair, he's certainly a kindred spirit. There are more than a few packed clown cars here, tracks jammed up with sonic baubles both instantly noticeable (the junglist break folded within the ""drop"" of ""Opium"") and blink-and-you-miss-them subtle (is that <i>really</i> the ""bonus level"" sound from <i>Sonic the Hedgehog</i> pinging off the video-game tumble of ""Asda Car Park""?). By my count, about half of <i>Songs</i>' 14 cuts feature what some would refer to as ""drops,"" which are deployed with a sense of melodic, hedonistic humor and only add to the sheer sonic mayhem that frequently takes place here. That being said, if you're the type that views ""drop"" as a dirty word, you might want to avoid about half of this album.</p>
<p>Setting aside ""Pressure"", ""Somebody to Love"", and the enjoyable Eurocheese banger ""Thunder"", the main issue with <i>Songs</i> is that, for an album of ""songs,"" there are too few pop cuts to work well as a whole. It's more of a pick-and-choose affair where the modern ability to fast-forward to your favorite musical moments, down to the second, is crucial. That also means that front-to-back listens can be exhausting. It's possible that the removal of the stormy, snoozy nü-ambient closer ""M357"", as well as the truly execrable faux-swag anthem and Worst Song of 2012 Thus Far contender ""Dirty Sexy Money"", would ease the fatigue, but honestly, I'd rather just hear an ADD-addled megamix of the entire album, one that runs at the globe-hopping speed that this material so seriously deserves.</p></div>"|16477.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16477-songs/|6.7|Larry Fitzmaurice

When Nabay self-proclaims himself ""Bubu King,"" it's truth, in that he was the one to cart that localized folk music form into a major African metropolis and put it not just on the radio, but on national television and before thousands at sold-out concert stadiums in his native land. And perhaps more important than that, Nabay has taken bubu before the all-important hipster demographic in Brooklyn, where they too have crowned him king.</p>
<p>But wait, what is bubu? And why hasn't Honest Jon's or Analog Africa or Soundways or Awesome Tapes From Africa already done the archaeological work on reviving it on vinyl? That'd be because without Janka Nabay, the music might have never been heard outside of his village. Bubu originated in the Tenme regions in the north and west of war-ravaged Sierra Leone, soundtracking the festivities surrounding Ramadan. Originally rendered on whatever was at hand, usually on bamboo or discarded auto exhaust pipes, bubu music followed Nabay when he went to audition for the Sierra Leone equivalent of ""American Idol"" in the major metropolis of Freetown in the mid 1990s.</p>
<p>As recounted in Jesse Jarnow's feature for the <i>Village Voice</i>, Nabay had originally prepared a reggae song for his audition, only to have one of the show's producers lament aloud: ""What about your own country's music? Do any of you know how to play something like that?"" Nabay stepped forward to proffer bubu. And with that, the once-a-year processional instead soundtracked an electrified, year-long celebration in his homeland. The decade-long civil war finally led the Sierra Leone superstar to flee, winding up in Baltimore and Philadelphia before Nabay began appearing on stages throughout Bushwick and Williamsburg. Backed by locals like Highlife's Doug Shaw and the band Skeletons, <i>An Letah</i> follows 2010's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14104-bubu-king/"" target=""_blank""><i>Bubu King</i></a> EP with a whiplash 14 minutes of electrified bubu that presage what will no doubt be a watermark year for Nabay.</p>
<p>While Freetown, Sierra Leone may be over 3,600 miles from Johannesburg, South Africa, opener ""Eh Mane Ah"" matches the hyperactive drum machine rev of that region's similarly electrified folk music, shangaan (as famously documented by Honest Jon's in the past few years). Janka Nabay does call and response with female backup singers as the Bubu Gang adds pistoning hi-hats and drums atop the machine and replaces the ringtone melodies that riddle shangaan with some vintage organ whir and deft guitar lines. The frantic handclaps and doubletime percussion of ""Rotin"" might seem to move too fast, yet it somehow still has room for psychedelic guitar flourishes and boisterous vocal trills. ""Ro Lungi"" features some dub effects but it speeds along like highlife on fast forward, casting ecstatic energy far and wide. This year Nabay has taken to the road with Delicate Steve, and David Byrne's Luaka Bop label will release Nabay's first American full-length this summer. Soon many others will also be hailing the king.</p></div>"|16472.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16472-an-letah/|7.8|Andy Beta

The track was a special kind of stoopid, a pure pastiche whose innovation-- slowing footwork's daft repetitions to UK bass speeds-- was inevitable and whose only sliver of wit came via its childlike abstraction of Chicago's crude mantras. It was so blindingly obvious and addictive that there frankly wasn't much to be said about it (<a href=""http://www.residentadvisor.net/feature.aspx?1220"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">see number five</a>). In the two years since ""Footcrab"", peers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29526-pearson-sound/"" target=""_blank"">Pearson Sound</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16062-sepalcure/"" target=""_blank"">Sepalcure</a> have found more nuanced applications of the Footwork sound, and Chicago originators like Traxman and DJ Rashad have toured Europe and released artist albums on Planet Mu. Addison Groove had impeccable timing, but the richest applications of the footwork template were coming from elsewhere. </p>
<p>Addison Groove-- né Antony Williams-- wasn't being lapped, though; he was casually refocusing, setting down footwork in favor of its more durable uncle, juke. His early singles in this style faithfully reproduced the rubbery basslines and 808 drum sounds but were somehow too oriented and dialed in. Straight recreations of this music-- which was produced cheaply and quickly-- might still yield fruit, but Williams' singles were long and thin. Count me among the surprised that his debut album, <i>Transistor Rhythm</i>, on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2978-modeselektor/"" target=""_blank"">Modeselektor</a>'s 50 Weapons, is so well thought and accomplished. He's still taking cues from Chicago's South Side veterans, but for the first time it feels like he's building something of his own. The tracks on <i>Transistor Rhythm</i> are coiled and weighty, dense and tough where their predecessors were diffuse and pliable. </p>
<p>Williams accomplishes this by slowing juke's core elements-- hissy rhythms, virulent bass-- to dubstep tempos-- he stays, with exceptions, in a familiar 120-140 bpm pocket here-- and adding snatches of vocals and rave-y synth patches. He spins the mixture like a top, and the result is tight, controlled motion that peters out as your attention begins to wane. During the slightly homogeneous middle third of the record, he rarely misses his mark: ""Sooperlooper"" capitalizes on a squelchy, pinched synth; ""Ass Jazz"" features drums that hew tightly to a short, pugnacious bassline. On ""Skylight"", clipped diva vocals threaten to untether from the rhythm section's wild orbit. When he stretches out on ""Incredibly Exhausted Bunny Ears"", he visits the spacey synth pads of early 1990s UK acts like Orbital on Chicago's hot circuits. </p>
<p>He's still not clever: Early-album tracks ""Bad Things"" and ""Beeps"" feature <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4159-spank-rock/"" target=""_blank"">Spank Rock</a> and aspire to the vulgar repetition of ghetto house. ""Fuck you, bitch,"" over, and over, and over. And there's nothing as sticky as ""Footcrab"": Join me in not quite remembering the precise turns of ""Superlooper"" or ""Skylight"". He never manages a Dance Mania tribute as personal and strange as Nina Kraviz's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=605bwlAz_iQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Ghetto Kraviz""</a>. <i>Transistor Rhythm</i> has been met with mild disappointment by many bass music fans, but I don't hear it. Williams is no longer ahead of the curve, sure, but <i>Transistor Rhythm</i>'s finest moments come when he threatens to step away from the curve completely. It is an album of well-portioned, difficult grooves that owe as much to craftsmanship as they do to scholarship, the sound of a chronic disciple slowing learning to make his influences work for him. </p></div>"|16463.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16463-transistor-rhythm/|7.3|Andrew Gaerig

But the outcome of Blur's initial early-00s dissolution tells a different story: While Coxon's foil/nemesis <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/47-damon-albarn/"" target=""_blank"">Damon Albarn</a> has successfully transformed himself from <i>NME</i> pinup into a globe-trotting Afro-pop fusionist with a penchant for genre-blurring super-group collaborations, Coxon's output comes off as relatively conservative in comparison. With eight albums under his belt, Coxon's amassed a discography larger than Blur's, but whether he's indulging in Nick Drakean folk whimsy or Buzzcockian punk rave-ups, he's mostly stayed true to time- and <i>MOJO</i>-honored British musical traditions.</p>
<p>Rather than amass a body of work that charts a consistent artistic evolution, Coxon deals mostly in reactionary gestures. His previous outing, 2009's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13047-the-spinning-top/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Spinning Top</i></a>, was a sprawling, psych-folk song cycle-- so you know <i>A+E</i> is going to be anything but. However, even by the standards of Coxon's previous punk-rock regression-therapy sessions (like 2004's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwyjLwHW-yk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Freakin' Out""</a> or 2006's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DK97d4Cz498"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Don't Let Your Man Know""</a>), <i>A+E</i> is aggressively dark and primitive, as if his old band's recent reunion stints inspired Coxon to reassert the mischievous contrarian character that made him the discerning Blur fan's favorite. If your list of all-time Blur jams includes <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AI5tOvlleM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Bugman""</a>, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTWZrr3Tryc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Bank Holiday""</a>, or <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbbsiDm_z_4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""B.L.U.R.E.M.I.""</a>, step right up: opener ""Advice"" and ""Running for Your Life"" surge forth with similar proportions of buzzsaw-guitar bluster and sneeringly sardonic cultural commentary. (""Bah Singer"" is another similarly fashioned in-the-red exercise and, while its lyrics are just a touch too distorted to decipher, the song assumes a far more playful tone if you imagine it's about Albarn.)</p>
<p>What really gives <i>A+E</i> its grotty edge is not Coxon's familiarly fractious guitar-playing (in bountiful supply here), but a newfound penchant for pawn-shop synths and drum-machine beats that lend the songs a mechanistic menace. ""City Hall"" doesn't amount to much other than a single lyric repeated over a ceaseless motorik pulse, but Coxon invests the skeletal structure with a rich sense of atmosphere, thanks to ominous blurts of saxophone and teasing guitar lines that cast the track as a pocket-sized version of Can's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3JpcK3_Y4c"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Mother Sky""</a>. The eerily disquieting ""Knife in the Cast"" is an even more atypical move for Coxon, and all the more captivating for it: Coming on like the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10527-colossal-youth-and-collected-works/"" target=""_blank"">Young Marble Giants</a> played at 16 rpm, this sparse, bass-driven ballad serves as a blank canvas onto which Coxon can project all kinds of freakiness-- dubby drum breaks, subliminal chatter, and queasily incessant guitar squeals that feel like a blade being slowly twisted into an open wound.</p>
<p>But if <i>A+E</i>'s spartan sound feels refreshingly raw and visceral in the wake of <i>The Spinning Top</i>'s meandering acoustic meditations, it also too readily exposes the instrumental and conceptual limitations of its lesser material. In both synth-pop form and get-the-indie-kids-moving sentiment, ""What It'll Take"" (""to make you people dance,"" goes the rest of the titular command) feels like it's at least 10 years too late for the electroclash party, while Coxon should be a good 20 years beyond the simplistic singles-scene musings of ""Meet+Drink+Pollinate"". And if the 10-tune tracklist at first appears more compact than <i>The Spinning Top's</i> 15-song slog, <i>A+E</i> still succumbs to its own excesses: The saxed-up post-punk boogie of ""Seven Naked Valleys"" chugs along for nearly six minutes but abruptly cuts out just as a piercing synth frequency threatens to destabilize it into something more interesting.</p>
<p>It's likewise something of a shame that a record featuring some of Coxon's most adventurous work as a solo artist should end with the noncommittal Beck-ian country-funk of ""Ohh, Yeh, Yeh"", a song that doesn't so much close <i>A+E</i> as bring it to an unceremonious, sputtering halt. Like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11569-songs-in-ae/"" target=""_blank"">the similarly titled Spiritualized album of 2008</a>, <i>A+E</i> refers to the accident-and-emergency wards found in British hospitals, the UK equivalent of our ER rooms. And looking at the scraped-knee photo that features on its cover, you're left wishing the album drew a little more blood to make the stay truly worthwhile.</p></div>"|16469.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16469-graham-coxon/|6.7|Stuart Berman

A year later, the band commissioned artists ranging from High Places to Justin Broadrick for <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14653-beast-rest-forth-mouth-remixed/"" target=""_blank"">Beast Rest Forth Mouth Remixed</a>, </i>which defied all expectations associated with indie rock remix records by actually being pretty good.</p>
<p>Now a group whose albums can be described as ""highly anticipated,"" Bear in Heaven masterfully punctured the hype cycle by slowing their third LP, <i>I Love You, It's Cool</i>, by 400,000 percent and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/44874-bear-in-heaven-slow-down-new-album-i-love-you-its-cool-400000-for-stream/"" target=""_blank"">streaming it on their website</a> for over 2700 consecutive hours-- if you missed it, the deluxe version of <i>I Love You </i>comes with two hours of it. But besides being one hell of a PR stunt, the drone version of <i>I Love You </i>unintentionally laid out a crucial rule of engagement for Bear in Heaven's latest artistic divergence: Don't rush to judgment with this thing. It might not take four months for it to finally click for you-- but it <i>might</i>.</p>
<p>Wisely, the Brooklyn-via-Alabama trio use <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11522-lovesick-teenagers/"" target=""_blank"">""Lovesick Teenagers""</a> as the jumping off point for <i>I Love You</i>, specifically the Lindstrom &amp; Christabelle version that appeared on <i>Beast Rest Forth Mouth Remixed</i>. The result won't be wholly unfamiliar due to Jon Philpot's boyish, confidently projected vocals, and even with all the crystalline textures, you never lose sight of Bear in Heaven as a wood-and-string, flesh-and-bone rock band at its core. The difference here is that while <i>BRFM </i>was a consistently locomative record, it took most of its rhythmic cues from easily identifiable indie precedents: the redneck punk-funk of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2800-modest-mouse/"" target=""_blank"">Modest Mouse</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/96-animal-collective/"" target=""_blank"">Animal Collective</a>'s electronic tribalism. There's more of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5179-the-field/"" target=""_blank"">the Field</a> in the way opener ""Idle Heart"" and later ""Cool Light"" play out: short, anticipatory windups that slowly thrust forward into a momentum that's constant throughout and never <i>feels </i>as fast as it actually is. This lends <i>I Love You </i>a structural fluidity that can make it slippery upon the first couple of listens, verses and choruses identifiable while in progress, but ending and beginning a few bars earlier than you'd usually expect.</p>
<p>Though <i>I Love You </i>doubles down on sequencers and digitization and was forged in the midst of Bear in Heaven's seemingly endless touring regimen, it's worth keeping in mind that they're not looking to carry hard drives for your favorite Kompakt producer. As Philpot memorably sings amidst the strobelit propulsion of single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12977-the-reflection-of-you/"" target=""_blank"">""The Reflection of You""</a>: ""If you could dance with me/ I think you would like my moves."" Note ""if"" and ""think,"" which is really indicative of how Bear in Heaven write more<i> </i>about the <i>idea </i>of dancing than dance music proper-- someone who refers to ""my moves"" is likely a dead giveaway for a wallflower at heart. It's a contrast that works for them, as <i>I Love You </i>generates a legitimate libidinous charge amidst the friction of their new four-to-the-floor rhythmic constancy and the remnants of their previous itchiness: drummer Joe Stickney dropping flailing solos on ""Cool Light"", the bent guitar melody that prods Philpot like the sleep-depriving light pollution described on ""Noon Moon"", penultimate ""Space Remains""' laser-tag meltdown. They could just be vessels for the uneasiness spilling over from Philpot's lyrics, which dare to get literal so as to portray the narrator as embittered, self-loathing, morally casual, or just out for a good time. ""Kiss Me Crazy"" indulges in a mutually destructive and irresistable romance that makes you think its title is missing a comma, while ""Warm Water"" gives itself up to some of <i>I Love You</i>'s most beatific passages while masking its austere rejection. The synths hush as Philpot sings, ""get up, c'mon,"" something that can be mistaken for a call for action when its context calls for closure: ""I wanna love/ Without feeling your love.""</p>
<p>Tracing back to why <i>I Love You </i>is such a slow burn, there's a fundamental challenge to Bear in Heaven's attempts to integrate the vast, incremental buildups of Hans-Peter Lindstrøm and Axel Willner within the context of four-minute indie rock songs with their expected allotment of payoff. Weirdly, it's most evident in ""Sinful Nature"", even though it immediately jumps out the way ""Lovesick Teenagers"" did. As with ""Lovesick"", Philpot's lyrics are simultaneously empathetic (""You're let down by God/ You're let down by boring strangers"") and conspiratorial (""Let's get loaded/ And make some strange things come true"") toward its subject, and it's a hell of an arrangement, too. After the opening flashbulb pop of disco synths, the deep, liquid undertow of the rhythm section sounds like it could ebb infinitely. And yet, there's a point after Philpot sings the title and the beat drops out that ""Sinful Nature"" and <i>I Love You </i>beg for release, yet they strangely demur amongst the rising action, leaving a wash of backmasked reverb as the climax. <i>I Love You </i>never allows itself that chance to boil over again, and considering <i>Beast Rest Forth Mouth</i> remained unified despite its occasionally volcanic choruses, the solidarity of <i>I Love You </i>wouldn't necessarily be compromised by a couple of visceral peaks. The protracted cohesiveness leads to other minor quibbles I can't quite shake: the simonized synth textures and Philpot's piecemeal approach to constructing melody causes a couple of lulls where the record bleeds together, and the opium-laced swirl of ""Sweetness &amp; Sickness"" feels like a closer marooned from some Bear in Heaven record that isn't this one.</p>
<p>Plenty of records from established bands seem to underwhelm on first listen, but what thankfully kept me coming back here? I think of recent releases from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28255-tanlines/"" target=""_blank"">Tanlines</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27745-the-antlers/"" target=""_blank"">the Antlers</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10351-chairlift/"" target=""_blank"">Chairlift</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29244-hooray-for-earth/"" target=""_blank"">Hooray For Earth</a> that functioned in a similar way-- each from New York, each possibly identifiable as ""synth-pop."" It's the kind of thing people point to when trying to figure out why Brooklyn doesn't appear to be on the cutting edge of indie rock anymore, but it's an unfair projection to assume that's what Bear in Heaven are aiming for. Similar to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15411-burst-apart/"" target=""_blank""><i>Burst Apart </i></a>or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16406-tanlines-mixed-emotions/"" target=""_blank""><i>Mixed Emotions </i></a>or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16183-something/"" target=""_blank""><i>Something</i></a>, these are songs that feel welcoming because of how they reflect and integrate themselves into real life-- the people, relationships, and emotions described herein are relatable and open-ended, and hell, considering the sound of ""urban maturity"" is typically seen as strictly the realm of baritones and bassoons, it's refreshing to think Bear in Heaven and their colleagues might be onto a refreshing alternative. It'd be unreasonable to expect Bear in Heaven to keep writing ""Lovesick Teenagers"" over and over again as adults with messy romantic complications, and <i>I Love You, It's Cool </i>is admirable in large part because its ambitions are every bit as subtle and difficult to quantify as its pleasures-- you don't have to call it ""adult indie,"" but it feels like conflicted indie rock for adults.</p></div>"|16440.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16440-bear-in-heaven-i-love-you-its-cool/|7.5|Ian Cohen

Even for someone who's situated within a culture that's constantly looking around the bend, though, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/throttleclark"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Chris Clark</a> is a particularly restless artist. Over the last decade as a Warp recording artist, the English producer's carved an idiosyncratic path for himself, many of his full-lengths containing an elegant, impeccably refined version of a particular style that's more or less discarded by the time the next release rolls around.</p>
<p>Clark's never really been a trailblazer. His music has often paid heavy tribute to his labelmate contemporaries-- <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/110-aphex-twin/"" target=""_blank"">Aphex Twin</a>'s hyperspeed whir, the psychedelic menace of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/410-boards-of-canada/"" target=""_blank"">Boards of Canada</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/168-autechre/"" target=""_blank"">Autechre</a>'s high-falutin glitch chemistry, and so on. 2006's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9557-body-riddle/"" target=""_blank""><i>Body Riddle</i></a> still stands as his prettiest, most impressionistic work, but 2008's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11240-turning-dragon/"" target=""_blank""><i>Turning Dragon</i></a> was undoubtedly Clark's lightning-in-a-bottle moment of brazen originality. An ultra-aggressive, adrenaline-addled slab of twisted metal and chugging, chopped-up beats, <i>Turning Dragon</i>'s aged impressively over time-- possibly because it was so prescient as a musical document, predating the 16-ice-cream-sundaes-at-once maximalism of current Warp artists like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22484-rustie/"" target=""_blank"">Rustie</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22485-hudson-mohawke/"" target=""_blank"">Hudson Mohawke</a> by almost a half-decade. Even now, its black-on-black swarm of drone and sugary noise sounds utterly singular.</p>
<p>If <i>Turning Dragon</i> represented dark magic captured on wax, then Clark's last full-length, 2009's diffuse <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13268-totems-flare/"" target=""_blank""><i>Totems Flare</i></a>, was a malfunctioning firework of a record. On the surface, everything seemed orderly, but the anticipated ""wow"" factor never really arrived.<i> Totems Flare</i> was the first record in Clark's career that truly lacked direction; listening to it was akin to zeroing in on a studio spitballing session, which was unexpected given his track record of statement-length uniformity.</p>
<p>In a sense, then, <i>Iradelphic</i>, Chris Clark's latest full-length, is a return to form. The album's not just another sonic change-up for Clark-- it's possibly the most drastic shift he's made thus far, a shift that's announced from the spinning acoustic guitar figures that open ""Henderson Wrech"". In a bio, Clark states that he taught himself guitar over two months after discovering that ""I was bored of computers."" Indeed, while there are plenty of ""electronic"" moments on <i>Iradelphic</i> (the hypnagogic analog ooze of album highlight <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13030-com-touch/"" target=""_blank"">""Com Touch""</a> especially), the album's jittery organic instrumentation and suite-like structure resembles post-rock's progginess more than anything having to do with ones and zeroes.</p>
<p>I've heard a colleague or two refer derisively to <i>Iradelphic</i> as ""nostalgic."" It's been a hot-button descriptor for electronic pop of various persuasions, and one that Chris Clark himself isn't unfamiliar with when it comes to his own work (his debut album, 2001's micro-IDM document <i>Clarence Park</i>, was named after a park in his hometown of St. Albans). You only need to look at the exposed-negative photograph art that adorns <i>Iradelphic</i>, though, to get the uneasy feeling that Clark-- who's spent most of his career existing outside of conversation-dictating musical trends-- might be somewhat cynically tapping into youth culture's still-current fixation with all things fuzzy, distant, and glowing.</p>
<p>As they are with many acts as of late, Boards of Canada are an influence here-- as is, somewhat surprisingly, fellow Warp signee <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/576-bibio/"" target=""_blank"">Bibio</a>, whose collaborative sessions with Clark were partially used on <i>Iradelphic</i> (Clark largely wrote and performed the album by his lonesome). To me, Bibio's music has always possessed a soft-around-the-edges feel, where even his most hard-knocking material hits with the impact of a pillow stuffed with cotton balls. That style actually looks good on him, but it's ill-fitting on Clark, who usually makes music that does more than slowly fade in the background.</p>
<p>There are moments of gnarled danger on <i>Iradelphic</i>-- the broken tones of ""Skyward Bruise/Descent"", the passing-train ambience of album closer ""Broken Kite Footage""-- but the abundance of tepid, six-string-shuffled numbers give <i>Iradelphic</i> the relative potency of a warm glass of milk. Even <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13333-secret-ft-martina-topley-bird/"" target=""_blank"">guest vocalist Martina Topley-Bird</a>, whose 1990s collaborations with Massive Attack and Tricky made for some of the most chilling, gorgeously druggy music from that scene, sounds limp and perfunctory here, almost despite herself.</p>
<p>Even though it's an improvement on its predecessor in sheer memorability, and its compositional detail and preciseness is impressively par for the course given Clark's history, <i>Iradelphic</i>'s fatal flaw is the same that felled <i>Totems Flare</i>: Despite its overall hazy, sun-lit-kaleidoscope feel, it's just too sonically scattershot to truly take in and enjoy as a body of work. An album's worth of paisley, synth-y psychedelia à la the gorgeous one-two punch of ""Com Touch"" and ""Tooth Moves"" would be ideal, or even a record that embraced one of the album's recurring bucolic motifs; instead, we get a somber piano instrumental here, a static guitar lullaby thrown over there, and how about a strummy three-part stomper right before that unsettling ambient piece at the end? The exact opposite's more or less worked for him for over a decade now, but it might finally be time for Chris Clark to find something-- just one thing-- and stick to it.</p></div>"|16468.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16468-iradelphic/|5.8|Larry Fitzmaurice

(Note that Pitchfork contributor Kim Kelly does PR for Vattnet Viskar's label.) Drummer Matt St. Jean stops playing altogether, while frontman Nicholas Thornbury's pit-of-the-stomach bellow dissipates into a decrescendo. The guitars go quiet, too, now plucking each note of a riff with great patience and from a distance. This oasis of stillness invokes most every metal album ever dubbed atmospheric, epic, or post-anything; of particular relevance, it's precisely the kind of two-to-three-minute impasse that split records by black metallurgists like Agalloch, Katatonia, or even Wolves in the Throne Room into dramatic and more relatable sections. But don't press stop, even if it seems you've heard this before.</p>
<p>The moment is exactly that-- a moment. After only a few seconds, Vattnet Viskar move along again, the drums building back toward a blast, Alan Sobodacha's bass fortifying the plucked riff. The guitars blur, and the band barrels ahead: That bit of gentle pause is instantly, completely forgotten. All of this takes maybe two minutes, meaning that Vattnet Viskar employ an economy that's rare on this side of heavy metal. This three-track, 27-minute EP, for instance, opens with field recordings, tolling bells, and a whispered Latin invocation, a trope-abiding introduction if ever there was one. But after less than 20 seconds of ""Weakness"", the din of a guitar's feedback bifurcates the sound of the bells, and the whole intro begins to crumble beneath a bed of electronic rumble, as if Merzbow were behind the mixing board. When it all disappears, Vattnet Viskar steam in at full volume, Thornbury growling lines about emotional vacuity above a gale worthy of Immortal. Once again, what might take their more established peers the better part of your lunchtime takes these upstarts from a small New Hampshire town less than a minute.</p>
<p>All this talk of restraint and efficiency might seem strange for a band that closes its debut with the 13-minute <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/show-no-mercy/8799-vision-quests/"" target=""_blank"">""Barren Earth""</a>. Within that span, though, Vattnet Viskar make several seamless shifts, moving from a foreboding acoustic start into a full-speed shriek, through a razor-wire guitar drone into a beastly closing surge. With each of those phases, they sculpt the form's brittle roar exceptionally well, letting two guitars pull against each other, each clamoring for space and attention. After just 27 minutes of a career (excepting last year's two-song demo), they've managed to marry ambition and efficiency without a single misstep.</p>
<p>Of late, black metal in the United States-- however excellent it might have been-- has often hinged on headlines and talking points. But Vattnet Viskar has <a href=""http://www.vice.com/read/not-fit-to-print-transcendental-metal"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">no manifesto</a> with which to proselytize, no <a href=""http://www.truecrimereport.com/2011/01/jef_whitehead_leviathan_frontm.php"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">extreme ideology or infamy</a> over which to bicker, and no yarn about <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/show-no-mercy/7668-show-no-mercy/"" target=""_blank"">life on the ol' Cascadian farm</a> with which to allure. Sure, to an extent, they're <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/show-no-mercy/8799-vision-quests/"" target=""_blank"">vegan environmentalists</a> from Plaistow, New Hampshire, a town so seemingly quaint that <a href=""http://www.plaistow.com/Pages/PlaistowNH_WebDocs/historychapterrevisedwithpictures.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">its official history</a> includes a proud section about something called ""The Deodorized Order of the Skunk"" and another about how local Girl Scouts have ""helped shape the moral and civic sensibilities of Plaistow girls for many decades."" Aside from some surprisingly wide-eyed lyrics that explore general themes of existential nihilism and a desire to tear down antiquated systems and build anew, none of those concerns really become a factor here. <i>Vattnet Viskar</i> is simply a strong start from a band that has tapped into the current transmogrification of black metal and proclaimed-- quickly, restlessly, and enthusiastically-- that it has something to say about the process.</p></div>"|16470.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16470-vattnet-viskar/|7.9|Grayson Currin

Anyone picking up a copy of <i>I Don't Want to Die</i>, his debut vinyl offering for <a href=""http://nnatapes.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">NNA Tapes</a>, is tumbling into his mindset from over two years ago, when this set of songs was originally released. So it's taken the world some time to catch up with Power, but he's probably okay with that. ""I'm a slow burner when it comes to writing songs"", he said, in <a href=""http://stereogum.com/937651/band-to-watch-ryan-power/franchises/band-to-watch/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">an interview</a> earlier this year. This new album finds him refining his gentle pop vision, while splashing it with touches of New Age pensiveness and moments that topple over into dissonance. In that interview, Power talks of a fondness for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4116-scritti-politti/"">Scritti Politti</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5414-prefab-sprout/"">Prefab Sprout</a>, and it's not hard to see their influence seeping into <i>I Don't Want to Die</i>. Often his music is glossed over with the same kind of plastic sheen as the two most barefaced pop statements from those acts (<i>Cupid &amp; Psyche 85</i> and <i>From Langley Park to Memphis</i>, respectively).</p>
<p>But the roots of <i>I Don't Want to Die</i> clearly sprout from lo-fi origins, and this is a far more inward-looking work than anything Green Gartside or Paddy McAloon were striving for when they decided to max out their pop potential. Naturally, Power is working on a much smaller budget than those artists, but it's to his credit that the joints rarely show. Occasionally a drum machine might sound too tinny (""The Knowhow"") or the production may feel unnecessarily strangulated (""The Way It's Always Been""), but mostly he's able to paper over those cracks. Power's biggest strengths are in his voice, which can shift from sullen to sparkling in a heartbeat without sounding remotely like a stretch for him; and the dexterous way he can manipulate song structure to suit his whims, often managing to squash jazz-funk, pop, and rock impulses into a tiny space where they all bounce off one another.</p>
<p>When it works, it's a delight. ""Mondo Rush"", the standout track here, is a finely carved slice of utopian pop, shot through with the promise of a better world somewhere around the bend. It's similar to the kind of bittersweet feeling that edges into the 1980s Brat Pack staple <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmoHQ2DC3zo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Tenderness""</a> by General Public, and the high-cheese-factor keyboard sounds Power deploys also strongly mirror that era. But he's too restless to settle on a single, definable style. After ""Mondo Rush"" he's channeling wistful <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Bill+Withers"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bill Withers</a> moves on the title track, then heading into the muted <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28716-ariel-pinks-haunted-graffiti/"">Ariel Pink</a>-isms of ""Transition Possible"" and ""You Wanna Seltzer"". Like Pink on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14324-before-today/""><i>Before Today</i></a>, Power is keen to explore the tension that occurs when you throw a brilliant sheen over angular rock. But when he's sticking a fork in the leg of pop (""Rag Rug"") his vision starts to feel flabby, heading close to a kind of unnecessary antagonism that he successfully rinsed out of sublime tracks like album opener ""Don't Care"".</p>
<p>That disconnect in the direction in which Power takes <i>I Don't Want to Die </i>is where it splinters. It feels like too many whims are being indulged, too many chances are being taken just to see where they lead him. It's unlikely Power would be satisfied being a straight-down-the-line singer-songwriter, but nothing else here comes remotely close to the angelic calm corkscrewing through ""Mondo Rush"" and ""Don't Care"". The Ariel Pink comparison will most likely irk him after a while, but he's undeniably trailing in his wake here, and with umpteen Pink albums readily available, it's difficult to see what the oblique work on <i>I Don't Want to Die </i>offers that isn't already out there. That's a problem many musicians face when they draw inspiration from artists whose aesthetics are so fully formed: How do you immerse yourself in that other world and then escape from it into a space that's discernibly your own?</p></div>"|16467.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16467-i-dont-want-to-die/|5.8|Nick Neyland

Eight years ago, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6033-the-blue-album/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Blue Album</i></a> sent Phil and Paul Hartnoll out on a moderate high note, a career-spanning compendium of their best ideas, if not always the best executed versions of those ideas. It was a perfectly acceptable cap to the decade-plus career of two reliable purveyors of strong-to-amazing dance music full-lengths. Orbital staged a seven-album run (nine if you count film scores) between 1991 and 2004 that produced only one or two outright clunkers. Looking at the ignoble history of electronic producers as album artists, this is hardly the faint praise it might seem.</p>
<p>As one of the most beloved live acts of the first rave era, Orbital could have reunited to profitably play festivals every year without ever putting out new and potentially rep-tarnishing new music. You had to wonder if they looked at the trajectory of their one-time peers over the course of 21st-century so far and worried a little. The last 12 years have been a downer in this regard, with <i>way</i> too many 1990s dance titans staging major comebacks and making embarrassing attempts to look with-it, even as dance culture's hyper-accelerated trend-hopping had long since passed them by.</p>
<p>So thank whatever god you wish that <i>Wonky </i>mostly finds Orbital deciding to do what they've always done best: gorgeous blends of house drive and techno precision, linking airy whoosh and stadium stomp, melodic hook and rhythmic push. These are dance tracks that hit you with the immediacy of pop singles, occasionally erring toward outright throwback territory but usually with just enough juice purloined from club culture's more recent mutations and underground niches to keep things vital. This doesn't mean the Hartnolls aren't still devoted to the sounds of the 1990s, ideas they helped either pioneer or refine, and there are indeed plenty of sonic nods to rave's (and Orbital's) most fertile decade.</p>
<p>Orbital tap young goth chanteuse <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27697-zola-jesus/"" target=""_blank"">Zola Jesus</a> for a guest spot on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13088-new-france-ft-zola-jesus/"" target=""_blank"">""New France""</a>, turning her steely, gothic vocal into the yearnings of a spooky diva in an ultra-bright world-- a tech-house anthem that would have worked just as well in the days when Alice Deejay was on the radio. Brighter still, ""Stringy Acid"" is a rush of all the shiniest, most emotional bits from the first few years of Orbital's career, a track so beautifully constructed and 3-D rich that you can forgive how unrepentantly stuck in 1991 it is.</p>
<p>But Orbital's great trick was always to fold the sound of the moment-- whether it was the epic sweep or prog trance or the tricky rhythm programming of jungle-- into the architecture of their own brand of mass-appeal anthems. It's a strategy that served them well as pop ambassadors during the ever-shifting 90s, beholden to no one scene but able to communicate some of the thrill to folks who got most of their dance music from Columbia House. They deploy that trick again on <i>Wonky</i>, except now they seem to be translating the current codes of for-the-kids club sounds for an aging audience of Orbital fans who might not be paying as close attention as they did in the past. And so ""Distractions"" is their take on the half-time lurch of recent techno-tinged dubstep, stripped of the bass drop, but with enough heart-tugging and Orbital-esque melodic curlicues filling up the haunted space that remains, so that it scans more as unique twist than desperate homage.</p>
<p>The only time this pick-and-mix approach to contemporary dance really falters is ""Beelzedub"", which attempts to take the distortion of brostep to an almost comically snarling extreme, complete with a headbanging burst of nasty breakbeats in the final third-- the kind we haven't heard since Alec Empire was smashing jungle and feedback together. The problem is that the extreme parts aren't quite extreme enough, distracting wannabe tough-guy kitsch <i>and</i> a desperate reversion to a played-out style. It's the only time the Hartnolls come off like old dudes struggling to outdo the young roughnecks.</p>
<p>And yet despite occasionally stumbling in this quest to keep things short and immediately ear-grabbing, the Hartnolls haven't lost their knack for gracefulness, tracks that seem to effortlessly build to goosebump-inducing climaxes. If anything, they've managed to work within mainstream dance music's current vogue for radio-friendly track lengths without abandoning their patented crest-to-the-big-release style. Nor have they forgotten how to extend the live act's seemingly preternatural knack for pop-rave pacing across the peaks-and-valleys arc of the listening in your bedroom experience, where even the bridge between the shimmer of ""Stringy Acid"" and the ugliness of ""Beelzedub"" feels natural. <i>Wonky</i> has the one-jolt-after-another vibe of a great collection of familiar hits but without the disconnected feeling you get when a bunch of obviously Big Moment singles are slapped together and called an album, rather seamlessly covering a whole lot of musical ground without sacrificing concision or intensity. It's not perfect, but it <i>is</i> an unexpectedly great comeback album that manages to seem utterly ""Orbital,"" occasionally backward-looking, and yet up-to-the-minute in a not-embarrassing way.</p></div>"|16458.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16458-wonky/|7.5|Jess Harvell

The group-- bassist/vocalist Mike Watt, drummer George Hurley, and guitarist/vocalist Ed Crawford-- was born under the shadow of tragedy after Watt and Hurley's previous band, the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6048-minutemen/"" target=""_blank"">Minutemen</a>, ended with the 1985 death of singer-guitarist D. Boon. Heartbroken, the two were cajoled by Crawford, aka Ed fROMOHIO, into regrouping and continuing on, and fIREHOSE released their first album on SST records less than a year after Boon's death. With no road map to guide them through such an emotionally charged situation, the trio plowed forward, touring relentlessly and recording three albums for SST before shifting to the majors. <i>lowFLOWs: The Columbia Anthology ('91-'93</i>) assembles the band's two studio albums released on Columbia, <i>Flyin' the Flannel</i> and <i>Mr. Machinery Operator</i>, the <i>Live Totem Pole</i> EP, and an assortment of extras to provide a generous overview of the group's loose-limbed, slightly lopsided rumble.</p>
<p>From the outset, fIREHOSE drew a particularly tough assignment, as the Minutemen were not an easy act to follow. Formed in 1980 in San Pedro, the Minutemen were pioneers of the American post-hardcore scene, among the first bands who, in the words of writer Byron Coley, ""showed that 'punk' was capable of gobbling up all other genres."" (For a more comprehensive history of the Minutemen, see Tim Irwin's excellent 2006 documentary <i>We Jam Econo</i>.) Though steeped in a DIY/punk ethos, the members of the Minutemen all had ferocious chops as musicians, with Watt and Hurley forming one of the truly elite rhythm sections of the past three decades. A classic three-sided power trio, the Minutemen's music functioned without a true center and the charismatic D. Boon held up his end with his fierce playing and razor-sharp politics.</p>
<p>So when fIREHOSE began, Ed Crawford faced an especially difficult task. Unfair though it might have been, it was virtually impossible to gauge fIREHOSE's work except as it related to Boon and the Minutemen, and Crawford brought a completely different skill set to the table. He had a stronger and more versatile singing voice, but his relatively straightforward guitar playing was no match for Boon's distinctive style. And his penchant for R.E.M.-style folk-rock occasionally struck an odd balance with Watt and Hurley's more muscular playing. Fortunately, the members of fIREHOSE had banked enough goodwill that their audience patiently allowed them to do much of their woodshedding in public, and their SST releases often seemed more like sketchbooks than finished albums.</p>
<p>Popular legend holds that Nirvana's success triggered the massive land rush of major labels signing every indie band they could, but that is only partially true. fIREHOSE was one of an earlier wave of SST bands-- which also included <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2725-meat-puppets/"" target=""_blank"">Meat Puppets</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3885-soundgarden/"" target=""_blank"">Soundgarden</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4122-screaming-trees/"" target=""_blank"">Screaming Trees</a>-- who all signed with major labels well before <i>Nevermind</i> was released. fIREHOSE's move to Columbia seemed a surprising one at the time. The band tended to treat their albums primarily as advertisements for their gigs, and with their quirky, still-evolving style it seemed unlikely that they could ever even accidentally write a hit song.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, their major label debut <i>Flyin' the Flannel</i> contains a fair portion of their best material and stands as their most cohesive album. The album is highlighted by the opening ""Down With the Bass"", a Watt showpiece/manifesto that features some of his flashiest playing on record. Also included on this set in an instrumental version, the track is a tidy summation of everything fIREHOSE did best, although Crawford's guitar is buried far enough in the mix that the studio versions have never quite captured what a runaway locomotive it was a live setting.</p>
<p>Other gems on <i>Flyin' the Flannel</i> include the group's Watt-sung version of ""Walking the Cow"", which stands as one of the best Daniel Johnston covers, and Crawford's breezy ""Toolin'"" and ""Too Long"", which frame his melodic vocals in best possible light. The album also illustrates, however, the difficulty the band had in nailing down a signature sound. The jazzy ""Epoxy, For Example"" abuts with the semi-spoken word ""Song for Dave Alvin"" and poppy ""Can't Believe"" in a manner that sounds jumbled rather than panoramic, with Watt and Hurley's ever-inventive playing seeming to be the only common denominator. Even so, <i>Flyin' the Flannel</i> has a lovable warmth that makes it easy to accept even its stranger digressions, as on the woozy closer ""Losers, Boozers, and Heroes"", which seems written and sung for maximum befuddlement.</p>
<p>The group's sound took yet another turn on 1993's <i>Mr. Machinery Operator</i>, with characteristically uneven results. Produced by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2693-j-mascis/"" target=""_blank"">J Mascis</a>, the album seemed to be a response to the grunge movement, and such as tracks as ""Rocket Sled/Fuel Tank"" or the Dinosaur Jr.-like ""Blaze"" rank among the heaviest fIREHOSE ever recorded. This was not a bad look for the group, especially since Mascis was able to give Hurley a drum sound that rivaled the Minutemen days. Meanwhile, Watt furthers his reputation as the indie rock John Barth, with ""Disciples of the 3-Way"" continuing his curious habit of writing meta-narratives about being in a band, playing bass, and songwriting itself. But <i>Mr. Machinery Operator</i> was never able to build up any sense of momentum either artistically or commercially. Filler tracks like the instrumental ""Number Seven"" and the drum solo ""More Famous Quotes"" seemed to indicate that they were running low on ideas and/or enthusiasm, and the group broke up shortly after the album's release.</p>
<p>Whereas the Minutemen seemed able to stay perpetually ahead of the curve, fIREHOSE were firmly of their time. Large parts of this collection could serve as a primer for what college radio sounded like circa 1989-1992. This is especially evident on the <i>Live Totem Pole</i> material, which features covers of such of-the-moment songs as Superchunk's ""Slack Motherfucker"", Public Enemy's ""Sophisticated Bitch"", and the Butthole Surfers' ""Revolution (Part Two)"", with its timeless chorus of ""Garry Shandling! Garry Shandling!"" Watt, of course, has remained visible in the years since, both through his solo work, with the Stooges, and numerous other projects. Later this spring, fIREHOSE will reunite for their first tour dates since 1994. And though their work might never be quite as celebrated as that of the Minutemen, it is a pleasure to revisit a group that served so necessary a function for all involved, driven on by heart, their blue-collar work ethic, and stubborn perseverance.</p></div>"|16442.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16442-firehose-anthology/|7.9|Matthew Murphy

Bon Iver has been <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/45787-watch-bon-iver-covers-anais-mitchell/"" target=""_blank"">covering a new tune of hers</a>, ""Coming Down"", on their most recent tour, and Vernon sang on Mitchell's last release, 2010's <i>Hadestown</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">. That record was a 20-song, acoustic-driven opera telling the story of Orpheus and Eurydice, with Vernon voicing the former, Mitchell the latter, and Ani DiFranco occasionally showing up to play Persephone. The whole thing often felt like an all-star folk book on tape, and it was as impressive and lovely and unapproachable as it sounds. In some ways, Mitchell's latest album, <i>Young Man in America</i>, is just as ambitious, but it's more intimate and accessible than its predecessor, focused on the textures of everyday life and the odd, stirring power of Mitchell's voice.</span></p>
<p>Though <i>Young Man in America</i> follows the titular character through some of its songs (including the terrific opening suite, in which the haunting, primal ""Wilderland"" moves seamlessly into the title track) it is less a concept record and more, in her words, ""a meditation on a theme."" And it's because of this approach that, although it's certainly got the recent recession and certain aspects of American history in mind, <i>Young Man</i> pulls off the difficult feat of feeling political without ever being didactic. Its songs instead focus on the repetitions of everyday labor (one of its narrators ""Sew[s] a party dress/ In and out/ And in and out"") and see in all types of work equal importance (a wife who's about to give birth tells her shepherd husband, ""We both have laboring to do""). At first glance, the characters might seem remote from modern or everyday experience: a shepherd's wife who dies in childbirth, a seamstress, the occasional goddess. But in Mitchell's egalitarian eye, these characters are all animated with the same sort of life. The figures of farmers are chiseled into stone, and, in the lively strum of ""Venus"", a marble-carved goddess laughs, sings, and moans. Hers are the songs that make myths of men, and that make statues shimmy and shake.</p>
<p>Mitchell is a skilled storyteller; many of her songs move through absorbing narratives that pull the emotional rug out from under the listener at an expertly timed moment. The characters on <i>Young Man in America</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> all seem to begin relatively sure of themselves and end up sputtering, questioning, unraveling. ""He Did"" starts out as a rather sentimental song about the narrator's love for her father, but ends grappling with a series of personal quandaries in the wake of his death (""Who gave you your sorrow/...And an empty page to fill?""). Perhaps even more powerful, ""Tailor"" is told from the point of view of a woman who's always figured her character through the eyes of her man. ""When he said/ That he liked my cut of hair/ I became a barber,"" she sings, and so on through ""tailor,"" ""sculptress,"" and finally ""poet."" When he leaves her midway through the song, she's left doubting her own identity, ""Now that he's gone away/ There isn't anyone to say/ If I'm a diamond/ Or a dime-a-dozen."" Mitchell gives voice this woman's question at the end of the song, with quiet pathos that could appear on the lips of almost any of <i>Young Man</i>'s narrators: ""Who am I/ Who am I?""</span></p>
<p>Mitchell has a sweet, squeaky bleat that's somewhere between <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3096-joanna-newsom/"" target=""_blank"">Joanna Newsom</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2845-the-mountain-goats/"" target=""_blank"">John Darnielle</a>, and there will be those listeners who hear a verse or two of <i>Young Man</i> and dismiss her vocals as being precious or affected, but they'd be missing the point entirely. Mitchell's songs are never whimsical, sentimental, or light: Sex and death creep into her compositions as casually as they do real life. The words of these narrators gain a peculiar power when they're sung in a voice that sounds at times childlike and innocent, and her delivery gives these songs an emotional complexity that welcomes and even demands repeated listens. Same goes for the splendidly naturalistic arrangements, courtesy of producer Todd Sickafoose, which cast woodwinds as fluttering trees and crashing drums as characters' inner turmoil without ever feeling intrusive or overly literal. A few of the quieter songs like ""Dyin' Day"" and ""Annmarie"" pull from similar-sounding palettes, but the results are consistently immersive and rich.</p>
<p>Mitchell's father is a writer (that's an old picture of him on the cover), and one of <i>Young Man</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">'s most riveting narratives, ""Shepherd"", is her adaptation of one of his stories. It's a fitting statement from a record focused on the classic American conflict between having reverence for lineage but craving independence and unpredictability. Like her characters, Mitchell possesses a restless spirit, one that pulls from her musical predecessors and contemporaries but continues with each release to develop a way of looking at the world that's all her own.</span></p></div>"|16461.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16461-anais-mitchell-young-man-in-america/|7.8|Lindsay Zoladz

His lyrics evoke a mountain range as a lover's spine and a river's edge as a place of spiritual reckoning, subtly chronicling the epic geological changes that mirror immense human emotions. Mountains shift, rivers cut canyons, hearts yearn and break. That idea of transience and flux extends to the band itself. Just as Great Lake Swimmers have recorded in unusual spots over the past 10 years-- in an abandoned grain silo, deep within the remote Thousand Islands region of Ontario-- the group has changed and shifted with each album, although it has always remained centered on Dekker.</p>
<p><i>New Wild Everywhere</i>, their fifth record in a decade, not only introduces a semi-permanent quintet that includes two long-time collaborators, but marks the first time the Swimmers have recorded in a proper studio. The new lineup is more agile than previous incarnations, introducing flourishes of country and bluegrass into Dekker's naturalistic folk and creating a larger canvas for his landscapes. And yet, there's something missing here. Perhaps it's the outdoors, which on previous albums has come across more as a charming backstory than as an identifiable sonic element. In the relatively staid environment of an actual studio, however, they've made their weakest record to date, one that lacks the subtle power and distinctive personality of their best work.</p>
<p>Slower songs like ""Cornflower Blue"" and ""The Knife"" sound wan and maudlin; the gravity that Great Lake Swimmers easily captured on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3672-great-lake-swimmers/"" target=""_blank"">their debut</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10300-ongiara/"" target=""_blank""><i>Ongiara </i></a>has been replaced with a drab dreariness. But as the title suggests, the emphasis is squarely on more upbeat numbers-- wild by Great Lake Swimmers standards. The band too often strains for exuberance, as on the title track, a sort of geological party rock anthem. ""Rocks jump and jitter,"" Dekker sings. ""The weather breaks, the spirit shakes, and something switches on."" That kinetic imagery is undercut by Dekker's ungainly melody and the awkward interruptions of electric guitar in the chorus. The song nods at celebration, but never quite achieves that tone.</p>
<p>It's hard to say whether or not this is the fault of the new line-up, although Dekker does trip over his own heady lyrics on ""Fields of Progeny"" and ""Ballad of a Fisherman's Wife"". Lines like, ""This is a time bomb, and it could happen right here,"" sound like they're one or two drafts away from being finished. It's taken the band four years to follow up <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13042-lost-channels/"" target=""_blank"">Lost Channels</a>,</i> but <i>New Wild Everywhere</i> sounds hastily assembled. There are moments when they get everything right-- the subtle doo-wop flourish that gives opener ""Think That You Might Be Wrong"" its buoyancy, the loping melody that lends ""The Great Exhale"" its gravity-- but they're too few and far between. Great Lake Swimmers are at their liveliest when they've got dirt under their nails and mud on their clothes, and they clean up too well on <i>New Wild Everywhere</i>.</p></div>"|16451.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16451-new-wild-everywhere/|5.7|Stephen M.

His declaration is hardly provocative until you learn that Breton's HQ-- functioning as studio, home, squat, party venue-- is a disused bank in south London. You may recall a few news items about occupying banks over the past year. The borough in which these filmmakers-turned-musicians work is within scanty distance of Brixton, one of the epicenters of last summer's riots. It's one underground stop away from the converted bank that Aphex Twin's Richard James reportedly calls home in Elephant and Castle. From the roof of their building, you can apparently see the dilapidated, brutalist Heygate Estate; once considered a housing ideal, it's now mostly abandoned and awaiting destruction. </p>
<p>These social and cultural associations are a little too potent to tally with the fact that Breton named themselves after the Surrealist pioneer André Breton, who believed in the idea of unadulterated, organic thought. However, if their aesthetic is very neatly and surreptitiously codified, <i>Other People's Problems</i>-- note that ambiguously apolitical and/or accusatory title-- is a significantly more hodgepodge affair that cherry-picks influences from the surrounding area like a gentrification tourist. </p>
<p>Nearly 10 years ago, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/571-bloc-party/"" target=""_blank"">Bloc Party</a> released their first song as part of a compilation by Angular Records, a label run from New Cross, which is just a few miles from Breton's HQ. Bloc Party have since gone on to symbolize the kind of generic, unexciting British indie band from which Breton pain to distinguish themselves, yet the frenetic high-hats and tremulous mope of a song like ""Wood and Plastic"" do little to abet that aim. On ""Edward the Confessor"", their dated clubby aggression calls to mind Brixton's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/300-basement-jaxx/"" target=""_blank"">Basement Jaxx</a>; following that is ""2 Years"", whose delicate hummingbird wing synths and pitch shifted vocal aptly demonstrate what might happen if Christopher Nolan asked James Blake to soundtrack a mawkish moment for Batman. By the end of the record, there's little but a mildly Aphex-ish electronic glitch to distinguish them from a band like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5321-the-maccabees/"" target=""_blank"">the Maccabees</a>.</p>
<p>It's perhaps unfair to introduce Breton's music by way of comparison, as they do have plenty of their own ideas. Sadly, they're not well executed. The band appealed to German composer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26019-hauschka/"" target=""_blank"">Hauschka</a> to record brass and strings for the record, which he sent back for Breton to chop up and use at will. Unfortunately, his parts have largely been used with as much grace as a child smashing up a priceless vase and turning the pieces into a mosaic of a Transformer. Stripped of natural eloquence, what you imagine was once a violin swoop becomes a sampled, aggressive stab on opener ""Pacemaker""; the stuttering piano sample on ""Electrician"" sounds as if it's repeatedly throwing itself against a brick wall. Both come off like bad hip-hop beats. These classical elements are at odds with the messy, meaningless field recordings that litter the record, whose first half-- before it smoothes into an increasingly bland paste-- is characterized by a violent, backpacker beat that comes on like a drunk getting up in your face just for the sake of provocation.</p>
<p>There are what appear to be occasionally poetic but often frustratingly blank references in Breton's lyrics to the London riots and the death knell of the coalition government. Opener ""Pacemaker"" has Rappak yelping, ""When the end of a sigh comes announced with a brick/ Would it help us decide or run to the cell,"" a comparatively eloquent summation of the frustration and poverty that boiled over into violence last August, and the mis-targeted, scared recriminations that followed. The overdriven, static-drowned tone in his vocal makes it sound is if he recorded it on a mobile phone, another potent motif considering the DIY footage that populated 24-hour news feeds during the riots, and a stylization picked up on ""Edward the Confessor"". As ""2 Years"" seemingly harks back to the general election of May 2010, ""Governing Correctly"" bitterly thanks someone for providing the mistakes from which to learn. It's one of the most interesting songs on the record, the band chanting dispassionately whilst a naked, bruxing bass groove rubs up against mewling synths-- that is, until an absurdly bombastic club grind drowns any sense of dynamic, an acidic Skrillex-lite womp that also kills the end of ""Ghost Note"".</p>
<p>Perhaps not in the way that he had intentioned, Rappak's line about the band's lack of grand political statements turns out to be true. Final song ""The Commission"" comes in with the sound of smashing glass muted to a glimmer, another hesitant, mournful James Blake-like moment where Rappak mumbles sadly, ""You're forced to act,"" as if resenting current society's prompting them to become politicized. Their aesthetic is so meticulous, they may as well have painstakingly tattooed ""GRIT"" and ""PAIN"" onto their knuckles with a rusty fountain pen found in a cupboard at the bank, but beyond that, whatever <i>Other People's Problems</i> is trying to say is lost beneath the fact that it's so sonically muddled and abrasive, and lyrically imprecise. Is their pebble-dashed sound documenting the urban decay and social degradation of the city, commenting or criticizing? Or are they just pillaging and riffling through their surrounding influences with little fixed idea of their eventual goal? For now, it feels more like the latter.</p></div>"|16465.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16465-other-peoples-problems/|4.9|Laura Snapes

As with other acts on New Jersey-based <a href=""http://vivaitalians.blogspot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Italians Do It Better</a>, a label co-founded by group mastermind Johnny Jewel, Chromatics didn't just incorporate the vocoders and vintage synth arpeggios of the turn-of-the-1980s originals, they added the brittle guitars, dubby reverb, and urban dread of post-punk. </p>
<p>In the years since, the label's emphasis on grainy synths, smokey ambience, and analog-fetishizing textures became the M.O. of an entire class of artists. And the band's 2007 <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10763-night-drive/"" target=""_blank""><i>Night Drive</i></a> set the blueprint for last year's Nicolas Winding Refn-directed thriller <i>Drive</i>; featuring two Jewel-assisted tracks, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15908-various-artists-drive/"" target=""_blank"">the film's soundtrack</a> exposed this music to a wider audience. Earlier this year, Jewel built on that momentum by releasing a two-hour epic created with fellow Chromatics member Nat Walker.

<p><i>Kill for Love</i>, Chromatics' first album since <i>Night Drive</i>, finally gives this loosely associated, prematurely decayed musical aesthetic its magnum opus-- and brilliantly transcends it. The moonlit vibe of previous highlights like street-skulking stunner ""In the City"" or haunting Kate Bush cover ""Running Up That Hill"" recurs, and various tracks still crackle and pop with the all-too-mortal degradation of vinyl. And despite the unfinished-seeming recording quality of the music videos that preceded the album's release, the completed product also boasts some of the most engrossing synth-pop songs so far this year. </p>
<p>The 90-minute <i>Kill</i><i> for Love</i> signals its tour-de-force ambitions from the opening track, a synth-draped cover of Neil Young's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13146-into-the-black/"" target=""_blank"">""Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black)""</a>. As with their past brooding renditions of Bruce Springsteen's ""I'm on Fire"" or Dark Day's ""Hands in the Dark"", it's a thoroughly rewarding pop deconstruction, setting one of singer Ruth Radelet's most affecting performances against an evocatively restrained backdrop. ""There's more to the picture than meets the eye,"" Radelet coos, in what emerges here as a key lyric. There's more to <i>Kill for Love</i> than the sum of its best songs.</p>
<p>That said, <i>Kill for Love</i>'s clearest improvement over <i>Night Drive</i> comes in its impressive clutch of left-field synth-pop standouts. The pill-dropping insomniac rush of the<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13146-into-the-black/"" target=""_blank""> title track</a> is the most likely to propel Chromatics onto the kinds of late-night TV stages and festival billings lately seized by M83, but the existential ache of ""Back From the Grave"" is no less gorgeously catchy. The bleakly yearning ""Lady"" returns to the group's signature Italo glide but wisely ditches the robotic vocal effects of a previously released late-2005 recording. When Jewel suggested in a recent Pitchfork <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/45098-johnny-jewel-talks-symmetry-drive-music-glass-candy-and-chromatics-lps/"" target=""_blank"">interview</a> that he was more influenced by Madonna than by crate-digging Eurodisco rarities, it was logical to wonder if he was being falsely modest. That is, until hearing ""These Streets Will Never Look the Same"", which stretches ""Eye of the Tiger""-like guitar tension into an eight-minute treatise on loneliness and includes the album's first male lead vocal, rendered cyborg-like by a vocal harmonizer. Or take the vampire-pallid lament ""Running From the Sun"", another male-led track, based on piano chords reminiscent of those found on Cyndi Lauper's ""Time After Time"". Fans who discovered Chromatics through <i>Drive</i> will find plenty of easy entry points here.</p>
<p>Still, just as the pop songs on <i>Kill for Love</i> are more direct than on <i>Night Drive</i>, the interstitial tracks are also more expansive and abstract. ""Time is stretching on/ And it keeps repeating/ As the beat goes on,"" Radelet sings, on the deceptively uptempo last-ditch plea ""At Your Door"", and those words could just as easily apply to the album's instrumentals (and near-instrumentals). Nevertheless, even the record's most ephemeral moments are more deeply engaging than their equivalents on the last album, livened up by disembodied vocals and orchestral touches. Though there appear to be as many references to walking and riding trains as to driving, the album is at least as cinematic as <i>Themes for an Imaginary Film</i>. In fact, the languorous ""There's a Light Out on the Horizon"" goes so far as to revive <i>Night Driv</i>e's phone-call conceit, though with results that are more beautifully agonizing.</p>
<p>After a front-loaded opening and sprawling, bewitching midsection, <i>Kill for Love</i> resurfaces with two tracks that encapsulate what Chromatics do, in an uncompromising way that's sure to confound as many people as it awes. ""The River"" reprises the Symmetry album's nearly <i>a cappella</i> closing track as glacial synth-pop, with finger snaps and artificial strings lending emotional support to Radelet's stiff-lipped vocal performance as a woman left behind. And then there's a sparsely forbidding 14-minute instrumental finale, available on the digital versions of the album, which is appropriate of Jewel's recent tendency to talk up 20th-century classical composers like Karlheinz Stockhausen and John Cage rather than film scorers like John Carpenter.</p>
<p>If <i>Kill for Love</i> had been a 10-track LP, with its most immediately striking songs each edited down to around 3 minutes, it would've still been impressive. In fact, as recently as an interview posted last month by <i><a href=""http://www.self-titledmag.com/2012/03/03/johnny-jewel-reveals-details-of-after-dark-ii-and-new-albums-from-chromatics-and-glass-candy-kill-for-love-body-work/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Self-Titled</a></i>, Jewel hadn't yet made up his mind about whether to put out one or two discs. Ultimately, he made the right choice. Closer ""No Escape"" may not be as immediate as the title track when heard in isolation, but luckily, we don't have to listen to it in isolation. Just as on albums by the War on Drugs, Deerhunter, and countless others, the experimental interludes here help create a context that makes the pop songs that much more effective; by including so many mood-oriented parts, <i>Kill for Love</i> paradoxically rises above hazy synth-pop's occupational hazard of dissolving into a blur of mood and mood alone. It's not just a collection of hits; it's an <i>album</i>, one that gives the project's familiar nocturnal foreboding a new sense of grandeur. </p></div>"|16452.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16452-kill-for-love/|8.7|Marc Hogan

That relatively short span feels surprising in light of their latest release, a nine-song soundtrack for the post-apocalyptic surf film <i>Year Zero</i>. Combining edits of their best tunes from previous records with five new pieces that tug at the range of their oeuvre, the set feels like the sort of compulsory stopgap a band might make after years of inactivity, not at the time when you'd expect a new record. A little like a greatest hits, a little like a soundtrack, and a little like a collaborative art project, Black Mountain's 51 minutes of music for <i>Year Zero</i> serve as a reminder of how good this band has sometimes been and as a tease of the music they might still make.</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>Year Zero</i> pulls from each of the three Black Mountain full-lengths, spanning from the first tune on the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1146-black-mountain/"" target=""_blank"">first album</a>-- the squiggly freedom march ""Modern Music"", with its shrieking horns and shout-along stoned vocals-- to the cascading, sloganeering title track of the band's most recent LP. Black Mountain's best and most cohesive album, 2008's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11056-in-the-future/"" target=""_blank""><i>In the Future</i></a>, is the only title to place two tracks here; an edit of ""Tyrants"" washes into the sound of waves before it's ready, while the masterfully sequenced ""Bright Light"" trims the jam fat to go from almost 17 minutes to just beyond 13. That cut affords a perfect transition into <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13234-mary-lou/"" target=""_blank"">""Mary Lou""</a>, one of the five new pieces. Of the fresh takes, ""Mary Lou"" is the most prototypically Black Mountain, building from a slow-burn intro into a chanted hook that eventually smears into a great exit, guitars and keyboards and harmonies flickering quickly until they slowly burn away. It's the sort of Black Mountain ripper that would've fit best on <i>In the Future</i>. </p>
<p>Elsewhere, the band tries new looks, especially since Amber Webber handles lead vocals on all of them. (That's a fortunate look for the somewhat ill-conceived <i>Year Zero</i>, too, a film about a ""new world"" in which women seem to do little more than party, look sexy, and cheerlead beefy surfer bros.) Closer ""Breathe"" swoops into a broad shoegaze arch, her voice the light of relief through a web of distortion and saturation. During ""Embrace Euphoria"", she calmly reads the film's new-order credo-- a short poem epitomized by ""Put down your possessions and follow us into the infinite""-- above a set of interlocking synthesizer hums and whirs. Webber also leads opener ""Phosphorescent Waves"", a march of drum machines and synthesizers that sounds at once foreboding and redemptive, the invocation correctly suggests dawn breaking after a night of violent squalls. She ends it with another poem, just as she opens ""In Sequence"", a placeholder piece of serial drum machines and synthesizers. Suggesting the elemental dance music of Manuel Göttsching overrun by his band Ash Ra Tempel, these three Black Mountain pieces don't force such psychedelic influences into rock'n'roll; instead, they suggest possibilities for the band by letting such ideas stand on their own merits. That is, on <i>Year Zero</i>, Black Mountain finally start to sound like an experimental rock band, not a rock band with experimental influences. </p>
<p>During <i>Year Zero</i>, director Joe G. cuts between these pieces, using the mass of music almost like a reel of footage-- cutting off sections, hopscotching between tracks, focusing on dramatic bits. At their respective bests, both the film and Black Mountain's music for it help tease out new, parallel elements about one other. At their most compelling, Black Mountain's long-form instrumental explorations imply a certain sense of danger-- all the pieces condense into a knotty mess, with guitars and synthesizers, drums and bass vying for room in claustrophobic conditions. In <i>Year Zero</i>, producer Joe G. keys on those moments, synching those uncertain bits with surfers who either emerge unscathed from a wave that seemed ready to wipe them or arrive frustrated, shaking the water from their hair on the shore while holding a snapped board. And whether it's the bass chug of ""Mary Lou"" or the slack-jawed insouciance of  ""Modern Music"", Black Mountain's music is often pretty damn fun. And despite any escape-to-aquatic-Eden pretensions, <i>Year Zero</i> is a small movie with awesome shots of people on big waves. Somehow, a Canadian band named Black Mountain serves that purpose well.</p></div>"|16457.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16457-year-zero-soundtrack/|6.6|Grayson Currin

More than anything, it nailed that feeling of getting a couple-three beers in you, flipping on the four-track, and watching the results roll in; in other words, not bad for a bunch of old guys. <i>Mouseman Cloud</i> is the beyond-prolific GBV frontman <a href=""http://robertpollard.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Robert Pollard</a>'s first solo LP since <i>Factory</i>, and comparisons between the two are inevitable.</p>
<p>Recorded with his longtime foil Todd Tobias-- and, according to Pollard, with the emphasis on wordplay, not songcraft<i>-- Mouseman</i> is, tune for tune, nearly <i>Factory</i>'s equal. But, like so much of Pollard's recent solo work, the lack of warm bodies in the room throughout <i>Mouseman</i> is practically something you can hear, with its bad decisions lined up right alongside the good ones. <i>Factory</i> was a genuinely weird record, but it's a weirdness it seemed to come by honestly. Pollard seems bound and determined to make <i>Mouseman</i> even weirder, drilling its left-field, literalism-be-damned lyrics directly into your skull. But up against even a standard-issue Pollardian ripper like ""Bats Flew Up""-- which, being about bats and all, is plenty weird itself-- these flat, rather forced attempts at oddballery give <i>Mouseman</i> a scattered, self-conscious feel it never quite shakes for more than a couple of minutes at a time.</p>
<p>Opener ""Obvious #1"" turns quickly into a real slog, a tumble of chords that finds Pollard muttering, ""it's gotten very obvious… it's too obvious,"" for what seems like an eternity. ""Picnic Drums"" takes a while to get going, but when it does, it really moves; Tobias finds just the right kind of grit on the quick ones here, neatly mimicking the in-the-red zip of Pollard's mid-1990s classics. The cascading percussion that closes out the proggy ""Picnic Drums"" was a risk worth taking, but as with almost all of Pollard's recent solo LPs, the faster stuff tends to trample the moony ballads and the stormier mid-tempo offerings. Chunky highlight ""Bats Flew Up"" is the kind of song you wish Pollard could write a thousand more of, and lean, muscular rockers like ""I Was Silence"" and ""Aspirin Moon"" come across with the giddy urgency of a first take.</p>
<p>Pollard's a got a way with words, no doubt about it, and even the most straightaway Pollard song isn't immune to a little poetic pastiche. But calling so much attention to the words on <i>Mouseman</i> seems like a mistake once you've heard what it is he's saying. After ""Obvious"", <i>Mouseman</i> takes its biggest dip with the mid-LP one-two gutpunch of ""Mother's Milk and Magnets"" and ""Continue to Break"". The former repeats its one-line chorus more than a dozen stultifying times in just over three minutes; the latter manages at least as many uninterrupted instances of ""Grandfather blues continues to shoot up the six o'clock news"" in two minutes and change. As Pollardian throwaways, these aren't bad; lined up like this, though, with the spotlight shone directly on them, they take mere seconds to grate, and repeat listens do them no favors. Pollard does get in some appealing nonsense here and there, but then again, he always does. When most Pollard diehards have long since given up on understanding everything that comes out of the man's mouth, that he's emphatically hammering home this nonsense proves doubly frustrating.</p>
<p>There's more than a couple of solid rockers and a few quirk-laden curiosities bringing up <i>Mouseman</i>'s average; the lurching urgency of ""Smacks of Euphoria"" is matched to some truly bizarre lyrics about ""a little shape-shifting shit,"" and the way he sings ""Half-Strained"" is both weirdly fitting and unimpeachably fun. But, for every sign of life, there's a stretch of pro-forma late-era Pollard rock, littered with garish lyrical left-turns and dressed up in Tobias' unobtrusive-cum-unimaginative arrangements. The feeling of spontaneity that marked Factory feels rather forced here; by self-consciously underlining his wackier side instead of just being the natural weirdo he always is, Pollard's essentially throwing off his own balance. A good thought exercise, perhaps, but it makes for kind of a tough listen. He'd be the last to admit it, but all this seems to speak to the overextension that Pollard's probably experiencing right now. Though it's rare to be into April and only have two Pollard albums to show for the year, juggling a touring band with his own peculiar recording schedule hasn't happened in some time, and on the spotty, lyrically strained <i>Mouseman</i>, the cracks are showing.</p></div>"|16456.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16456-mouseman-cloud/|5.7|Paul Thompson

Now, after being released from jail just over a year ago, he's taking on a predictable, and yet maybe impossible, task: regaining relevance in a kid's game. <i>H.N.I.C. 3 </i>is P's latest and most high-profile attempt at finding his footing in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30007-asap-rocky/"" target=""_blank"">A$AP Rocky</a>'s New York, and though the elements of what made him one of the city's greats are still readily present, the tape is disappointingly scattershot and unfocused. Much of it flies in the face of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10116-return-of-the-mac/"" target=""_blank""><i>Return of the Mac</i></a>, the cohesive 40-minute solo album released in 2007 that distilled his genius into a startlingly good record.</p>
<p><i>H.N.I.C. 3 </i>clocks in at 26 tracks, and unless you're Biggie or Tupac, that's too many tracks. What's worse is that most of the songs that make up the album's second half are no longer than a minute or two. In theory that should blunt the blow of the tracklist just a bit, but in reality it challenges your interest in the record by making you openly question Prodigy's level of investment. Unlike, say, Gunplay's recent <i>Bogota Rich</i>, a mixtape that more or less deployed the same strategy, the succession of one-hitters here leaves you much less eager to hear what the artist may still be holding onto and more wondering why all this stuff wasn't either left on a hard drive or worked into actual songs. Maybe the most obvious example of the carelessness is the innocuous inclusion of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50jVMAha5X4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Type""</a>, Prodigy's collaboration with Curren$y, released last year on the latter's <i>Covert Coupe</i>. This sort of double dipping is by no means unusual in the rap world, but when slotted as track 23 and sandwiched between two songs that are less than 90 seconds long, it perfectly encapsulates the project's lack of direction.</p>
<p>It may actually be best to just pretend that <i>H.N.I.C. 3 </i>ends after the 10th song, because up to that point it's a pretty good, if slightly uninspiring, mixtape. In that small batch of tracks, P reunites with Mobb Deep partner Havoc for the type of thing they've been doing for decades, while also seamlessly integrating himself into a certain slice of contemporary rap. As far as the latter goes, it's no surprise that collaborations with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30094-french-montana/"" target=""_blank"">French Montana</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29211-waka-flocka-flame/"" target=""_blank"">Waka Flocka Flame</a> result in the tape's best tracks. Although French's main influence is Dipset's skewed radio rap and Waka's is classic Atlanta crunk, both follow in Prodigy's footsteps as compelling rappers who prioritize things like aura, emotion, and grittiness over more traditional elements such as rhyming. The combination of French's sleazy hook singing, P's gruff growling, and producer Harry Fraud's warm, relaxed funk on ""Lay Low"" is the closest we get to the heights Prodigy hit in his brief pre-jail resurgence.</p>
<p><i>H.N.I.C 3 </i>has found little buzz, and it's not hard to understand why. But the good news for both Prodigy and listeners is that his place in the canon is cemented and, more importantly, his last great album isn't decades in the rearview. He is respected and his music is still anticipated, and when his next project comes out, it will still be met with open ears and high hopes. But attention spans are short, and if whatever P has in store isn't more focused and coherent, he may have to revert back to all-caps blog posts that reassure us, and himself, of his importance.</p></div>"|16459.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16459-hnic-3/|5.5|Jordan Sargent

So it makes sense that he's become a mainstay of the event, culminating in a fierce performance in 2011 with Dan Auerbach of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/375-the-black-keys/"" target=""_blank"">the Black Keys</a>. That onstage collaboration extended into the studio, as the younger performer produced the elder's latest album, <i>Locked Down. </i>You're right to be skeptical: A certain amount of success gives an artist the leeway to work with his heroes, and for every <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4961-van-lear-rose/"" target=""_blank"">Van Lear Rose</a>,</i> there's Justin Vernon shouting out Bruce Hornsby. Auerbach has already done production work for Jessica Lea Mayfield, the Ettes, and Hacienda, but <i>Locked Down </i>is his first intergenerational record.</p>
<p>It's an unlikely collaboration, primarily because the man born Mac Rebennack seemed destined for a respectful revival focusing on his New Orleans roots and the melting pot of styles and sounds represented by the Third Ward. Think Joe Henry, some Americana fans, and a Grammy nomination. On the other hand, it's not like <i>Locked Down </i>represents a comeback for Dr. John: If not exactly prolific, he's been consistent throughout the last decade, releasing at least one album every two years and entertaining new twists on his time-tested Big Easy rock. Even so, this album still stands out among his recent work, not so much for the leap of faith he took collaborating with Auerbach but because it turned out so damn well.</p>
<p>Producing and playing like there's no such thing as boomer nostalgia, the Black Key not only respects Dr. John's southern-fried eccentricities but amplifies them. <i>Locked Down</i> is a weird-ass gumbo of grotty funk and R&amp;B, littered with raunchy reeds, leering organ riffs, and blustery guitar. Often it sounds busy and overcooked, but that's better than chaste reverence on any day. The idea isn't to evoke Bourbon Street or some staid idea of New Orleans history. Instead, these songs trace dead ends and back alleys, wandering past houses still bearing high-water marks, finally arriving at a party no tourist was invited to.</p>
<p>While it's never explicitly invoked on <i>Locked Down</i>, Katrina haunts these songs and fires Dr. John's outrage over class inequities and flawed American systems, whether social or judicial. The songs are enlivened by that anger, and if he occasionally sounds like he's shooing the kids off his lawn-- ""kids with Uzis, icing suckers,"" he laments on ""Ice Age""-- at least he's still got some fire in him. Even at 71, his voice has lost little of its distinctive rubberiness, which makes him sound like a more agile Tom Waits, only with a thick Creole accent on ""Eleggua"" and ""Kingdom of Izzness"".</p>
<p>Not one of these songs proceeds in any expected, predictable way. ""You Lie"" and ""My Children, My Angels"" may be the most immediately catchy, but every track boasts a prominent hook, whether it's Auerbach's extended guitar outro on ""Getaway"" or the second line <i>Shaft</i> funk of ""Eleggua"". Much like his local forebears from Fats Domino to Professor Longhair, Dr. John has never met a style that he couldn't integrate into his music, so the Afro-pop guitars on ""Ice Age"" and the rumbling syncopations of ""Revolution"" don't sound out of place from him. On the other hand, they're a surprise coming from Auerbach, whose vocabulary once began and ended with lo-fi blues rock. So perhaps <i>Locked Down</i> represents a bigger leap for him than for Dr. John, who presides over the album with his usual authority. But both men understand that none of these sounds or ideas is of any use if it doesn't move.</p></div>"|16455.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16455-locked-down/|7.5|Stephen M. Deusner

With <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7862-bradford-cox/"" target=""_blank"">Bradford Cox</a> fronting the group as one of rock's most dominant personalities, it's easy to view <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/11920-lockett-pundt/"" target=""_blank"">Lockett Pundt</a> as following in the lineage of reclusive guitar wizards who serve as a necessary counterbalance.  Whether or not Cox goes off the grid any given night, you can catch Pundt standing catatonically still and staring off into the distance when his gaze isn't intently focused on an armada of effects pedals. </p>
<p>Based on that persona, no one could've been surprised by his solo bow as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22753-lotus-plaza/"" target=""_blank"">Lotus Plaza</a>, 2009's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12844-the-floodlight-collective/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Floodlight Collective</i></a>. A mélange of looped guitar and amorphous vocals slathered in amniotic goo, it wouldn't have stood out in any year, and released smack dab in the midst of indie's deadbeat summer, it was the kind of solo record that could only be the result of a guy who goes to the greatest lengths possible to not get noticed. But even if he gets approximately 0% of the good quotes in any Deerhunter interview, the relatively egalitarian division of the band's songwriting labor makes <i>Spooky Action At A Distance </i>every bit as unsurprising as its predecessor. In an infinitely more rewarding way, of course: save for a minute-long intro that recalls <i>Floodlight, </i>these are nine reminders that Pundt also is responsible for soft-focus beauty of ""Agoraphobia"", ""Neither of Us, Uncertainly"", and the juggernaut centerpiece of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14681-halcyon-digest/"" target=""_blank""><i>Halcyon Digest</i></a>, ""Desire Lines"". This consistency means <i>Spooky Action </i>lacks the galvanizing force of Deerhunter and the unpredictability of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5633-atlas-sound/"" target=""_blank"">Atlas Sound</a>, but in fully realizing its comparatively modest ambitions, it's one of the strongest indie rock records of the year so far.</p>
<p>Comparing how Cox and Pundt function in their solo ventures tempts a needless quarterback controversy, but nonetheless, it is helpful to see how they're complementary. While Atlas Sound allows Cox to indulge in genres, collaborations, and haircuts that wouldn't vibe with Deerhunter, Pundt tends to find inspiration in limitations, patterns and forms. Pundt prefers echoing guitar, slow-moving vocal melodies, and distorted washes that generally signify qualifiers like ""shoegaze"" and ""dream-pop,"" but neither of those really sit well with me. The ""dream"" part implies exaggeration or illogic, while nearly all of <i>Spooky Distance </i>is handcrafted,<i> </i>thriving on structure and restraint-- a constant, kraut-like pulse, strict patterns of verses and choruses broken down into repeating chord progressions, loops, loops, and more loops. </p>
<p>Moreover, along the lines of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27602-real-estate/"" target=""_blank"">Real Estate</a> and especially<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9633-the-war-on-drugs/"" target=""_blank""> the War On Drugs</a>, Pundt embodies a wakeful, meditative state associated with various forms of transit: your physical being stays relatively still while being in motion, a symbiosis between human and mechanical effort. I can't help but think of each song here as having some sort of vehicular spirit animal, so to speak. As with ""Desire Lines"", the anti-flash ""solo"" that breaks from the casually soaring chorus of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13140-strangers/"" target=""_blank"">""Strangers""</a> could be visually represented as medians on a deserted open road, and the anticipatory effect of its repetition brings the relief of arrival during the final minute of decrescendo. Meanwhile, the timbres on ""Out of Touch"" are fit for a vigorous bike ride, sleigh bells and metallic guitar loops jangling rhythmically over a cyclical kick drum pattern. The shambling acoustic closer ""Black Buzz"" feels just right for foot traffic, and ""Jet Out of the Tundra"" cruises at speed like its namesake, the same handful of chords repeating throughout a remarkably brisk seven minutes while Pundt seamlessly adds and removes trebly acoustic strums, Superball bass riffs, and a gorgeous, one-finger piano melody like he's slowly pulling levers in the cockpit. <i>Spooky Action </i>then plays out like ten self-contained, daily commutes where familiarity brings not contempt but a private joy in recognizing the landmarks and shortcuts.</p>
<p>Lest it seem like <i>Spooky Action </i>is an overly subtle work, it's worth reiterating that its 44 minutes are unerringly tuneful and immediate, the sort of thing that seems unambitious until you step back and ask yourself just how many records out there manage to actually pull it off. And Pundt's means of cranking out one instantly memorable chorus after another brings to mind someone who's incredibly good at sports wagering: there's surely some intuition and luck involved, but Pundt's a guy who's figured out how certain mismatches and trends work to his advantage. To get specific: the hyperextended guitar bends that push ""White Galactic One"" are technically a slight bit <i>off</i>, yet it's that serration that demonstrates why things like these are called ""hooks.<i>"" </i>Where a specific minor chord might be more harmonically congruent, Pundt inserts a major and the result finds ""Monoliths"" and ""Strangers"" stocked with ear-turning melodies as opposed to folky familiarity. Heck, it's likely the greatest testament to Pundt's abilities that <i>Spooky Action </i>is in a major key and dedicated to simple pleasures of escape and memory more often than your typical ""power-pop"" record, and yet it always comes off as warm and generous rather than cloying.</p>
<p>And so while Lotus Plaza is truly a solo project for Pundt, I hear more purposeful solitude than isolation-- like reading a book or swimming laps, ""antisocial"" with all the pejorative connotations removed. Maybe I'm reading too much into things, but in light of Deerhunter's notoriously volatile personnel dynamic preceding <i>Halcyon Digest</i>, it's tempting to hear Lotus Plaza as Pundt's platonic ideal for a band, where people are as predictable and helpful as loops and are united in their pursuit of the kind of reverberant pop music that makes perfect sense for the times you most enjoy getting caught up in your own thoughts. It's a common ambition for artists to capture the music that plays out in their head and if <i>Spooky Action</i> is really what Pundt's hearing, you can't really blame him for looking so lost within himself all the time.</p></div>"|16432.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16432-lotus-plaza-spooky-action-at-a-distance/|8.4|Ian Cohen

""College Grad Moves to Fashionable Urban Enclave and Starts a Garage Rock Band"" isn't the most compelling headline, regardless of whether the music is any good. How do you get people to pay attention? One common method in the last couple of years has been to swaddle your music in the gauze of ""mystery"": no bio, no photos, a cryptic name that puts the artist one step ahead of the engineers writing Google's search algorithms. Another is to actually live an unusual life before you first sit down with a publicist to write a press release. This is the path of Chicago's Willis Earl Beal.</p>
<p>Before news came earlier this year that he'd signed to a subsidiary of indie giant XL, very few people outside of Chicago had heard of Beal. A profile in the <a href=""http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/willis-earl-beal-found-magazine-acousmatic-sorcery/Content?oid=4330114"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Chicago Reader</i></a> from July of last year told the story of a 27-year-old African-American man who grew up on the South Side of Chicago, had been in the Army, lived with his grandmother, bummed around Albuquerque, and sometimes left CD-Rs of his music in random places. He was a visual artist who had drawn the attention of <a href=""http://foundmagazine.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Found Magazine</i></a>. He printed his phone number on flyers and invited people to call him and he would sing them a song. He busked a capella on El platforms. After the news came that he'd signed to XL, we discovered that he had auditioned the reality television show ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/45724-watch-willis-earl-beal-on-the-x-factor/"" target=""_blank"">The X Factor</a>"". Add it all up and the urge to ask, ""What's the deal with this guy?"" is overwhelming.</p>
<p>Beal's debut album, <i>Acousmatic Sorcery</i>, which consists of of home-recorded songs stretching back over the last few years, doesn't answer this question. But it does suggest that the answer, when it finally comes, may well be fascinating. The first thing working in Beal's favor is his astonishing voice. One moment it's a soft and modest whisper, the kind of instrument that makes you want to lean in a little bit to make everything out. On songs like ""Sambo Joe From the Rainbow"", ""Monotony"", and ""Evening's Kiss"", all of which are sung quietly with just a steady strum of a guitar string or two, Beal is firmly in the mode of the late-night home-recording folkie. All seem like songs he might have recorded at 3 a.m. after being asleep for an hour two, trying to get them down before a short burst of dream inspiration faded. They are haunting and beautiful, and his barely-tuned guitar strumming, as well as the hermetic and occasionally surreal lyrics, brings to mind Jandek, an artist he admires.</p>
<p>But this is only one of his modes. ""Take Me Away"" finds Beal singing in a full-throated howl on a song that touches on blues by-way-of-field-holler. Accompanying his moans and growl is some kind of cheap, distorted hand-made percussion. Here Beal's love of Tom Waits is readily apparent-- if Waits stuck a version of ""Take Me Away"" on the back half of <i>Mule Variations</i> no one would have batted an eye. And then on ""Ghost Robot"", Beal does a (awkward, ultimately) version of rap that actually feels closer to Lost Poets-style proto-rap than anything hip-hop proper has produced in the last 30 years.</p>
<p>""Ghost Robot"" aside, Beal brings something to the table no matter what kind of music he's making, and the highlights of <i>Sorcery</i> are impressive. But there's also a nagging sense that the songwriting and vision hasn't quite caught up with the talent. His lyrics have too many clunkers, his songs don't seem quite developed. In a different world, this would be Beal's third or fourth release, the one that comes after a couple of strong albums, serving to show his fans that he was doing something interesting early and on his own. This is not to say that the four-track lo-fi approach can't lead to great and important music-- see the recent issue of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16400-weed-forestin/"" target=""_blank""><i>Weed Forestin'</i></a>, the first solo release by <a href=""http://cms.pitchfork.com/artists/586-lou-barlow/"" target=""_blank"">Lou Barlow</a>'s Sentridoh. Sometimes crude technology suits the music perfectly. But Beal's music seems to want something more. Songwriting aside, in his case, the limitations feel like just that-- something that prevents the work from being fully realized.</p>
<p>In that respect and a few others (the impressive vocal range, songs filled with introspection an ear for junkyard percussion) Beal has something in common with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27618-tune-yards/"" target=""_blank"">tUnE-yArDs</a> circa <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12851-bird-brains/"" target=""_blank"">BiRd-BrAiNs</a>, even if his songs don't stand up to where Merrill Garbus' were then. So while <i>Acousmatic Sorcery</i> is interesting and occasionally even great on its own, it ultimately feels very much like a hyper-creative and gifted artist trying to figure out what he's doing. He's woodshedding, and it's often rewarding to listen in. But even during the best moments, you can't help thinking ahead to what might come next.</p></div></div>"|16454.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16454-acousmatic-sorcery/|7.2|Mark Richardson

Prismatic, kaleidoscopic, and oversaturated with color, it endlessly resituates itself between towering chamber-folk, cyclonic <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5136-marnie-stern/"" target=""_blank"">Marnie Stern</a>-style spazz, and orchestral psych. Between its frantic opener ""Epic"" and its swooning closer ""Don't Lie Down"", Wyland and drummer Dana Vlatka whip through ostentatious sonic cathedrals at breakneck speed. Wyland may be a dedicated craftsman, but he's an impatient tourguide, and on <i>Both Lights</i>, his insistence of forward motion leaves the listener without much time to settle down and enjoy the view.</p>
<p>Wyland's ascendant melodies are always on the verge of overcomplicating themselves; they ripple, soar, then double-back, accruing new layers on each pass. Though his arrangements hover around the kitchen sink, he manages to balance moments of brassy everything-at-once bombast with swatches of stripped-back serenity, travelling from a full-on group shoutalong to a simple voice-and-synth wash in one fell swoop. Though he sometimes struggles at a higher mph, his music tends to be at its best when it's on the move; the trickier the rhythm, it seems, the odder the angles at which he can set off his melodies. Save the too-stark ballad ""The Veil""-- which all but stops <i>Both Lights</i> in its tracks-- and the fraught ""Epic"" and ""Why I Must"", <i>Both Lights</i> finds Wyland giving himself plenty of space to expand his sound both upward at outward, making it among the most sumptuous-sounding AU records to date.</p>
<p>Comparisons to singular acts like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/96-animal-collective/"" target=""_blank"">Animal Collective</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1843-grizzly-bear/"" target=""_blank"">Grizzly Bear</a> have dogged Wyland practically since the start of AU; as those bands have evolved, so, too, has Wyland, as echoes of their most recent work-- along with roughly half of the other critically acclaimed wing of indie rock of the last half-decade-- ring out loudly here. You could call Wyland an expert mimic, but what <i>Both Lights</i> does is trickier than mere idolatry; certain resemblances, like the haunting Ed Droste/<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3241-panda-bear/"" target=""_blank"">Panda Bear</a> hybrid ""Don't Lie Down"", are uncanny, but Wyland usually strikes the right kind of recombinative balance with his contemporaries, draping one over another until it becomes its own sort of crystalline cacophony. The trouble with AU's tracks isn't so much that they sometimes sound like somebody else's; the real issue is that they all too often sound like several somebodies, mostly familiar, all playing at the same damn time. Centerpiece <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12859-solid-gold/"" target=""_blank"">""Solid Gold""</a> begins as a clear-hearted piano ballad; 45 seconds in, it's made the leap into post-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/37519-characteristically-freaky-new-animal-collective-video-brother-sport/"" target=""_blank"">""Brother Sport""</a> skitter. A minute later, it escalates again, a zig-zagging guitar drawing sharp lines through the track. Any one of these would've been a fine idea to explore, expand upon; hopscotching between them, as Wyland does here, is dizzying.</p>
<p>Still, it's fairly easy to get good and lost in <i>Both Lights</i>' labyrinthine tangles; it's bringing something back that proves a little tougher. Wyland's a fine enough singer with a voice that sometimes feels as malleable as his instrumentation. But he's neither our greatest enunciator nor our most gripping lyricist, and over time, his vocals have never quite emerged as the eye around which his melodies could swirl. He gets off some lovely harmonies here and a couple oddball lines there, but you could listen to <i>Both Lights</i> a dozen times without much sense of what the guy's trying to say with it; as often as not, he seems content to sweep himself up in the swirl rather than place himself in the center of it. Sometimes it seems constant forward motion is the only thing holding these tracks together, but these little shards of melodies often slip by quick enough to escape your notice. It's not that there aren't plenty of fine ideas swirling around <i>Both Lights</i>; there are, in fact, altogether too many, resulting in something of a head-spinning mess, one Wyland's got  to somehow settle out if he's ever going to connect with people the way the music of his peers has. His commitment to constant movement is, oddly enough, both the best and worst thing about him; <i>Both Lights</i> may be plenty gorgeous, but in Wyland's never-idle hands, that beauty proves fleeting.</p></div>"|16450.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16450-both-lights/|6.6|Paul Thompson

Coming in the wake of the band's critically adored 1991 breakthrough <i>Bandwagonesque</i>, the moment effectively marked the Scottish bubble-grunge quartet's Stateside high watermark, before they receded from the indie-rock frontlines with a series of increasingly sporadic and increasingly mellow releases that gradually sucked the power out of their pop.</p>
<p>Now, as per the clockwork 20-year nostalgia cycle, the Fannies' formative fuzz-pop sound has been making something of a resurgence via tunefully dissonant successors like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28604-yuck/"" target=""_blank"">Yuck</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27360-the-pains-of-being-pure-at-heart/"" target=""_blank"">the Pains of Being Pure at Heart</a>. But rather than pull the obvious move-- i.e., a 20th-anniversary tour of <i>Bandwagonesque</i> that would turn <a href=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/80/Bandwagonfanclubalbum.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the mock moneybag on the cover</a> into the real deal-- the Fanclub's principal songwriters continue to spiritually drift away from their past: Last year, Norman Blake introduced <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15344-jonny/"" target=""_blank"">Jonny</a>, his quirky prog-pop collaboration with Euros Childs of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1768-gorkys-zygotic-mynci/"" target=""_blank"">Gorky's Zygotic Mynci</a>, and now Gerard Love-- always the McCartney to Blake's Lennon-- attempts an even more pronounced break with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30246-lightships/"" target=""_blank"">Lightships</a>.</p>
<p>Granted, Love's singing and unerringly melodic songwriting haven’t changed; his gentle, congenial voice still hovers somewhere between blissed-out reverie and forlorn resignation, and his new project has an obvious antecedent in ""Into the City"", Love's hazy-headed standout from the Fanclub's 2010 release, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14267-shadows/"" target=""_blank""><i>Shadows</i></a>. However, sonically, <i>Electric Cables</i> represents a more concerted effort to distinguish itself from the traditionalist, Byrdsian country-rock that has essentially been Teenage Fanclub's default mode since 1997's <i>Songs From Northern Britain</i>. Recorded with a gaggle of Glaswegian mates (including past and present Fanclub members Brendan O'Hare and Dave McGowan, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/324-belle-and-sebastian/"" target=""_blank"">Belle and Sebastian</a> bassist Bob Kildea), <i>Electric Cables</i>' brand of soft-focus psychedelia represents the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13498-i-am-the-cosmos-deluxe-edition/"" target=""_blank""><i>I Am the Cosmos</i></a> to Teenage Fanclub's eternal <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_City_(album)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Radio City</i></a>: A more lush, cerebral rendering of the same pop ethos, drawn from a broader instrumental palette-- mellotrons and flutes vs. analog synths and drum machines-- that blurs the divide between retro and futurist, dreamlike and lucid.</p>
<p><i> Electric Cables</i> is the sort of album whose deceptively placid presentation belies the richness of detail and sense of purpose at work here. While slow-motion, kaleidoscopic opener ""Two Lines"" and sister track ""Girasol"" suggest Lightships is driven by the modest intent to fashion a chillwave <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13436-magical-mystery-tour/"" target=""_blank""><i>Magical Mystery Tour</i></a>, other songs reveal a more restless spirit, from the disarmingly grim working-class imagery of ""Muddy Rivers"" (""from the open field to the crowded shore/ we carried the stains from the factory floor"") that offsets its perky Wings-ian synth line, to the boisterous extended coda of starry-eyed ballad ""Silver &amp; Gold"" that plays like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3914-spiritualized/"" target=""_blank"">Spiritualized</a>'s <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5mkMeDT8js"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Medication""</a> in miniature. But it's the self-explanatory mission statement ""Stretching Out"" that best signifies Lightships' liberating qualities: set to a breezy go-go groove several degrees looser than the Fanclub's workmanlike rock normally allows, the song sees Love getting swept up in a splendorous swirl of laser-guided moogs, fluttering flutes, and acid-dipped, <i>Revolver</i>-esque guitar tones. His bandwagon may be less crowded than it was 20 years ago, but Love still knows what it takes to keep the wheels rolling.</p></div>"|16443.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16443-lightships/|7.5|Stuart Berman

For one, there's the fact that she named her first LP <i>Milo Goes to Compton</i>-- a play on the title of the Descendents' first album, <i>Milo Goes to College</i>-- and has loaded it up with enough historical references to make it clear that there was some overlap between your high school record collection and hers. If you don't notice that album opener <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HW4ej9q_dU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Good Good Things""</a> is also a cover of a song by the same flagship California punk band, for instance, you'll probably recognize track two as a scuzz-laden half-cover of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-EKcjpEIGo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I Wanna Be Sedated""</a> by the Ramones. Perhaps you'll see something of your own ideal likeness in the cartoon rendering of the 27-year-old Boston transplant that appears on the album art-- Wayfarer-style sunglasses, palm trees, sun-- and if not, then you’re probably familiar with other millennial garage rockers who’ve tapped a similar iconography.</p>
<p><i>Milo Goes to Compton</i>, which she originally self-released on cassette tape last year, builds on the simple-as-hell, one-woman-band arrangements that marked 2011's <a href=""http://www.purevolume.com/news/Stream-Cujo-New-EP-Colleen-Green"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Cujo </i>EP</a>. While perhaps a bit quirkier and diminutive in stature, her amalgam of punk, garage, and 1960s girl group memories feels like something you might expect from a member of the <a href=""http://artfagrecordings.blogspot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Art Fag Recordings</a> stable, which has included <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27600-dum-dum-girls/"" target=""_blank"">Dum Dum Girls</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28196-best-coast/"" target=""_blank"">Best Coast</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29757-bleached/"" target=""_blank"">Bleached</a>, and other contemporary proponents of time-tested guitar-pop thrills. Hustling together the album's eight tracks from nothing but a drum machine, multi-tracked vox, and some fuzzed-out power chords, Green enacts the less-is-more principle on a molecular level, as though she were trying to see how many elements she could subtract from the rock band equation while still creating an overall impression of rock'n'roll.</p>
<p>Depending on your relationship to the rock tropes that abound here, this could feel either endearing or lazy. Lyrically, Green's shortened attention span for pretty much anything beyond crushes, marijuana, and complicated love is likely to recall Best Coast, although her delivery is deadpan enough to discount any aspirations toward belting pop diva-dom. More than sublimate heartbreak into collective exaltation, she shades these lyrical themes a bit darker than the punchy power riffs might suggest. The aforementioned Ramones classic, for example, is renamed ""I Wanna Be Degraded"", with Green introducing a few NSFW scenarios for the sake of illustration. Album single ""Worship You"", similarly, sees Green warning a romantic prospect that he had better ""worship her"" if he wants ""to be the one I sleep with every night/ to be the one I let tie me up tight."" That the song ends with her desiring to ""worship"" the same person isn't the only thing that makes its sentiment feel less than cut-and-dry. More striking is the fact that she sounds cool as a cucumber, as though the lyrical content of the song were only secondary, a conduit for a catchy, sock-hopping melody.</p>
<p>More often than not, it feels like Green is trying to hide from us, layering on the auto-harmonies so thick that you cannot even tell which vocal track is meant to be the lead. But what carries <i>Milo Goes to Compton </i>is less its dark-sunglasses-inscrutability than Green's economical melodic sense, which leverages minimal gestures for maximal impact-- loaded pauses included. Her cover of ""I Will Follow Him"", for example, would be a whole lot less fresh-sounding if it didn't contract the 1963, Little Peggy March <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YgyU5yFwR8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">original </a>into a skeletal, two-note affair, jauntily layered over a mechanical groove. Likewise, part of the pleasure of listening to ""Always on My Mind"", is simply hearing the sound of her left hand sliding repetitively up and down the guitar neck, sounding ever-so-slightly different-- or imperfect-- with each go-around.</p>
<p>If we're comparing Green to other, better-known female garage rock heroes of the past few years, I’d say that the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19442-vivian-girls/"" target=""_blank"">Vivian Girls</a> sound like the most kindred of spirits. A band whose members are so unattached to their own instruments that they are willing to swap them mid-performance doesn't just reaffirm the DIY notion that anyone can make catchy, thoroughly engaging rock'n'roll regardless of technical skill, it elevates that understanding to a central facet of  their art. Green does that on the level of each individal song, and our enjoyment stems partly from sensing just how much fun she seems to be having while building them, note by note.</p></div>"|16449.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16449-colleen-green-milo-goes-to-compton/|6.7|Emilie Friedlander

It's more like the world simply caught up with them. Cheap, accessible software eradicated sound collage's barrier of entry. Mashups and remixes became commonplace marketing tools, and then Christian Marclay <a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/03/12/120312fa_fact_zalewski?currentPage=1"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">blew up the whole game with <i>The Clock</i></a>. Most of all, the internet made illogical connections between disparate things feel like a matter of course. By 2012, what the Books did was still pretty amazing, but it was no longer strange. That's why Nick Zammuto's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29717-zammuto/"" target=""_blank"">self-titled debut</a>, which jettisons the stale conceptual parts of the Books while retaining the durable technical parts, is such a breath of fresh air.</span></p>
<p>At the time of its release, <i>The Way Out</i>'s focus on hypnotherapy samples seemed like just another rich documentary vein to explore. It's revealed as more personal in the wake of Zammuto's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/45239-nick-zammuto-talks-about-ending-the-books-starting-his-new-project/"">recent admission to <i>Pitchfork</i></a> that he suspected the title's aptness even as they were making the record. Listening again, we can hear Zammuto and de Jong poignantly trying, via self-mesmerism, to reconcile their attachment to the project with the growing conviction that it was tapped out. I saw them perform <i>The Way Out</i> in 2010, synched with kaleidoscopic videos. The most visibly excited Zammuto became all night was when he introduced a guitarist who was fast enough to play <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wVhWcpZpac"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Tokyo""</a>, which he'd thought impossible when he built it on a computer. After staking his career on what technology could do, he was becoming more interested in what humans could play.</p>
<p>That instrumentalist impulse flowers on <i>Zammuto</i>, though he certainly hasn't lost his taste for digital enhancement: Dexterous musicianship and catchy pop writing are upgraded to hyper-reality. Still, Zammuto's <a href=""http://zammutosound.com/home.cfm"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">blog commentary on ""The Shape of Things to Come""</a> is telling, in what it chooses to highlight, of his mindset. The song is sweet and fizzy electro-pop in the manner of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3377-the-postal-service/"">Postal Service</a>, mounted on a pithy time-shifting synthesizer loop, where Zammuto sings passionately about his tax forms. The fact that interests Zammuto is that drummer Sean Dixon ""is playing a 6/8 clave pattern double time with his right hand and halftime with his left. It's a mind bending thing to watch."" This is the rhapsody of a Latin jazz aficionado after a <a href=""http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=29603"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Guillermo Klein</a> concert, not of a cerebral sound artist. Zammuto's focus is narrowing from what music means to how it works-- especially how it divides up time.</p>
<p>The record has baggy moments: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13032-f-u-c-3po/"" target=""_blank"">""F U C-3PO""</a> gets into bloated electro-prog territory, with heavy laser-fight sound effects and chorused, antic vocals. It's flashy and exciting but a bit hollow, and it's not hard to imagine Zammuto making a whole album of it-- there is a raging prog-rocker just below his mild-mannered façade. Happily, it's an exception to the lucid, pared-down sound profiles of most of the songs. <i>Z</i><i>ammuto</i> blasts us with musical particles in narrow, swarming beams; each grain rendered with hallucinatory clarity. The overriding emphasis is on energetic, complexly metered percussion; jam-bandy guitar voyages; and startlingly expressive (if heavily processed) vocals from the typically docile singer. On the joyous overture <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12228-yay/"" target=""_blank"">""Yay""</a>, Zammuto uses a slicer effect to turn his voice into a skittering pulsation, with tumbling blocks of percussion offsetting its stuttering skip. With guitar and organ movements creating tectonic shifts, a little melody is elaborated into a full-bore composition.</p>
<p>The first two-thirds of the songs are especially strong, each extrapolating something specific from the record's general style. Techno and acid house refract through <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12834-weird-ceiling/"" target=""_blank"">""Weird Ceiling""</a> and ""Zebra Butt."" The hokey but disarming ""Groan Man, Don't Cry"" synthesizes Afrofunk and Western disco, with vocoder vocals and guitar curlicues evocative of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28004-fools-gold/"">Fool's Gold</a>. (It also sounds a bit like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5471-bon-iver/"">Bon Iver</a> making fun of his own AutoTune hymns.) ""Idiom Wind"", which anchored a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12917-idiom-wind-ep/"">recent EP</a>, resembles <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3768-the-shins/"">the Shins</a> at their most archly constructed. Loosely cobbled together from down-walking bass and humidly pulsing strings, it features very striking vocal writing and inflections, with Zammuto's voice staggered against itself in a falling melody. Addressing an ""educated man"" whose education ""isn't worth a damn,"" he advises, ""Try getting off your ass/ Try picking up an ax/ Things are getting overgrown and it's time for ruthless cutting."" This so perfectly captures his process of getting from the Books to here that he could only be talking to himself.</p>
<p>The sharply differentiated genre experiments become less well-defined in the home stretch, but the sound design stays immersive, with pleasant little things to listen to festooned in every niche. But while plenty of iconic Books tropes are ported over to <i>Zammuto</i>, such as  Rube Goldberg percussion and manipulated spoken-word samples, there's no labyrinthine concept to untangle. There's just Zammuto, singing and playing his heart out through an array of computer dressing-- except on the lovely closing track, where his high voice and guitar arpeggios stand barely adorned. Zammuto <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/45239-nick-zammuto-talks-about-ending-the-books-starting-his-new-project/"" target=""_blank"">has said</a> that he considered quitting music after <i>The Way Out</i>, and that this record was about finding out if it was still in him: another round of self-help, this time on his own. His joy upon discovering that he still had music to make is evident, and highly contagious. While <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/45239-nick-zammuto-talks-about-ending-the-books-starting-his-new-project/"" target=""_blank"">the record may be modeled on the stages of grief</a>, it comes off with the turbocharged giddiness of a fun rebound fling after a long, enriching, but grueling relationship that has run out its course.</p></div>"|16433.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16433-zammuto/|8.0|Brian Howe

In 2012, it's rarer to find a band that <i>doesn't </i>incorporate button-pushing, vocal manipulation, or wholesale sampling as a primary compositional method-- how do you even begin to acknowledge the impact of technical proficiency outside of, say, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29765-araabmuzik/"" target=""_blank"">AraabMuzik</a>? On their gorgeous debut of bewitching digital folk, <a href=""http://www.hundred-waters.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Hundred Waters</a> find answers in a means similar to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29315-braids/"" target=""_blank"">Braids</a>' or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29994-julia-holter/"" target=""_blank"">Julia Holter</a>'s: Their stage setup might be a confounding tangle of cables and surge protectors, but there's a commitment to unapologetic, real-time virtuosity, compositional refinement, and vision that cuts through the nonchalant clutter of their peers. You can't pull of sounding this joyfully adventurous without being a <i>serious </i>musician.</p>
<p>The most obvious extension of that kind of serious musicianship is the Gainesville, Fla., quintet's confidence, and there are tangible ways in which it manifests here: Whether the pristine clarity of the production is the result of countless studio hours or just a monetary leap of faith (I'm more inclined to believe the former considering its tiny label), you immediately appreciate the investment of belief. And <i>Hundred Waters </i>streams for free on the band's website with the lyrics posted in plain sight, which might seem like a small gesture, but a heartening one if you think of how far out their way young bands go to obscure their words. If you <i>have </i>to shackle yourself to a computer, Hundred Waters allow and invite a more immersive listening experience in a terribly shallow format. Both make the same point: They're not afraid to ask for your full attention.</p>
<p>In a more abstract way, <i>Hundred Waters </i>plays out like a record unusually sure of itself despite having no obvious stylistic hook-- colleagues of mine have grasped at <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/473-broadcast/"" target=""_blank"">Broadcast</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1196-dirty-projectors/"" target=""_blank"">Dirty Projectors</a> as comparisons, two bands who sound like hardly anyone else, let alone each other. I hesitate to use ""folktronica"" because I think the nomenclature can trigger more ill will than the music that was actually produced under that faux-genre, but that's really what you're getting here: Befitting a record with both ""Sonnet"" and ""…---…"" as song titles, <i>Hundred Waters </i>merges the digital and the antiquated sonically and lyrically. At their core, the songs are often in a folk tradition, albeit more towards the ""freak-"" than the coffee-shop type, vocalist Nicole Miglis heavily informed by pastoral England in terms of harmony and language. The lyrics to opener ""Sonnet"" are taken directly and entirely from a Percy Shelley verse of the same name, while the acoustic figures and woodwinds that vine upwards throughout it the suggest <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1402-espers/"" target=""_blank"">Espers</a>' Ren Faire wake-and-bakes basking in sunshine rather than blacklights. Beyond the modal harmonies, there's an archaic poetry to these songs that some might find impossibly precious (note the spelling of ""splendour"" in the lyrics), but I find it congruent with the band's musical persona. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13255-boreal/"" target=""_blank"">""Boreal""</a> and ""Me &amp; Anodyne"" initially appear fantastical due to their purple wordplay, but they're stories grounded in the complexities of human relationships and the urge to opt out of modern mundanity. Likewise, focus on the ripeness of the lyrics, and you'll miss ""Thistle"" as an acrid sendoff written with a poisoned quill.</p>
<p>Occasionally, the faerie dust gets a little too thick (the free-time drum circle ""Wonderboom"" in particular), but even then you never get a sense that they're being overindulgent. More often, their playful side is where their virtuosity gets revealed: a nimble player piano roll that splits ""Boreal"" open, the expert deployment of syncopated kick drums accenting the chorus of ""Me &amp; Anodyne"". ""Visitor"" starts off with the kind of half-melodic, half-percussive ripple of indistinct brass that's familiar in the wake of Animal Collective, yet it's a loop and a living thing, morphing into intriguing melodic shapes while the rhythm sections bustle skillfully. There are brief hat tips to glitch (""Thistle""), tUnE-yArDs' oblong rhythms (""Theia""), and the processor-spiked jazz of Four Tet (""Visitor""), but much of <i>Hundred Waters </i>is just love of pure sound.  It's particularly evident on near-instrumental pieces like ""Caverns"", which layers a gorgeous backward loop over a heaving percussion for an effect that's similar to crystal stalactites described therein, both extremely dense and yet translucent, and meditative closer ""Gather"" features an <i>ostinato</i> piano line and rich cello acting out its hopeful epitaph (""We can crouch in sanctuary/ Or we can gather our threads into rope and pull."")</p>
<p>Throughout, it's evident how much of the hard work occurred in the planning stages, such is the simply staggering sophistication of these arrangements. Though mostly clocking in at under five minutes, no single track exposes its hooks too quickly and their tendency to explore phrases and shapes before locking into a groove evinces a foreground of both improvisation and skill that suggest Hundred Waters just might be an omnivorous jazz band. And above all, they're the kind of discovery it's easy to get excited about: Their debut does more than enough to stand on its own, not only ambitious in its own right, but leaving little doubt about Hundred Waters' capability of handling wherever their ambition takes them from here.</p></div>"|16415.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16415-hundred-waters/|8.1|Ian Cohen

Is it the production, the quality, or inventiveness of the sonics? Or would it be the singing and the presence of the frontman? How about the lyrics and their ability to convey emotion? Since we all hear music differently, this is an impossible question, but it's an interesting exercise when it comes to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27863-miike-snow/"" target=""_blank"">Miike Snow</a>. Because the Swedish trio, who are known for an electronic take on springy indie pop, are really good at some things and not so great at others. They're lopsided.</p>
<p>The first thing to consider when talking about these guys is their studio ability. Each of the three members has ample experience behind the decks, and two of them, Christian Karlsson and Pontus Winnburg, comprise the hitmaking production duo <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloodshy_%26_Avant"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bloodshy &amp; Avant</a>. They were responsible for Britney Spears' irrefutable <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOZuxwVk7TU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Toxic""</a>, her nearly-as-good recent single <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTztyRDl70"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""How I Roll""</a>, and various cuts for Kelis and Kylie Minogue. Point being, they know how to make stuff sound good. And a lot of the music on <i>Happy To You</i>, their second full-length, <i>sounds</i> excellent. Beats sparkle, synths crest and unfurl with purpose, horns come in at just exact right moment. The foundation is strong.</p>
<p>Problem is, that's only one part of the equation. Miike Snow are missing some important components, the first of which is a compelling singer to elevate or at least match the sonics. Marc Hogan touched on this in <a href=""pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13189-miike-snow/"" target=""_blank"">his review</a> of the band's debut and I'm bringing it up again because it's still an issue. Singer Andrew Wyatt is by no means a bad vocalist, but he has a thin, reedy presence that's probably better suited for bedside indie fare than pop songs with beats and thrust. It's a mismatch. Add to that a vague lyrical quality (a line like ""You don't have to sell your shirt to do the devil's work"" kind of makes sense but doesn't) and you're left with tracks that feel sort of lifeless, emotionally inert.</p>
<p>That's not always the case. There are instances where the Miike Snow formula comes together and you can hear the beginnings of something really good. The best song to my ears is ""God Help This Divorce"", which sounds like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/777-the-clientele/"" target=""_blank"">the Clientele</a> backed by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3082-the-neptunes/"" target=""_blank"">the Neptunes</a> or an updated <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3377-the-postal-service/"" target=""_blank"">Postal Service</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5490-mgmt/"" target=""_blank"">MGMT</a> gone really emo. With sharp lyrics like ""Taking my tea in silence, telling strange jokes to myself,"" you don't have to guess whether or not it's about post-breakup loneliness. That sort of unity of vision, though, where the sound matches the idea and the idea matches the delivery, is still rare with this band. Too much of the time, too much is missing.</p></div>"|16445.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16445-happy-to-you/|5.8|Joe Colly

It's the sort of moniker that suggests a gang of crusty punks or a band of black metal bros, all loud and mean and vile. But Worm Ouroboros is actually guitarist/singer Jessica Way and bassist/keyboardist Lorranie Rath, accompanied on each of their two albums by a different drummer. The Bay Area group plays as softly as the two sing, their ethereal harmonies luxuriating above musical atmospheres that shift shapes like thick white clouds. Wading between waters of doom metal and gossamer atmospherics, Way and Rath's music moves with a wonderfully graceful menace that's far less terrifying than the name might indicate. But as ""Worm Ouroboros"" rightly suggests, the eight-minute drifts and builds that this band makes are borne of persistence, diligence, and care. Their sense of restraint turns the rare trick of making 4AD-adherent epics stop just short of maudlin.</p>
<p>The band's second album <i>Come the Thaw</i> sharpens the focus of their 2010 self-titled debut by giving each instrumental part what essentially amounts to more respect. Like recent records by the blues-crawling <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1420-earth/"" target=""_blank"">Earth</a>, Worm Ouroboros makes layered music that doesn't sound overly dense or distracted, so that each player is able not only to convey shades of meaning but also to push each song along in unexpected ways. Though never very loud, Rath's remarkable bass playing shakes the frame. On ""Further Out"", her thick lines dart beneath Way's languid guitar, not only shouldering the melody but also serving as the tonal anchor. Way's playing during <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13014-withered/"" target=""_blank"">""Withered""</a> is marvel of dynamics, each steely note refracted as if through a crystal. She finally climbs into a riff, though, and like a spartan Crazy Horse, the rest of the band follows, lashing hard against its back. Its hard-won redemption, the sort of coda that feels deserved.</p>
<p>Drummer Aesop Dekker proves Worm Ouroboros' perfect complementary third. If you've heard his 1990s punk bands or his current black-metal benders <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4892-agalloch/"" target=""_blank"">Agalloch</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/show-no-mercy/7534-show-no-mercy/"" target=""_blank"">Ludicra</a>, you know playing heavy isn't a worry for him. Last year, <a href=""http://www.npr.org/blogs/ablogsupreme/2011/02/02/133373253/agallochs-aesop-dekker-on-his-5-favorite-jazz-records"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">he wrote about his favorite jazz albums for NPR</a>. By splitting the meter during ""Withered"" and darting (slowly) around the beat of ""Further Out"", he proves that such talk isn't a feint, but is instead a tool. Here, he's constantly on the boundary of heavy-- insistent but not impatient, always present but never upstaging. He breaks through only when necessary, adding dimension and weight to the nebulous movement. All the space on <i>Come the Thaw</i> simply galvanizes those bigger moments, affording simple rock-trio-taking-a-solo moments a rare kind of majesty and power. That feeling is appropriate, too, since <i>Come the Thaw</i> lyrically focuses on processes that take months, years or lifetimes to reach-- birth, blossoming, death, discovering-- but only an instant to fulfill. ""We feed our days on measured hours,"" Rath reassures at one point, singing with such softness and slowness that it feels as if these units of time are only foreign abstractions.</p>
<p>During ""When We Are Gold"", Rath opens with a question. ""What have we won/ when all is won?"" she sings, pulling at each syllable like strips of gauze as feather-light guitar, bass, and drums wind through each other. This track is not only the album's best but its loudest, pushing from a place close to stillness and silence into, after nine minutes, the sort of near-roar that might fit between two Agalloch bursts or on any record that attempts to truss post and hard rock. But the climax matters here less than that opening credo; in the context of <i>Come the Thaw</i>, an album that's very much concerned with the slow cycles of nature and life, it seems a subtle indictment of music that mistakes volume and motion for emotion and substance. Worm Ouroboros are more concerned with the core of their music than the crescendos that that might propel. It's a good thing, too, because these songs-- however quiet or calm they become-- bear a great weight with remarkable elegance.</p></div>"|16448.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16448-come-the-thaw/|7.4|Grayson Currin

They question what it means to Bring New York Back, whether the early-mid 1990s looms too large over a genre and a lifestyle that never stops evolving, and if there's a point in reviving a moment that's almost universally agreed upon to be impossible to replicate. But lost in that debate is the smaller, more individual picture: what it means for specific artists with their own sets of expectations and influences to come to terms with their formative experiences.</p>
<p>The rapper <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30330-ka/"" target=""_blank"">Ka</a> came up as a 1970s baby out of Brownsville, New York, a crucial place and age to live through a wave of creative revolution that spanned from Slick Rick to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4628-wu-tang-clan/"" target=""_blank"">Wu-Tang</a> and onwards. But <a href=""http://passionweiss.com/2012/03/22/question-in-the-form-of-an-answer-ka/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">as he's mentioned in recent interviews</a>, he didn't feel like he was at the ideal talent level to put in his own voice. He's been quick to self-identify as the weak link in Brooklyn crew Natural Elements, he's chalked up the stalled career of his one-12""-wonder group Nightbreed (1998's ""2 Roads Out the Ghetto"") to being overwhelmed in a talent-rich field of peers, and he hung up his mic for the better part of the 2000s out of a combination of frustration and personal day-job necessity. By the time 2008's <i>Iron Works</i> finally got his career catalyzed again after years of struggling with his own creative ambivalence, the means of expression he carried with him for most of his life had the added weight of a well-documented style's celebrated past.</p>
<p>But Ka's an artist who's put a lot of thought into what it means to be a rapper past your thirties, and <i>Grief Pedigree</i> is an album that puts a lot of weight behind the wisdom of age and experience. Fittingly enough, it's the kind of record that takes a bit of experience to really sink in. Ka's voice is a bit subdued, often affectless, and quietly straightforward-- not an easy way to get a fickle listener's attention. You can get a grasp of his thought process and the nuanced emotions that drive them, but the thousand-yard-stare flow that clinically unspools incidental corner-hustle details is the same one that mourns lost friends, holds on tight to the thankful moments, and claims his own resilient parcel of Brooklyn hip-hop territory. It might take some dedicated listens for opinions on that flow to shift from ""deadpan and repetitive"" to ""focused and hypnotic,"" so the more immediate draw in the meantime is his lyricism. And these are the kinds of verses that stand out bluntly in the cold light of a matter-of-fact flow, giving equal time to agile internal rhymes and frank, unobscured sentiment.</p>
<p>On the surface, you could thematically peg Ka on a continuum that ranges from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4755-mobb-deep/"" target=""_blank"">Mobb Deep</a>'s bleak threats to the sinister comedy of crucial collaborator <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29234-roc-marciano/"" target=""_blank"">Roc Marciano</a>; the latter's complement paid off on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14720-marcberg/"" target=""_blank""><i>Marcberg</i></a>'s ""We Do It"" and gets a returned favor here on the defiantly survivalist ""Iron Age"". (An announced upcoming teamup,<a href=""https://twitter.com/#!/MetalClergy"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> Metal Clergy</a>, is both inevitable and promising.) But there's more introspection and ambivalence at work, the sense of a man who's survived a lot but still feels like there's little he can control about his own destiny. That ambivalence stands out in a self-contained moment like ""Decisions"", a for-the-seeds track that underscores just how much can hinge on a single judgment (""Blood or Crip/ honor my moms, or who I'm thuggin' with/ is this lust or do I love this shit/ keep it gutter, or get butter dip"") without getting didactic about which path's always the correct one.</p>
<p>It also scatters conflicting emotions across tracks in a way that ties them together, like how the bravado in ""Cold Facts"" is inseparable from spiritual self-doubt and regret. It's the kind of lyricism that doesn't technically need hooks, but benefits from the care put into them anyways-- the almost shellshocked way the fatalist refrain of ""Summer"" plays out in particular is especially hard to shake (""This goin' be the summer they come for me/ guns for me/ tryin' to put food in my young tummies/ this goin' be the summer the cops get me/ shots fit me/ tryin' to push whips off lots swiftly""). And once the words work their way in, that delivery starts to feel more and more like a pure expression of low-key intensity.</p>
<p>Finding a blatantly 1995 precedent for the juxtaposition of Ka's stark voice and similarly stark production is a bit trickier than it seems, though-- he'll spot you the odd 1970s Hi Records loop (""No Downtime""), but even with a full litany of circa-DITC sounds to compare it to there's still something a bit more contemporary at work. There's not much that really knocks non-stop in the way golden-age, Hot 97-geared classics intended-- imagine the insomniac feel of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3634-raekwon/"" target=""_blank"">Raekwon</a>'s<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13441-only-built-4-cuban-linx-pt-ii/"" target=""_blank""><i> Only Built 4 Cuban Linx... Pt. II</i></a> interstitial ""Pyrex Vision"" dissipating across 37 lean, hazy minutes-- but that's by design, and in the right mindset it can be as devastatingly evocative as any speaker-rattling break.</p>
<p>A number of the loops are simple but well-chosen: an icy, twinkling guitar/electric piano lick for the reverie of ""Every…""; a woozy,swaying bell/wah-wah concoction to back up the tightly-knotted verses on ""Collage""; a couple stray chords reverbed to the point of decay on ""Cold Facts"". It's as though he found a way to build an entire production backbone off the parts of records that lead up to the big crescendos, and that looped all-prelude-no-payoff feel is the kind of friction the album needs for its confessional release to hit home. Yet as uncomplicated as these beats are, something about them sticks in a way that leads to the suspicion that they come from well-worn records that Ka listened to hundreds of times long before he even got the idea to sample them. And if sticking with music for a while doesn't pay off immediately, that only makes it more of a revelation when it finally does.</p></div>"|16447.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16447-ka-grief-pedigree/|7.7|Nate Patrin

Oh, you have to! Here, I'll put it next in the queue after the Stan Tracey Quartet's King Crimson cover and-- okay, hold on, let me fade out this Pop Group instrumental, you kind of get the idea..."" They also seem like the rare people from whom that behavior would not result in silent pleas to just put on an <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5771-al-green/"" target=""_blank"">Al Green</a> album or something and leave the stereo alone, because their ability to dig up amazing, not-overexposed music defies the Dunning-Kruger Effect by being as good as they think it is.</p>
<p>Hence, Stuart Murdoch and company have been invited back for their <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/45199-belle-and-sebastian-curate-another-entry-in-the-late-night-tales-compilation-series/"" target=""_blank"">second volume</a> of the <a href=""http://latenighttales.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">LateNightTales</a> series of ""here's a bunch of not particularly dancey stuff a well-known artist likes, plus a new cover by that artist, and a spoken-word piece"" compilations. (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/640-latenighttales/"" target=""_blank"">Their first</a> came out in 2006.) As expected, their taste is superb; as you might also expect, they lean heavily on the 1960s and early 1970s, with occasional glimmers of modernity (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28121-gold-panda/"" target=""_blank"">Gold Panda</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28039-toro-y-moi/"" target=""_blank"">Toro y Moi</a>) and the odd touch of naff-and-obvious just for contrast. (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22156-blood-sweat-tears/"" target=""_blank"">Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears</a>' ""Spinning Wheel""? Srsly?) Not a lot of this set sounds much like their own music, although the Wonder Who?'s pop-psychedelic ""Watch the Flowers Grow"" sounds like the Belle and Sebastian rhythm section might have taken a few cues from it. They also include two tracks by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/473-broadcast/"" target=""_blank"">Broadcast</a>, the much-missed Birmingham group whose aesthetic was all about stereophilic retro-futurism, and whose admirers are probably almost entirely a subset of Belle and Sebastian's own.</p>
<p>A handful of the songs they've picked effectively declare ""but have you heard it like <i>this</i>?"": not Margo Guryan's lite-psych delite ""Sunday Morning"" but Marie Laforêt's French cover of it, not <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/873-the-cure/"" target=""_blank"">the Cure</a>'s skeletal synth-pop heavy breather ""Close to Me"" but the repurposing of its plinky hook in Ce'cile's dancehall track ""Rude Bwoy Thug Life"", not the regular version of Pete Shelley's ""North American Scum""-prefiguring ""Homosapien"" but some kind of dub mix. (They're the kind of record geeks for whom the less-heard version is <i>obviously</i> better.) And they turn out to be fond of very precise music by hairy hippies-- the folk-prog band Trees' ""Streets of Derry"", from 1970's <i>On the Shore</i>, sounds especially brawny in this context.</p>
<p>Still, this mix is trying a little too hard to be a <i>mix</i>, rather than letting tracks play out-- their few attempts at cross-fades leave a lot to be desired, and the echo-chamber effect that curtails several tracks isn't so hot either. And one of the album's few weak links is Belle and Sebastian's own pallid, ambling <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13232-crash-the-primitives-cover/"" target=""_blank"">cover of the Primitives' ""Crash""</a>: without the original's brakes-are-out momentum, there's not much left of it. (If it had come out back in the days when B&amp;S were flicking out a new single every few months, it wouldn't have been disappointing, but a year and a half after <i>Write About Love</i>, that's <i>it</i>?)</p>
<p><i>LateNightTales</i>' requisite spoken-word closer doubles as a commentary on the project itself: critic-turned-label-guy-turned-critic Paul Morley's piece ""Lost for Words, Part 3"", whose centerpiece is a string of his favorite sentences by other writers.

""When I made <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14160-kush-and-orange-juice/"" target=""_blank""><i>Kush and Orange Juice</i></a>, I listened to it and knew I had created a genre that would change music,"" he wrote. ""The mistake I made on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15294-rolling-papers/"" target=""_blank""><i>Rolling Papers</i></a> was thinking it was time to move on from that genre and not knowing that it had impacted people so much…creatively [it] wasn't my best work.""</p>
<p>The gist was that Khalifa had gone too far into pop-rap with his major label debut and sacrificed the kicked-back stoner vibe that first got him wide attention. Concurrent with this were other artists-- from psychedelic producers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29688-spaceghostpurrp/"" target=""_blank"">Spaceghostpurpp</a> to <i>au courant</i> rap crews like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30007-asap-rocky/"" target=""_blank"">A$AP</a> and <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/29865-main-attrakionz/"" target=""_blank"">Main Attraktionz</a>, basically the whole ""cloud rap"" or ""trillwave"" movement, whatever you want to call it-- who had since ran with a similar style. <i>Taylor Allderdice</i>, named for Khalifa's high school, is the rapper attempting to reclaim what he sees as his.</p>
<p>There are a few logical flaws in this argument. For one, while <i>Kush and Orange Juice</i> did crystallize the Taylor Gang aesthetic and help trailblaze the mixtape-to-commercial-success model for others, Khalifa was hardly the first guy to leisurely rap about weed. The list of cannabis-obsessed MCs is long and you don't have to look far to find a Wiz precursor. (See: <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/5186-devin-the-dude/"" target=""_blank"">Devin the Dude</a>.) Also, <i>Rolling Papers</i> was actually pretty good. Yes, the record did nosedive into B.o.B.-esque cheese in the second half, but the front end contained some of Wiz's strongest material-- ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12139-the-race/"" target=""_blank"">The Race</a>"", ""Hopes and Dreams"", ""On My Level"".</p>
<p>To some degree, it's disappointing to see Khalifa shrugging off the strides he made on <i>Rolling Papers</i> and choosing regression over creative advancement. <i>Taylor Allderdice</i> is basically <i>Kush and Orange Juice 2</i>. The flip side is that there's still gas left in this tank, in part because the guy still loves weed and is still good at rapping about it. Marijuana is his muse, his <i>raison d’être</i>. Like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29043-curreny/"" target=""_blank"">Curren$y</a>, Khalifa rarely leaves his comfort zone, but can create variety within self-imposed limits. Over humid tracks by various producers (in-house Taylor Gang beatmaker Sledgren oversees, the aforementioned Spaceghostpurrp contributes a beat), he weaves raspy bars and singsong choruses into pleasant, low-stakes party jams.</p>
<p>Obviously life has changed a lot for Khalifa in the two years since <i>Kush and Orange Juice</i> was released. He's a legitimate star now with a tabloid-fodder fiancee in Amber Rose and presumably lots more money. Weirdly there's not much acknowledgment of these seemingly big transitions. Every now and again, he lets go of a ruminative line (""Still rollin' weed on my <i>XXL</i>, only difference is that's me on the cover"" or ""Room full of expensive bags, still all the shit on the floor/ But that's just how you live when your wife's a model""), but mostly he seems determined to prove he's the Same Old Dude. If the album has a thesis statement, it's this couplet from ""Never Been"": ""In my jacuzzi, roll another doobie/ See what's newest on Netflix, order another movie.""</p>
<p>Where he does get personal is during a recorded interview with MTV News correspondent Rob Markman that's broken up and threaded throughout the album. It's annoying for several reasons. Almost every song ends with a clip of the two guys talking, thus breaking up any groove you may establish. Two, Khalifa actually burps at least twice during these segments. (I realize this mixtape comes at no cost to the listener, but this is pushing it even for free shit.) Third and most important, it seems remarkably lazy for an artist to rely on a conversation with a random guy to express the themes, ideas, and frustrations he wants to get across. That's what the songs are supposed to be for.</p>
<p>It feels like this is the central problem with Khalifa right now. He seems either unwilling or incapable to share the personal details, the other aspects of his persona that would give him extra dimension as a rapper. It's not a dealbreaker on this particular tape because a) it doesn’t carry the weight of a major release and b) these songs for the most part sound good, but it should be cause for concern for his fans going forward. Songs about pot are fine, they have their place, but he's reached the level of popularity that it's reasonable to expect something more.</p></div>"|16434.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16434-taylor-allderdice/|6.3|Joe Colly

On a handful of tracks, a pair of forcible female vocalists cut through the seductive murk, anchoring the songs and lodging their voices in your brain. ""Play it then, let my soul unwind,"" one sang on ""Swerve... the reeping of all that is worthwhile (Noir not withstanding)"". At the very end of the track, the other rapped with patient conviction: ""So still it morphed, this shit is way too advanced."" The voices were those of Catherine Harris-White and Stasia Irons, respectively, the duo behind Seattle neo-soul/avant-rap duo <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30183-theesatisfaction/"" target=""_blank"">THEESatisfaction</a>.</p>
<p>Following a handful of self-released Bandcamp mixtapes, <i>awE naturalE</i> marks THEESatisfaction's proper debut, and their post-<i>Black Up</i> introduction to the world through Sub Pop. The album stands on its own as a fresh take on dense neo-soul, jazz, and rap fusion, but it also functions as a component of a larger piece. It's solid proof that they weren't merely vocalists auditioned for a part by Palaceer Lazaro, but part of a symbiotic relationship that must have much deeper roots. As Irons and Harris-White's were on <i>Black Up</i>, Lazaro's fingerprints are all over this record, including guest verses over the minimal-jazz of ""God"" and the alien-like, wobble-warped <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13253-enchantruss/"" target=""_blank"">""Enchantruss""</a>. On a more understated level, unconventional song structures-- there are few hooks or choruses or neatly measured verses here-- subtly reveal themselves the way they did on <i>Black Up</i>. Perhaps it's the result of a close artistic partnership, or a reflection of the contemporary music scene in Seattle, but the music of Lazaro and THEESatisfaction sounds as though it's working toward the same goal, even when released as separate entities.</p>
<p>What is that common goal? Like Lazaro has done in the last couple of years, THEESatisfaction find a way to draw from the early-1990s backpack era and break new (and sometimes strange) ground while staying on the right side of the line between groovy and granola. Songs meander through psychedelic loops built around jazz or funk instrumentation, starting punchily in one place and ending abruptly somewhere altogether different. Most clock in well under three minutes. That sort of free-flowing structural approach lends itself well to Irons and Harris-White's stream-of-consciousness lyrical mode, a smooth rapping/singing tag-team effort.</p>
<p>The content here is cryptic but almost always obliquely political, brushing on the experiences that come along with being black lesbians in America. ""My melanin is relevant/ It's something to be had,"" they chant on ""Deeper"". ""I said, 'Ow! I am the bitch on the side,'"" the two sing together on ""Bitch"", narrating an inner monologue of friendship and romantic struggle. At a time when politically conscious rap is viewed with skepticism, that sort of territory becomes tricky to navigate, but Irons and Harris-White pull it off. They come over as ultra-positive Queens of the Stoned Age who prioritize uninhibited genre exploration and good vibe-seeking above all.</p>
<p>At some point in 2009, the duo uploaded a goofy video they'd filmed of themselves talking at the webcam, grinning and telling their fans what a good month they'd had. The music in the background was Digable Planets' ""Black Ego"", which points explicitly to the tradition they're helping to carry on along with Lazaro. <i>awE naturalE</i>, like Black Up, is a pleasantly surprising resurrection of the Pacific Northwest-via-Brooklyn hippie-hop that we never might have anticipated a few years ago. Much of the music from that era doesn't hold up, but THEESatisfaction have an ear for what was worth saving, and the mantra on uptempo album highlight <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13097-queens/"" target=""_blank"">""QueenS""</a>-- ""Whatever you do, don't funk with my groove""-- still has legs.</p></div>"|16444.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16444-awe-naturale/|7.5|Carrie Battan

For people of a certain generation (and those who wish they were born in it), there is no purer form of pop music-- the gilded group harmonies, the pristine hooks, the ringing Rickenbacker chords that are the very definition of perfect sound forever. It's a music that sounds like the eternal promise and euphoria of youth-- and yet, it's a strain of rock music that hasn't been purchased by teenagers in large quantities since, oh, 1965, while some of the more valiant but failed attempts to revive it on mass level have driven its adherents to career-killing seclusion (see: Lee Mavers of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eu2iv-vMKT8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the La's</a>), suicide (half of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz4uWgdRJ6I"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Badfinger</a>), or reactionary psychobilly records (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNKSs1J38EA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Alex Chilton</a>). But, in spite of the genre's no-hope commercial prospects and oddly tragic history, there are always new recruits who entrust themselves with the daunting task of breathing new life into an almost 50-year-old artform. And, invariably, the ones who modestly succeed approach jangly power-pop not as some historical reenactment of a bygone golden age, but as a gauzy lens that magnifies the impossibility of ever living in one.</p>
<p>London four-piece <a href=""http://www.weirdweirddreams.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Weird Dreams</a> takes this logic one step further, by recasting the exuberance of mid-1960s Beatles and Byrds as a manifestation of modern-day social anxieties and sleep-depravation-induced paranoia: the band's frontman, Doran Edwards, introduces himself on <i>Choreography</i> by proudly declaring, ""I live in an empty room where the shadows call my name""; his most endearing love song (""Hurts So Bad"") is a paean to emotional masochism. In this sense, Weird Dreams' true spiritual antecedents aren't the aforementioned classic-rock touchstones, but the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAt7hK_zKr0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Soft Boys</a>, the rare first-wave post-punk band to draw inspiration from pop's paisley period and give it a subversive spin. Weird Dreams' Edwards may not possess the same flair for absurdity and perversity as the young Robyn Hitchcock, but <i>Choreography</i> strikes a similarly uncanny balance between reverence and deviance for their sources-- what sticks with you isn't so much the crystalline guitar lines and misty-eyed melodies as the mischievous sense that something more sinister is lurking beneath all the pretty surfaces.</p>
<p>Sure, the band may oversell this conceit off the bat by calling themselves Weird Dreams, blissfully saluting Satan on ""666.66"", and naming their pretty acoustic campfire serenade ""River of the Damned"", gestures akin to <a href=""http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=alternative+rock+radio+edge&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">an alternative-rock radio station using the word ""Edge"" in its name</a>. But for a good three quarters of its 47-minute run time, <i>Choreography</i> proves to be a consistently rewarding, highly revelatory listen, as Weird Dreams progress outward from the knotty power pop of the album's introductory tract to open up the sound by deploying its intertwining dual-guitar formation to more wondrous effect (the extended coda of ""Suburban Coated Creatures"" is especially lustrous). After peaking nine tracks in with the exquisite melancholy of ""Velvet Morning"", Weird Dreams effectively go into retreat, and spend the home stretch retracing previously covered terrain on songs that aren't quite distinguished enough to transcend the familiarly jangly dressing. Still, editing issues aside, <i>Choreography</i> stands as a most impressive debut: one that captures a young rock 'n' roll band buzzing with raw energy and inspiration, while already displaying the sort of rapidly sophisticating songcraft you expect to hear on a sophomore release.</p></div>"|16411.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16411-weird-dreams/|7.6|Stuart Berman

Their collective tastes run rich and decadent, and unwittingly encourage the inherent hedonistic tendencies couched within the black leather and dried blood of metal's more extreme varieties. Not content to wallow in the swollen streams of mediocrity that course throughout the global metal consciousness, the Gauls prefer to vacillate between extremes.</p>
<p>On one end, there lies darkness; chaos reigns and metallic dogma is crucified before bloodied altars. Lines blur, eardrums bleed. This is where the raw, ugly scrapings of Les Legiones Noire, and the twisted, charred remains of what was once called black metal is scavenged and molded by feral scum and madmen, where <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23036-deathspell-omega/"" target=""_blank"">Deathspell Omega</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23037-blut-aus-nord/"" target=""_blank"">Blut Aus Nord</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5882-antaeus/"" target=""_blank"">Antaeus</a>, Hell Militia, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29924-glorior-belli/"" target=""_blank"">Glorior Belli</a>, and their violently innovative ilk make their home. On the other, there is light. Here, black metal goes soft, embraces the shimmering sounds of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1388-explosions-in-the-sky/"" target=""_blank"">Explosions in the Sky</a> and <i>Loveless</i>, and abandons its roots entirely, save for the odd scrap of tremolo or flurried drum fill. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5913-alcest/"" target=""_blank"">Alcest</a>'s summertime blues, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27827-amesoeurs/"" target=""_blank"">Amesoeurs</a>' velvety odes to urban decay, and the sullen grandeur of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30327-les-discrets/"" target=""_blank"">Les Discrets</a> provide the yin to their countrymen's yang.</p>
<p>While France's black legions intimidate, their post-black dreamers captivate, and it's the latter that have been gaining a great deal of traction and recognition amongst seasoned metal fans and genre tourists alike. ""French shoegaze metal"" is apparently a thing (no matter how clumsy the nomenclature) and the handful of visionaries moving within its Grey Circle are to blame. Alcest's Neige is one of them. Fursy Teyssier is another, a fact his latest creation only serves to emphasize. It's inevitable Les Discrets will be hauled out and strung up alongside their brothers in Alcest for inspection, but of the two, Teyssier's crew are the more somber, venturing beyond Neige's fairylands and blue-bathed nostalgia trips and into more earthy territory. If Alcest float gently on the springtime breeze, Les Discrets perpetually dwell within the last days of autumn, watching for the coming of winter. Separate, yet equal, they operate within the same sphere, serving as reluctant ringleaders of a ""movement"" that reflects black metal's ever-changing attitudes. <i> </i></p>
<p>Teyssier joins forces in with vocalist Audrey Hadorn and drummer Winterhalter (Amesoeurs, Alcest) in the studio and onstage, but Les Discrets is his baby. He's best known as a prolific (and talented) artist, animator, and director, celebrated for his work with Alcest, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30254-drudkh/"" target=""_blank"">Drudkh</a>, Secrets of the Moon, Lantlos, and others, but his pièce de résistance was 2010's <i>Septembre Et Ses Dernières Pensées</i>. Regarded as a cornerstone of the post-black metal movement, Teyssier's initial foray into composition was a wondrous achievement, and scrawled a mighty high water mark towards which his newest opus strains. In a nutshell, <i>Ariettes oubliées...</i> makes a fine attempt, but lacks the lively memorability of its predecessor. That's not to say it's a bad album. It may be a tad uneven (perhaps due to the staggered timing in the songwriting) and bleeds together after a few spins, but is a more than worthy addition to any fan of wistful not-quite-metal's collection (especially when its dose of Teyssier's gorgeous artwork is taken into consideration).</p>
<p>At its core, <i>Ariettes oubliées...</i> recalls shades of Katatonia's melancholy rock and gossamer interpretation's of Weakling’s dark, hypnotic melodies, infusing each composition with an ethereal amalgamation of post-rock, dusky goth-pop, and the faintest shadow of black metal. The interplay between the guitars works beautifully, as the warmth of the acoustic and cold steel strings of the electric mesh seamlessly and highlight one another in turn. Melancholia abounds. The aim is to awe, rather than to shock (though anyone who picks up this record expecting a Vlad Tepes clone is in for a big one). Atmosphere is everything. Delicacy and restraint are essentials tools.<i> </i></p>
<p>Les Discrets' masterful command of the kinder, gentler side of doom and gloom is made more than apparent, from the plaintive opening chords of ""Linceul d'hiver"" and on. ""La Traversée"" takes the long road home, wending its way through a wintery landscape, spurred onwards by a jangly pop melody and jaunty tambourine before the tempo changes, slows, and slips into echoing, near acoustic quiet, and ending on one of the album’s few metallic notes. ""Apres l'Ombre"" is all glinting post-rock, overlain with high, crooning vocals, while ""Aux Creux de l'hiver"" is as cold as its namesake (""At the Heart of Winter"", roughly), and is one of the most dynamic of the tracks on offer, kicking off with an almost folky feel before bleeding into an expansive, textured melodic line that wouldn't feel out of place on one of the more potent Drudkh records. The vocals remain within that whispery, timorous range, sparse and understated. Teyssier tackles the lion's share, while Audrey Halborn's breathy tone adds color and grace; from time to time, she truly shines, and her poetic lyrics add an elegant note to the proceedings.</p>

It's a reply to Street's unsolicited offer of demos as possible backing tracks for a post-Smiths B-Side or two. Morrissey writes that he's done with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4065-the-smiths/"" target=""_blank"">the Smiths</a>, that he's keen for his solo career to start as soon as possible, and could these demos perhaps form the basis of a full album?</p>
<p>The letter shows a hungry, impatient Morrissey, ambitious for more than just artistic success-- he also frets over the marketing and midweek chart position for ""Girlfriend in a Coma"". After 20 years of stalled comebacks and scorned collaborators it seems odd to think of Morrissey as a mainstream contender, but in 1988 he was, and he had a record label willing to throw serious money at making the idea stick. The result was one of Morrissey's most energetic and prominent phases: an acclaimed album, singles thick with new tracks, and a year-end surprise gig at Wolverhampton which saw him mobbed by his delirious cultists. The perfect subject for a deluxe reissue package, you'd say, and that's just what EMI announced last year, a remastered <i>Viva Hate</i> filled with bonus material and the Wolverhampton gig in full.</p>
<p>Morrissey being Morrissey, that isn't what we got. This is the <i>Viva Hate</i> album, given a crisp remaster by Stephen Street. Except Morrissey's cut one song (""The Ordinary Boys""), replaced it with a demo (""Treat Me Like a Human Being""), and added nothing else. No B-Sides, no Wolverhampton, just an album that's not quite the same as you remember. This mix of tampering and parsimony makes it hard to recommend the reissue (had this set been done well, the mark here would have been higher), a shame since <i>Viva Hate</i> is one of Morrissey's most interesting records, and certainly his riskiest.</p>
<p>Morrissey's early solo career is defined by its string of jilted collaborators. On <i>Viva Hate</i>, the first chance to hear what he might do away from Johnny Marr, he involved two musicians with seemingly divergent instincts. Stephen Street had produced <i>Strangeways, Here We Come</i> for the Smiths, and there's a throughline from his lush, ponderous orchestrations there into <i>Viva Hate</i>’s fuller moments. Vini Reilly, though, was a callback to Morrissey's roots in Manchester's post-punk scene, a guitarist who'd spent a decade making brittle, semi-ambient tone poems as the Durutti Column.</p>
<p>This strange mix of pomp and minimal languor makes <i>Viva Hate</i> the only Morrissey LP you'd consider listening to just for its music. From the jagged programmed drums on ""Alsatian Cousin"" through the peeling MOR grandeur of ""Everyday is Like Sunday"" to the discreetly gorgeous strings on ""Dial-a-Cliché"", it's full of intriguing touches, and settings bold and open enough to push Morrissey into recording some of his most expressive vocals. Lyrically, ""Margaret on the Guillotine""-- Margaret Thatcher, of course-- doesn't have much more going for it than shock tactics: it's Morrissey’s fey venom that makes it work.</p>
<p>Not every risk comes off, or is worth taking in the first place. ""Bengali in Platforms""-- the notorious ""life is hard enough when you belong here"" song-- has gotten no easier to listen to over the years, whatever the song's intention. In ""Bengali"", the experience of racism is glibly reduced to a subset of its surface effects: feeling like you can't fit in, which is Morrissey's home territory. His purse-lipped delivery only underlines how patronising this false equivalence is.</p>
<p>But that's the problem with Morrissey sometimes: the other side of empathy is always feeling sorry for yourself. He's been trailed by accusations of self-pity since the beginning, self-parody since not long after. On <i>Viva Hate</i> it looked, briefly, like he might be trying out newer ideas-- character sketches like the excellent ""Little Man, What Now?"", cryptic dramas like ""Alsatian Cousin"", and a theme cutting through the record of the need to move on, to let go of things. ""Why do you hang around?"" Morrissey despairs on debut solo single ""Suedehead"". Stasis-- a fading child star, or the grey horror of the English seaside-- is the enemy.</p>
<p>At the same time, <i>Viva Hate</i> held Morrissey's most autobiographical, contemplative tracks. Featuring Vini Reilly's most decorative work for Morrissey-- a minute of which is pointlessly lopped off in this remaster-- ""Late Night, Maudlin Street"" is a patchwork of 1970s memories that fans received like a superhero origin story. But it's more about closing the diary than opening it, a last visit to an old crime scene. Album highlight ""Break Up the Family"" makes things even clearer over a skinny, gawky electro-funk backing quite unlike any other Morrissey track-- the singer sounds kinder and more hopeful than he ever has: ""I'm so glad to grow older.""</p>
<p>The future promised on and by <i>Viva Hate</i> failed to happen: Morrissey and mainstream success broke off their relationship, and while he made more consistent records, his music was never this distinctive again. It's typical of him, and sad, that a record full of songs about wrestling away from the past is now subject to his obsessive tinkering: maybe few will miss the self-satisfied ""Ordinary Boys"", but there's a reason the barely memorable ""Treat Me Like a Human Being"" has stayed on the demo shelf for two decades. If this is now the official, canonical <i>Viva Hate</i>, its unfinished roughness sticks out horribly. Fans are wearily used to Morrissey's whims, but will rue an opportunity missed here.</p></div>"|16439.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16439-viva-hate/|7.3|Tom Ewing

This is an artist whose spirit of independence has scattered her presence over as many contexts as her psychedelic, jazz-inflected neo-soul sensibility can carry her-- an R&amp;B auteur with a 24/7 omnipresence. You might've heard her on a Stones Throw compilation, or building the lush melodic backbone of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2838-mos-def/"" target=""_blank"">Mos Def</a>'s <i>The</i> <i>Ecstatic </i>track ""Roses"", or forming a mutual-muse partnership with the off-kilter but sincere g-funk crooner <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3426-dudley-perkins/"" target=""_blank"">Dudley Perkins</a>, or sweetening up albums by Oddisee or Shawn Lee or Oh No. If you're lucky, you've pulled up a couple of her albums, weathering occasional bouts of formative inconsistency to savor the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5062-nina-simone/"" target=""_blank"">Nina Simone</a>-indebted gems off releases like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13913-kings-ballad/"" target=""_blank""><i>Kings Ballad</i></a> or <i>Owed to Mama Rickie</i>. Defining her solely through any individual one of those works is clearly incomplete, but taking in the big picture of her output reveals more about her restless creative evolution than any easy synopsis.</p>
<p><i>Seeds</i> is another left-field deviation in Muldrow's career: it's one of her most captivating and immediate front-to-back statements of purpose as a singer, but it's also the first album where she's handed over all the production duties to somebody else. That this somebody else is <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2885-madlib/"" target=""_blank"">Madlib</a> is a good hook, and his most prominent R&amp;B production job prior to this one-- two excellent songs on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/537-erykah-badu/"" target=""_blank"">Erykah Badu</a>'s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11562-new-amerykah-part-one-4th-world-war/"" target=""_blank"">New Amerykah Part One: 4th World War</a>--</i> makes for an optimistic precedent. It's one he fills with a relatively understated smoothness, rolling out his more classic-soul-influenced side to subtle effect. This isn't the Madlib of Firesign Theatre clips, damaged-filmstrip horns, and resin-caked surface hiss; it's the one that put the buttery Stacy Epps feature ""Eye"" on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5579-madvillainy/"" target=""_blank""><i>Madvillainy</i></a> and rode the bliss of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/208-roy-ayers/"" target=""_blank"">Roy Ayers</a>' slow jam ""DC City"" on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3496-quasimoto/"" target=""_blank"">Quasimoto</a>'s ""Seasons Change"". The beats on <i>Seeds</i> are characteristically weathered, peppered with abrupt truncated loops and instilled with a familiar sense of hard-wrought excavation. But they still come at you head-on with no tricks or punchlines, whether they lift cues from stretched-taut funk (""Kali Yuga"") or sleek vintage drum machine R&amp;B (""Best Love""). They help make the album click, but they don't take over the spotlight.</p>
<p>That gives Muldrow a comfortable space to do what makes her so compelling: grab a simple phrase, mull it over, turn it into a mantra-like refrain, and bend it from every melodic angle she can find. <i>Seeds </i>has a wide theme of existential reflection-- hoping for a better environment for our children (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12947-seeds/"" target=""_blank"">the environmentally conscious title track</a>), wondering how our legacies will be remembered (""Wind""), and finding a sense of communal identity and pride through the birth of a child (""The Birth of Petey Wheatstraw""). It's deeply spiritual, not in some superficial hippy-dip way, but in the sense of someone working through profound ideas of worry and praise. She's an evocative wordsmith when she wants to be, like when she's referring to the state of hesitant apprehension as ""kneecap jelly"" in the resilient self-sufficiency anthem of the same name. But taking a simple observation or a plain truth and breathing her own life into it makes her lyrics a solid means to a stronger end, simple sayings (""you and me, we can make a difference if we try""; ""original man divine"") given a third (and fourth) dimension through her voice. She lets slip a few slyly showoffy vocal tricks, like the simultaneously full-throated and quiet interjections of a couple mid-chorus cathartic screams in ""Kali Yuga"", that fall somewhere between the paired thrills of ""because I want to"" and ""because I can."" And through the refined multi-tracking that boosts her signal, there's this dense, rich, self-call-and-response room-of-mirrors trickery that amplifies the recursive contemplation of her words and the open emotions behind them. If it seems like she's in love with the sound of her own voice, hey, why not? It's easy to love.</p></div>"|16416.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16416-georgia-anne-muldrow-seeds/|7.9|Nate Patrin

The song isn't preoccupied with any particular threat, just a general sense that it's a matter of time before we make a real mess out of that place, too. ""I hope I see you in the sky/ At night when I get old/ I hope you'll look about the same/ As when I was a boy,"" Alan Wilson muses in his high, strange warble. It's an oddly affecting tribute to a big dumb gray orb that could probably use a bit of sympathy-- I mean, of all the gravitational pulls of all planets in all the solar systems, it got sucked into <i>ours</i>?</p>
<p>A certain expectation of depth and sensitivity persists for a band naming itself after a song that effectively mines an emotional connection with a piece of rock floating hundreds of thousands of miles outside our personal atmospheres, but <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30182-poor-moon/"" target=""_blank"">Poor Moon</a>'s five-song debut EP falls short. <i>Illusion</i> is a slight effort by any standard, even the most fair: the bar set by the prior work of the band members themselves. Brothers Peter and Ian Murray comprise the tweaky, brainy, almost-entirely under-the-radar Seattle-based act the Christmas Cards, who have released one LP, 2009's quietly solid <i>Happy Birthday</i>; multi-instrumentalist Casey Wescott has played in both Fleet Foxes and Crystal Skulls, spinning out woodsy, harmonic folk in one and rehabbing 1970s AM gold in the other, joined in both of those acts by Christian Wargo, Poor Moon's lead singer/guitarist and primary songwriter.</p>
<p>If not for its pedigree, Poor Moon could easily be accused of straight aping Fleet Foxes; despite its pedigree, that suggestion still rings weirdly true. The vocal reverb, the arpeggiated electric guitar, the tumbling acoustic fingerwork, the muffled drums, the gauzy group harmonies: Robin Pecknold and his crew hardly pioneered the combination of these elements, but they've done it better than most anyone since CSNY, so they've got an almost proprietary claim on the sound for now. Curiously, though, Poor Moon struggles despite Wargo and Wescott's direct connection. On <i>Illusion</i>, the four-part harmonies fail to hit that spine-tingling sweet spot and the instrumentation feels muffled and low-energy, rather than deliberately bare-bones or restrained. Lyrically, Pecknold has taken some jabs for his romantic fixation on the rustic and agrarian as antidotes to his millennial malaise, but at least he dealt in specifics, however fey; trying to identify anything concrete in Wargo's lines is almost like pawing around in a smoke-filled room, grasping at nothing a hand could hold.</p>
<p>""I don't know how to prepare to be seen,"" he sings on the opening track, his harp-like plucking spiderwebbed by faint digital distortion. ""Isn't there anyplace you want to go?"" he asks on the shuffling ""Anyplace,"" a plume of airy harmonies trailing in his wake. A generous explanation would be that <i>Illusion</i> is a concept EP about the nature of the chimera, that the tracks are meant to capture and embody their non-subjects' non-natures. The solipsistic ""People in Her Mind"", about a poor cipher of a girl ""that no one could recognize/ that no one could identify/ 'cause no one had heard anything/ from anyone who knows anything about her,"" assists that theory. A jaunty, Hollies-esque thing with a nice Spector drum-bounce, it's the EP's most sonically distinct song, though it could use a real verse or two. (Check with Pecknold first-- he might have a few to spare.) ""Once Before"", with its splashy drums and slinky, noir vibe, pulls more from the Crystal Skulls side of the family tree. ""I curse the day that love walked out my door,"" Wargo sings, but he doesn't sound heartbroken or bitter or especially like he's cursing anything, actually-- just bored, like even he'd rather be doing something else.</p>
<p>Closing track ""Widow"" sketches the vague sadness (""all the years she spent/ never knowing where he went"") of a woman left at home by a wandering husband (""he was chasing after what he might be sorry if he hadn't done""). The sparse, tender lead-in of ""oh's,"" the contemplative finger-plucked guitar, the imagery of earth and furniture and death-- did Fleet Foxes' ""Oliver James"" not already go there, and more elegantly, and quite recently? Why does Wargo, an established music-maker in his own right (he played with Danielson Famile and Pedro the Lion before joining up with Fleet Foxes), seem so determined to abide by the template set by the band that his new act is supposed to function as a side-project of? Can he just not get enough? Or does he find the Pecknold-led amalgam of these same influences, tones and affects to be somehow too urgent, too muscular? Will some eventual Poor Moon full-length do a better job of making good on the band's considerable promise? Or am I the misguided one here, complaining about the presence of 15 more minutes of passably lovely music in the world? When should you be happy with what you have, and when should you demand more? In a way, that's the same question ""Widow"" asks, and answers: The woman takes care of her wandering man, poisoning his drink when he finally returns home-- a curious safeguard against future loneliness-- and then the whole thing shimmers away into nothingness.</p></div>"|16438.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16438-illusion-ep/|5.1|Rachael Maddux

And yet when an email arrived in my inbox requesting review consideration for this EP recorded by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30322-gala-drop/"" target=""_blank"">Gala Drop</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8168-ben-chasny/"" target=""_blank"">Ben Chasny</a>, recorded live over the course of a week in 2011, there was reason to pause. Surely it was a typo: there seemed to be little shared ground between Lisbon, Portugal's instrumental group Gala Drop and NorCal's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3807-six-organs-of-admittance/"" target=""_blank"">Six Organs of Admittance</a> sole proprietor Ben Chasny.</p>
<p>For those who did not have the chance to see Gala Drop in their lone stateside appearance opening for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3241-panda-bear/"" target=""_blank"">Panda Bear</a> on Governor's Island a few years back, they don't easily slot into musical categories. At times, I thought the band reminded me of Hot Chip, were they obsessed with spaced-out instrumentals like Pink Floyd's ""Interstellar Overdrive"", or else Liquid Liquid cutting their propulsive grooves with the laconic dubs of Augustus Pablo. Philip Sherburne, in <a href=""http://www.residentadvisor.net/review-view.aspx?id=8161"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">reviewing</a> their 2010 EP on Golf Channel, laundry-listed acts like El Guincho, John Talabot, Four Tet, Tortoise, Animal Collective, the Durutti Column, and King Tubby, all of which might make more sense as collaborators than Chasny with his glowering folk noise.</p>
<p>Not that Chasny is a lone wolf. For years, he added white phosphorescence to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/805-comets-on-fire/"" target=""_blank"">Comets on Fire</a>, participated with ex-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1048-deerhoof/"" target=""_blank"">Deerhoofer</a> Rob Fisk in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/278-badgerlore/"" target=""_blank"">Badgerlore</a>, and last year saw him release an album with girlfriend Elisa Ambrogio as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30053-200-years/"" target=""_blank"">200 Years</a>. (I even recall seeing Chasny adding atmospherics behind <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3144-will-oldham/"" target=""_blank"">Will Oldham</a> as he read passages from Rudolph Wurlitzer's <i>Slow Fade</i> in a Brooklyn bookstore.)</p>
<p>And yet he still seemed well outside the realm of Portuguese-flavored nü-Balaerica, at least until the appearance of <i>Broda</i>. According to Gala Drop synth player (and prominent Lisbon concert promoter) Nelson Gomes, Chasny was a fan of the band's self-released first album, suggesting the band open dates on Six Organs' European tour in 2009, and then even suggesting the collaboration. Perhaps it's a way for Chasny to step outside of the strictures of Six Organs. Or maybe he missed the shredding salad days of Comets on Fire, who have been on hiatus since 2008. Perhaps he simply pined for a more rhythmic underpinning in which to juxtapose his guitar-slinging. The nearly 13-minute ""Positano"" builds from an echoing drum machine and Chasny's legato lead for three minutes before the drums of Afonso Simões and congas of Jerry the Cat enter. And at the halfway point of this atmospheric yet charged jam, Chasny's wah-wah quickens and it all turns as hot, viscous, and pleasantly disorienting as the Joshua Light Show, before wrapping after a particularly wheezing and flatulent synth turn from Gomes.</p>
<p>Namechecking the lightshow at Bill Graham's old Fillmore naturally suggests that late 1960s heyday of rock. (Think iFillmore East Meets West. Or better yet, North Cali Meeting Southern Europe.) So if the congas, wurlitzering organ, and guitar spurt of the title track rumba as convincingly as Santana, it's the Santana of Woodstock to keep in your now acid-touched mind, well before he conceived the Mars Volta and ""Smooth"". Chasny's bravura solo five minutes in, veering into searing noise and back amid the polyrhythms remains a particular highlight, making me miss his unfettered leads amid the din of prime-era Comets all the more.</p>
<p>Closer ""Brain"" might be the most overtly psychedelic of the three, suggesting that the grouping was just reaching symbiosis. Overall, this near half-hour of jams never separate into distinct acts, or suggest one artist dictating the others' moves. Gala Drop and Ben Chasny are neither entity, instead just a crack 1960's instrumental band wailing freely.</p></div>"|16437.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16437-broda/|6.7|Andy Beta

At times it sounds like a group of machines engaged in an uneasy standoff on stage, about to push each other over the edge. This is a live recording, captured on tape at <a href=""http://mute.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mute</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/42376-news-in-brief-short-circuit-festivalmute-phil-cook-of-megafaun-sloan-the-felice-brothers/"">Short Circuit Festival</a> in May 2011, performed by Chris Carter and Cosey Fanni Tutti (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4229-throbbing-gristle/"">Throbbing Gristle</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/24666-chris-and-cosey/"">Chris &amp; Cosey</a>, <a href=""http://chrisandcosey.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Carter Tutti</a>) and Nik Colk Void (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30051-factory-floor/"">Factory Floor</a>). Unusually, for a live recording, there's a transformative energy at work here, akin to the rare sense of magic you sometimes get at shows. The kind where everyday worries slip out of your mind, where the part of your brain that flips into figuring out what the musicians are doing on-stage is dislocated, where fanciful notions of music being some kind of ""higher power"" don't seem so silly after all. This might be a place they never return to-- plans for the trio to work this way again don't look promising according to a recent <a href=""http://www.junodownload.com/plus/2012/03/05/a-qa-with-carter-tutti-void/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interview</a>. For the moment, we should just be grateful they left this document behind. </p>
<p>It makes sense that Void would find her way to Carter Tutti, especially as the nascent Factory Floor records owe a considerable debt to some of the pair's early Chris &amp; Cosey recordings. Check out the stringy electro backing and darkly moaned female vocals of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGCpfED0P30"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Love Cuts""</a> from <i>Songs of Love and Lust--</i> both strands Void and her band would prominently thread into their sound several decades later. <i>Transverse</i> doesn't go down that route; instead, it bears more of a resemblance to the harshly processed machine noise of Chris &amp; Cosey's <i>Trance</i> record from 1982. But it's a fatuous task to draw too many comparisons here, as the four tracks on this record, all coming in around the 10-minute mark, don't feel like a world too many people have inhabited before. It's both loose and rigid at the same time, with stringent 4/4 beats providing the backing for some increasingly inspired guitar and electronic work from the trio.</p>
<p>Talking about this as a collection of individual ""songs"" feels wrong. Instead, each piece picks up where the last left off, with short breaks for audience applause in-between. It's a testament to how absorbing it gets that the applause often feels like an intrusion. When the pulsing thug-beat of ""V2"" gets to its all-consuming peak, where it feels like a giant robot gone haywire, stomping on skyscrapers and crushing them to dust, it's easy to blank out the fact that other people were there to witness this recording. In many ways this feels like the true promise of industrial music being capitalized on, before it got utilized as a scare tactic to lure in impressionable mall-goth teens. But on <i>Transverse</i> there's something distinctly unpleasant, something downright nasty, worming its way through the tracks. It's there in the piercing, eardrum-perforating electronics of ""V1"", and it’s there in the lethargy-fueled ""V4"", which sometimes resembles rotten sewage slowly pumping through a drainpipe.</p>
<p>There are moments of beauty here, too. The shortest track of the bunch, ""V3"", is the lightest of the four, with a treated female vocal (either Void or Tutti, it's impossible to tell which) veering close to the kind of seraphic mannerisms <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27589-fever-ray/"">Karin Dreijer Andersson</a> often displays. It's a welcome dip into serenity, a relief from the all-conquering storm brewing elsewhere. That's part of the great strength of <i>Transverse</i>. There’s subtlety and force vying for air, with all three players possessing an intuitive knack for knowing when to turn from one to the other, and knowing how to prevent the intricacies from getting lost when the dial bleeds into the red. These tracks come entirely from improvisations, with barely any practice beforehand. But the level of detail in the electronics-- from tiny, meticulous twists to vast plates of metallic sound-- makes that claim feel like a deception.

Sharing a darkened room with a flashy, quick-cutting, psychedelic sensory overload blasted out in Dolby Surround can do that to people. Especially when it's based around a set from arguably the most enduringly successful rave-gone-pop act of all time. Tom Rowlands and Ed Simons have built a 20-year canon that can effortlessly fill 90 minutes with wave after wave of euphoric, body-shaking classics. And at a time when their occasionally-bumpy transition from next-big-thing 1990s icons to <i></i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15289-hanna-ost/"" target=""_blank""><i>Hanna</i>-scoring</a> cool older brothers has positioned them as elder statesmen of a resurgent moment for electronic dance music, the role of a generation-bridging legacy act has fit them well. So while Gondry and Jonze did them plenty of justice in the MTV era, an actual audiovisual document of their mind-bending live show feels a bit overdue.</p>
<p>If you're wondering how <i>Don't Think</i> overcomes the skepticism people might still harbor towards live EDM shows, it's actually a bit misleading to focus on the music itself as a performative act. It's more of a catalyst for something bigger, an approximation of the kind of mixed-media freakout that provokes synesthesia. Not that Tom and Ed aren't up there working the dials and controlling the levels and amping up the crowd-- every time they're shown on film, they're twiddling switches to some end or another, messing with levels and dropping in cues and, crucially, being just as propelled by the music as the people in the crowd. (One key shot -- a single finger hitting a key on a synthesizer that lets loose with that sharp opening hornet-buzz of ""Hey Boy Hey Girl""-- almost feels like a jolt on the order of a Pete Townshend windmill.) The Chems have earned a rep for avoiding canned setlists and predictable sequencing, and even if some moments lean on long-used ideas-- Bernard Sumner's voice on ""Out of Control"" is chopped up and folded in on itself in much the same way as it was on the live Glastonbury 2000 version that appeared on the <i>Music: Response</i> EP-- there's no contempt in their familiarity.</p>
<p>Expecting the gold standard that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/990-daft-punk/"" target=""_blank"">Daft Punk</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10925-alive-2007/"" target=""_blank""><i>Alive 2007</i></a> set for re-defining career-spanning overviews shouldn't be necessary; there aren't as many transformative mash-up tricks or back-and-forth intra-song dialogues on that level. But there's still no shortage of the kinds of fan-geekout juxtapositions that give new meaning to tracks new and old. The bombastic Boss 302-gone-Roland 303 of ""Horse Power"" sounds a bit more at home cut out of the more subtly refined surroundings of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14359-further/"" target=""_blank""><i>Further</i></a> and dropped in the midst of an early peak, but it also makes for a perfect stage-setter for the vintage acid of ""Chemical Beats"". And the b-boy lineage of a set-closing run that conflates ""Leave Home"", Q-Tip's vocals from ""Galvanize"" and the deathless ""Block Rockin' Beats"" is a fine way to go out, especially when that latter track's familiar bass gets pushed into super-fast-forward until it's just a blurred, stammering climax.</p>
<p>And the newer stuff stands just as well on its own. The crowd goes nuts at the woozy, vertiginous opening of ""Swoon"" for a good reason, and the title cut's hyperventilating bridge between <i>Surrender</i> favorites ""Hey Boy Hey Girl"" and ""Out of Control""-- think <i>Dig Your Own Hole</i> deep cut ""It Doesn't Matter,"" but simultaneously more melodic and more suspenseful-- is perfectly placed to make it sound like the they-still-got-it highlight it is. It all flows so smoothly so immediately that tracks which felt like late-career missteps on album-- like overstuffed pigeon-toed funk oddities like ""Do It Again"" and ""Get Yourself High"", which show up in succession in the set's first 10 minutes-- come across as all-hook monsters, fused in a way that splits the difference and shaves off all the fat.</p>
<p>It's a good CD, but a staggering film. Shot at the 2011 Fuji Rock Festival by longtime visual partner Adam Smith, it's a rhythmically edited spectacle that builds off the strobing pulse of basslines and lights alike. But even under the engaging light-show antics and all the allusions to 60s acidsploitation LSD-freakout sequences (faces covered in swirling colors, dancing silhouettes, scary clowns), the real engrossing thing is the focus on the crowd as the performative focal point. And not just the massive faceless festival-size throng, either, though there isn't a lack of wide shots and pans showing just how many people are going berserk at pivotal moments.</p>
<p>The field of vision is often geared to make a theatergoer feel like they're on the same scale as the people on the screen, a microcosm of thousands-strong energy strewn across a dozen faces. And there's an emphasis on capturing individual people as certain moments break-- abrupt drops startling an unsuspecting fan out of his reverie, buildups sending people into head-back ecstasy, people losing it as they shout along to lyrics. Sometimes it pulls back to the outer edges of the crowd by the concession stands, occasionally following one woman in particular and capturing moments where she's frightened or amused or disorientated by all the things going on around her; other moments we see vendors nodding along to the music or bewildered concertgoers suddenly finding out that the same projections that flood the main stage's screen also sneak in little cameos amongst the trees and the mud.</p>
<p>It's an angle that might seem derived from performative social-media awareness; when everyone has a video camera, crowds are so easily distilled into individuals. But its real effect is an on-the-field, you-are-there immediacy that pulls you in more than any concert documentary recorded in recent memory, capturing not just what you see when you're riveted to the stage, but what you see when you turn to your friend, when you glance over your shoulder, when you wander the grounds, when you completely lose control. The crowd at Naeba Ski Resort could say they were there, sure, but you could probably count anyone who saw it in a London theater or a Montreal living room or a Chicago train ride as claiming an honest attendance, too.</p></div>"|16424.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16424-the-chemical-brothers-dont-think/|8.2|Nate Patrin

They don't need people to explain their back story for half a review anymore, and they've become truly intertwined with a huge network of African and Western artists whom they've toured and recorded with, a list that ranges all over the place from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5428-manu-chao/"" target=""_blank"">Manu Chao</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12366-david-gilmour/"" target=""_blank"">David Gilmour</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7518-knaan/"" target=""_blank"">K'naan</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/47-damon-albarn/"" target=""_blank"">Damon Albarn</a>, Bassekou Kouyaté and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27635-santigold/"" target=""_blank"">Santigold</a>. With that fame comes a potential snag, though: it's much, much harder for them to surprise us now that they've defined themselves around a seamless synthesis of the music of their homeland and the music of the rest of the world.</p>
<p>They're trying to work around that. For <i>Folila</i> (which means ""music"" in Bambara), they took an unusual approach to making a record, essentially making the same album three times. They recorded it once in New York with a host of indie rock musicians helping out, and again in Mali with a group of musicians from Mali's popular and traditional music communities. And then they took it to Paris, where they took the two recordings, which were made with matched keys and tempos, and mixed them together into a very literal genre hybrid. Honestly-- and this is really my bias here-- I would've loved to hear them use their newfound fame to strip things back a little and reveal the sounds of their homeland to a newly invested audience, but the hybrid works pretty well for the most part, and I'm not going to hold it against them that they're doubling down on their established fusion.</p>
<p>That fusion pays off beautifully on several tracks. Opener and lead single ""Dougou Badia"", featuring a guest vocal from Santigold and the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4704-yeah-yeah-yeahs/"" target=""_blank"">Yeah Yeah Yeahs</a>' <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6484-nick-zinner/"" target=""_blank"">Nick Zinner</a> mixing it up on guitar with Amadou, is about as good a result as you could hope for from the oblique recording process. Zinner and Amadou in particular have great chemistry, Amadou's staccato, tangled rhythm playing playing foil to Zinner's long, sustained tones. The chemistry is similarly strong with UK singer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27683-ebony-bones/"" target=""_blank"">Ebony Bones</a>, whose vocal turn on ""C'est Pas Facile Pour Les Aigles"" injects a huge burst of energy right into the heart of the album. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4063-scissor-sisters/"" target=""_blank"">Scissor Sisters</a>' <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/14422-jake-shears/"" target=""_blank"">Jake Shears</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4313-tv-on-the-radio/"" target=""_blank"">TV on the Radio</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8040-kyp-malone/"" target=""_blank"">Kyp Malone</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7740-tunde-adebimpe/"" target=""_blank"">Tunde Adebimpe</a> also contribute vocals, but stay in the background for the most part. Malone and Adebimpe fit so organically into the slinking funk of ""Wily Kataso"" that it makes me wonderful what a full album collaboration between the two bands might sound like, and Shears' addition of just a hint of disco camp to ""Metemya"" is about perfect.</p>
<p>The most prominent collaborator is French singer-songwriter Bertrand Cantat, who contributes vocals, harmonica and guitar on a few songs. Cantat was the longtime leader of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/21792-noir-desir/"" target=""_blank"">Noir Désir</a>, one of France's most prominent rock bands, and his contributions are fine here (well, he's definitely outshone vocally by the headliners, but he's not bad), but I can't help feeling a little weirded out by his presence. This isn't well-known in the States, but in 2003, Cantat <a href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3569581.stm"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">beat his girlfriend</a>, actress Marie Trintignant, in a jealous, drunken rage and put her in a coma-- she died days later. If <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/oct/03/bertrand-cantat-girlfriend-murder"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">he'd served all of his eight-year prison sentence</a>, he wouldn't even have been available to record his parts for this record (he was part of the sessions that took place in Mali). As I said, his musical contributions are fine, but given that he's frankly someone the album could been made without, I rather wish they'd brought in someone else.</p>
<p>As off-putting as Cantat's personal history is, though, <i>Folila</i> is still a highly successful merger of the Malian duo's vision with the input of collaborators. There's nothing as immediately stunning as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12435-welcome-to-mali/"" target=""_blank""><i>Welcome To Mali</i></a>'s ""Sabali"" or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/485-dimanche-a-bamako/"" target=""_blank""><i>Dimanche </i><i>à </i><i>Bamako</i></a>'s ""Coulibaly"", but hearing Kouyaté's ngoni bubbling up through the guitars and Amadou's roiling guitar lines bump up against Zinner's textures is definitely enjoyable. Likewise, Mariam's vocal duets with Ebony Bones and Santigold are spirited-- they really feed off each other's energy. And when they do strip things back to favor the sparser Mali recordings on ""Sans Toi"", it becomes very clear very quickly just how strong the identity of Amadou &amp; Mariam remains even amidst all the high-powered guests. Even if <i>Folila</i> is less surprising than the two albums that came before it, it still makes me look forward to seeing where they'll take this fusion next.</p></div>"|16435.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16435-folila/|7.4|Joe Tangari

Jokes are ideally obvious and obtuse. All art would be objective. All draft picks guaranteed and insured. There is no fan interference and all mustaches are created equal. But sometimes, you laugh or you don't. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29808-serengeti/"" target=""_blank"">Serengeti</a>'s <i>Kenny Dennis </i>EP is one of those times.</p>
<p>Back when 50 Cent was the rap Roger Maris at comparing his cock to candy, Serengeti conceived his Kenny Dennis character. At the time, the erstwhile beer delivery driver was watching the Little League World Series on a viscous August afternoon in Chicago. Between swings, ESPN flashed capsule bios of each player: favorite athletes, foods, and films. Somehow, the concept bloomed around a Super Fan who worshipped Brian Dennehy, the Vietnam-fabricating actor best known to younger generations as the dad in <i>Tommy Boy</i>.</p>
<p>Enter Kenny Dennis, a 45-year old white rapping schlub with a lunch pail Great Lakes accent and a mustache the size of ""Mike Ditka's forehead."" Primary interests include: bratwurst, his wife Jueles, O'Douls, Buicks, softball, Kools, Richard Daley, Tom Berenger, the Bears, the Sox, the [Black] Hawks, and the Bulls. If you're confused, the video for ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqrtoFWglMY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dennehy</a>"" is your Rosetta Stone. Over a velvety violin loop of sad Chicago soul, Serengeti depicts a blithe afternoon in the life of the accidentally enlightened, Kenny Dennis. His desperation is never quiet and only occurs when Chicago sports teams tank. ""Dennehy"" is the only rap song in history to establish a timeline before-and-after the retirement of ex-Chicago Bulls short-shorted stiff, Dave ""Lumber"" Corzine.</p>
<p>From Dr. Jekyll to Dr. Dooom, rap has seen plenty of alter egos, but none so pleasant or ostensibly pedestrian as Kenny Dennis. The salient question is why would anyone want to listen to a middle-aged, rapping telephone booth repairman with an accent thicker than a slice of Giordano's pizza. And honestly, there is no logical answer. I could tell you that Serengeti's dedication to the character is as absurdist and extreme as Andy Kauffman in wrestling tights. I could argue that his conceptual ambition, comic creativity, and bizarre specificity are half Prince Paul, half-Waiting for Guffman. But you could also retort that no one would want to hear a soundtrack of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WtJbXEN-a0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Corky St. Clair-led original show tunes</a>.</p>
<p>Too esoteric to be commercial and too weird for purists, Serengeti's aesthetic more closely resembles the unshaven folk-rap of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/319-beck/"" target=""_blank"">Beck</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/529-buck-65/"" target=""_blank"">Buck 65</a>. It's fitting that Serengeti's been championed and collaborated with such inscrutably gifted peers as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3947-sufjan-stevens/"" target=""_blank"">Sufjan Stevens</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6002-yoni-wolf/"" target=""_blank"">Yoni Wolf</a> of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4593-why/"" target=""_blank"">WHY?</a> and <a href=""http://www.brainfeedersite.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Brainfeeder</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28977-matthewdavid/"" target=""_blank"">Matthewdavid</a>. All of whom he's collaborated with in the last year. Most notably, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15639-family-and-friends/"" target=""_blank""><i>Family and Friends</i></a> found Serengeti playing it (mostly) straight, spinning despondent spells of pop culture detritus and addiction. With apologies to the Roots' ""Water,"" but it's the closest rap has gotten to ""The Needle and the Damage Done.""</p>
<p>In spite of its inherent esotericism, the Kenny Dennis doppelganger has been Serengeti's most beloved creation. The video for ""Dennehy"" is closing in on 200,000 views-- scraps for a major label rapper, but kielbasa for an idiosyncratic indie rapper prone to releasing records with neither advance notice nor organized publicity campaigns. Ultimately, it led to a recording contract with Anticon, one of the few labels experimentally inclined enough to promote a raspy-voiced palooka who flows like his chief inspiration was Jim McMahon on ""The Super Bowl Shuffle"".</p>
<p><i>The Kenny Dennis EP</i> is the fourth chronicle of Kenny, following <i>Dennehy</i>, <i>Conversations With Kenny/Legacy of Lee</i> (2009), and last year's <i>There's a Situation on the Homefront</i>. If it was possible, that's when things got even more ridiculous. Long baffled why a 45-year old white guy would rap, Serengeti scripted a prequel for his favored creation. Ergo, Kenny Dennis was once a 30-year old rapper in the Chicago-area group Tha Grimm Teachaz. Briefly signed to Jive Records in 1993, <i>There's a Situation on the Homefront</i> was shelved when the group's lone single ""I Getz"" flopped. Enlisting his long-time conspirator Hi-Fidel, Serengeti recorded the ""long-lost"" Teachaz record, complete with raps by KDz (The Killer Deacon) and PMDF (Prince Master Dark Force.), scratches by DJ Koufie, and a cameo from Funkdoobiest's Son Doobie—complete with styles suspended in the amber of the early Clinton era. For those keeping score, the alter ego had begat an alter ego,<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jY5TRfNi7Y"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> complete with a video that allegedly played only once on <i>Yo! MTV Raps</i></a>. In effect, Kenny Dennis was the Moonlight Graham of hip-hop.</p>
<p>If this sounds mildly insane, that's because it very well might be. Since the days of ""Rappin' Rodney,"" comedy rap has played a crucial role in reminding the genre to stop taking itself so fucking seriously. But no one has ever taken the joke further than Serengeti. At times, he is as insular and zany as Zappy. Sometimes, he is as bleakly comic as Zevon. Sometimes, he just mumbles in a faintly polish accent about O'Douls and onions. But there is no time when anyone can say that they have ever heard anything remotely like the<i> Kenny Dennis</i> EP. </p>
<p>I have spent the last two months attempting to play this record for anybody who gets in my car. It generally elicits a silent film star's range of facial expressions: people wrinkle their nose, raise their eyebrows, and finally roll their eyes. When they ask me why I like it so much, my only answer is that it makes me makes laugh. With its wealth of inherited folklore, inside jokes, and obscure allusions, <i>The Kenny Dennis EP</i> should come with Cliff Notes. You could find the idea of Kenny Dennis recording a diss song against Shaquille O'Neal funny in the abstract, but ""Shazam"" works a lot better if you understand that it's retaliation for when Shaq mocked Kenny's mustache at the 1993 Jive Records Showcase. Shaq was rocking with the Fu-Schnickens. You should watch <a href=""(http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JgNey0TtMS0"">the video</a> where Serengeti/Kenny dribbles the Big Aristotle's head like a basketball.</p>
<p>How am I supposed to explain ""Rib Tips?"" Its hook bellows: ""Rib Tips/ Rib Sandwiches/ aaaannndd chicken wings."" Kenny reprimands himself for being unable to shake his long-standing enmity against Shaq. He explains that the Grimm Teachaz split up because the KMDMF believed that Kenny expunged his verse from the group's Tevin Campbell remix. We also learn the fate of Kenny's little brother, Tanya, resigned to jumping out of birthday cakes, stripping, and doing an umbrella dance. Kenny sweetly defends Tanya, who ""just had to make a living."" It is the world's greatest karaoke song about smoked meats that will never be sung.</p>
<p>Then there is ""Don't Blame Steve"", the Chicago Cubs anthem in defense of Steve Bartman, the fan whose interference in a 2003 playoff game indirectly led to the team missing their first World Series since the end of World War II. Using the Cubs 8th inning Game 6 collapse as the setting, Serengeti/Kenny indicts 100 years of franchise futility. The refrain assigns blame to Paul Assenmacher, Jeff Pico, Damon Berryhill, Kevin Tapani, Steve Stone, Luis Salazar and every other choking Cub. Except for Andre Dawson, the first player to ever win an MVP on a last place team. The Hawk gets an extended bridge where Kenny celebrates his merits. It's like a game of RBI Baseball brought to life. The only flaw is that there is no Harry Caray narration.</p>
<p><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2181-jel/"" target=""_blank"">Jel</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3201-odd-nosdam/"" target=""_blank"">Odd Nosdam</a> slyly coax a full spectrum of emotion from the character. They produce every track, gleefully re-creating the break-beats and no bullshit attack of '93. After all, ""Shazam"" and ""Top That"" were unearthed from the lost vault of Tha Grimm Teachaz, complete with scratched hooks featuring <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/14362-guru/"" target=""_blank"">Guru</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3499-q-tip/"" target=""_blank"">Q-Tip</a>. While ""Rib Tips"" swoons with seraphic horns seemingly stolen from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28582-leyland-kirby/"" target=""_blank"">Leyland Kirby</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29716-the-caretaker/"" target=""_blank"">Caretaker</a> sample bin . Like Kenny himself, it is sentimental but without nostalgia. Dennis is too focused on the simple pleasures of marriage, high cholesterol products, sports, and non-alcoholic beer to lament any tragedies of time.</p>
<p>If anything, Kenny Dennis is the anti-Willy Loman, a character once resuscitated on Broadway by Brian Dennehy. He is the most antiquated of American heroes, the average ecstatic Joe. The erosion of age and obsolescence are unimportant. What matters is that there is plenty of pop and smoked sausage and Swanson's Chicken. Spring training is always around the corner and serenity occurs every Sunday each Fall. Unless the Bears lose.</p></div>"|16436.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16436-serengeti-kenny-dennis-ep/|7.8|Jeff Weiss

The longtime co-leader of the gloomily obstinate <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2546-low/"" target=""_blank"">Low</a> and the furrowed brow behind the fretwork-heavy <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5700-retribution-gospel-choir/"" target=""_blank"">Retribution Gospel Choir</a>, is not (on record, anyway) known for his sunny disposition. So when ""Maharisha"", the third of four tracks on Retribution Gospel Choir's brief, somewhat bizarre <i>Revolution</i> EP (available for free download right <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/45570-retribution-gospel-choir-give-away-new-ep/"" target=""_blank"">here</a>), clanks in on the back of a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10886-def-leppard/"" target=""_blank"">Def Leppard</a>-worthy cowbell, one can't help but wonder if Sparhawk's maybe, finally, having a laugh. If he was, could we even tell?<br><br>The answer to that one, like the <i>Revolution</i> EP itself, is more than a bit muddled. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/534-big-star/"" target=""_blank"">Big Star</a>-by-way-of-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1798-guided-by-voices/"" target=""_blank"">GBV</a> opener ""Feel It, Superior"" feels, at first, almost shockingly bright, its sleek, nigh-on-glossy production lending the guitars a kind of metallic glint that feels miles removed from the smoke-riddled slow-burn Sparhawk's long favored in Low. This sheen's not entirely new to Retribution, although the intensity is: ""White Wolf"" and (especially) ""Workin' Hard,"" from 2010's great <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13841-2/"" target=""_blank""><i>2</i></a>, hinted at the pared down, radio-ready-for-1985 sonics and what Sparhawk's called ""<a href=""http://www.avclub.com/twincities/articles/retribution-gospel-choirs-alan-sparhawk-unleashes,37800/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Huey Lewis harmonies</a>,"" all of which make strong showings on <i>Revolution</i>. But Sparhawk, a guy who's spent most of his career making records for the middle of the night, has rarely sustained a disposition as breezy as the one he affects on Revolution's first three songs; it's barely eight minutes, but it's something.</br></br></p>
<p>The pleasantly propulsive ""Superior"" uses up its tricks in its first minute or so, but it slides easily into the chunky chords and slightly silly falsetto of the Rick Springfieldian ""The Stone (Revolution!)."" Everything about ""The Stone"" feels appropriately corpo-rock; heck, even its incitement of revolution comes off less like the capital-R stuff and more like the nickname you'd give a radio station. There are references to things like turnin' up volumes and crankin' trebles throughout <i>Revolution</i>, with the emphasis very much placed on those apostrophes. The Loverboy-lite""Maharisha"" takes <i>2</i>'s ""Workin'"" and sets its sights squarely on the weekend; get past its veneer of Eastern spirituality, and underneath, it's pure cheese, the kind of thing you'd expect to hear rattling around some sweaty concrete bowl circa 1985. In other words, not really one to overthink.<br><br>Not an easy task, considering the source. Given Low's resolute Lowness, Sparhawk's more than earned the right to branch out, one he's taken continued advantage of in RGC. And, musically anyway, Sparhawk and company's flirtations with power-pop and arena-rock manage to feel pretty much like the real thing without accruing their own excesses. Sparhawk's got a surprisingly light touch with this style of songwriting, since they only ever approach all-out <i>Hysteria</i> with the production, they manage to completely sidestep what could only be the natural tendency towards parody.</br></br></p>
<p>But Sparhawk, not our loosest dude, can't quite shake his longstanding stolidity when he steps to the mic here, and vocally, it's a mismatch, an uncharacteristically stiff vocal performance laid atop some of the most easygoing music of his career. His vocals sound almost clipped, every intonation carefully rehearsed. Letting loose with knowing nonsense like ""nobody understands the Maharisha"" requires either a dumber delivery than he gives it or a dumber dude singing it; here, Sparhawk lays it out pretty straight, resulting in a song you'd raise your lighter to were you not otherwise scratching your temple with it.<br><br>The occasional hint of sleekly produced stadium fodder on <i>2</i> was always smartly matched to something dark, stormy, more suited to Sparhawk's strengths; here, it overwhelms, and Sparhawk can't quite brood his way through it without sounding a little lost. Closing duststorm ""I'm a Man,"" perhaps unsurprisingly, that fares best. With its smoldering guitars and defiantly sour mood, it's Sparhawk, cackling from the depths of his comfort zone. It's the one tune here that doesn't feel like it's trying to be something it isn't; he knows what he's saying, and he says it well, whereas elsewhere, he seems tentative, as though he knows what strange waters he's testing here. Sure, that cover-by-committee throwback artwork looks like the real deal, but it's just a JPEG. All the same, you can practically hear Sparhawk's commitment to the arena-rock ambitions of ""The Stone"" and ""Maharisha"" wavering from the minute he opens his mouth. The sound, he's got down; if only he could have a little fun with it.</br></br></p></div>"|16430.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16430-revolution/|5.5|Paul Thompson

The Sounds of Black Power 1967-1974|0.0|Various Artists|[]|0.0|0.0|0.0|['Light in the Attic']|2012-03-27 00:00:00|2012|2016-06-11 17:14:34.339640|"<div class=""contents dropcap"" data-reactid="".jvs2i6kgsg.1.6:0.1.0.$16408/=1$16408.0.3.2.0.1.0.1""><p>The music of Black Power turned out to be just as revolutionary as the politics. Just as activists conceived of a society that placed fewer limitations on and granted more liberties to African-Americans, contemporary artists associated with the movement worked toward stylistic freedom unconstrained by genre boundaries. And just as there were various permutations of the Black Power message (from militant nationalism to peaceful dissent), there was no one sound, much less one hit, that defined the cause. Instead, the movement espoused not only in jazz and R&amp;B, but also in rock, funk, folk, proto-rap, even stand-up comedy. Perhaps the most powerful aspect of <i>Listen, Whitey! The Sound of Black Power 1967-1974-- </i>the album and the book, both representing many years' research by historian Pat Thomas-- is how they portray a music in flux: Artists such as the Watts Prophets, the Original Last Poets, Shahid Quintet, and Marlena Shaw were only just realizing the potential for cross-genre synthesis and for radical political statement through music.</p>
<p>The rhetoric is not buried deeply in the music; in fact, these works wear their politics on the surface. Backed by saxophonist Eddie Harris, singer Gene McDaniels fashions a hook out of ""silent majority,"" the term famously used by Nixon to describe the millions of American who tacitly disagreed with left-wing protestors and who wanted no part of any revolution. What could have been awkward commentary-- the phrase isn't inherently musical-- instead becomes an eloquent redefinition of the phrase, equating silence with hypocrisy and cowardice. What good is a majority that stands for nothing and speaks up for no one? <i>Listen, Whitey!</i> depicts a movement in which the very act of making art becomes politicized-- a form of outreach not unlike the Black Panthers' breakfast program. On a riveting live version of ""Woman of the Ghetto"", Marlena Shaw doesn't simply document inner-city life, but does so from the perspective of struggling mothers and neglected children. She peppers the verse with relentless bursts of scat-singing-- a volley of untranscribable consonants that could be horn charts, heartbeats, or gun blasts.</p>
<p>These artists make their cases and explain their stances so exactingly that it's easy to grasp their messages as well as their rejection of previous civil rights strategies. Although it advocates social activism over violent revolt, Shahid Quintet's ""Invitation to Black Power (Parts 1 &amp; 2)"" seems to reject both the passive tactics of the Deep South civil rights movement just a few years easier and its roots in the church. However, the oratory skills of the black Southern preacher inform the public speaking style of Stokely Carmichael, whose ""Free Huey"" is a highlight on the compilation, bolstering his reputation as an intense public presence. ""We have to recognize who the major enemy is,"" he declaims. ""The major enemy is the honky and his institutions of racism."" Compare that speech to Eldridge Cleaver's ""Tim Leary"", which makes public the Black Panther leaders' falling out with the popular LSD sage. Cleaver's cadence is littered with um's and uh's, offering few glimpses of the magnetic presence who drew likeminded activists into his circle. ""Tim Leary"" is of purely historical value, documenting a footnote in the two men's lives.</p>
<p>In general, however, <i>Listen, Whitey!</i> emphasizes lesser-known acts, or at least lesser-known songs by fairly well-known acts. Thomas is interested in depicting Black Power music at street level rather than playlisting the most popular songs of the era. In the book, he unearths a wealth of material on the under-studied and overlooked Motown imprint Black Forum, which released spoken-word albums by Bill Cosby and Ossie Davis addressing the Congressional Black Caucus, Langston Hughes reading poetry, and black Vietnam soldiers discussing the realities of warfare with disarming candor (someone please reissue <i>Guess Who's Coming Home</i>). On the album, the standout from Black Forum is Elaine Brown's sparkling gospel-pop testament ""Until We're Free"", which communicates dignity and determination in the face of ""absurd"" hostility.</p>
<p>If there's a prominent theme on the album, it's the language of race: What do words like ""black,"" ""white,"" and ""power"" even mean? ""White folks in this country dirtied up the word black, not us,"" explains comedian Dick Gregory in an incisive routine that could double as poetry. ""White folks corrupted power, not us. Then one day we come through with two innocent words, 'Black Power,' and everybody go crazy."" Unfortunately, the track fades out too quickly, leaving Gregory's comment that ""America hides bigotry under conservatism"" unexamined.</p>
<p>Gylan Kain, formerly of the Last Poets, rejects any such categorization in his boisterous ""I Ain't Black"": ""I ain't black!"" he insists repeatedly, as the band goes wild behind him. As the song progresses, he changes it up: ""I ain't white!"" The implication is clear: he pushes against the racial distinctions but embraces the insults attached to them-- ""bastard"" and ""motherfucker""-- in much the same way that other artists and activists took on the pejorative ""nigger"" to forcefully distinguish themselves from the white society they saw as fundamentally corrupt.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most curious inclusions on <i>Listen, Whitey!</i> are a trio of tunes by white artists, who alternately support the Black Power cause and reject their own race. British folkie <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22059-roy-harper/"" target=""_blank"">Roy Harper</a> enumerates white offenses in ""I Hate the White Man"", a meandering indictment of imperialism, greed, genocide, and endemic cruelty. On the other hand, ""Angela"" by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2452-john-lennon/"" target=""_blank"">John Lennon</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3161-yoko-ono/"" target=""_blank"">Yoko Ono</a> sounds well intended but incredibly naïve, which is perhaps the downside to their notorious plan to rush that album to stores. Similarly, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1177-bob-dylan/"" target=""_blank"">Bob Dylan</a> released ""George Jackson"" just two weeks after the death of the activist during a prison riot, but he manages to capture the tragedy while it's still fresh, somehow preserving those raw emotions in amber. More crucially, he doesn't let his sympathy get him off the hook: ""Sometimes I think this whole world/ Is one big prison yard/ Some of us are prisoners/ The rest of us are guards."" Dylan may side with the prisoners, but he understands that he remains apart from them-- both prisoner and prison guard, an uncomfortable duality that he navigates with more sensitivity and nuance than Harper or Lennon.</p>
<p>It's fitting then that <i>Listen, Whitey!</i> ends with the hard one-two punch of the Original Last Poet's frenzied ""Die Nigga"" and Amiri Baraka's fiery ""Who Will Survive America"". The two songs couldn't sound more different, but they are intense, jarring, even fearless as they ponder the true cost of revolution. Forty-eight years after the passage of the Civil Rights Act and 46 years after the founding of the Black Panther party, it's difficult to reconstruct the original context for these songs or to understand how startling it would have been to hear artists discuss race and revolution so frankly. But by focusing on the range of music inspired by this movement, <i>Listen, Whitey!</i> allows so much of the confusion, outrage, anger, emotion, humor, and even optimism of this music to resonate anew.</p></div>"|16408.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16408-listen-whitey-the-sounds-of-black-power-1967-1974/|8.0|Stephen M.

These sort of records don't need to be cynical or uninspired on an artistic level, but this one feels particularly hollow, the dead-eyed result of obligations, deadlines, and hedged bets.</p>
<p>Madonna has made her share of bad music in the past, but for the most part, her failures have come from taking artistic chances that didn't pay off, as on her experiments with hip-hop on <i>American Life</i> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11453-hard-candy/"" target=""_blank""><i>Hard Candy</i></a>. Large chunks of <i>MDNA</i> are shockingly banal, coming across not so much as bad pop songs per se, but as drably competent tunes better suited to D-list Madonna wannabes. The worst of these numbers were produced by French DJ Martin Solveig, whose anonymous, unimaginative arrangements for ""Turn Up the Radio"", <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/45292-watch-the-video-for-madonnas-single-with-mia-and-nicki-minaj-give-me-all-your-luvin/"" target=""_blank"">""Give Me All Your Luvin'""</a>, ""I Don't Give A"", and ""B-Day Song"" are paired with excessively bland lyrics. The latter track, a collaboration with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2935-mia/"" target=""_blank"">M.I.A.</a>, is horrifically regressive, the sound of two of pop's great feminist provocateurs joining forces for what amounts to a tacky children's song about birthday parties spiced up with a couple of tired double entendres. (Sorry ladies, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5310-rihanna/"" target=""_blank"">Rihanna</a> beat you to that frosting-licking line.)</p>
<p>Madonna's tracks with house duo the Benassi Bros. and William Orbit, the principal architect of her 1998 album <i>Ray of Light</i>, are much better, if not up to par with previous career highlights. ""I'm Addicted"", a dynamic electro throbber by the Benassis, is the big keeper here, and their work on ""Girl Gone Wild"" yields a reasonably strong single that rises to the challenge of competing with Ke$ha, Britney Spears, and Katy Perry on pop radio. The Orbit collaborations mainly call back to their work together on <i>Ray</i>, the record that essentially established the aesthetics of the singer's past decade of music. ""I'm a Sinner"" is a serviceable rewrite of their <i>Ray</i>-era soundtrack hit ""Beautiful Stranger"", and ""Falling Free"" plays to her strengths as a singer of ballads, though it lacks the generous hooks of, say, ""Take a Bow"" or ""Live to Tell"".</p>
<p>The most interesting of the Orbit productions is ""Gang Bang"", a campy revenge fantasy that essentially uses her filmmaker ex-husband Guy Ritchie's sub-Tarantino aesthetic as a weapon against him. The title suggests porn, but it's really a nod to mobsters, particularly as her over-the-top, Ana Matronic-esque monologue turns especially violent and bloody. It's the album's boldest, most experimental track, and it's marred only by a just-off vocal performance that renders her very familiar voice a bit anonymous, and a half-hearted attempt at a dubstep bass drop. (Next time just hire <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30169-skrillex/"" target=""_blank"">Skrillex</a>, okay?)</p>
<p>Madonna reckons with her divorce from Ritchie elsewhere on the record, but her attempts to address lingering bitterness and affection for her ex are so remote that the songs have all the soul of a carefully edited press release. ""Love Spent"", an Orbit production with brittle electro-acoustic accompaniment, at least approaches the topic from an interesting angle, focusing on the tension and power dynamic of a relationship in which one half of the couple drastically out-earns the other. The song picks up steam as it goes along, but it ultimately comes out like a tepid, ponderous rework of her 2005 smash <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDwb9jOVRtU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Hung Up""</a>. ""I Don't Give A"" starts off strong with her spitting out the lines, ""Wake up, ex-wife/ This is your life,"" in a robotic rap, but she is upstaged by guest <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28745-nicki-minaj/"" target=""_blank"">Nicki Minaj</a>, who turns in an entertaining performance that is nevertheless below the standards of her usual features.</p>
<p>It's almost impossible to approach <i>MDNA</i> without some degree of cynicism, but it's equally difficult to imagine anyone being more cynical about this music than Madonna herself. Unlike previous late-period records in which she had the luxury to indulge in creative tangents and not get too hung up on scoring several hits, <i>MDNA </i>is a record that comes with major commercial expectations. The ""this has to work"" factor is high, and it's hard to shake the impression that she has some measure of contempt for the contemporary pop audience. We all know that Madonna is an extremely intelligent woman-- even if she's never been known for penning great lyrics, it's easier to take the mesmerizingly dumb lyrics of tracks like ""Superstar"" and ""B-Day Song"" as spiteful trolling rather than vapid pandering. It doesn't really matter whether or not this drivel is insulting to Madonna's audience-- the most loyal fans seem to embrace being submissive to her domineering persona-- but it is disheartening when one of the most influential pop artists of the 20th century is tossing out the world's umpteen-millionth ""Mickey"" retread as a lead single. She's the one who deserves better.</p></div>"|16426.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16426-mdna/|4.5|Matthew Perpetua

""Simply put, neither Eric [Emm] nor I have ever taken anything in our whole lives more seriously than the work we put into this album,"" Cohen continued. ""It couldn't possibly mean more to us. I don't think I need to be super pretentious for you to know that, but sometimes I just want to say it.""</p>
<p>Part of the reason Cohen felt the need to clarify was likely because <a href=""http://twitter.com/#!/tanlines"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">@Tanlines</a> doesn't look like your typical musician's Twitter feed, focusing more on clever observational jokes rather than self-promotion. In turn, it has gained them more than a few followers who are clearly unaware that the Tanlines account belongs to a working band and not a comedian. Cohen's message contained a surprisingly heartfelt sentiment coming from a handle usually known for material like, ""Just had a landline-to-landline conversation #90s."" But try as he might to separate his Twitter account from his band's music, the truth is <i>Mixed Emotions</i> and @Tanlines have more in common with each other than Cohen would likely admit. <i>Mixed Emotions</i> contains some truly great tracks that work terrifically as standalone singles, as carefully composed and satisfying as a well-constructed quip, almost always augmented by a good-natured undercurrent of earnest, welcome sentimentality. And while everything in between may feel like a contextually empty @-reply or obligatory retweet, it makes for an uneven listen that still amounts to more than what that ever-present <a href=""http://twitpic.com/8u2j2m"" target=""_blank"">winky-sad emoticon</a> might suggest.</p>
<p>Tanlines are clearly capable of writing great songs. Between a few singles and 2010's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14031-settings-ep/"" target=""_blank""><i>Settings</i></a> EP, we were given a handful of warm, Balearic-tinged tracks with an extra dancefloor-ready boost thanks to Afro-pop and Tropicália detailing. One of the more notable standouts, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11819-real-life/"" target=""_blank"">""Real Life""</a>, shows up again on <i>Mixed Emotions</i>, and while its replay value makes its inclusion seem perfectly logical, it does reveal what some might consider to be a strike against the band. There is little denying that Tanlines' sound is, for all intents and purposes, beholden to a place and a time (see: Brooklyn, 2010). With ""Real Life"" fitting in so well with the rest of the new material, it's pretty clear that <i>Mixed Emotions</i> has been an immersive project, so much so that it uses the same building blocks on which Cohen and Emm propped up the Tanlines project a few years ago.</p>
<p>But being hard on Tanlines for not being progressive is a waste of time when, pretty frequently, the pair is able to use gratifying sonic details, big choruses, and large pop pleasure-center targets, all of which help manage to occasionally hit emotionally rich sweet spots. Opener and lead single<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12976-brothers/"" target=""_blank""> ""Brothers""</a> is as good a place to start as any, with the amniotic warmth of its bass and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3031-new-order/"" target=""_blank"">New Order</a>-styled synth flourishes. ""Brothers"" takes its name from the first studio Tanlines ever recorded in, but it also works when translated as a reflection of a friendship over the years. ""I'm just the same as I ever been/ But I'm the only one who doesn't notice it,"" goes the chorus. A lot of <i>Mixed Emotions</i> contains similar thematic elements in its lyrics, full of vague, open-ended questions that seem most applicable for people verging on a mid-mid-life crisis. But because of their opaqeuness, the simplest turns of phrase-- when left open for interpretation-- give the album a sort of emotional adaptability. For such a rhythmically-oriented affair, these smears of melancholy offer necessary balance.</p>
<p><i>Mixed Emotions</i> aims for the heart and the gut (though aside from ""Real Life"", not so much the hips, which is a bit disappointing), but in missing easy opportunities to connect with either lies the record's biggest problems. In the way most of these songs are structured, there's a real need for some kind of release, a way to tip things over the edge and open the songs up. You get a wonderfully redemptive feel from tracks like the gigantic, aching ""Not the Same"", and it's largely because there's some very tangible emotional payoff in the chorus. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13244-all-of-me/"" target=""_blank"">""All of Me""</a> and the saccharine ""Lost Somewhere"" both fall victim to simply not being big enough, which is especially hard to overlook when there's evidence that these guys can pull off big. By presenting itself as being a vivid and borderline-anthemic kind of album, you can't help but feel a bit frustrated when the songs fail to make good on the promise. Exemplified by the driving ""Green Grass"", it means to give you a charge and push you forward, but instead creates the sensation of running in place.</p>
<p>Which is, in some ways, preferable to the songs that never even have a chance to get off the ground. A lot of <i>Mixed Emotion</i>'s direct influence lies in a very specific corner of classic rock radio, plucking rather indiscriminately from the Police, Peter Gabriel, and Paul Simon. A number of acts over the past few years have been paid substantial dividends in channeling these names, but Cohen and Emm seem bent on rendering out the most honeyed details, leaving some of these tracks nauseously buoyant. Had they been a bit more inconspicuous with the references (the lovely ""Abby"" being a nice example), Vitamin D-enriched tracks like ""Lost Somewhere"" and the unnecessarily stripped-down ""Yes Way"" wouldn't begin to reek like so much potpourri.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the record's second half really picks things up, with the appealingly straightforward, new romantic-shaded rock track ""Rain Delay"" and the spatial new wave ballad ""Nonesuch"" at the close. These tracks don't hit the same highs that ""Not the Same"" or ""Brothers"" do, and that's okay. It can be easy to forget that, while you're constantly waiting for that big payoff, most of these songs are really pretty damn good. Tanlines have never had a problem with the set-up, but it's in the delivery where the occasionally falter.</p></div>"|16406.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16406-tanlines-mixed-emotions/|7.1|Zach Kelly

I can't think of another way to explain his last three albums, each of which has found him casting outside his usual wheelhouse for material and producing excitingly eclectic records. <i>Sonik Kicks</i> is the latest of these, and it wears its search for new textures in its title. Weller does a lot more with electronic textures than usual here, though that doesn't mean he's gone and produced some kind of exploratory electronic album. Rather, he uses a lot of electronic toys and production tricks to goose the arrangements of what are otherwise pretty basic rock songs.</p>
<p>Weller doesn't have to do this. I think Americans can be forgiven for not realizing what a huge star he is in his native Britain, but he has laurels enough to rest on for the remainder of a career (his last two albums charted at No. 1 and 2 respectively in the UK). It could be argued that the Jam alone is laurel enough. That he still pushes himself is admirable and shows that he cares. That said, I'm not sure all the electronic window dressing is a good look for him, mostly because it is primarily window dressing. At best it helps things along a bit and at worst it's distracting, but I'm not sure there's a single song here that's made or broken by it.</p>
<p>""Dragonfly"", for instance, is a strong song with a brisk tempo-- there's some nice, buzzy organ hanging back in the mix that gives it sting, and the airy production is good. But those little bubbly noises don't add up to anything. On lead single ""That Dangerous Age"", the electronic sheen does give an extra kick to the beat, but the song is really driven home by something much more old-fashioned: the fantastically catchy ""shoo-woop!"" backing vocals. Likewise, opener ""Green"" isn't much of a song, but it has a decent-enough pulse that it pulls you into the album. Honestly, if someone had played it for me blind, I might have guessed it was a middle-of-the-order track from a new <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3993-super-furry-animals/"" target=""_blank"">Super Furry Animals</a> LP.</p>
<p>In places, the production choices outright hinder the music. Late album tracks ""Around the Lake"" and the proggy ""Drifters"" would both benefit from less reverb, because their melodies don't hit as hard with so much watery echo. On the opposite end of the spectrum, though, is the six-and-a-half-minute ""Study in Blue"", a dub reggae excursion that works pretty well, especially contrasted with the relatively dry, folky ""By the Waters"", and the straightforward slam of ""That Dangerous Age"". <i>Sonik Kicks</i> is a good record, but it doesn't have the songwriting depth and range of its two predecessors, and as admirable as it is that Weller is still playing with his formula and searching for something new to do with it, the electronics here do the songs few favors.</p></div>"|16422.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16422-sonik-kicks/|6.5|Joe Tangari

The latter was a natural fit for a video in which long pans take in a fabulous landscape full of piled corpses and visual references to European painting. In Black to Comm's music, we likewise feel ourselves to be plowing across wastelands of aestheticized violence and apocalyptic beauty. You could call it a match made in hell. After performing his score at screenings in Berlin and Krakow (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IM9mQxf_oxk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here's an excerpt</a>), Marc Richter decided to go ahead and make it his seventh full-length Black to Comm record. </p>
<p>Black to Comm's music is as abstract as an inkblot, and so you can project your favorite influences onto it: 1970s German experimental music, contemporary noise, eccentric outsider art, classic film scores-- all fair game. Liberated from any one set of formal constraints, Richter uses his many resources to conjure delicate effects of mood and graded shading. <i>Earth </i>has an arc, rising up from desolation through some pastoral and sacred passages to culminate in the impenetrably shining ""Mirror"". But even the prettiest moments are shot through with uneasy threads. I can't verify <a href=""http://destijlrecs.com/098.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Richter's claim</a> that he composed it on heavy painkillers while recovering from a broken leg, but it's credible. It's also consoling that there should be an <i>explanation </i>for this: sinister loop-based music that, somehow, never repeats itself.</p>
<p>Like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13789-alphabet-1968/""><i>Alphabet 1968</i></a>, Black to Comm's prior LP, <i>Earth </i>is a mix of manipulated loops from old shellac records, errant acoustic instrumentation, and electronic disturbances. (His consistent fondness for altered records marks him as an evil twin of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2178-philip-jeck/"">Philip Jeck</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15518-an-empty-bliss-beyond-this-world/"">Leyland Kirby</a>.) Unlike <i>Alphabet</i>, it features ghoulish arias courtesy of <a href=""http://vindicatrix.tumblr.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Vindicatrix</a>. Whenever Vindicatrix shows up, it sounds like someone punched <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4025-david-sylvian/"">David Sylvian</a> in the stomach, then made him sing in a room full of wind-chimes and possessed phonographs. Undoubtedly an acquired taste (he does grow on you), the vocalist is most poignant when he holds back: trying to catch his breath, with understated pathos, on ""Stickstoff II"", or murmuring ""awake"" with hypnotic insistence on the gloomy chorale ""Thrones"". Vibrating in tune with the record's derangement, he sings like someone who has suffered from an irreparable internal cave-in. As with Laura Dern's constantly stricken expression in David Lynch movies, this seems like an appropriate response to finding oneself singing on a Black to Comm record.</p>
<p>If you generally listen to music on the factory speakers in your car or computer, you can basically forget about this release. All you'll hear is distant rustling and moaning; some indifferently fretted acoustic guitar. The music is for close listening or for nothing. This is especially true of ""Stickstoff II"", a complex of infinitesimal flutters and whirrs. But every broad narrative unit on the record breaks down, at the atomic level, to an accumulation of tiny, chaotic events. In this way, life on <i>Earth</i> is an uncanny yet accurate reflection of life on this planet.</p></div>"|16429.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16429-earth/|7.6|Brian Howe

It's a haunting image, and one that fits her music perfectly. The Ethiopian-Finnish singer-songwriter plays stark doom-folk in permanent flux between light and dark, life and death, and concerns of the soul and desires of the flesh.</p>
<p>All we hear is a dexterous, spectral guitar and Wagner's haunted vocals, so intimate they could be your inner monologue. Exhibiting a firm grasp of American folk traditions, she understands not only their oldness and weirdness, but also how they hint at worlds that never existed except as fantastical alternatives for the real one. She manages to find common ground between Dock Boggs and Townes Van Zandt, between Geeshie Wiley and Robert Johnson, between <i>Let Us Now Praise Famous Men</i> and <i>Wisconsin Death Trip</i>. As Wagner understands it, folk needs no revival: These referents still exert a primal power no matter how old they are.</p>
<p>There she is at the crossroad, finding erotic possibility as she makes a deal with the devil. ""Red"" describes a lover with red eyes and possibly cloven feet. ""Let the devil take me,"" Wagner's narrator submits. ""He'll eat your flesh and spit out the seeds,"" she is warned. Such an act may be even tantalizing for the seduced woman. The supernatural elements work because they engage folk music's long history of addressing sin and temptation. They work because Wagner sings them in a small but unwavering voice: Facing eternal damnation, she sounds utterly and unshakably certain of her lust for Old Scratch.</p>
<p>Death looms over this debut, making Wagner's quiet songs sound much louder. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13079-no-death/"" target=""_blank"">""No Death""</a> not-so-subtly rewrites the old Appalachian dirge ""O Death"" with an old EC Comics storyline. A man refuses to believe his lover is dead. Necrophilia ensues. The visceral imagery can be disarming: ""Her hair is long, still smells like mud,"" she sings. ""She answered to my kiss with a rotten tongue."" Wagner flirts with goth hyperbole, yet her commitment to the idea lends it the emotional heft of confessional songwriting.</p>
<p>Following ""No Death"", ""No Hands"" isn't what you might expect. Rather than chronicling amputation, it turns out to be a nostalgic ode to childhood-- to days spent riding her bicycle under the watchful eye of her mother. ""Look mother, no hands."" The song is neither bitter nor sweet, but a curious memory considered in the fewest words possible. Likewise on ""The Well""-- another tune that invokes an unspeaking mother, this one long since gone-- Wagner conveys a powerful sense of wonder at the world, investing even the smallest details with stark significance.</p>
<p>Wagner uses her acoustic guitar the way hypnotists use crystals and pendulums. The repetition of short themes, which all sound like they still have attic dust on them, lull you gently and escort you into her dark world, which is both larger and more unusual than its sketched quality might suggest. She lays down a truncated blues riff on ""Dream"", a bed of nails for her spoken-word delivery. On ""The Well"", her acoustic filigrees sound like sunlight on water. <i>Mirel Wagner</i> possesses a curious physicality both in her lyrical conjurings and in the confident agility of her guitar playing, which together sound distinctive, specific, and personal even when considered against the decades of acoustic folk music that has come before.</p></div>"|16427.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16427-mirel-wagner/|7.8|Stephen M.

He's smoking savage out of Sarasota, twisting joints just like a contortionist. He's not hitting Poughkeepsie crispy chicken, he's devouring roasted bone marrow spread onto lightly toasted rosemary bread-- drizzled with vinaigrette. He's not lampin' in the throne with Wonder Woman bracelets and King Tut hats. He's swaddled in suede loin cloths and knee-length leather jackets. Meaning: He is not <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1824-ghostface-killah/"" target=""_blank"">Ghostface Killah</a>. After all, Tony Starks never laid out in the Galapagos, eating tacos, higher than an opera note (that we know).</p>
<p>The Ghostface similarity is the <i>arrière-pensée</i> precluding people from joining the Bronsolino bandwagon. But Bronson doesn't ask for his French to be pardoned. He speaks Polish out in London, with a face just like a young John F. Kennedy. Bronson is Homer Simpson staring into the mirror and seeing a chiseled Adonis. But it's not true self-delusion. 5'7"", 260, ginger-bearded, bowling ball-built, Bronson has the swaggering confidence of the original overweight lover, Heavy D. He blends that with epicurean inclinations-- a dirty sex and esoteric food obsession suggestive of Henry Miller scripting episodes of <i>No Reservations</i> for Anthony Bourdain. Sautee the intricate rat-a-tat patterns of Kool G Rap, the stoned perversion of the Beatnuts, and the super-fly vivid laser eye-guide specifics of Ghostface and... bon appétit.</p>
<p>But when the 27-year old of Albanian ancestry uploaded ""Shiraz"" and ""Imported Goods"" to YouTube two years ago, the Flushing native was little more than a Ghostface manqué, a chubby, Knicks Jersey-sporting, blunt smoking chef, spitting slang over formalist soul loops and break beats. There was promise but the only thing that made truly set him apart from the crowded field of New York revivalists was his ability to articulate the differences between Canadian bacon and prosciutto. Admittedly, that's not entirely different from what he does now. But at some point over the last six months, Bronson made the leap. He went from promising character whose music always seemed on the brink of making you turn it off in favor of <i>Supreme Clientele</i>, to one of the most hilarious and creative writers in rap.</p>
<p>What's weird is that he did this by becoming even more like Ghostface Killah, going so far as to sample ""Apollo Kids"" on ""Tapas"". Rather than mimic Ghostface's trademark vocal exaggerations, <i>Blue Chips</i>-era Bronson mines from the same concepts that made Ghost great: bodega slang, sleazy narratives, childhood flashbacks, and bizarre allusions. Sculptures of Bronson's body are out in Nagano, he smuggles cheese in baby bags, sometimes his only friends are drugs and cannoli.</p>
<p>Take ""Hookers at the Point"", a triptych of pimp, ho, and john, interwoven with samples from the 2002 documentary of the same title. There have been a million songs that cover similar terrain, but Bronson boasts his own brand of gonzo humor, subtle pathos, and specificity. He raps from all three perspectives, taking special glee in his absurd portrait of Silk, aka Montel (one ""L""), a pinky-ringed, Henny-swilling pimp, sporting lizard-skin boots and green suits, with ""eight bitches look like they straight from the Alaskan blizzard.""</p>
<p>The most harrowing cut might be ""Thug Love Story 2012"", where Bronson spins a tale of ""young love/ But we thought it was eternity/ Raw sex/Never thought about paternity."" It ends up with diapers being flung and assault and battery charges being beat. Bronson's New York is one of loud arguments keeping entire apartments awake, exotic smells seeping out into hallways, thick accents and thin walls, the tug-of-war between assimilation and the preservation of old world roots. It is what a Weegee photograph would look like now.</p>
<p>Should you be searching for them, there are flaws to be found on <i>Blue Chips</i>. It's fair to say that Bronson's influences could be synthesized more. The audio fidelity is about what you'd expect it would be when samples were lifted straight off of YouTube after searching stoned for phrases like ""100 Acre Burgundy Carpet"". You could also cavil that the project is too retro-minded. Originally conceived as a 1980s throwback (and taking its name from a 1990s Nick Nolte college basketball film), producer Party Supplies rifles through familiar beat breaks and Cyrus Neville, the Flamingos, and Frank Zappa samples. To futurists, it might sound too traditionally New York. Then again, A$AP Rocky got shit for not sounding enough like New York. There is no winning.</p>
<p><i> Blue Chips</i> works so well because it's as tailor-made to Bronson as the leather Jodeci suit he invokes. The album's structured structureless-ness plays to Bronson's strengths. It has the loose off-the-cuff spontaneity that lends to its playful vibe. Bronson fucks up no fewer than three times on ""9-24-11"", but keeps recording. Nor are there any real attempts at hooks. Bronson's goals are minimal and fully realized: Make eminently quotable East Coast rap, and be savagely funny.</p>
<p>Think of Bronson as less throwback, more raw Queens charmer, scheming in the tradition of old working class New York: the fast-talking cabbies with the Noo Yawk patois, porno theaters, immigrant waiters, and bizarre late-night public-access programs. <i>Blue Chips</i> spits back the striving native son as white Queens rapper, weaned on old WWF and NWA, the Doc Gooden Mets, Wu-Tang, and fistfuls of baklava. Under the influence of fly shit, puffing hibiscus, chilling eating lamb brain.</p></div>"|16425.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16425-action-bronson-blue-chips/|8.1|Jeff Weiss

Though it sounds cynical, a roomful of musicians who seem like they have no business being together usually don't, it turns out, and are far more apt to produce a dismaying mess than an unprecedented, illuminating fusion. Over the last five or six years, <a href=""http://www.sufjan.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sufjan Stevens</a> seems to have suffered a particular weakness for just this sort of collaboration, and his fans, accordingly, have suffered along with him. For whatever reason, one of the earlier decade's most singular voices has grown increasingly fond of hurling himself into colorful masses of people. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13593-the-bqe/"" target=""_blank""><i>The BQE</i></a> project, the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28331-osso/"" target=""_blank"">Osso String Quartet</a> dalliance, collaborations with everyone from the Clogs to the Castanets to Clare &amp; the Reasons-- Sufjan is now defined largely as the guy you find on everyone else's records. It might be irrepressible eagerness, or it might be his crazy-like-a-fox way of working beyond the kind of flashpoint moment that can stop a career like a clock, but it's resulted in a breathtakingly erratic run littered with inconsequential one-offs just like this one.</p>
<p>Here's the lineup for s/s/s : Sufjan, the new York composer <a href=""http://sonlux.tumblr.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Son Lux</a> (who keeps one foot in the cozy NYC indie classical scene), and the Anticon rapper <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29808-serengeti/"" target=""_blank"">Serengeti</a>. You'll notice that all three artists' first initials begin with ""S."" You may now sigh a little and feel a slight sinking in your chest. The first song, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13272-museum-day/"" target=""_blank"">""Museum Day""</a>, opens with the sound of Sufjan piped through an Auto-Tuner, a moment that heightens the general dubiousness. The effect is tweaked a little too artlessly, giving it a suspiciously parodic hint that feels about three years past its cultural sell-by date.</p>
<p>The good news is that the resulting EP is far less dire than all this suggests. Son Lux and Sufjan have created a nice tapestry of mournful synth pads and strings, and it makes a suitable background for those by-now familiar somber-choirboy voices Sufjan deploys to add shivers. Serengeti's loose, conversational story-rapping is the wild card, but he fits into the subdued atmosphere, talking quietly more than he raps. The downcast, emo-rap slam poetry he works in has a perilously high carnage margin, but he keeps from plummeting off a cliff here, staying understated and writing in reliably small, vivid images: ""Sneaking in my sister's purse/ That was money for the water bill."" Over an irregular, clomping beat on ""Beyond Any Doubt"", he tells us about being ""Lonely and depressed/ Eating cold fried rice."" We've all been there.</p>
<p>On ""If This Is Real"", Serengeti even invites us to his wedding, where his best man reads a poem: ""A beautiful villanelle, you made everybody's eyes well."" He tells someone else they are ""vital like Krebs cycle,"" which feels almost ridiculous enough to be something a drunken groom tells a friend. All of this is awkward, obviously, but the openhearted spirit is endearing, and the songs themselves pulse fleetly enough that you aren't really given much of an opportunity to snort. You can feel the breeze on your face from the pages of a 500-page novel riffled in front of you. As for Sufjan, apart from a couple flourishes, his presence is about as detectable as a teaspoon of salt in a pot of jambalaya. But these three have managed to come away with this thing with some actual songs, which is, well, something. Whether or not they've produced anything that justifies the time away they could have spent producing something better, more consequential, by themselves? Well, the jury's still out there.</p></div>"|16418.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16418-sss-beak-claw/|4.8|Jayson Greene

Prologue has a secret weapon in Donato Dozzy, whose own productions could range from relatively chugging techno (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oIYSj65u8w"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Menta""</a>), pastoral daydreams (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COTZGbcS5BQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">his remix</a> of Tin Man's ""Nonneo""), and any manner of ambient synth kosmische material. His <a href=""http://prologuemusic.bandcamp.com/album/voices-from-the-lake-feat-donato-dozzy-and-neel"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Voices From the Lake</a> project is a collaboration with fellow Italian Neel, and solves Prologue's predictability problem by reinventing typical techno structures wholesale.</p>
<p>Voices From the Lake emerged in 2010 as the name for a semi-anonymous Neel mix, proffering up more than an hour of elegantly paced ambient techno. The moniker appeared on Prologue last year with a four-track EP of spiritually throbbing techno. Their self-titled album is the fruit of a live set worked up by the duo played at Japan's infamous Labyrinth, the mountain-set festival with which Dozzy has long been associated, and removes most of the conventional techno signifiers of both contributors' past work in favor of a webbed crawl that takes trance's steady chug and applies it to a new-agey palette of discrete, delicate textures.</p>
<p>Kick drum? What's that? The first thing you'll notice about <i>Voices From the Lake</i> is that it seems to be made out of meticulously detailed glass shards, a brittle and dissolute sort of rhythm that forms out of synchronous elliptical patterns rather than the rigid time signatures of techno. There's a pulse there, but it's soft and hidden, like you'd have to peel back a thousand layers to get closer to these songs' beating heart. The result is something that sounds strangely alive and heavily dynamic, where patterns shift and forms morph so subtly and patiently that it's hard to tell exactly what's going on at any moment, like a fractal that actually changes shape as you go further down to its core. This gives the album an unusual flow that feels like stationary floating in space, 70 minutes of beautifully constructed breathing music so painstaking you can't tell where one track begins and another ends if you aren't watching your music player: It just <i>is</i>.</p>
<p>That's not to say <i>Voices From the Lake</i> doesn't change over its running time, because dip your fingers into the world music vortex of ""Vega"" and then look to the submerged rave of ""Twins in Virgo"", and you'll find yourself in two very different wading pools of bubbling beats. There is one defining moment on <i>Voices </i>that stands out above all others, the pair's rework of the previously-released Dozzy track ""S.T."".  After almost 30 minutes of percolation and vibration, a single bassline emerges, a gently ascending and descending chord progression that harbors an unusual impact for something that sounds so airy and ephemeral. Those particulate low frequencies flood the canvas of a work painted mostly in dot matrix with broad strokes of emotion.</p>
<p>In terms of taking ""techno"" to unconventional extremes of sound design and structure, <i>Voices From the Lake</i> most immediately recalls Ricardo Villalobos and Max Loderbauer's exhaustive <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15797-re-ecm/"" target=""_blank"">Re: ECM</a> </i>double album from last year, but <i>Voices</i> has more emotional resonance and a rhythmic plot that feels more inviting, even if it's no less difficult to figure out. But barring that mid-album explosion of melody, this is a record that eschews the politics of techno linearity, replacing the rise-rise-rise-rise-peak-blowout-descend progression with one that puts all the tension and shift into pockets and sounds so small that it sounds more like a vibrant ecosystem of microorganisms than ""beats.""</p>
<p><i>Voices From the Lake </i>is a triumph of care and exactitude, the kind of well-executed work of art that feels effortless despite its obvious complexity. Rarely can an album be this intimidatingly detailed, warmly inviting, and totally indifferent. In its seeming quest to map out rhythm to an unimaginable infinity, <i>Voices From the Lake</i> manages to be everything at once: It's some of the most inventive techno in ages, it's some of the prettiest ambient you'll hear on any German techno label, and it's a unique kind of entrancing that would feel hokey if it weren't so undeniably attractive.</p></div>"|16357.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16357-voices-from-the-lake/|8.2|Andrew Ryce

And for <a href=""http://mckenzieeddy.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">McKenzie Eddy</a>, an employee of Dame Dash's BluRoc label who has just begun recording, it's probably just a chance to work with <i>someone</i>. Should you download it and listen to it? The stakes could not be lower-- it is free, and takes up 20 minutes of your time. And yet, depressingly, the answer is no. There is not a single moment here that suggests any of its participants were ever in the same room, have met each other, or have ever heard the finished product. This is a release for no one.</p>
<p>It's a shame. Vado and Cam'ron were a great team when they first found each other. Cam'ron gave the upstart rapper a crucial, early-career cosign, and a juicy context-- the Rebirth of Dipset!-- to leap out of. But lately, their chemistry is eroding, and the blame is entirely Cam's. Listening to this man rap used to be one of life's great pleasures, but listening to him in 2012 is almost no fun at all. He hasn't switched up his flow in any meaningful way since 2004, to the point that  you can mouth along to these raps on your first time through. He was always a guy who sounded like he was rapping for his own private amusement, but it seems to take a lot less to amuse him these days: ""The hell with drama/ Tell yo mama/ You the first lady/ My Michelle Obama,"" he raps on ""Why, Oh Why"".</p>
<p>Vado has a few more flows in his arsenal than Cam'ron does-- which is to say, two or more. Hearing him rap over the heavy-lidded lava-lamp blobs that Ski provides, you get the distinct sense he could still crawl his way to a wider audience. He does his job, barking like a drill sergeant, but it's wasted work. Ski Beatz drops some of his least distinctive material here-- which is fair play, as a project like this is where it belongs. McKenzie Eddy sings in a breathy, off-brand imitation of Chrisette Michele, making an impression on no one. The result feels like some sort of dispatch from sneaker-commercial purgatory. This is not where Vado belongs. Hearing his galvanizing voice cut through all this glop, you feel for him. Maybe it's time to part ways with this tired-sounding dude who keeps repeating himself.</p></div>"|16423.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16423-camronski-beatzvado-blu-tops/|4.2|Jayson Greene

There are plenty of times where I doubt whether I can legitimately be surprised anymore, but upon encountering this song in anticipation of Finnish duo <a href=""http://pepedeluxe.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pepe Deluxé</a>'s new album, I was on some straight <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m5CIcbytfM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Trapaholics ""DAMN SON, WHERE'D YOU FIND THIS?""</a> shit. Pepe Deluxé have been around since the late 1990s as sample-happy, electro-pop jokers and you could put ""The Storm"" in a lineage of va-va-voom bombast ranging from Shirley Bassey to the ""1812 Overture"", so it wasn't totally out of nowhere. Nonetheless, it left me truly curious as to what sort of album could possibly contain it. But <i>Queen of the Wave'</i>s simply soul-deadening abundance makes the answer seem awfully predictable in hindsight: You know the rich spectrum of human emotion captured in the facial expression of someone who ordered the fully-loaded nachos and then realized, ""I'm gonna eat <i>that</i>?"" once it's brought out? <i>Queen of the Wave </i>mostly exists toward the tail end of that spectrum.</p>
<p>Fitting too, since it's the sort of record that's far more attractive when its ingredients are merely listed out of context. Pepe Deluxé have certainly upped the extracurricular ante for this thing, as you can <a href=""http://pepedeluxe.com/#companions"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">help yourself</a> to up to <i>five </i>Album Companions annotating the production of <i>Queen of the Wave. </i>This includes the use of Edison's ""Ghost Machine"", a 500,000-volt Tesla Coil synthesizer, and, most prominently, the Great Stalacpipe Organ in Virginia's Luray Caverns-- one of the songs here is seemingly <i>about </i>the world's largest instrument (""Temple of Unfed Fire"") and another actually features it (""In the Cave""). And right there on the cover, Pepe Deluxé promise an ""esoteric pop opera in three parts,"" which begins in earnest on ""Queenswave"". A web of gentle acoustic arpeggios get spun over a chunky bassline melody and oscillating bird calls while a stacked-octave harmony intones, ""Let me a song for you/ Let me spin a tale that's true/ A story about the days of gold/ A story more than ages old."" That's about as minimalist as things get here, and a flurry of flutes come in a moment later.</p>
<p>Pepe Deluxé claim narrative inspiration in the Atlantis fantasies ""A Dweller on Two Planets"" and its sequel ""An Earth Dweller's Return"", so of course, the tale isn't true, it isn't about the days of gold, and it's actually from the 19th century. No worries, this wouldn't be the first concept record to successfully overcome a completely nonsensical or nonexistent plot-- the ""story"" serves more as a framework for Pepe Deluxé to spin their usual surrealistic foolery. The problem is that while <i>Queen of the Wave </i>is ostensibly meant as a whirlwind, genre-hopping excursion that can match its wild literary ambitions, most of it circles back to 1999's idea of 1969, or, more ominously, a dystopian vision of Austin Powers making <i>Midnite Vultures. </i> Which is even worse than it sounds as it amplifies all their flaws: the painful mugging, Cool Britannia kitsch, overbearing spy soundtrack vocals, and the most indiscriminate track stuffing imaginable. Did you ever think it'd be possible for a song to somehow merge Air's ""Sexy Boy"" <i>and </i>the Go! Team? Probably not, and for the same reasons you wouldn't expect fish to have lungs, but ""Go Supersonic"" scoffs in the face of evolution and fails loudly in its attempts to do so.</p>
<p>In both title and execution, ""Go Supersonic"" is Pepe Deluxé's compositional M.O., but unlike similar exploratory thrift-store epics like <i>Since I Left You</i> or even <i>Blueberry Boat,</i> <i>Queen of the Wave </i>is just no <i>fun.</i> Whether it's the Spy vs. Spy freakout achieved by the volleys of timbales and horns on ""Hesperus Garden"" or the modal folk scales of the surely winking ""Contain Thyself"", there's no maneuverability or dynamics, nothing to explore, no depth to the stacks upon stacks of overdubs. Nothing earns its place in the mix and rather than demonstrating boundless creativity, every stereo-panned drum roll or harpsichord lick feels custodial or the result of sheer boredom. I'm sure this is capable of finding a cult audience if only because I know plenty of people who play <i>Grand Theft Auto </i>using all the cheat codes, but even after a dozen or so listens, the only things that stick are fashioned from blunt repetition: the cheerleader hook from ""Go Supersonic"", ""A Night and a Day""'s jutting surf riff, the Wagnerian convulsions of ""The Storm"". All fairly simple musical ideas and yet they prove more enduring than the budget-blowing gimmicks.</p>
<p>Considering its absurd execution and basis in an arcane literary work, I can't help but think of <i>John Carter,</i> which is similarly not all that bad but will forever serve as a parable of excess as opposed to a work of art. Of course, for all the talk of stubborn auteurs and inexperienced executives, the most glaring flaw was how Disney spent a gazillion dollars on an ad campaign that gave nobody even the slightest idea of what the movie was actually about. Likewise, <i>Queen of the Wave </i>is every bit as intriguing and batshit as an elevator pitch and something of a visionary work the band is clearly proud of. But it's ultimately up to the artist to generate a reason for the audience to actually care, and whether it's in terms of melody, narrative, or emotional resonance, <i>Queen of the Wave </i>just makes you lay prostrate at the feet of Pepe Deluxé in the hopes that you won't mind them relentlessly hammering you with tacky quirks and leaving absolutely nothing to the imagination.</p></div>"|16405.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16405-pepe-deluxe-queen-of-the-wave/|5.0|Ian Cohen

<p>If you thought that one-two punch of videos for the lead singles from <i>The OF Tape Vol. 2 </i>was the beginning of the end for the notorious gang of L.A. skate punks, you weren't alone. Never mind that the songs were fine, but for a crew whose visuals were as important to their meteoric rise as their music (if not more), those big-budget videos suggested Tyler and the rest of <a href=""http://oddfuture.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Odd Future</a> had forgotten why they became such a big deal. Both clips try to get over on low-level shock value, but in playing up their propensity to rankle casual onlookers, the group overlooked that they became a sensation first and foremost because of their dynamic and unique chemistry. Their insularity and aura is what draws people to them and that was wiped away by sterile video sets and CGI.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzi24Nssiow"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Oldie"" video</a>: While at a Terry Richardson photo shoot, the entire Wolf Gang stages an impromptu video, reciting their verses from the album's closing track. They interrupt each other, bust each other's balls, play hypeman for each other, and laugh and smile a hell of a lot. Its lo-fi spontaneity is as close as we've gotten to the group's early videos, and it looks like the most fun you could have on any given day. This is no coincidence. The energy and camaraderie that ignites the video is the purest distillation of Odd Future's accidental genius, and after a year-plus of overwrought attempts to continually up the shock level, it's a much-needed breath of fresh air. This is great news, but even better is that <i>The OF Tape Vol. 2 </i>as a whole shares more with the ""Oldie"" video<i> </i><span class=""s1"">than the other two. The tape incorporates all of Odd Future's members with surprising ease (not an easy task considering all the stylistic differences at play) and pieces together the first release in over a year that'll remind people why they liked the group so much in the first place.</span></p>
<p>Part of it is just mathematical. Contributions here are less than any one person would put into a solo album, and though that simple formula doesn't always equal success when it comes to group records, every member here benefits from the arrangement. For guys like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29241-hodgy-beats/"" target=""_blank"">Hodgy</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29181-domo-genesis/"" target=""_blank"">Domo</a>, there's barely any room for filler lines (let alone filler verses), and that helps mask their lesser-developed personas. As for Tyler, well, at the moment, less Tyler is better than more Tyler. His presence still dominates the album, but his charms are more apparent and his abrasiveness is easier to digest than on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15413-goblin/"" target=""_blank""><i>Goblin</i></a>. Those three show up on nearly half of these tracks, and that's crucial to the album's success since any combination of the three works well together. This is often thanks to Hodgy, whose versatility finds him just as comfortable turning up the aggression with Tyler on ""NY (Ned Flander)"" as he is trading verbal workouts with Domo on ""Bitches"" for style points. </p>
<p>But the album is a success mainly because everyone simply steps it up. Domo in particular seems to have evolved from the group's bumbling stoner into a guy who can spit dizzying, complicated verses. Even the peripheral members manage to hit it out of the park when given their turns: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Es7rds2402U"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mike G's ""Forest Green""</a> has been out for close to a year, but its inclusion here is obvious and deserved. Syd has show-stopping turns as a singer at the end of ""Analog 2"" and on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29960-the-internet/"" target=""_blank"">the Internet</a>'s ""Ya Know"", the latter being a more successful take on the sort of lounge-soul that Pharrell used to awkwardly dabble in. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29508-frank-ocean/"" target=""_blank"">Frank Ocean</a> swings by for a few hooks plus ""White"", his lone solo contribution, which will add Stevie Wonder to the list of classic singers he's usually compared to. Even ""We Got Bitches"", Tyler, Jasper, and Taco's second stab at an affectionate Waka parody, is almost good enough to make up for <i>Goblin</i>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/44260-watch-the-video-for-tyler-the-creators-bitch-suck-dick/"" target=""_blank"">""Bitch Suck Dick""</a>.</p>
<p>Which brings us back to ""Oldie"". The 10-minute-plus track closes an album that's probably too long in the first place, and in theory it borders on overkill. But it's a reminder that when you strip away all the noise, there's just a group of rappers here, and pretty good ones at that. Maybe it's also a reminder to Odd Future that their skills can allow them to stand on their own, teen dreams of wild music videos be damned. Oh, and the return of Earl Sweatshirt doesn't hurt either.</p></div>"|16421.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16421-the-of-tape-vol-2/|7.5|Jordan Sargent

Liz Harris and Jesy Fortino are musicians based in the Pacific Northwest who have each spent several records exploring this question. Harris, who records as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6134-grouper/"" target=""_blank"">Grouper</a>, crafts ambient works that range from muted, narcotic guitar pop to more characteristic drone pieces, all haunted by vocals that can be alien or angelic. Fortino, meanwhile, leans toward black-hearted folk in her work as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5420-tiny-vipers/"" target=""_blank"">Tiny Vipers</a>. Using primitively spare guitar lines, she etches full-bodied and evocative works characterized by silence and space, with expressive lyrics that convey feelings of isolation through form more than storytelling. In at least one interview, Fortino referenced the mystic, orchestral minimalism of Arvo Pärt's sacred music, and recently <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/45681-grouper-and-tiny-vipers-talk-mirrorring-collaboration/"" target=""_blank"">in conversation with Pitchfork</a>, she noted her and Harris' shared roots in metal. Fortino almost certainly alluded to the similarly brutal <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4008-swans/"" target=""_blank"">Swans</a> on her 2009 track ""Young God"". These are imaginative parameters, and both artists have been individually responsible for albums that provide consistently therapeutic listening.</p>
<p><i>Foreign Body</i> is the pair's collaborative record as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30259-mirrorring/"" target=""_blank"">Mirrorring</a>, and it effectively and purposefully combines their respective sounds. Tension is the driving force for these six compositions, as each builds from electro-acoustic whispers to landscapes that range from paralyzing paranoia to a glistening sense of subliminal bliss. The recordings feel realized and complete, but never too dense, and while listening I feel placed distinctly between either musician, their sounds tearing from various angles. </p>
<p>Some of these works would make sense on a Grouper or Tiny Vipers record, marked foremost by the aesthetic of the track's leader, but the foil Fortino and Harris offer one another is crucial. The trudging opener <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13209-fell-sound/"" target=""_blank"">""Fell Sound""</a> is reminiscent of Grouper's album <i>Way Their Crept</i> with an eerie and overwhelming sense of drowning in lightness. But Fortino's subtle, suspended guitar work begins to pull from an elevated place, and you never fall too far. The sheer immensity of Grouper's drones on ""Fell Sound"" makes Fortino's following ""Silent From Above"" all the more stark, crushing, and cathartic. It's the record's most tuneful and formally structured song, and an immediate highlight, led by acoustic fingerpicks that sound nearly identical to ""Development"" from her 2009 album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13178-life-on-earth/"" target=""_blank""><i>Life on Earth</i></a>. And ""Drowning the Call"" is a nuanced and idyllic drone-scape centered on the sunlit side of Grouper's aesthetic, but radiating with a new, mood-altering clarity that brings to mind a kind of healing, utopian dream state. </p>
<p>The most affecting tracks on <i>Foreign Body </i>achieve something transcendent, making use of the full range of the duo's instrumental toolbox as well as Fortino's deep warble. At the center is ""Cliffs"", a nearly 10-minute track that begins with slow and artfully minimal guitar notes, reminiscent of a downcast and zoned-out remake of Nick Drake's ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUled-LLzI8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Horn</a>"". Acoustic notes crawl and unfurl in a hypnotic, circular fashion, using broad strokes to foreshadow an undercurrent of anxiousness. Listening, for me, evokes the feeling of climbing a cliff and facing the absolute terror of an ocean, past its mist and dew. The piece eventually towers over into a collage of dissolving weather sounds, with Fortino's earthy guitar tones and Harris' oceanic electronics expanding a pronounced, pastoral picture. It's an experiment in the emotional possibilities of space, and seemingly designed to make you feel very small. </p>
<p class=""p1"">""Mine"" grows to a similar climax, but instead ends with the noisiest and most expansive drone sounds on the record, with skull-mining capabilities that leave a rattling sense of dread. Whether intentional or not, the song's title reminds me that <i>Foreign Body</i>, and indeed the whole of both artists' catalogs, makes the most sense when heard in solitude. I have gravitated toward albums by Harris and Fortino during the most difficult points of my life, and, despite its high-floating potential to incite escapism, I imagine <i>Foreign Body</i> will likewise help bring many a lost listener down to earth.</p>
<p>""Meditative"" is one of a handful of the most common terms pinned to Grouper and Tiny Vipers, but with these tracks it's worth pausing to consider why it is so important to engage with things like repetition and drone. The sound of ""Drowning the Call"", and much of <i>Foreign Body</i>, offers a sense of hyper-presence; of being acutely aware of yourself as the music's recipient, which counters our disengaged, techno-distracted worlds of Elsewhere and offers a moment of mindfulness.</p>
<p>There is a tendency among music critics to create sub-stories with records and impose narratives. We might identify with a hardcore punk group this year because we are a restless generation, or with a work of hyperactive pop because the internet has made us incapable of concentrating, and so on. But sometimes we take a record for what it is: a resistant piece of art, existing as a singular entity. In a world that is newly full of ""content"" at every turn, it can be refreshing to find an uncompromising record that exists so honestly on its own.</p></div>"|16420.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16420-foreign-body/|7.9|Jenn Pelly

On 2010's <i><a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14559-tima-formosa/"">Tima Formosa</a></i>, the instrumentation was unexpected-- particularly O'Rourke's piano-- and the music often got so cloudy and formless it was hard to tell who was playing what. Things became a little clearer when Ambarchi moved to drums and O'Rourke to bass for 2011's <i>In a flash everything comes together as one there is no need for a subject</i>. Still, Haino's array of noise-making tools made it feel more like a ritual ceremony than a musical performance.</p>
<p>Mystery gets blown out the window on <i>Imikuzushi</i>, the third installment of this group's annual live meeting. From the very first second, our heroes' intentions are clear: They came to bang out ear-filling power-trio noise-rock. And they do that with obliterating abandon on an opener whose rambling title, ""still unable to throw off that teaching a heart left abandoned unable to get inside that empty space nerves freezing that unconcealed sadness…"", seems logical compared to its sonic insanity. The track's blood is boiled by Haino's inhuman guitar, which starts in overdrive and gets progressively more violent. At his peaks, he sounds like Jimi Hendrix if he actually played his flaming guitar instead of just waving at it.</p>
<p>It's tempting to say those peaks are the album's high points, since the trio doesn't spend all of <i>Imikuzushi </i>in fifth gear. But even during its most mellow stretches, the music crackles with tension, charged by the possibility that chaos could erupt-- and it often does. That edge-of-oblivion feeling naturally comes from Haino's high-wire acts, but it's also due to Ambarchi and O'Rourke's rhythm work, which is both weighty and nimble. The pair alternates between depth-charge beats and clicking, jazzy clips, along the way conjuring metal, psych, and sky-shooting stoner rock.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, they also evoke the bluesy blasts of Haino's legendary avant-rock outfit <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/16240-fushitsusha/"" target=""_blank"">Fushitsusha</a>. But there's something different about this trio's approach to sonic obliteration. Even when everything's clanging and exploding, and Haino's voice is dive-bombing through all the clamor, the band never sounds rushed or at risk of tripping over itself. Perhaps this move to noise-rock actually calmed their nerves and loosened their musical muscles. Whatever the explanation, <i>Imikuzushi </i>feels like the work of artists looking down from a mountain rather than laboring to climb it.</p>
<p>That vision reaches furthest on track three, which has another sprawling title: ""invited in practically drawn in by something facing the exit of this hiding place who is it? that went in…"" Here, many sonic parts fit together magically, like levers and pulleys in a Rube Goldberg machine. There's O'Rourke's swaying, two-note bassline as things pick up steam; Ambarchi's monstrous fills when Haino's guitar detonates; and Haino's chilling chants over O'Rourke's rumbling fuzz. The excitement feels endless, but knowing how restless these three can be, this might be the last time they work in this ecstatic mode. Luckily, <i>Imikuzushi</i> captures that moment in a way that sounds timeless.</p></div>"|16417.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16417-imikuzushi/|8.2|Marc Masters

But even after you've traced out the many roots of the New York <a href=""http://bandcamp.com/tag/nervous-soul?artist=3144585128"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""nervous soul""</a> septet's gnarly genre-bending, you'll find there's simply no telling where they'll take it from one minute to the next. With his band restlessly undulating around him, Ava Luna frontman Carlos Hernandez coos about calculus, coming off a little like The Soulman Who Fell to Earth. Still sounds like a bit of a mess, doesn't it? Sure is; and a glorious one at that.</p>
<p>Hernandez, son of a soul DJ with a background in noise-punk (among other things, he produced the Stateside version of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5160-fucked-up/"" target=""_blank"">Fucked Up</a>'s ""Year of the Pig"" 7""), belongs to the post-Prince school of falsetto-forward vocalists. Which is not to say he's a particularly studious singer; as much as or more than the man from Minneapolis himself, I'm reminded of the clear-eyed, chameleonic croon of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4777-multiply/"" target=""_blank""><i>Multiply</i>-era Jamie Lidell</a>, particularly when, like Lidell, Hernandez's love for the music comes across closer to full-absorption rather than simple idolatry. He's got quite a foil in Becca Kauffman, who takes a couple of striking Aaliyah-inspired solo turns here; with both Babygirl's all-knowing tone and her incredible reserve, she slips neatly into these clattering beats, where Hernandez wobbles around them. Kauffman, Felicia Douglass, and Anna Sian can often be found joined in zig-zagging, out-from-nowhere harmony, more than a little reminiscent of the vocal derring-do Angel Deradoorian and Amber Coffman brought to the Dirty Projectors' still-spectacular <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10577-rise-above/"" target=""_blank""><i>Rise Above</i></a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13159-bitte-orca/"" target=""_blank""><i>Bitte Orca</i></a>. But with so much going on in, under, and around them, Ava Luna never allow themselves the time to fix on any one element; not only do they they sound like a lot of things, they manage to sound like most of them all at once, an impressively deft balancing act atop an ever-shifting platform.</p>
<p>Beneath the vocals, <i>Ice Level</i>'s fidgety future-funk seems forever on the verge of flying off the rails, accruing-- then discarding-- an endless stream of whirrs and gurgles. <i>Ice Level</i>'s made up of little moments, its unapologetically wriggly, cacophonous caterwaul providing one tiny thrill after another. With all that racket swooping in from all angles, the initial impression is that of utter chaos, one some listeners may never be able to quite settle into. But cock your ear to <i>Ice Level</i> a few times, and it begins to develop its own sort of machine logic, all these bursts of noise propping up Hernandez and co.'s abstracted come-ons and spaced-out soul-searching. Locating the songs themselves amidst these impossible shapes isn't always the easiest, but Ava Luna manage to wrangle the careening elements into a series of sweet spots well-suited to their attention-deficient dalliances with dance music, past and future. Note the ease with which ""Ice Level"" glides from late-1990s pop radio to sweltering strings of Isaac Hayes, or the way the skittish Destiny's Child nod ""Wrenning Day"" always seems a second away from spinning itself out. Songs bend, dip, double-back; that ""whoa, what <i>was</i> that?"" feeling you'll get listening to <i>Ice Level</i>? It persists, no matter how much time you've spent puzzling it all out.</p>
<p>Restlessness aside, I suspect most folks'll find their trouble with Ava Luna is located in the back of Hernandez's throat. Though his love for R&amp;B's slippery side is readily apparent from the first time he opens his mouth, there are moments when he bends so far into a note, it comes off as slightly parodic, a little closer to Beck's winking Prince homage ""Debra"" than the man himself. These moments are fleeting, though, and they're smartly counterbalanced by the liquid-cool trio of Douglass, Kauffman, and Sian. And, with so much else going on, it's a feeling that, like almost everything else about <i>Ice Level</i>, seems fleeting. <i>Ice Level</i>'s willingness to take so much on at once can be more than a bit discombobulating-- you throw this much at the wall, not all of it's going to stick-- but there's a real sense that if they could settle things down just a touch, there'd be a little more for the listener to grab onto from one spin to the next. But, while <i>Ice Level</i>'s an awful lot to process, it's the finest sort of overload; listen closely enough, and you can almost hear your circuits being rewired.</p></div>"|16419.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16419-ice-level/|7.3|Paul Thompson

On the follow-up to 2009's sleeper hit <i>Reservoir, </i><a href=""http://www.fanfarlo.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Fanfarlo</a> bring forth songs that are capably performed, professionally produced, and have the kind of perky melodies and implied optimism that would suggest the London quintet get along really well with each other. I'd have no reason to dissuade you from <i>Rooms Filled With Light</i> if time and money weren't limited resources in determining whether a record was worth a listen<i>. </i>Which is sort of the problem: None of this can counter that <i>Rooms Filled With Light </i>most often feels ""good"" only because it's ""not bad,"" existing at the center of a galaxy of bands used as exemplars of ""boring indie,"" but only serving as a mirror that reveals their idiosyncracies, where Fanfarlo simply have good intentions and risk aversion.</p>
<p>Strange then, since Fanfarlo seem to aspire to darker and difficult territory than <i>Reservoir, </i>a record whose success ultimately felt like the result of new Arcade Fire and Beirut albums' being only theoretical at that time. They trade po-faced folkiness for influences of distinguished new wave haircuts and the production touch of Ben Allen, who of course helmed <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12518-merriweather-post-pavilion/"" target=""_blank"">Merriweather Post Pavilion</a> </i>and <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14681-halcyon-digest/"" target=""_blank"">Halcyon Digest</a></i>, but more relevantly, a shockingly vital album from former UK bantamweights Bombay Bicycle Club. Though minor cosmetic changes, they result in <i>Rooms Filled With Light</i>'s playing out as the sonic equivalent of deciding to major in Economics, mildly ambitious, but ultimately pragmatic about having a set path to success. This strategy pays off in the subtly ingratiating first half: ""Deconstruction"" is ""angular"" done by squares, its new romantic pulse and wobbly surf guitar chords never shaking it too far from its sweet, <i>Neon Bible-</i>lite center. Likewise, Fanfarlo usually like to ease into their hooks, so the hearty chorus of ""Lenslife"" is a genuine surprise in its urge to stand up and be counted while ""Tunguska"" ekes into Dexys territory with its woozy saxophone arrangements and spirited harmonies.</p>
<p>But as <i>Room Filled With Lights </i>crosses a <i>Peanuts</i>-styled piano interlude (""Everything Turns"") into a Side B of songs as familiar and interchangeable as their titles (""Feathers"", ""Bones"", ""Dig""), you just come away thinking that the demand for fussy orchestral indie of this type is constant, whereas Fanfarlo are simply supply. From where does the love of Fanfarlo spring when <i>Rooms Filled With Light </i>never shoots for the power of populism nor something wholly individual? The cracked-whip cadence Simon Balthazar employs over the staccato violins on ""Replicate"" and ""Tightrope"" is too similar to Win Butler to not be a distraction, especially since he can't commit to sounding truly unhinged or making bold declarations rather than pat musings (""We have a better chance on paper/ So we catalog our lives""). So when Balthazar pleas to ""break it up into pieces/ Throw away what we don't understand"" on ""Deconstruction"", the conservatism of the latter half rings more true despite a propulsive, downstroked bassline. Meanwhile on ""Feathers"", Balthazar repeats, ""It is the same/ And the river is the siren/ And the rock before the time you washed up feeling nothing at all,"" enough to suggest he meant it as a singalong, but it fails to generate urgency. That, and the song piggybacks the same exact melody as Neon Indian's decidedly roustabout ""Terminally Chill"".</p>
<p>Look, I know this kind of stuff is easy to dismiss as lame prima facie, especially if you can't possibly imagine perfectly reasonable listeners who don't need to go to SXSW to have confidence in their opinion that a dude tapping at a sampler while standing perfectly still is bullshit most of the time. And I agree with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/45801-sxsw-lower-dens/"">Larry Fitzmaurice's assessment from the festival</a> that it's important to have music you ""like"" rather than the false binary of ""this rules"" and ""this sucks."" But it seems to me that you seek out music you love, whereas likable music simply finds you. And so <i>Rooms Filled With Light</i> is friendly and nondescript, but so are the vast majority of the people you unconsciously encounter on a daily basis-- <i>Rooms Filled With Lights </i>is Jenny from a couple of cubicles over who wears cool shoes and watches ""30 Rock"", it's the guy who always nods hello when taking the treadmill next to you on Thursdays, it's the waiter at your local coffee spot who doesn't conduct himself like he'd rather be anywhere else on earth. Do they make things more pleasant? Sure, and I wouldn't rush to turn off the radio if ""Deconstruction"" came up either. But would you voluntarily spend 45 minutes with these people? Why haven't you?</p></div>"|16407.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16407-fanfarlo-rooms-filled-with-light/|6.0|Ian Cohen

As impressive and influential as Sonic Youth have been during the last three decades, their married leaders have become icons of a sort, a manifestation of domestic bliss that inspired creativity, not complacence. Of course, some Sonic Youth adherents took the news poorly, interpreting it as a sign that no relationship is sacred, that no artistic bond is strong enough to stand the pressures of a lifetime.</p>
<p>But in spite of the chatter about Gordon, Moore and, concomitantly, the future of their quartet, there's another 2012 Sonic Youth story worth attention: This week, co-founder <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2057-lee-ranaldo/"" target=""_blank"">Lee Ranaldo</a> released <i>Between the Times and the Tides</i>, a 10-song set that grew from a batch of acoustic ideas into a full-band production featuring <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4596-wilco/"" target=""_blank"">Wilco</a>'s Nels Cline, Sonic Youth's Steve Shelley, jazz-and-jam organist John Medeski, guitarist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2474-alan-licht/"" target=""_blank"">Alan Licht</a>, and former bandmate <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3176-jim-orourke/"" target=""_blank"">Jim O'Rourke</a>. It represents a chance for Ranaldo to nab a headline without having to talk about Gordon and Moore's Facebook relationship status.</p>
<p>This isn't Ranaldo’s first solo album. Apart from a busy Sonic Youth schedule, the guitarist's been releasing quiet bits of acoustic music and field recordings or bursts of noise since the late 1980s. He's an active collaborator, too, having worked with an expansive roster that, only to sample, includes harpist<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6838-zeena-parkins/"" target=""_blank""> Zeena Parkins</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4469-the-velvet-underground/"" target=""_blank"">Velvet Underground</a> drummer Maureen Tucker, and the singer-songwriter <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4664-wooden-wand/"" target=""_blank"">Wooden Wand</a>. Still, despite a propensity for abrasion and his instantly identifiable winding guitar patterns, Ranaldo has long seemed the ""quiet"" member of Sonic Youth, often misplaced alongside the band's ostensible power couple. Sure, he's long been Sonic Youth's minority songwriter (between 2000 and 2006, he led only one song per album), but many of Ranaldo's tunes are essential catalogue pieces-- the long-may-you-roar <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIOdjR2O3xg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Karen Revisited""</a>, the ripping <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uONhjgIGjU&amp;feature=related"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Eric's Trip""</a>, the gently major-label<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEdHX-l0lM0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> ""Wish Fulfillment""</a>, the manically lucid <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19aefKYIYXA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Skip Tracer""</a>. But he often remains an afterthought, answering interview questions <a href=""http://exclaim.ca/Interviews/WebExclusive/lee_ranaldo_2"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">about Moore and Gordon</a> despite releasing the biggest record of his solo career.</p>
<p><i>Between the </i><i>Times and the Tides</i> likely won’t help: A motley assortment of Sonic Youth nods, acoustic entreaties, and cloying pop-rockers, Ranaldo's opportunity to step out of the Sonic Youth shadows and into his own proper spotlight is mostly a miss made of mediocrity. Though Ranaldo has helped guide his other band through one of music's great unpredictable repertoires, this outfit sounds both predictable and awkward. Opener ""Waiting on a Dream"" waves the Sonic Youth bait for the old adherents with spiraling melodies and saturated sonics, Medeski's organ taking the place of Moore's guitar grate. ""Angles"" simply cranks the college-rock quotient, with heavy-handed harmonies stacked behind each chorus. ""Shouts"" dates its makers with spoken-word samples underneath a web of guitar and kick-drum, while ""Hammer Blows"" turns the obvious trick of building a foreboding electric din beneath a pretty, finger-picked lament. With the help of Cline, the six-minute, two-section ""Fire Island (Phases)"" takes all the turns Wilco might make to get from the Krautrock march ""Spiders"" to the fluttering pop number ""Impossible Germany"". And depending on your perspective, Ranaldo's lyrics are either symptomatic or responsible for the album's banality. A published poet with an interest in abstract structures, he writes as if thumbing through a rhyming dictionary or composing a children's album alongside <a href=""http://pbskids.org/rogers/songs/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mr. Rogers</a>. ""Was it something I said…/ Was I wrong in the head?"" he sings at one point. Or, more telling and laughable: ""I don't wanna throw a wrench in the works/ But this whole town is full of jerks.""</p>
<p>This isn't to say that <i>Between</i> is without its moments. Ranaldo, after all, is an accomplished and inventive player, surrounded by a score of them here. There's the dramatic push between Medeski's organ, Cline's guitar and Shelley's drumming during the last half of ""Xtina As I Knew Her"" and the spectral air beneath the starry-eyed love number ""Stranded"". Swiveling, urgent guitar harmonies open and later incite ""Lost"", while closer ""Tomorrow Never Comes"" takes shape around a drum machine before climbing into one of the most inspired instrumental breaks of these 48 minutes. But every interesting piece comes countered by multiple banal solos, clumsy transitions, or altogether unfortunate looks. The band treats ""Stranded"" with surprising subtlety and grace, and Ranaldo's voice conveys the perfect amount of vulnerability for such a lovesick tune. As soon as he rhymes works with jerks and phone with home, however, the song turns too silly to be taken seriously. At least ""Off the Wall"" has the energy and concision to break Ranaldo to a new audience-- alas, an audience he'll find via <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcHB060NKYo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Toad the Wet Sprocket</a>'s Pandora station.</p>
<p>It's hard not to pull for Lee Ranaldo, a songwriter, arranger and improviser who's never gotten the due he's deserved as a critical component of a near-compulsory band. But if <i>Between the Times and the Tides</i> reveals anything important, it's that Ranaldo's songs require the right kind of foils. Here, he's backed by old friends with distinct and familiar styles of their own, not folks who systematically push and pull his good songs until they become great. This is an album badly in need of editing and, above all, a little friction, resistance and rebuilding. I hear there's some acrimony within Sonic Youth lately; maybe they could have helped?</p></div>"|16413.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16413-between-the-times-and-the-tides/|5.2|Grayson Currin

His impact on rap is already such that if he disappeared tomorrow, he would linger in the cultural bloodstream. But somehow, he endures: He's like Swee'Pea from a <i>Popeye</i> cartoon, crawling over gnashing gears while we clutch our heads and watch. <i>God</i>'<i>s Father</i>, which came out last week, is the latest proof that he hasn't finished telling us his peculiar story, and that somehow, even after untold terabytes of #based music, he's still finding out new ways to tell it.</p>
<p>The first thing you'll notice after porting <i>God</i>'<i>s Father</i> into your iTunes is that<i></i> it's long. Ludicrously so, in a way that defies any sense of what an ""album"" is, or how one plays. It is a face-whitening amount of Lil B to contend with in a single sitting; at 34 tracks, it demands several sessions to even take in. (It took me three days, in 10- to 12-song chunks.) It doesn't feel ""sequenced"" in any noticeable way. Like Lil B, it just keeps going. Also as with Lil B, I have only the fuzziest idea how it sprang into existence. After years of listening to his music, I still have zero sense of how his creative decisions are made, or not made: Does he take time recording his punched-in overdubs? Does he know the order of any of his tracklists? Has he ever done a second take in his life?</p>
<p>With the atrocious stuff, of course, the added mystery is: ""Did he even <i>listen</i> to this? And good lord, why am I?"" The good news, with <i>God</i>'<i>s Father</i>, is that even at its ridiculous length, I never found myself asking this question. It's probably his most immersive single release-- or album, or mixtape, or emanation, or whatever-- in a year and a half, better than <i>both</i> <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16082-lil-b-based-god-vellisilent-president/"" target=""_blank"">BasedGod Velli</a></i> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15641-im-gay-im-happy/"" target=""_blank""><i>I'</i><i>m Gay</i></a>. Lil B's consistency relies as much on monkeys-and-typewriters statistics as it does on luck, timing, and inspiration. With <i>God</i>'<i>s Father</i>, the breezes are blowing favorably.</p>
<p>He has always found ear-catching beats from unlikely corners, and over the course of <i>God</i>'<i>s Father</i>, he raps over whole crates of dollar-store vinyl: We get pan flutes, strings, and choirs; electro funk, 1980s R&amp;B, and Yanni pianos; gospel soul, new age synthesizers, doctor's-office jazz fusion. Individual moments stick out: ""Flowers Rise"" is one of his prettiest beats in ages, a wisp of synth twirling miles in empty space above an ominous pool of warped noises. ""SF Mission Music"" rolls out the sepia-tinted Pete Rock piano chords. ""Flash"" is a skewed take on rap's Lex Luger obsession, trademark synth sweep, ticking hi-hats and all. Over the course of the album, it runs together into one gently mind-expanding blob. This isn't a rap mixtape; it's an amniotic tank.</p>
<p>As for his rapping, those who insist he's a ""bad rapper"" certainly don't lack evidence. I could pluck 11 or 12 mortifying lines from this tape alone to argue their case for them. But that would miss a larger point about Lil B's music: its use, its proper context. His lyrics rarely accomplish what traditional rap lyrics do, but you can learn a lot about how good rapping works, it turns out, from listening to Lil B, in a way that you cannot from listening to more traditional rappers.</p>
<p>Listening to him work out what kind of beat he's rapping on, for example, what kind of mood it suggests and how he can add to it, is fascinating. ""Normal"" rappers do this all the time, commenting on the vibe of the track as it rolls out (""this shit feel like a movie!"" ""this that 1970s heroin flow"") getting themselves, and you, in the proper mind frame. But Lil B is especially good at it; in fact, sometimes listening to Lil B do this is the whole song. Menacing minor key pianos on ""Breath Slow""? ""Ahhhh let me out this motherfucking caaaaage!,"" he screams. A refracted prism of synth streaming in on ""I Ain't Neva Won""? ""You see that light up there? Oh yeah, that's just so beautiful."" It's a bit like watching a group of little kids dance to music they're hearing for the first time: Is this dark music? Should I make my scary face?</p>
<p>Hearing him drop a line of thought and pivot abruptly into new territory a beat or two later is also absorbingly odd: ""Even Eminem known Lil B crazy/ I wanna see how you... [pause] <i>situations</i>/ Duct tape ya click, ain't no way for escapin,"" he says on ""God's Father"". He leaves gaps, presumably to be punched in later, in the otherwise fairly dense rhyme pattern of ""Buss Em 4 Points""'s second verse. This is how raps generally come together before the microphone is turned on, or while the song is being hashed out before entering the studio, but it is not the way rap listeners are accustomed to engaging with it. If you like thinking about language as unfinished stuff, Lil B's music will play upon rarely visited parts of your listening brain.</p>
<p>It doesn't hurt that he has a genuine way with words, a knack for memorable phrasing. ""Man you gotta fuck a mother, and it's real still...,"" he says on ""Be a Star"". Talk about an unfinished thought! ""I don't eat that pussy, man, on the dancefloor, man,"" he says on ""Go Dumb Tonight"". Sounds reasonable. On ""Flowers Rise"" he offers what might be the most hilariously #based lyric of his career: ""I'm so lonely on this pony riding over the sunlight."" Pick any stretch of <i>God</i>'<i>s Father</i>, and you will be mowed over with quotable phrases. It's like being showered with fortune cookies.</p>
<p>""Man, I just got some deep-ass thoughts,"" he says, on the aptly titled ""Deep Ass Thoughts"". The irony is that he doesn't, or if he does, he declines to share them. But he recreates the <i>feeling</i> of having deep-ass thoughts-- dazed wonder, disorientation-- and then encourages you to have your own. It's the same sort of service he provides on a song called ""Real Hip Hop 2012"", which is a reference to East Coast hip-hop more than an East Coast hip-hop song. It's an odd, abstracted sort of music, and it will never be for everybody. But Lil B knows who his music is for: ""This for everybody that/ They think so hard, man they thoughts be so deep/ And don't nobody believe 'em/ But I believe you.""</p></div>"|16414.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16414-lil-b-gods-father/|8.0|Jayson Greene

Typically, this would be a fairly strange fixation, considering the extent to which the likes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5471-bon-iver/"" target=""_blank"">Bon Iver</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27763-jj/"" target=""_blank"">jj</a> have already made Auto-Tune plenty safe in the indie rock landscape. However, Leaneagh happens to have been lead singer for the late Twin Cities roots-pop outfit Roma di Luna, where the entrancing purity of her smoky pipes was very much front-and-center. With that in mind, it's understandable fans of that band's earnest, organic sound would be bemoaning Leaneagh's acceptance of such technological mediation.</p>
<p>Leaneagh herself, however, seems to be savvier, <a href=""http://austin.culturemap.com/newsdetail/03-10-12-16-03-channy-casselle-of-gayngs-polica-sxsw/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">explaining</a> in an interview with CultureMap Austin during this year's SXSW that, ""From my perspective, I am trying to meld into the three other band members and the music we're making and create a force between us that is cohesive and captivating."" As part of Poliça, Leaneagh not only isn't the unvarnished centerpiece of the group's music, she's arguably its least dynamic performer. Which isn't to suggest she's not important-- quite the contrary, Leaneagh is surprisingly the constant around which Poliça's compellingly changeable music flows. Roma di Luna may have posited her as a relatively straightforward chanteuse, but her role within Poliça calls to mind far more interesting descriptions, like ""Fiona Apple fronting TV on the Radio"" or ""A heavily digitized Norah Jones atop Radiohead at its most polyrhythmic.""</p>
<p>Because while Leaneagh is evenly intoning her vocals, rendered all the more coolly hypnotic by being constantly double-tracked and looped in on themselves, the unorthodox band behind her (keyboards, bass, and, awesomely, two drummers) never seems to stay in one place. Throughout the group's debut effort, <i>Give You the Ghost</i> (produced by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28643-gayngs/"" target=""_blank"">Gayngs</a> mastermind Ryan Olson), the rhythm section in particular is afforded a fluidity and freedom typically only witnessed in jazz or funk spheres, the bulbous basslines and restless drums following their own whims rather than the dictates of pop-rock convention. The entire album adheres to this formula, making it an exceedingly seamless listen, though there are standouts-- ""Violent Games"" is propelled by especially mad percussion, the catchy ""Dark Star"" really does sound exactly like Apple returning to <i>Cookie Mountain</i>, and ""Lay Your Cards Out"" approaches trip-hop levels of exquisite dankness.</p>
<p>My only real complaint is that the physicality of the bass and drums could have been emphasized to an even greater degree-- while your ear is constantly drawn to the rhythm section's permutations, Leaneagh's voice sits perhaps a bit too prominently in the mix, and the exhilarating wildness of the drumming is often suggested rather than truly felt. Judging from her description of Poliça's music as a democratic blend of compelling moving parts, however, it's likely Leaneagh wouldn't mind a little further encroachment, not when the inaugural results are already so exciting.</p></div>"|16410.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16410-give-you-the-ghost/|7.6|Josh Love

A few years ago he was a waiter at my favorite Atlanta bar, a cavernous place with a beer list the size of a small-town phonebook. I scrawled out an uncountable number of debit-card-receipt tips to Server Name: <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/gentlemanjesse"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Gentleman Jesse</a> before realizing he played guitar in the Carbonas, one of the nastier local power-punk bands, and that he had his own act. In 2008, when <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12256-gentleman-jesse-his-men/"" target=""_blank"">his first record</a> came out, it suddenly required an embarrassing amount of effort to not reply to his waiterly banter with his own song lyrics. Like the time he brought me a drink but not the one I'd ordered-- it was a rare flub and I was just trying to roll with it, but he was contrite, offering to trade it out. ""No, it's cool,"" I said, taking an overlarge first gulp just to keep myself from adding, ""You Don't Have To (If You Don't Want To)"".</p>
<p>That song-- one of the best from that first album,<i> Gentleman Jesse &amp; His Men</i>, which was almost all bests-- highlights some of Smith's main tendencies as a lyricist. He favors longish song titles, often involving some sort of sly parenthetical and almost always derived from the chorus, which in turn is usually built around some kind of ordinary phrase-- not an out-and-out cliché, exactly, but something you'd say, something you've heard before. He's like a garage-rock William Eggleston, shining a flickering backroom bulb on the most mundane feelings (regret, inertia, annoyance, wanting-to-have-sex), rendering them, if not particularly fresh or transcendent, then at least really really fun to have. You can sing along to his hooks. You can sing along to his words, too, but it's the hooks that'll glom on and hang around for days.</p>
<p>On the new record, <i>Leaving Atlanta</i>, Gentleman Jesse has dropped His Men, but in name only. It's almost impossible, actually, to imagine this guy as a solo act; so much depends upon the barrage-- the guitars chasing each other around like kids in a dirty parking lot, the teetering organ and, here, even harmonica provided by third-wave garage-rock O.G. King Louie Bankston on the frantic opener ""Eat Me Alive"". The band's debut was kind of a crumpled, nicotine-smudged affair, but <i>Atlanta</i> feels brighter, less muddled, not polished but certainly tidier around the edges. Smith's voice remains a friendly, mid-range yawp-- emotionally precise if not always entirely on-key. ""Careful What You Wish For"", with its sparkly-clean guitar riff, spunky little drums and backing harmonies occasionally cresting into ""aahh's,"" sounds enough like a lost <i>Help!</i> track to warrant an earnest Beatles comparison in the year 2012 (though a more appropriate corollary may be that occasionally-- and, one assumes, inadvertently-- Gentleman Jesse seems most explicable as a boozier, hornier, later-model version of the Oneders, that band of skinny-tied goofballs from the Tom Hanks movie <i>That Thing You Do!</i>).</p>
<p>Recorded three years ago in Smith's basement, <i>Atlanta</i>'s accompanying press release hints at some reasons for the delayed release; for one, dude was apparently clobbered across the face with a table leg while trying to help some guys change a car tire, which understandably dampened his enthusiasm for music and the city and life in general for a while. Then five friends died in weirdly quick succession, most way too young. The album is dedicated to them, their names in small print in the liner notes; on the flip side of the CD insert, there's a black-and-white photo collage of Smith and the band playing shows, lipping cigarettes, spraying champagne. The cheery vibe is battle armor, a shield raised against the unknown darkness. Each track plows straight ahead into itself-- head down, guard up-- like a good-natured drunk mainlining tallboys to flush out the pain.</p>
<p>Smith can't even seem to catch a break romance-wise: he's swaddled in self-loathing and indecision, ""I'm Only Lonely (When I'm Around You)"" and ""I'm a Mess (Without You)"" bookending his misery. But the sadsack-lover look seems a bit too easy. It's a fun exercise, and maybe even the intended approach, to take every song here that seems to be about woman troubles and imagine Smith is singing instead about his hometown, about everything he's done here and everything it's done for-- and to-- him: ""Take it easy on me, my pretty baby/ Don't be cruel, that's not the way that I treat you."" (This may be the only way to make palatable ""Kind of Uptight"", otherwise basically the song equivalent of a ""C'mon, gimme a smile, baby!"" catcall.)</p>
<p>On the cover of <i>Leaving Atlanta</i>, Smith and his Rickenbacker pose, along with a couple of suitcases and a rifle and what appears to be a golden bust of Elvis Presley, by the big wooden ""Leaving Atlanta"" sign that gives the record its name. Locals will know exactly where he's standing: just barely northeast of Little Five Points, facing west, the mess of Ponce de Leon Avenue zooming past him on his right. The sign marks one of the eastern edges of Atlanta proper and maybe it once signaled you were truly on your way out of town, but if you live here you know this, too: that the city doesn't really end there, or anywhere-- that it just keeps going, unfolding into deeper and deeper pockets of neighborhoods, then out into suburbs, then the suburbs of the suburbs. Atlanta is a city where you can spend more time leaving than actually staying. But, like Smith sings, ""It's as good a place as any to try and survive.""</p></div>"|16409.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16409-gentleman-jesse-leaving-atlanta/|7.9|Rachael Maddux

Boxcutter offered a variant, but mostly undistinguished take on techno and bass music that nonetheless found fans in labels like Hotflush and Planet Mu (who released four Boxcutter albums and another under Lynn's own name). The Host's signing was announced by Planet Mu label owner Mike Paradinas, somewhat mysteriously, in January. Perhaps the name change-- its relative anonymity and slight sci-fi overtones-- will do Lynn some good. On <i>The Host</i> he abandons beat-driven aggression for short, wafting pieces, visiting upon trends in electronic dance music before drilling down to something more personal and psychedelic.</p>
<p>It's clear that Lynn has online activity on the brain. The first three tracks here are named, in order, ""Neo-Geocities"", ""Angel Fire"", and ""Internet Archaeology"" (later on: ""Org"", ""Second Life"", ""3am Surfing""), enough ammo to suggest that the <i>The Host</i> is less Orwell and more Go Daddy. Certainly the album's structure of 12 tracks in just over 42 minutes suggests impermanence and distraction, even if its creation-- <i>The Host</i> was composed on vintage, analog synth gear-- was built of sturdier stuff. Lynn isn't interested in nostalgia, though, and much of <i>The Host</i>'s first half trades in the type of skittering, sun-stroked maximalism popularized by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22484-rustie/"" target=""_blank"">Rustie</a> et al. Lynn avoids a major pratfall of synth-tinkerers by not punching us in the face with his masterfully programmed arpeggios.</p>
<p>The second half is arguably more interesting, as Lynn indulges himself as a guitarist and bassist, steering toward the swampy, electro-acoustic climes of German masters like Ash Ra Tempel and Popul Vuh. <i>The Host</i>'s longest-by-some-margin track at seven-and-a-half minutes, ""Rainy Sequences/Phosphene Patterns"", is reverb-sopped psychedelia, an oil puddle of decaying tones and jammy guitars. This is a beguiling mix of instrumentation, and <i>The Host</i> is slippery and elusive even at its most drawn-out and patient. Combining these muses-- ""Summer Solstice at Cape Canaveral"" mashes those Kraut-y guitar excursions and a sore-thumb bass into beefy drum machines-- proves more troublesome, like the odds-and-sods drawer in your desk that loses its potency when organized. These net-centric references, synth sculptures, and snake-y guitars are best taken as a jumble.</p>
<p>There's no narrative to <i>The Host</i>. It's a series of vignettes and at its best it reminds me of amorphous copy/paste artists like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3384-prefuse-73/"" target=""_blank"">Prefuse 73</a>, musicians who wormed their way into a genre by nibbling at its edges. It suits Lynn, whose work to-date as Boxcutter fits bass music's move from heavier, more percussive sounds to linear house and techno too neatly. That there is less to grasp here may be the point entirely.</p></div>"|16412.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16412-the-host/|6.4|Andrew Gaerig

It has the overwhelming grandeur of something viewed from above-- perhaps from the top of a tall tree or an airplane or very possibly, if you're into that sort of thing, heaven-- but also the painstaking, labyrinthine detail of a map. His first solo EP, <i>Silent Hour/Golden Mile</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">, is a brief but majestic song cycle full of fingerpicked notes that babble like tributaries, echoing piano chords that cut through silence like rocks rippling the surface of a pond, and in a few cases, explosive mountains of sound that jut up out of nowhere. It occasionally sounds like George Harrison or Harry Nilsson or even, in fleeting and not unwelcome moments, the Eagles, but it also sounds personal, like one person's recollections of the music he grew up with knocked slightly askew by memory's jostling. So yes, a map, but if you had to draw it, it would end up looking like one of those on the inside cover of a fantasy novel or maybe an old edition of </span><i>Robinson Crusoe</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">: a detailed rendering of an imagined, serenely unpeopled place.</span></p>
<p>Rossen is one-fourth of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1843-grizzly-bear/"" target=""_blank"">Grizzly Bear</a> and one-half of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26510-department-of-eagles/"" target=""_blank"">Department of Eagles</a>. ""A lot of this music comes from exiling myself,"" he said <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/news/45680-daniel-rossen-talks-new-ep-grizzly-bear-department-of-eagles/"">in a recent interview</a>, and considering the year he had in 2009, it's understandable why the guy would need to get away from it all. After the success of Grizzly Bear's acclaimed record <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13078-veckatimest/"" target=""_blank"">Veckatimest</a></i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">, a group that began with humble aspirations suddenly found itself catapulted onto Billboard's Top 10 and magazine covers, and vexed by sensationalist reports of intra-band conflict. The guys could weather it (they're recording </span><i>Veckatimest</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">'s follow-up as we speak), but in the meantime writing and recording </span><i>Silent Hour/Golden Mile</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> was Rossen's way of keeping his fingers busy and his mind at ease during the band's downtime. It seems to have worked. ""Up On High"", the opener, has the bright feel of someone pushing off from the world to find the clarity that has eluded him. ""In this big empty room,"" he exhales over a gently crescendoing chord progression, ""Finally feel free.""</span></p>
<p>Expansive yet graceful in its moments of restraint, <i>Silent Hour/Golden Mile</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> shows off Rossen's skill as an arranger. Tracks like ""Golden Mile"" (on which he's joined by Dr. Dog drummer Eric Slick) and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13084-silent-song/"" target=""_blank"">""Silent Song""</a> (which is streaked with the signal-flare wails of Scott Hirsch's lap steel) feel full and lush but never cluttered; the emotion of the songs is free to bob unobstructed to the surface. ""I'll dig until I bleed/ Drink until I rot,"" he hollers soulfully on ""Silent Song"", before appealing for salvation, ""Lord, I know it's wrong/ So help me out."" Drowning out his pleas, ""Silent Song"" builds to an instrumental bridge that finds Rossen doing Rossen: imbuing architectural grandeur with gentle naturalism. ""Silent Song"" towers, but even in its boldest moments it trembles and rustles precariously, as if a breeze much stronger than the one blowing through could topple the whole thing.</span></p>
<p>Rossen's guitar playing has unmistakable personality. You could probably count on one hand the number of indie rock guitarists you can say this about right now, but a lot of listeners will recognize these as Daniel Rossen songs before he even opens his mouth. The style that you can hear Rossen developing from the earliest Department of Eagles recordings up through <i>Veckitmest</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> is a distinct, improbably fluid blend of folk, jazz, rock, and even the occasional jolt of punk attitude (one of his finest moments with Grizzly Bear, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11183-while-you-wait-for-the-others/"" target=""_blank"">""While You Wait for the Others""</a>, hinges upon his subtly sneering distortion). And here, he busts out some of his most impressive tricks. Positioned at what feels like the exact geodetic north of the song cycle, ""Return to Form""'s summit recalls </span><i>Veckatimest </i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">opener ""Southern Point"" as it explodes into a jazzy, Beatles-esque cascade of notes that glimmer with the naturalistic sorcery of the northern lights. As with Grizzly Bear, Rossen's lyrics rarely approach the poeticism of his guitar playing, but he's able to suggest more with his unique tones and phrasing than most singers can. When words fail, Rossen's jazz hands <i>shred</i>.</span></p>
<p>Though <i>Veckati</i>-mania was replete with plenty of overzealous YouTube commenters proclaiming Brooklyn's fab four to be better than the Beatles, it doesn't feel too hyperbolic to say that Rossen is gradually, quietly earning his George Harrison stripes. Though there's nary a ""Hare Krishna"" in sight, <i>Silent Hour/Golden Mile</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> still has the candid honesty of a person grappling with faith and trying to reconcile his place in the universe. The terrific closing track, ""Golden Mile"", is the closest he's yet mustered to an ""All Things Must Pass"", and though he doesn't quite stumble upon lasting enlightenment, momentary peace will do. Rossen brings to this EP the meticulous craftsmanship we've come to expect from his work</span><span style=""font-style: normal;"">, but in </span><i>Silent Hour</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> he's created something rare: a rendering of isolation that feels sincere but never maudlin. Returning from the solitary hike of ""Golden Mile"", he concludes with an observation that will still ring true in a busier world: ""There is bliss in this mess.""</span></p></div>"|16394.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16394-daniel-rossen-silent-hourgolden-mile-ep/|8.0|Lindsay Zoladz

As popular as the band is, it's probably safe to say most of the attention's directed toward lead singer Dan Whitford or collaborator Tim Goldsworthy. Their bassist, <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/bbalone"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ben Browning</a>, evidently has something to say, though, and he follows his first single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13157-i-cant-stay/"" target=""_blank"">""I Can't Stay""</a> from late last year with a full-fledged EP, <i>Lover Motion</i>.</p>
<p>Ben Browning's solo music isn't too far removed from Cut Copy: With synthesizer contributions from Dan Whitford, this stuff pretty much sounds like Cut Copy minus the Goldsworthy sheen, which is good and bad for Browning. On the one hand, the sprightly disco bounce of ""I Can't Stay"" feels refreshingly uncluttered, all AM-gold guitars and rubber funk basslines, but his tentative and unremarkable vocals end up way too prominent in the mix. Sounding like a slightly higher-pitched Whitford, Browning's voice is slightly less detached but still anonymously blank-faced, hampered by even more awkward lyrics. Lines like, ""this town is full of roads and simplicity,"" are head-scratchers, and even the chorus feels annoyingly tentative: ""I don't want to stay <i>much longer</i>."" (Dude sounds like a pushover, and that blandness is a shame over such a sterling, infectious instrumental.)</p>
<p>The same issues bleed into the EP's other two vocal tracks: ""Feels Like"" has a similar late-period Fleetwood Mac breezy strut tainted by a makeshift melody and lyrics that don't even rhyme, and, well, I'll say no more than: ""When are you here/ Are you belonging to me any time?"" The chorus reaches for the heavens with a brilliant guitar riff, pulled down by Browning's meekness. ""Mistaken Images"" goes for more subdued production, and Browning's perfectly multi-tracked croon sounds eerily like <i>Revolver</i>-era McCartney, replete with all kinds of whimsical production flourishes. Exploding into a thrilling post-rock crescendo, it gives a hint at what Browning might be able to do in the future, but he still doesn't sound comfortable in his own shoes.</p>
<p>Intriguingly, the EP's two instrumentals-- what you might assume were otherwise throwaways-- are actually its highlights. The short ""Night Dune"" is a dramatic cosmic disco journey that sounds like satin pillows and goose down, betraying a melodic delicacy lacking from Browning's ham-fisted vocals. <i>Lover Motion</i> closes with the five-minute instrumental blowout ""Bullet Island"", which could have been an unfinished track from <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15055-zonoscope/"" target=""_blank"">Zonoscope</a></i> with its post-punk guitar stabs and gorgeously fanned arpeggios. That's a compliment, sure, but it also doesn't sound like anything new: Browning can't seem to escape the confines of his band, and while Cut Copy might be an easy group to love, it turns out it's not such an ideal formula when there are only a few pieces of the puzzle in place.</p></div>"|16397.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16397-lover-motion/|5.6|Andrew Ryce

Martens has traded under the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30244-dolphins-into-the-future/"">Dolphins Into the Future</a> name since a self-titled cassette release in 2007, ultimately gaining wider attention with his <i>…On Sea-Faring Isolation</i> LP for <a href=""http://notnotfun.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Not Not Fun</a> in 2009. His music ripples with such calm oceanic splendor that it makes last year's high-benchmark release in the genre, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29786-jurgen-muller/"">Jürgen Müller</a>'s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15696-science-of-the-sea/"">Science of the Sea</a>, </i>sound like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1306-einsturzende-neubauten/"">Einsturzende Neubauten</a> in comparison. Dolphins Into the Future's sound is divined from a split of Martens' own field recordings, gentle twists from his armory of analog and digital synths, and influences extracted from gamelan and exotica, often simply working as a way of recreating the undersea world with which he is so enchanted. Actual music sometimes plays a secondary role; when ""Jardim Dos Tufaos"" from <i>Canto Arquipélago</i> is halfway through, a recording of waves lapping at a beachfront is deployed, subtly nudging the Dolphins Into the Future aesthetic to its logical end point.</p>
<p>Like many artists operating in calmer waters in the post-noise underground, Martens is highly prolific. This album comes at approximately the same time as a cassette-only release for <a href=""http://nnatapes.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">NNA Tapes</a>, <i>A Star Maker, Strange Dreams &amp; Clairvoyance</i>, and a reissue of <i>…On Sea-Faring Isolation</i> on the Finnish label <a href=""http://www.fonal.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Fonal Records</a>. His own <a href=""http://cetaceannationcommunications.blogspot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Cetacean Nation</a> label, itself a subsidiary of Martens' <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/label/Taped%20Sounds"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Taped Sounds</a>, is similarly bountiful in its output. This record, conceived as ""an audio poem for the Açores"" according to <a href=""http://cetaceannationcommunications.blogspot.com/2012/02/canto-arquipelago.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">its maker</a>, was appropriately recorded in a small fishing town, São João, on the island of Pico off the coast of Portugal. It's a less dense recording than <i>…On Sea-Faring Isolation, </i>with huge gaps opening up in the sound, often vanishing into complete silence. There's a greater reliance on Martens' field recordings too, sometimes in a curiously disruptive manner. A piece of beach sound and bird song is cleaved into <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13171-noite/"">""Noite""</a> with scant regard for the pace or direction of the track, making it feel like Martens was gripped by a sudden ADD-like impulse to meddle.</p>
<p>Such diversions only occur irregularly-- for the most part, <i>Canto Arquipélago</i> is an intensely minimal piece, barely perceptible in places, occasionally rugged in others. But it's when those frequency jams split the songs into two, three, or four parts that things really get interesting. ""Verde"" is positively epileptic in its approach, handing over from calmed tone-drift to a raw lo-fi recording of muffled drum sounds, ending up in a sparse (and amusing) call-and-response duet between a synth and a nearby bird. In his excellent 2011 <i><a href=""http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/music/la-ca-new-age-20110703,0,2953740.story"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">LA Times</a></i> piece on the New Age revival, Pitchfork contributor Andy Beta spoke to Douglas Mcgowan of <a href=""http://yogarecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Yoga Records</a>, who hypothesized that the genre could be satiating a desire to escape from constant-click culture, calling it ""the opposite of checking your Facebook every two minutes."" What separates Dolphins Into the Future's work from Martens' peers is hearing strands from the contemporary world leaking in, propelled by a fidgety desire to not get too settled into the straight path he could so easily embark upon.</p>
<p>But <i>Canto Arquipélago, </i>spread over six tracks with a 35-minute runtime, only sporadically inspires. Sometimes Martens does take the straight path, and when he does, with umpteen similarly minded Dolphins Into the Future releases trailing behind him, it starts to feel like he's painting himself into a corner. On the lengthy ""Levante"", Martens is coasting, dipping into territory he's covered so extensively before that coming back for more just feels like he's circling a sparsely populated stretch of ocean, staring emptily into his own reflection. It's a mesh of ambient fluttering and prods of spacey synth drones, laid out for dolphin-like squeaks and gurgles to rise and fall over the top. It might sound churlish to complain about an act called Dolphins Into the Future leaning too hard on dolphin noise for its central stylistic force, but as this record proves elsewhere, it's when Martens plugs up the desire to take the tried and tested route that he loosens a few of the unwanted barnacles from his sound.</p></div>"|16395.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16395-canto-arquipelago/|5.7|Nick Neyland

So maybe it's no surprise that the individual band members' splinter projects over the past couple of years have tended to home in on one sound or another-- <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28740-the-2-bears/"" target=""_blank"">the 2 Bears</a>' big, cuddly house and club pop, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28299-about/"" target=""_blank"">About Group</a>'s trad blue-eyed soul, etc.-- though not always with thrilling results. <a href=""http://newbuildband.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">New Build</a> is the trio of guitarist/multi-instrumentalist Al Doyle, synth/drum machine man Felix Martin, and studio engineer Tom Hopkins, and despite having neither of Hot Chip's distinctive lead vocalists, they seem to have walked away with the band's winning sense of dancefloor melancholy. More than any spin-off so far, New Build recaptures that rare alchemy-- of moods, of music-- that first made Hot Chip so appealing.</p>
<p>Much of New Build's charm is that they've dialed things back from the high-gloss consistency of Hot Chip's last album, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13908-one-life-stand/"" target=""_blank"">One Life Stand</a></i>, arriving at something reminiscent of an earlier era. <i>Yesterday Was Lived and Lost</i> is on all fronts a smaller, more intimate-sounding record than these players have made in years. It cycles through modes rather than seeking a single unified style, and in leaving its hodge-podge edges visible and the occasional acoustic space unfilled, it reopens a certain sense of room and possibility.</p>
<p>The band splits its time between electro-funk, synth-pop, house jams, and balladry, all done with a mannered but never stiff-limbed style. It's a particularly British sound, one warmly indebted to onetime Hot Chip collaborator Peter Gabriel. This influence is especially felt on lead track ""Medication"", with its wobbly funk bass and indulgently soulful background vocals (courtesy of Annalie Wilson and Planningtorock's Janine Rostron, who appears throughout), as well as on ""Miranda, Be My Guide"", whose vocal updrafts and smooth-gliding, sparkling synths are stirred by some subtly muscular drum rolls.</p>
<p>Equally affecting, and perhaps more clearly the band's own, are the house-pop hybrids ""Behind the Shutter"" and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13015-do-you-not-feel-loved/"" target=""_blank"">""Do You Not Feel Loved?""</a>, each of which is propelled by rising synth chords and steady-pumping 4/4 kicks, but to opposite ends. The former is all giddy and light, the latter one of those gorgeous saddo-at-the-rave numbers that this extended family does so well, as hands-in-the-air as it is heart-sunk-to-the-floor. As its muted chords rev into full-on synth buzz, accented by steel drums, Doyle tenderly sings, ""and as the party's shutting down, do you not feel loved?"" and the effect is like a friend checking in on you as your E's wearing off: You want the song not to end but to swell up one more time, even though you know it's time to go home.</p>
<p>New Build's arrangements are impressive and uncomplicated throughout, from the faint tinkling cowbells and squirming, fibrillating synths of ""Schism of the Mind"" to ""Mercy"", with its hyperventilating flute-like synths, flurries of steel drum and percussion, and coda of chicken-scratch guitar. The album closes with a trio of padding, gently drifting ballads, which, while perhaps not the record's main attraction, are sweetly done and even a hair less ponderous than some of Hot Chip's similar offerings. Where New Build lack is in their turns of phrase; ""Do You Not Feel Loved?"" aside, there's nothing here with quite the emotional punch of a ""Boy From School"" or a ""No Fit State"", and the album's most whimsical turns, ""Medication"" or ""Misery Loves Company"" don't quite measure up to the clever fun of Hot Chip's best lines.</p>
<p>It feels like a slight to keep circling around to that comparison, but the truth is that none of <i>Yesterday</i>'s  songs would sound out of place amongst that band's work. Doyle has  neither Alexis Taylor's high falsetto nor Joe Goddard's bass rumble, but  his voice, which has provided backing vocals for Hot Chip and LCD  Soundsystem, proves a happy medium, supple but understated, well up to  the task of singing lead and not without its own personality. Maybe at the next band meeting, the guys should invite Doyle to lend a few songs to the upcoming album. Otherwise, New Build look set to be that rarest of spin-offs: the one that lives up to the original.</p></div>"|16404.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16404-new-build-yesterday-was-lived-and-lost/|7.7|Eric Grandy

While <i>Distressor</i> was focused and enjoyable, the seven-song EP was pretty uniform in terms of sonics and songwriting. The group's new LP, <i>Pipe Dreams</i>, finds the band, formerly called ""Whirl"", not only broadening and improving its old sound but also nudging the margins of it, establishing an identity in a style that so often relies on blurry facelessness.</p>
<p>For starters, few shoegaze albums would have the moxie to include a song like ""Formulas and Frequencies"", which explores texture with an adventurousness that goes beyond tweaking effects pedals. Built around acoustic guitar, piano, and singer Alexandra Morte's floaty soprano, the song is melancholy almost to the point of being a dirge, a slow drift that inches toward the six-minute mark. <i>Pipe Dreams</i> revels in more downtempo fare, from the colossal build of opener ""Reverse"" to the slowcore of ""Wait"", while adding a bit of heft to songs like ""Hide"" and ""Flashback"". (Guitarist Nick Bassett also plays in Deafheaven, and the violent guitar textures on some of the songs here aren't incredibly far removed from those of his other band.) The autumnal, downcast spirit that inhabits the album might come as a surprise to those who wore out the comparatively bright <i>Distressor</i> and last year's <a href=""http://whirrband.bandcamp.com/album/june"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>June</i> 7""</a>.</p>
<p>The languid pace is broken up by a handful of uptempo tunes, including songs like ""Junebouvier"" and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13202-home-is-where-my-head-is/"" target=""_blank"">""Home Is Where My Head Is""</a>, which will inevitably draw comparisons to shoegaze's Big Three (Ride, Slowdive, My Bloody Valentine) due to the overdriven rush of layered guitars. But this is indicative of the limited frame of reference a lot of people have when it comes to shoegaze. Although Whirr share some similarities with the aforementioned bands, the songwriting on <i>Pipe Dreams</i>' more propulsive offerings has more in common with the genre's lesser-known predecessors, such as Velocity Girl and Pale Saints. Songs like ""Bogus"" and ""Toss"" are closer to a glossy, widescreen version of noise-pop. But even during its faster, punchier moments, the album never brightens all the way, maintaining an overcast tone from start to finish.</p>
<p><i>Pipe Dreams</i> ends with the pillowy effects and minor-key guitars of ""Reverie"", bringing the dolorous feel of the album around full-circle. However, its sadness manifests itself in a variety of ways. It's dense and powerful one minute and spacious and quiet the next, never settling into one mood long enough to become stale or seem one-note. With the broadening of their sound and the maturation of their songwriting, the album marks a pretty vast evolution to go with Whirr's subtle name change.</p></div>"|16387.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16387-pipe-dreams/|7.5|Martin Douglas

Pop music headed out to the club, mainstream hip-hop more or less went bust, people started buying more vinyl (and, to a lesser extent, cassettes), and ""indie"" culture traded its guitars for turntables (or, at the very least, pirated audio software and synthesizers that didn't take up too much space in the bedroom).</p>
<p>A lot can happen in five years, the amount of time since <a href=""http://mercerhouse.theshins.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Shins</a> released their last album, the eclectic and overlooked <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9808-wincing-the-night-away/"" target=""_blank"">Wincing the Night Away</a></i>. During that stretch, the band's primary songwriter and sole constant member, James Mercer, also went digital. In 2010, he teamed up with Brian ""Danger Mouse"" Burton to form <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28316-broken-bells/"" target=""_blank"">Broken Bells</a>, a collaboration that has led to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13979-broken-bells/"" target=""_blank"">an album</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15262-meyrin-fields-ep/"" target=""_blank"">an EP</a>, both of which were light on things like ""songs"" and ""choruses."" The problem with Broken Bells is that it took up so much of Mercer's time and didn't provide a proper outlet for one of big-tent indie pop's strongest songwriters. For a few years, the idea of a new (never mind <i>good</i>) Shins album seemed unlikely. Mercer sounded hopelessly adrift.</p>
<p>A deep breath, then: James Mercer has returned to Earth. <i>Port of Morrow</i>, the Shins' fourth studio album in 11 years, is a triumphant return from a project that once risked being reduced to an indie-went-mainstream tagline. It's the perfect distillation of the Shins' back catalog-- the jangly, wistful airs of <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7113-oh-inverted-world/"" target=""_blank"">Oh, Inverted World</a></i>, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7114-chutes-too-narrow/"" target=""_blank"">Chutes Too Narrow</a></i>'s genre-resistant playfulness, <i>Wincing the Night Away</i>'s expansively detailed production. But in other ways, its colorful, detail-oriented approach sets it apart from anything Mercer's done before.</p>
<p>Mercer invited a cast of characters both new (Janet Weiss, production wiz Greg Kurstin, singer/songwriter Nik Freitas) and old (Modest Mouse's Joe Plummer, Fruit Bats' Eric D. Johnson, on-and-off supporting players Marty Crandall and Dave Hernandez) to realize his ornate pop-rock creations. All contributions are felt-- you don't need liner notes to tell how many people worked on this thing-- but none more so than Kurstin's. His multi-instrumental arrangements and behind-the-boards know-how are what make <i>Port of Morrow</i> one of 2012's best-sounding records thus far. Every element here is tricked out for maximum emotional effect-- experience total power-pop pleasure overload from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12952-simple-song/"" target=""_blank"">""Simple Song""</a>'s acrobatic pile of guitars, get the chills from the drifting sea breeze-echo of ""September"", and wrap yourself in ""For a Fool""'s string-laden lushness. Needless to say, these songs would sound great on <a href=""http://www.thecinemasource.com/moviesdb/images/Natalie_Portman%20-%204%20-%20Garden_State.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Natalie Portman's humongous headphones</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, Kurstin wouldn't matter if the raw materials weren't so strong: Mercer (who also co-produced) delivers the goods, mostly by being himself. He's either missed out on the last few years of indie's ever-shifting microtrends or simply doesn't care about ""the conversation."" And thank fucking god for that. More so than any other Shins album, <i>Port of Morrow</i> doesn't sound like it belongs to any particular decade or style, instead hopping around like some fully loaded AM radio dial that cranks out gem after gem. There's the sugary new-wave ""Bait and Switch"", ""No Way Down""'s meat-and-potatoes American pop-rock (right down to the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h04CH9YZcpI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Jack &amp; Diane""</a>-biting guitar hook), the title track's creeping psych-soul bombast. Most surprisingly, there's ""Fall of '82"", a Steve Miller Band-meets-Chicago lite-rock hybrid-- muted trumpet solo!-- that also works as a <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFjjO_lhf9c"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Summer of '69""</a> update. (These are all good things.)</p>
<p>Lyrically, I've always thought of James Mercer as a cousin of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3100-ac-newman/"" target=""_blank"">A.C. Newman</a>, another songwriter with a gift for spinning gold from the sounds from the past. Newman's never been shy about writing kinda-nonsensical lyrics that simply sound good accompanying a solid melody (think ""Sing Me Spanish Techno"", or ""Submarines of Stockholm""). Although <i>Wincing the Night Away</i> had dark undertones drawn from Mercer's personal life, he's got a similar knack for writing beautiful words that don't need to mean anything in particular. Along with its other strong points, <i>Port of Morrow</i> proves he hasn't lost that talent, especially when rhapsodizing on matters of the heart. ""Simple Song"" and ""Fall of '82"" score points for sharp, nostalgic description, but ""September"" is the real winner, a straightforward stunner of stumbling affection with a shining pearl of a couplet buried within: ""Love is the ink in the well/ When her body writes.""</p>
<p>Despite all the hullabaloo about band members getting ""fired,"" the fact is that Mercer isn't a member of the Shins-- he <i>is</i> the Shins, and he always has been. In a recent interview, he expressed his frustration over how to represent that specificity: ""Bands I really loved were these auteurs who presented themselves as bands-- Neutral Milk Hotel, the Lilys-- and I just felt, 'Why am I not allowed to do that?'"" Consider <i>Port of Morrow</i>, then, the results of an auteur's accepting that role while having a load of fun with his friends in order to realize it. Comeback stories don't get much better than that.</p></div>"|16390.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16390-port-of-morrow/|8.4|Larry Fitzmaurice

It's the kind of hood where you can chow on designer meatballs, drink Pabst in a neo-dive bar, and catch an artfully rustic indie folk band. Sure, some gritty pockets remain, but it wouldn't even come close to ranking on a list of contemporary NYC's bogeyman areas.</p>
<p>You wouldn't know any of this from listening to <a href=""http://unsanenyc.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Unsane</a>. In the mind of guitarist-frontman Chris Spencer, who moved to the LES along with his bandmates in the late 1980s, the place remains feral, a cesspool of violence (emotional as well as physical), addiction, and alienation that's straight out of Travis Bickle's dystopia. When Unsane got going, they might have mirrored their environment-- their first drummer, Charlie Ondras, died of an overdose in 1992-- but in 2012, the band's output is a PTSD freeze frame, a protracted rant re: the idea that things simply don't get better. Likewise, Unsane's sound is anti-evolutionary, almost masochistically so. For the past 20-odd years, both in their gruesome album covers (a severed head on the subway tracks, an automobile grille smeared with blood) and their often monosyllabically titled songs, they've explored only shades of grey, with spatterings of red.</p>
<p>Which is all a way of saying that Unsane tell us nothing we don't already know on <i>Wreck</i>, their seventh LP (first in five years and a debut on Alternative Tentacles). If you've heard anything the band has issued since 1995's <i>Scattered, Smothered &amp; Covered</i>-- the record where the current lineup solidified, and arguably the definitive Unsane statement-- you know what you're getting into: ugly yet starkly coherent noise rock, built from just a few elements-- the rumble/thud of bassist Dave Curran and drummer Vincent Signorelli, and Spencer's sneering postindustrial blues riffs and trademark distorted yelp. Just in case you were in doubt about who was responsible, there's a dripping, crimson-stained hand on the cover, not to mention a typewriter font that'll whisk you back to the early 90s, Proust-style.</p>
<p>Calling <i>Wreck</i> predictable isn't a value judgment, though. There's still plenty of kick left in Unsane's simple recipe, and if the style doesn't surprise, the sustained conviction does. To my ears, Unsane have never released a lackluster album, <i>Wreck</i> included. The band's early-90s NYC cronies like Cop Shoot Cop and Helmet matured rapidly but flamed out by the end of the decade. Unsane, on the other hand, have played the tortoise. They flirted with major-label-dom (Atlantic co-issued 1993's <i>Total Destruction</i>) and landed a few clips on MTV, but mostly, they've just gone about their grisly business, never trying to outsmart or out-extreme anyone. Like fellow survivors Melvins (who, in contrast, have evolved with nearly every album), their tourmates on an upcoming U.S. jaunt, they now seem like a scene of one.</p>
<p>Wreck isn't Unsane's most intense album-- 2005's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8386-blood-run/"" target=""_blank"">Blood Run</a></i> hit a harrowing peak that's unlikely to be topped-- nor is it as immediate as <i>Scattered</i> or as huge-sounding as 2007's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10030-visqueen/"" target=""_blank"">Visqueen</a></i>. But much of what's here stands with the band's best work. The biggest takeaway is the monomaniacal genius of Chris Spencer, the way his presence elevates the band from merely aggro to downright poetic.</p>
<p>He's at his most effective on ""Decay"", a failed-relationship waltz with a rue-steeped vocal and mournful leads that sound more English folk ballad than cacophonous rock song. The key is that, both as a howler and a player, Spencer sounds as sad as he does pissed. (Compare the Curran-sung ""Don't"", on which the band registers simply as a swaggery power-rock trio, not the ear-splitting accompanists to some epic tragedy.) Even on less distinctive tracks, such as ""Pigeon"" and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13233-ghost/"" target=""_blank"">""Ghost""</a>, Spencer's eerie guitar melodies-- brittle textures that float over the band's bottom-end wallop-- add a strong emotional jolt. You know he could write these parts while checking his e-mail, but that doesn't make them any less impressive. The same goes for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13127-no-chance/"" target=""_blank"">""No Chance""</a>, which shows off the rhythm section's brute finesse. The song is a transparent recycling of elements from exemplary <i>Scattered</i> single ""Alleged""-- a wailing harmonica, an armor-plated riff that's pure post-hardcore Sabbath-- but it's so exquisitely badass that you're happy to grab for the cheese and feel the familiar sting of the Unsane mouse trap.</p>
<p>Other tracks (""Metropolis"", ""Roach"") furnish intensity without real spark, revealing the deceptively narrow gap between a great Unsane song and a passable one. But the band throws two smart late-album curveballs that offset the unevenness: the dirgey drug lament ""Stuck"", in which Spencer alternates his trusty scream with a strangely composed murmur, and a brilliantly sardonic cover of Flipper's ""Ha Ha Ha"", a song that finds demented comedy in Unsane's beloved ""this city sucks"" sentiment.</p>
<p>Mini departures aside, <i>Wreck</i> is simply another strong Unsane album and another wrench thrown in the idea that an enduring band needs an arc. Noise rock has long since outpaced Spencer and co. in terms of black-hole nihilism (the now-defunct Drunkdriver set a more current benchmark for the subgenre), but Unsane aren't part of that race; like any devoted minimalists, they find strength in limited parameters and take pride in workmanlike production. That's why, even though you already know its moves by heart, <i>Wreck</i> still musters real gravitas. The LES may have been scrubbed clean, but no one's sanitizing Unsane's hermetic urban nightmare anytime soon.</p></div>"|16401.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16401-wreck/|7.6|Hank Shteamer

When the selling point of their tour is that they're going to be playing all of an album they made 21 years ago. That may be a slightly unfair assertion, but <a href=""http://www.scopitones.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Wedding Present</a> are asking for it: their tour for <i>Valentina</i> is being billed as the shows at which they'll recapitulate 1991's <i>Seamonsters</i> in its entirety, ""<a href=""http://www.scopitones.co.uk/news/forthcoming-concerts"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">along with 40 minutes of other music</a>.""</p>
<p><i>Seamonsters</i> was a hard slap of an album, indie pop curdled into abrasion and dissonance, with lyrics whose barbed wit seemed like singer/guitarist David Gedge's dam to hold back much more hurtful words. That version of the Wedding Present, though-- Gedge, guitarist Peter Solowka, bassist Keith Gregory, and drummer Simon Smith-- is a distant memory. Gedge has been the only point of continuity with that lineup for the past 15 years, and meanwhile the rest of the band has turned over multiple times, not to mention the seven-year span during which Gedge's main project was the soundtrack-obsessed group <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/761-cinerama/"" target=""_blank"">Cinerama</a>.</p>
<p><i>Valentina</i> is essentially Gedge and his current sidemen doing a very solid impression of the Wedding Present as they were circa 1990. His lyrics are still focused on infidelity and emotional unfairness, although his characters are a lot more willing to accept culpability than they were back when he was writing songs with titles like ""Why Are You Being So Reasonable Now?"" ""The Girl from the DDR"", the catchiest thing here, is a sour/sweet inversion of cross-cultural love-duet clichés: Gedge admits ""I've been using you all this time... I've realized that I don't think I'm ever gonna leave my girlfriend for you,"" while the band's new bassist Pepe le Moko chirps sad little phrases in German. In ""Back a Bit... Stop"", Gedge even backs out of ""the liaison we're exploring,"" citing ""your lovely fiancé.""</p>
<p>It's not clear what the current lineup of the Wedding Present would sound like left to their own devices, or if they just naturally approximate the bash and swing of the old incarnation as closely as they do. The fuzzy snarl of le Moko's bass sounds just like Gregory's; Charles Layton plays frantic drum rolls just like Smith's; and if Gedge and Graeme Ramsay's guitar parts don't crash into each other quite as enthusiastically as Gedge and Solowka's did, they come pretty close: The trebly flicker-and-rub riff that introduces ""You Jane"" is this band doing what it does best.</p>
<p>There are two aspects of the early Wedding Present, though, whose absence from <i>Valentina</i> is particularly regrettable. One was their engagement with the world of music outside themselves--their songs often felt like witty ripostes to everything else they were listening to. (The Weddoes <a href=""http://vimeo.com/17029298"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">covered Pavement's ""Box Elder""</a> when Pavement had one self-released EP to their name; they recorded multiple John Peel sessions' worth of Ukrainian folk tunes; their first singles compilation was called <i>Tommy</i>, of all things.) <i>Valentina</i> suggests that the only thing they've been listening to lately is their own discography.</p>
<p>The other thing missing on <i>Valentina</i> is the sense that they were perpetually charging forward, and maybe even trying to escape from themselves. The first 10 years' worth of Wedding Present recordings were one formal advance after another; when Gedge turned his attentions to Cinerama, that seemed like another exploratory shift, a way of making sure he wouldn't have to keep rehashing the aesthetics of his youth forever or keep singing like every failed romance was the end of the world. Going back to the old name with a new band, though, was a disappointing retrenchment, and spending a yearlong tour relying on the ""playing the old album"" gimmick means that either the Wedding Present don't trust these new songs or they don't trust their fans. It's strange to ask this question about a band this forceful, but why are they being so timid now?</p>

It's taken him a decade to get here, from the scruffy post-punk of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/370-black-eyes/"">Black Eyes</a>, a dancier advance on that template with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27083-mi-ami/"">Mi Ami</a>, plus his various solo projects (Sex Worker, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29535-ital/"">Ital</a>). The latter earned particular notice for the helix-shaped house rhythms riddled throughout this year's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16256-hive-mind/"">Hive Mind</a></i>, gaining Martin-McCormick a <i><a href=""http://www.villagevoice.com/2012-03-14/music/Daniel-Martin-McCormick-spin-control/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Village Voice</a></i> cover feature. On <i>Decade</i> he returns to work with Damon Palermo as half of Mi Ami, a record released by <a href=""http://notnotfun.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Not Not Fun</a> offshoot <a href=""http://www.listentosilk.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">100% Silk</a>, who helped establish Ital through a series of 12"" singles in 2011. It's an apt way of tethering Martin-McCormick's dual careers, of drawing an easy line between them, especially when the expansive deep house influence at the heart of <i>Decade</i> kicks in.</p>
<p>Michaelangelo Matos notes the surprising cachet Ital has earned in the dance world in that <i>Voice</i> feature, with Martin-McCormick chiming in on how indie-oriented artists releasing electronic side projects don't usually have ""any weight in that world."" Ital's curveball-laden approach mostly attracts an indie crowd dabbling in dance music, while simultaneously having a gentle nibble at the margins of the tightly cloistered house scene. But in the unlikely (yet tantalizing and potentially audience-expanding) event that Ital ends up going full-on four-to-the-floor, Martin-McCormick still has Mi Ami as an exit-hatch, a fall-back in which he can further impale himself on the serrated edges that have marked his career to date.</p>
<p><i>Decade</i> follows a similar template to last year's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15219-dolphins/"">Dolphins</a></i>, containing four tracks of increased breadth and depth. This is an advance on that record, just as most new Mi Ami recordings have been on their predecessors, with the duo allowing the screech and howl of prior albums to taper off into short, staccato bursts of aggression. There's nothing as flat-out grating as ""Secrets"" from <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14140-steal-your-face/"">Steal Your Face</a></i> here, nor is there anything like the Damo Suzuki-channeling ""Peacetalks/Downer"" from <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12840-watersports/"">Watersports</a></i>. Instead, this is all tension, no release, all build, no freefall. There are numerous points of intersection with Ital and Palermo's solo project, Magic Touch. ""Horns"", for example, plays out like a subdued take on Palermo's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDJDW3RBN_k"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Clubhouse""</a>, with the jittery female vocal samples stripped out and replaced with Martin-McCormick's sinewy bawl.</p>
<p>If past Mi Ami releases felt like a band's hunting for a place where its influences could line up just so, <i>Decade</i> is the sound of gaining clarity as far as what it might do with them. It helps that Martin-McCormick's stringy vocals don't dominate. The poised groove of the instrumental (save for a few warped vocal samples) <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13177-time-of-love/"">""Time of Love""</a> would scarcely be able to carry his weight, while the standout ""Bells"" backs him into a corner, limiting him to subtle, well-timed outbursts that don't drench the track in the kind of tortured sadness and anger of prior Mi Ami records. Instead, <i>Decade</i> finds a different kind of weight, the kind trailing in the moody undertow of Mr. Fingers' classic acid cut <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VqAP4fCJOg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Beyond the Clouds""</a>, or in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1304-808-state/"">808 State</a>'s Hacienda anthem, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLxDRePUwEY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Pacific State""</a>. Like <i>Hive Mind</i>, <i>Decade</i> manages to be both lean and meticulous without homing in on a clear point of convergence, feeling very much like a vision still undergoing a slo-mo blur into focus.</p></div>"|16403.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16403-decade/|6.7|Nick Neyland

With <i>Metal Dance</i>, he's yet to give up on that fertile (if almost harvested-to-exhaustion) decade, even as 90s nostalgia is well underway. But where <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3333-playgroup/"" target=""_blank"">Playgroup</a>, and many of Jackson's other mixes and collections, mined the punk-gets-loose (or disco-toughens-up) side of the 80s, here he hammers us with two discs of  martial mayhem and creepy crawling. Despite the compilation's unwieldy subtitle, and a few post-punk ringers, this is music from the stiffer, meaner, moodier, fuglier world of industrial and its various offshoots and precursors, from the club-ready to the floor-clearing.</p>
<p>With its sober packaging, and the backing of a cognoscenti-friendly label, <i>Metal Dance</i> might convert some people still dismissing some fierce and strange music as disco for death-trippers and gloom-hounds, whether that means the kind of punishing not-quite-house that late industrial did so well or the genre-jumbling experiments of the early days that still don't sound like much else. But it'd be consumer fraud to claim that <i>Metal Dance</i> is an embarrassment of forgotten riches. True, there are a fair number of neglected classics here, from the ridiculous metal sleaze of Alien Sex Fiend to the uncomfortably feverish tribal funk of 23 Skidoo. There's also some plain embarrassing stuff that really was probably best forgotten. Jackson's rep as a tastemaker, his seriousness of presentation, and his label's strong track record at this sort of revisionist history compilation-- all of it lends an air of legitimacy to some wack goth boogie that should have stayed in the crypt. Dully repetitive proto-acid tracks that run on far longer than their shrill loops can sustain interest (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTIcFpqTVtY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Neon's ""Voices""</a>). Electro funk that would have made a fine backing for the Pointer Sisters but feels flat without <i>some</i> kinda song on top (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dn9_NvG-5o"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Hard Corps' ""Je Suis Passée""</a>). ""Scary"" guys who sound less menacing than the Pet Shop Boys, who also had better hooks (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbshDwElauI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Naked Lunch's ""Slipping Again""</a>).</p>
<p><i>Metal Dance</i>'s dark and glittering peaks, on the other hand, are all over the map in terms of sound, approach, and effect, proving that industrial and EBM were far more interesting before things got rule-bound and easily marketable. There's the aforementioned Alien Sex Fiend, whose overblown guitars are a serious noisy balm after so much runny keyboard goo. D.A.F. take the same synth-pop starting point as much of <i>Metal Dance</i>, only making it bigger, louder, and more dramatic, and thus more thrilling, even if bigger and louder is a cheap (but effective!) route to thrills.</p>
<p>The set as at its best when the rhythms are less predictable, the textures more otherworldly, the tracks more stylistically hybridized than locked into a scene-pleasing formula. Say, the way 23 Skidoo, Jah Wobble, or 400 Blows merge American funk, various strains of African and Asian ethnic music, and futurist ambiance into thick grooves with an overabundance of ideas-per-minute that shame most of the competition here. Or how even John Carpenter and Alan Howarth get on the good foot, adding a low-riding funk undercarriage to their usual cinematic synth ominousness, as if War had been contracted to score a sci-fi exploitation flick.</p>
<p>It's hard not to think that Jackson would have made a better case for this music if he'd put together one blinding disc of stomping giants and polyrhythmic oddities, rather than padding things out with so many wannabes and never-could-bes. To pick just two examples: Gary Numan had thicker and more head-wrecking riffs than a good number of the synth-pop-for-all-intents acts here, despite the fact that he was working with a similar old-school toolkit. And Kraftwerk obviously had a more finely tuned sense of wringing melody and drama from the days of ""limited"" technology. Too often when slogging through the valleys of <i>Metal Dance</i>, I wondered why I was listening to these collector curios rather than the canonized (but actually enjoyable) likes of <i>Replicas</i> or <i>Computer World</i>. There's only so much time in the world for Euro dudes shouting or moaning over music that sounds like a Berlin lounge band covering ""Jack &amp; Diane"" on a couple of Casios.</p></div>"|16399.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16399-trevor-jackson-presents-metal-dance-industrialpost-punkebm-classics-and-rarities-80-to-88/|5.5|Jess Harvell

And while his position was enviable for someone of his age (he turned 21 during this stretch), he was already feeling some insecurity about his role in the group. The band was called <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1087-dinosaur-jr/"" target=""_blank"">Dinosaur</a>, and they were led by a savant guitarist and songwriter named <a href=""http://jmascis.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">J Mascis</a>; the bassist was a kid named <a href=""http://www.loobiecore.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lou Barlow</a> who had more to say musically than this band would allow him. And so, building on the weird acoustic song called <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I0NvgKZnTk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Poledo""</a> that he'd been allowed on the band's second album, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11719-dinosauryoure-living-all-over-mebug/"" target=""_blank"">You're Living All Over Me</a></i>, he began recording at home in earnest. Where Dinosaur were known for their blown-out guitar energy, Barlow's solo project, which he called <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/sentridoh"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sentriodoh</a>, was quiet, a conversation spoken in a whisper. Here and there, his friend Eric Gaffney helped out on percussion, but the focus on these early recordings was squarely on Barlow's voice, his brief tunes, and the steady strumming of his guitar and ukulele. He put out a Sentridoh cassette in 1987 in a tiny run and called it <i><a href=""http://sentridoh.bandcamp.com/album/weed-forestin"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Weed Forestin'</a></i>.</p>
<p>As luck would have it, Barlow had the perfect voice-- chesty and reasonably deep but always on pitch-- and songwriting style for this kind of music. He sounded like someone who'd lived a while and seen some things even though he really hadn't, but his naivety and inexperience turned out to be an advantage. Performing his songs for his four-track, he sounded utterly alone, and the tunes took on a diaristic feel. He sang about being lonely and jerking off and feeling unloved, but he also had a sense of humor and was able to laugh at himself. Many of the songs were just sketches-- there were 23 of them in 45 minutes-- but they never felt incomplete, exactly. It was more that, when Barlow had said what needed to be said and introduced his melodic or lyrical idea, he was cool with just stopping and moving on to something else. This music was more about process than resolution.</p>
<p>Barlow now brings the original vision of <i>Weed Forestin'</i> back into print. It's an album with a strange release history. After those initial cassettes, which were issued in two editions as Barlow added more songs to them, the album was eventually reissued by Homestead on vinyl. By then, however, they came out under the name <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3733-sebadoh/"" target=""_blank"">Sebadoh</a>, the one used by Barlow when in full collaboration with Gaffney (he'd continue to release solo material as Sentridoh). Eventually, <i>Weed Forestin'</i> was combined with an edited version of its Sebadoh follow-up, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10448-the-freed-man/"" target=""_blank"">The Freed Man</a></i>, and was released on CD in 1990 as <i>The Freed Weed</i>. I'm going to guess that this is the version through which almost everyone who heard these songs in the 90s first encountered them (including yours truly). But this set brings <i>Weed Forestin'</i> back to its initial form, under the Sentridoh name. It comes in multiple editions, including deluxe vinyl (I worked from mp3 promos for this review), and comes with an hour of bonus material called <i>Child of the Apocalypse</i>, which adds early versions, alternate takes, and unreleased songs.</p>
<p>It's worth asking whether a 25-year-old album of home-recorded indie folk is worth reissuing at all. This is, in one respect, music very much of its time, when small-run print zines were the only source of information about this low-key and obscure music, and the independent scene was still very much in the underground. Does <i>Weed Forestin'</i> have anything special to say in 2012 that isn't being said by the thousands of home-recording kids currently on the cusp of turning 21?</p>
<p>It's not an easy question to answer, and, since I encountered this music in the 90s and it opened my ears to a new way of listening to and thinking about music, I may not be the right person to ask. But to my ears, <i>Weed Forestin'</i> holds up very well, and represents a sort of ideal for what a home-recorded singer-songwriter record might be. For one, there's the sheer tunefulness of Barlow's songwriting. Even though he was writing fragments, songs like ""New Worship"", <a href=""http://sentridoh.bandcamp.com/track/gate-to-hell"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Gate to Hell""</a>, and <a href=""http://sentridoh.bandcamp.com/track/brand-new-love"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Brand New Love""</a> are filled with fresh melodic turns you don't quite expect and chord changes that lodge in your brain (later covers of some of these tunes would bear out their strength as compositions). Hearing this stuff at the time, Barlow came over like a suburban Nick Drake remaking <i>Pink Moon</i> in his bedroom (which made even more sense when Sebadoh eventually <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf51YCO629U"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">covered ""Pink Moon""</a> on <i>Smash Your Head on the Punk Rock</i>). And <i>Weed Forestin'</i> could also be seen as a young dude's version of Joni Mitchell's <i>Blue</i>, another record Barlow came to admire, talking about self-doubt and his place in the world around him and in the simplest and most direct terms.</p>
<p>And the structure of <i>Weed Forestin'</i> elevates it further. It's sequenced to flow, with garbled tape pieces, swells of sampled symphonic music, and even a snippet of Eric Burdon and the Animals' ""Sky Pilot"" to keep it moving along. It works an appealing edge between a collage and a proper album, and has the feel of a mixtape. Part of the allure of home recording of this kind, which continues to this day, is the blurring of the lines between listening to music and making it. Barlow arranged everything to give it a sense of context that made the completed project feel whole.</p>
<p>All of which explains why the copious bonus material is even more for-fans-only than is typical for this kind of release. We're talking about <i>extras</i> here, for a 23-song album of bits and pieces. And since the assembly of <i>Weed Forestin'</i> proper feels anything but random, the dump of additional material doesn't add a whole lot. There are reasonably interesting tape collages and instrumental and alternate versions of some of the album's better-known songs, but they're not the sort of thing anyone but the most dedicated fans would return to. I'm glad they exist and are available, and it makes perfect sense to include them here, but <i>Weed Forestin'</i> on its own is more than enough.</p>
<p>The first question people ask with lo-fi is whether it's a necessity or an aesthetic choice. For every artist saying, ""If I could afford a real studio, I'd use one,"" there's another talking about the warmth and intimacy of the four-track cassette (or, more recently, the cheap microphone, cracked recording software, and reasonably expensive computer). People who've no choice but to record on inexpensive equipment carry with them an air of purity: They're presumably poor artists who, for one reason or another, are not given access to the means of production (think <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2202-daniel-johnston/"" target=""_blank"">Daniel Johnston</a> bouncing between dictaphone cassette machines in his brother's garage). Whereas producers making lo-fi by choice aestheticize the the warp, the break, and the hiss. Since we know that cheap recordings can mask mistakes, a certain amount of skepticism for those in the latter group is natural and healthy. But you're eventually confronted with a piece of music that either does something for you or doesn't. For me, modest as it is, <i>Weed Forestin'</i> still works wonders.</p></div>"|16400.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16400-weed-forestin/|8.2|Mark Richardson

Even in the crowded lane of fight-music rap, Gunplay is a breed apart: For sheer fiendish creativity, technical ability, and display of unsettling enthusiasm, he is Bacardi 151 to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29211-waka-flocka-flame/"" target=""_blank"">Waka</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30094-french-montana/"" target=""_blank"">French</a>'s Everclear: just as potent, but surprisingly refined for something specifically designed to knock you on your ass. His last mixtape, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15097-inglorious-bastard-prelude-to-valkyrie/"" target=""_blank"">Inglorious Bastard</a></i>, came out on January 1 of last year, and its loony swagger towered over almost all the street-rap that came out after it. He's nominally a member of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4880-rick-ross/"" target=""_blank"">Rick Ross</a>' Maybach Music Group, but Ross seems to keep him apart from the crew for some reason, perhaps out of fear of what he might do to a gentle soul like Stalley. He has kept mostly to himself during the MMG empire's expansion-- he only had a single guest verse on last year's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15472-mmg-presents-self-made-vol-1/"" target=""_blank"">Self Made, Vol. 1</a></i> showcase-- but he seems to have used the time honing his act and upping every conceivable ante on it. Listening to him let loose on <i>Bogota Rich: The Prequel</i>, his new DJ Holiday mixtape, I am reminded of Travis Bickle, doing countless pushups alone, staring into a mirror.</p>
<p><i>Bogota Rich</i> is only 13 songs, an eye-blink as far as rap mixtapes go. If it's all we're getting from Gunplay this year, it's a major letdown. It's billed as the ""appetizer"" to the ""filet mignon"" that will be the full <i>Bogota</i> mixtape, due out at some troublingly unspecific moment in the future. Even with all these minor disappointments, however, it's easily one of the most exciting gangsta-rap releases of the year so far. As a rapper, Gunplay has become darker and more interesting: He's not exactly taking us into into ""Diary of a Madman"" territory yet, but he comes off as genuinely dangerous and unpredictable, whereas on <i>Inglorious</i> he sometimes sounded like Foghorn Leghorn with a bad coke habit.</p>
<p>A lot of that edge comes from his delivery. His word choices, which have always been surprising, are now a head-turning parade of ""wait, what?"" His phrasing is full of rhythmic trap doors and unseen left hooks. ""Bank filled to the brim/ Spilled on my rims/ One sheet to the wind/ Cup of gin to the chin/ Jewels on my limbs/ do not attempt,"" is the Tommy-gun volley Gunplay opens the tape with. Later from the same song, he tells us, ""Never flew what I flaunt/ All you seen is the wing."" On ""Fuck Shit"", he's ""just another petty thief, never had a spaghetti feast."" On the riotous <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13260-jump-out/"" target=""_blank"">""Jump Out""</a>, he doesn't just stick people up, he gets ""wretched with my ratchet until I see my proper ends."" There is no threat or depraved boast that he can't embellish or improve with some odd, singular wording.</p>
<p>Far too many verses on this brief mixtape are given over to the other two members of Triple Cs, the group that Gunplay is also, at least theoretically, a member of. Of the three, Torch is the second-most interesting, but the gap between them is cavernous. The second he starts rapping, you begin waiting for Gunplay to return. Also: The Nazi Thing continues to be unsavory. <i>Inglorious Bastard</i> featured him in full regalia, and on several points on <i>Bogota Rich</i> he sniggeringly refers to himself as Don ""Adolf"" Logan. But it seems to be no more than a ""thing,"" with as much commitment to it as a swastika idly dug into a middle-school desk with a compass edge in the hopes that it will piss someone-- anyone-- off. ""Everything I say so goddamn low life,"" goes the sneering chorus to ""Low Life"", and it's a line Gunplay leans into pretty hard: The title of the song is repeated 40 times in four minutes. It's his Message, and if he continues to find as many creative ways to dig into it on the expanded <i>Bogota</i> as he does here, it will almost certainly be one of the most entertaining rap releases of the year.</p></div>"|16393.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16393-gunplay-bogota-rich-the-prequel/|7.6|Jayson Greene

Sure, there are those who still embrace dragon or goblin talk and explore the complexities of getting the most stoned with the least amount of effort. But within the 40-year-old form, there are clear factions based on fundamental philosophical fractures-- Christian metal versus Christ-killing metal, populist champions versus elitist extremists, good old Southern boys versus idealist art kids. There's metal for being vegan, metal for being skeptical about technology, and metal for crushing authority in all forms. Lots of very good music elects to avoid the issues of the day in favor of songs about love and loss, emotions and escape; heavy metal, however, refuses to accept too much too easy. The genre is its own warzone.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Perhaps nowhere is this more apparent and divisive than in black metal, a field whose forefathers set an instantly high bar for controversy, if not necessarily conversation. In 2012, no one's burning churches in the name of blast beats, but the threads of nationalism and homeland defense that helped fuel those flames two decades ago certainly haven't disappeared. Though it's not a necessary qualification, black-metal bands sometimes champion the vilest forms of xenophobia-- racism, homophobia, and anti-Semitism being the trifecta. From the names of their record labels to their insignia to the lyrics on the albums themselves, a mess of these bands either have nothing to hide about their hatred or no sense of subtlety about how to share it; if you need a black-metal band to validate your prejudice of choice, the combination of a Google search and a PayPal account should have their super-limited-edition, ultra-kvlt LP delivered to your doorstep in just a matter of days.</p>
<p class=""p1"">But then there are those black-metal bands that invoke much head-scratching and hand-wringing with fans who want their black metal without race- or class-specific bile and those who, well, want the opposite. Chief among them might be <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/drudkhofficial"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Drudkh</a>, a mysterious Ukrainian band that doesn't do press photos, websites, interviews, or, intermittently, lyric sheets for the nine full-length albums they've made since 2003. (Aside from song titles, the lyrics for their latest, the excellent <i>Eternal Turn of the Wheel</i>, are written and sung entirely in Ukrainian.) But during the last decade, Drudkh have made one thing abundantly clear-- a keen appreciation for and espousal of their country's history. Whether quoting Ukrainian folk music, lifting from various Ukrainian writers, or sampling films about the country's sometimes benighted or controversial politics, Drudkh have expressed deep pride in their Slavic origins.</p>
<p class=""p1"">That makes them provincial, sure, but their broader politics haven't been so simple to decode, especially since they come from a country whose own role in World War II remains an active topic of debate among scholars. Drudkh have named a track for the Ukrainian Insurgent Army, a violent group who pushed for an ethnic Ukrainian state through whatever alliances they found necessary. Drudkh have also described themselves as ""conservative revolutionaries,"" a movement with slippery ties to specific quests for nationalism in Europe. Sharing members with the tedious, blatantly Aryan band Hate Forest (including founder Roman Sayenko), as well as with Astrofaes, bands who both turn up frequently in talks about Neo Nazis in heavy metal. Still, last year, they collaborated as the band Old Silver Key with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5913-alcest/"" target=""_blank"">Alcest</a>'s Neige, a guy who seems to have stepped away from his former political associations to become the peaceful disciple of black metal. They've released tapes via notoriously nationalist Ukrainian imprint Oriana Productions; but like their last two albums, <i>Eternal Turn of the Wheel</i> arrives via Season of Mist, a label whose massive roster stretches from Georgia's Kylesa to Greece's Rotting Christ, from Norway's Mayhem to Florida's Morbid Angel. In short, there's nothing easy to say about Drudkh's politics other than that, well, they're not very easy.</p>
<p class=""p1"">On the other hand, the appeal of <i>Eternal Turn of the Wheel</i> is easy enough to hear. During the last decade, Drudkh have alternately been tagged for their Burzum worship and their folk-music leanings, but <i>Wheel</i> splits the difference by fighting against both typecasts. Built with two pairs of nine- and eight-minute songs (and the requisite mood-setting introduction, of course), it offers a relentless and urgent interpretation of the same canyon-sized stuff that bands like Agalloch and Wolves in the Throne Room-- and, before them, Katatonia and Ulver-- have steadily pushed toward popularity. On a purely musical level, it's as compelling and cathartic as any such recent marriage of post-rock grandiosity and black-metal grit.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Drudkh have occasionally delighted in their own sense of misdirection, with guitar or bass tangents breaking their massive metal marches into bits, much the way they might in prog rock. But befitting its name, <i>Eternal Turn of the Wheel</i> never squanders its momentum, making these epics feel more like focused conquests than free explorations. About six minutes into ""Breath of Cold Black Soil"", for instance, the bass takes the lead, its throb the only changing feature among a tide of steady guitars, synthesizers, and drums. On 2010's <i>Handful of Stars</i>, the other instruments might have fallen out of the mix, giving the bass too much room to stretch. But here, the guitars keep swirling, and the drums keep stomping, so that when Thurios' vocals return, they don't feel disconnected from the previous five minutes.</p>
<p class=""p1"">And there's a pause during ""When Gods Leave Their Emerald Halls"" where the drums ease into a patter and the guitar peels back the distortion for a slight, rippling interlude. Rather than emphasize technicality or individual ambition, the stop only highlights the roar of Drudkh when they return for the coda a few seconds later, all instruments barreling at once. Where Drudkh have sometimes struggled to truss their vision for arrangements to the vitality of those arrangements, <i>Eternal Turn of the Wheel</i> feels like an ego-less union, a quartet gladly cooperating for an exhilarating half an hour. At most any point here, don't be surprised to find your fist in the air, your foot tapping on the floor, or your mind somehow pulling for the conclusion of some dramatic quest. It's that good.</p>
<p class=""p1"">If one of the purposes of art is to inspire conversation and to make us consider contexts that we'd never even imagined, Drudkh have been doing their job from the start. It's OK if you reject Drudkh wholesale because of their potentially problematic politics or past alliances. But Drudkh and lesser bands with the same ideological contradictions or conundrums essentially remind us that music can be an expression of its specific culture-- of ideas which we have the agency to reject or accept, to debate or table for more study. <i>Eternal Turn of the Wheel</i> is as captivating as most any stretch of black metal you'll hear this year, even if it posseses a lifetime of questions that deserve to be asked.</p></div>"|16392.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16392-eternal-turn-of-the-wheel/|8.2|Grayson Currin

So go the opening lyrics of ""Terminal Body"", the first discernable words sung on <i><a href=""http://soundcloud.com/hipposintanks/sets/white-car-everyday-grace/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Everyday Grace</a></i>. While a compelling standalone lyric, it makes for an even more effective thesis statement, as much of <a href=""http://white-car.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">White Car</a>'s full-length debut is spent ruminating on the ever-widening gulf between technology and humanity. Themes of over-consumption, isolation, and claustrophobia all seep into the album's grooves. Idols crumble into dust; the future is a very cold place. For an album so firmly rooted in electronic dance music, it is one huge bummer of a party.</p>
<p>With a croon and a howl that are equally nightmarish, Elon Katz attempts to work out the depersonalization of modern, internet-driven life through a torrent of unrest. He struggles with the concept of wasting time on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12899-she-the-bodiless-now-we-continue/"" target=""_blank"">""Now We Continue""</a> while ending ""In the Second Month of the Year"" with the phrase, ""You will be alone."" Pendulums swing and flesh is eaten on ""When"", while Katz pines for the past in a way that doesn't evoke wistful nostalgia, but confronts the changing times with a healthy dose of disgust. On <i>Everyday Grace</i>, signifiers of the past are left behind in exchange for hollow new items and the idea of being found when you really don't want to be. There's a sense of dystopia Katz conveys that seems far too anguished to be put-on.</p>
<p>Through its wide array of instruments and collaborators, <i>Everyday Grace</i> never feels too minimal for its own good. Katz's pitch-shifted vocals are an appropriate anchor for his songs, incorporating elements of industrial music to his dissonant strain of early-80s computer funk. This formula often works for him: The jerky rhythms and synth melody of ""Feed Me"" and the shuffle of ""The Factor"" make for genuine highlights. There are layers of digital art damage throughout.</p>
<p>But somewhere along the line, the songs bleed into each other and the record feels more like variations of the same nightmare; the tempos and song structures rarely deviate, making the album as a whole a bit ponderous to get through. And once the jarring shock of Katz's atonal vocals subsides, it can get grating quickly. Only seven of the album's 11 songs have lyrics-- the words being the most compelling facet here-- and aside from the mangled vocal sampling of the intro, the instrumentals don't provide anything more substantial than the proper songs. At times, they feel like filler.</p>
<p>Aside from its dancefloor-ready beats, <i>Everyday Grace</i> is the epitome of a challenging listen. Its dissonance triggers the part of our brains that responds negatively to something that isn't tuneful. Its lyrics are of a man trying to make heads or tails of himself and contemporary society, with its obsession with saturation, creature comforts, and its own image. There's a disturbance felt from top to bottom, and the idea of using it as background music is laughable. But it explores the deteriorating collapse of, well, everything in the digital age in a way that feels new.</p></div>"|16398.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16398-everyday-grace/|6.8|Martin Douglas

<p>Though delivered with various levels of irony, each of those lyrics makes the same point: Retromania is inevitably a practice in revisionist history. For those of us coming of age during <a href=""http://www.tmz.com/2010/10/14/former-mtv-vj-kennedy-memba-her/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>this </i>Kennedy</a> administration, I present <i>Baby</i>, the debut album from Camden quartet <a href=""http://tribesband.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tribes</a>. Though <a href=""http://soundcloud.com/tribesband/we-were-children-1"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""We Were Children""</a> is ostensibly meant as a narrative of youthful indiscretion, there's nowhere near enough specificity in Johnny Lloyd's lyrics to hear ""these things happen, we were children in the mid 90s"" as anything other than <i>Baby</i>'<i>s </i>mission statement. It essentially recreates a 45-minute MTV rock block from 1995 in its most accurate and often unflattering terms.</p>
<p>I can't stress the <i>MTV </i>aspect of it enough. Tribes are hardly alone in their studious appreciation of Clinton-era guitar rock these days, but unlike <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28248-surfer-blood/"" target=""_blank"">Surfer Blood</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28096-male-bonding/"" target=""_blank"">Male Bonding</a>, or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28604-yuck/"" target=""_blank"">Yuck</a>, they have absolutely no sonic or philosophical ties to indie rock whatsoever. If you're in a generous mood, you might hear the regally draped ""Corner of an English Field"" occupying the same cross-section of glam-rock and Britpop that Suede's <i>Dog Man Star </i>did, and ""We Were Children"" pretty much steals the riff and song structure from ""Where Is My Mind?"" wholesale. But due to the arrow-straight performances, slick and sober production, and overeagerness to please, a more accurate assessment would say that we're dealing with third-genners like Spacehog or the Toadies. These are two of <i>Baby</i>'s maybe five memorable songs, for what it's worth... which for a supposed pop-rock record is worth everything.</p>
<p>There <i>is</i> a good amount of hooky fun to be had when Tribes come off like the band on <i>Baby</i>'s album cover-- scrappy but stylish, in search of the next available good time. In a weird way, the album actually feels like an alternative of some kind in 2012 if you're all but ignoring major-label rock: Lloyd's vocals are loud and brash, but in a charming way that's utterly necessary if you're gonna sell lyrics like, ""I scream from California,"" pronounced like, ""ice cream from Californ-eye-<i>uh.</i>"" Likewise, the liftoff achieved by the choruses on ""We Were Children"" and ""Whenever"" packs a tremendous kick in large part because Tribes harbor no delusions about being a garage band. This is market-tested and fail-proof keg-rock with all grunge and grit sanded off so it can leap out of jukebox speakers with the utmost velocity.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the sequencing of <i>Baby </i>takes too many cues from its Buzz Bin forerunners as well. After spending 15 minutes sounding like preordained headliners, Tribes trudge through half an hour of perfunctorily composed and performed verses and choruses that are all too deniable. The contents of <i>Baby </i>can be evaluated by a pretty simple calculus: The more esoteric the song title is, the worse the actual song is. Tribes aren't much for lyrics <i>or </i>book learnin', so the plug-dumb femme fatale fantasia ""Sappho"" more or less exists so these guys could prove to themselves they could write a song based on Greek mythology. And the best thing I can say about ""Walking in the Street"" is that, while its introductory roll of concrete-slab snares immediately reminds you of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsdy_rct6uo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Two Princes""</a>, a hook of, ""All I wanna do is you,"" reminds you of the casually backhanding misogyny of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXWbMu4PtpE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Little Miss Can't Be Wrong""</a> instead.</p>
<p><i>Baby </i>isn't a very good record, but I'm actually kinda happy bands like Tribes still exist. How many times have we thought fondly of all those guys who missed out on influence or longevity but got a stylish <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0779265/otherworks"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jake Scott video</a> as a consolation prize?  It's not Tribes' fault the necrophiliac Brit rags are calling these dudes the biggest thing since <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29829-viva-brother/"" target=""_blank"">Viva Brother</a>. But it's nice to know that there are rock bands out there aspiring toward that elusive, career-making hit single and major labels ready to throw money at 'em. I just hope <i>Baby </i>fulfills its destiny and finds itself comfortably nestled between Three Fish and Tripping Daisy in whatever used-CD stores are left out there.</p></div>"|16396.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16396-tribes-baby/|5.2|Ian Cohen

On songs like ""Another Naive Individual Glorifying Greed and Encouraging Racism"", he made it clear there was a Native Tongues revivalist knocking around inside him as well as a Texas-rap revivalist, and he seemed as good a candidate as any to fuse the two into something resonant and thoughtful. Neither scene had a whole lot to say to each other in their heyday, but now that they're both safely preserved in amber, there are some powerful dots to connect. Both relied heavily on warm, instrument-heavy tracks. Both were single-averse, album-statement-friendly forms. And both were excellent vehicles for humble spiritualism and the softer side of blue-collar wisdom. K.R.I.T. seemed to be finding his lane.</p>
<p>With <i><a href=""http://www.livemixtapes.com/download/16042/big_krit_4eva_n_a_day.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">4 Eva N a Day</a></i>, he already seems to be foundering in it. It's his first full-length statement since last year's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15312-return-of-4eva/"" target=""_blank"">Return of 4Eva</a></i>, and it's one of the least distinctive things he's put his name on, a step backward into Southern-rap exercises that point you away from K.R.I.T.'s music and toward his heroes. None of it is <i>bad</i>, strictly speaking: K.R.I.T. produced all of it, and his production, even when it's in safe, UGK-template mode, is reliably spacious and warm, full of audible air. The chorus to ""Me and My Old School"" skillfully threads wah-wah guitars around a screwed and chopped vocal sample just like UGK's ""Diamonds &amp; Wood"", and it's beautiful even as it remains stymied by the actual existence of ""Diamonds &amp; Wood"". He tweaks the sunny soul vocal loop on ""4EvaNaDay Theme"" so that it pours out of the speakers like sunshine. K.R.I.T.'s ear for spacing samples and live instruments in a mix is immersive, and it exudes an easy confidence in itself that you rarely hear in K.R.I.T.'s rapping.</p>
<p>The problem with K.R.I.T.'s rapping is not that he lacks a personality; it's that he refuses to settle into the one he has. When he insists on play-acting like a heartless pimp, it doesn't suit him, and on <i>4Eva</i>, his Pimp C impersonation has grown so slavish that it's downright distracting. He does not sound like the kind of soul who would be welcome, or comfortable, at a ""Player's Ball"", but he raps about it on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13092-boobie-miles/"" target=""_blank"">""Boobie Miles""</a>, after sneering at the girl in his passenger seat as a gold digger. Some rappers can balance on the knife edge between consciousness and ignorance, but K.R.I.T. is not one of them. Not everybody can be Pimp C, and he muddies his image when he veers into this territory.</p>
<p>Worse is the vagueness that has settled into his reflective moments, which have always been where he shines. ""They can barely hear the real shit/ In a world of fantasies, can you be a realist?"" he demands on ""The Alarm"", without bothering much to elaborate. On ""Country Rap Tunes"" (about as imaginative a title for a Southern rap song as ""Real Hip Hop"" is for an NYC one), he insists that he ""came from the bottom of the map to show/ That there's more to us country folk,"" and he sounds like a presidential candidate pitching aw-shucks normal-guy woo to an assembly of steel workers. With all his generic references to the Struggle, to Living Your Dreams, and to Holding Onto Your Integrity, K.R.I.T. sounds like he's already skipped past the Common of <i>One Day It'll All Make Sense</i> and landed at the empty, air-quotes empathy of <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10483-finding-forever/"" target=""_blank"">Finding Forever</a></i>.</p>
<p>There are still glints of the soul-searcher K.R.I.T. is supposed to become: ""Package Store"" renders an encounter with a diseased, corrupt preacher in one packed, memorable verse. ""Red Eye"" is a disarming love letter to an estranged girlfriend. But elsewhere, he sounds like a guy in danger of fading into his own record collection. <i>4 Eva N a Day</i> might be a stopgap release, filled with leftovers, as he preps his major-label debut, <i>Live From the Underground</i>: let's hope so.</p></div>"|16375.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16375-big-krit-4eva-n-a-day/|6.8|Jayson Greene

In the last year, he's released <a href=""http://rimar.bandcamp.com/track/let-me-luv-u-remix"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a dripping, chipmunk slow jam remix of Mario's ""Let Me Luv U""</a>, and the J. Dilla-indebted <i><a href=""http://rimar.bandcamp.com/album/higher-ground"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Higher Ground</a></i>, a synth funk EP that was reissued on vinyl in the fall. So yeah, he's one of many musicians deftly mining of-the-moment sounds-- merging chilled-out production with radio R&amp;B like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15395-the-perfect-lullaby/"">Nguzunguzu</a> and simultaneously paying homage to and deconstructing 1990s hip-hop like almost every other rap producer out there. But he also possesses a better handle on these sounds than a lot of other guys.</p>
<p>On stage with Cities, he doesn't just drop beats; he slices and dices samples live in front of the audience, tastefully piles on effects, and often sends the songs into an explosion of feedback before deftly pulling the next beat out of the noise-rap din. His Mario remix was sensitive and confident, put together by a guy who clearly spent a lot of time with the mid-2000s hit; <i>Higher Ground</i>, a concept record about falling in love, used broken-down boogie-inspired beats and clever samples (the Velvet Underground's ""I'll Be Your Mirror"", Nas [ft. AZ]'s ""Life's a Bitch"") to convey its open-hearted message.</p>
<p>A sequel to the lovestruck <i>Higher Ground</i>, <i><a href=""http://rimar.bandcamp.com/album/closer"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Closer</a></i> replaces early-80s grooves with the sounds of the late 80s, namely the bedroom atmospherics of quiet-storm R&amp;B and the communal throb of Chicago house. The track ""Holding on lay deep: break"" begins by layering porno sounds underneath a winding, stretched-out funk guitar, and later on it transforms into a deep dance cut. Among wordless moans and exhortations, there's a sample from G-Side's ""24-8"", chopped and screwed, with ST from the group declaring, ""Love her til' she old/ And fuck her like she new."" There's the album's touching thesis, playfully expressed as poignant dirty talk.</p>
<p><i>Closer</i> is a concept album about sex-- baby-making music for music dorks-- and a touching celebration of the emotional rewards brought on by serious, dedicated intimacy. Song titles like, ""As time moves into this home"", and ""It's been so long"", as well as movie clips (most notably from Gaspar Noe's <i>Enter the Void</i>), further highlight the love and devotion underneath these songs about fucking. ""I still feel a certain way about you"" loops a soul singer's voice into a series of increasingly excited orgasmic wails.</p>
<p><i> </i></p>
<p>Rimar's approach to hypnagogic glow also shows ambition. The hiss isn't conveying misremembered nostalgia or sending listeners back to childhood, before student loans and a bummer of an economy. It is turning that glowing buzz into something emotional and expressive: that gut-level warm feeling that overwhelms you when you're in love. The comfortable sound of being in the moment, not thinking about the past, and imagining a healthy, productive future with someone else.</p></div>"|16391.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16391-rimar-closer/|7.3|Brandon Soderberg

On the other hand, ""songs"" have rarely felt like much more than jumping-off points for the band's interstellar overdrive. <i>Frying on This Rock</i>-- their third LP for Thrill Jockey in as many years-- goes about things a little differently, with W. and company arriving at the studio with a few things worked out, a fairly marked shift in philosophy for a band who've long been fond of winging it. With noisenik legend Martin Bisi behind the boards, though, their wilder, woolier side's in good hands, and <i>Frying on This Rock</i> mostly finds White Hills with their freak flags hoisted well above half mast, with any and all overtures toward coherence obscured by billowing clouds of feedback.</p>
<p>""Song of Everything"" rips itself open like Deep Purple's <i>Book of Taliesyn</i> played at an advanced RPM; the band stomps as W. grunts, not-so-gradually building to a neuron-unsettling pummel. It's clear from the first few seconds of this gnarly ""Song"" that Bisi's not exactly there to clean up anybody's act, but he seems to've helped the oft-messy White Hills suss out their sound a little bit; where many of their earlier recordings seemed overstuffed to the point of claustrophobia, <i>Frying</i> feels expansive, grandiose even. ""Song"" surges into the pulsating ""Robot Stomp"", the sound of your head being repeatedly crushed by heavy machinery while a symphony plays mockingly in the corner; over a dozen-plus minutes, with something like malevolence on their minds, W. and bassist Ego Sensation twist a few undulating notes around each other into a near-maddening climax. Both beauteous and brain-tenderizing, ""Stomp"" is <i>This Rock</i>'s greatest peak, its one real go-for-broke moment; it's not all downhill from there, but the trail ahead proves quite a bit rockier.</p>
<p>""You Dream You See"" folds in Spaceman 3 swirl and pre-<i>Superunknown</i> Soundgarden smash, complete with a Kim Thayil-nodding wah-wah from W. running up the sides of the track. It's at about the three-minute mark that ""Dream"" begins to plod; unlike the rest of <i>Rock</i>, ""Dream"" starts much as it ends, and since the song itself is not much more than a mantra-like chorus with some space for guitar breaks, it never quite justifies all six of its minutes. W.'s gruff vocals have long been White Hills' weak spot on wax; the guy just doesn't have the pipes to cut through his own din, and for all Bisi's strides toward sonic separation here, pretty much whenever W. steps to the mic, his husky howl gets a little lost in the undercurrent. The swirling <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13151-pads-of-light/"" target=""_blank"">""Pads of Light""</a> smartly finds a way around that particular problem by not even trying to match W. to the gale force of the music; the tune reaches its summit early before sliding off into <i>Rock</i>'s trippiest territory, an echoey, near-Floydian float complete with promethazene-soaked mantra recitations from a deeply stoned W.</p>
<p>Arriving after the time-dilating ""Pads"", though, closer ""I Write a Thousand Letters (Pulp on Bone)"" can't help but feel a little sluggish. The track, <i>Frying</i>'s longest, seems to take forever to get going: W. slowly turns the same riff over and over again, and it's not until roughly the 12th of its nearly 14 minutes that you realize they're actually getting somewhere with it. Though it does eventually bow out on something of a high, in the wake of the towering ""Robot Stomp"" and the sharp turn in the middle of ""Pads"", ""Thousand Letters"" lacks urgency, and the track's eventual arrival at its not-all-that-high point feels like little more than a foregone conclusion. Ending on a non-starter's one thing, but the sluggish ""Thousand Letters"" fills up a good third of <i>Frying</i>; taken together with the last several unnecessary minutes of ""You Dream"", you've got an LP with some serious balance issues, one that peaks too early and peters out too soon. <i>Frying</i> isn't the song-centric platter promised in the press packet-- which, going on ""Dream"", was probably for the best-- but this is still White Hills at their most deliberate and, ""Stomp"" aside, their least wild. But, like any good psychonauts, it's when White Hills really let go that all the truly revelatory stuff starts happening.</p></div>"|16380.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16380-frying-on-this-rock/|6.4|Paul Thompson

From the title inward,<i> Pretty Ugly, </i>Smart's debut album for Hyperdub, wears its polemical heart on its sleeve, offering a manifesto for an approach to dance music that looks askew, glances awry, and always moves out of kilter. This approach was present in Smart's earlier work in the UK funky field, already a sub-genre that self-defines by how much it can subvert the rhythmic template of house. Perhaps influenced by his background in grime, Smart took this perversity to extremes-- see the half-step razzmatazz of 2008's ""Hard House"" or the alien samba of 2009's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECDr4rEvXSc&amp;feature=related"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Jelly Roll""</a>-- pushing UK funky's twisted rhythm-sculptures to breaking point, and challenging dancers to keep moving by constantly tripping their feet.</p>
<p><i>Pretty Ugly</i>'s first single <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZwxre005PI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Just Vybe""</a> expressed the idea perfectly, its waterlogged tabla percussion sounding like living fish flipping fitfully on a frying pan while R&amp;B singer Fatima struggles valiantly to hold everything together. The valiant struggle is itself the charm, offering the tense thrill of riding so close to the edge of where everything really will fall apart. The balance of <i>Pretty Ugly </i>pushes further still: beats that stutter without cohering, woozy Moog-like synth runs, soulful vocalists carefully stepping around any melody which might turn into a hook. On the brief, sketchy R&amp;B of ""Why U Do"", diva AL catches her dude cheating on her in their bedroom, only (wait for it) <i>with another man</i>: It's an unexpectedly blunt thematic literalization of Smart's self-consciously subversive modus operandi.</p>
<p>Clearly, this is not a UK funky album. While <i>Pretty Ugly </i>boasts a few rolling grooves still with one foot in that camp (the by-turns menacing and sickly ""Polyphonic Dreams""; the stirring second half of ""Reach the Sun""), for the most part its slippery arrangements skid through an interzone between funky, R&amp;B, and techno. ""Broken beat,"" basically, and in fact the album strongly resembles DKD's similarly vocal-themed 2004 album <i>Future Rage</i>, leavened with liberal doses of Flying Lotus style fogginess. The resemblance hits hardest on the gorgeous R&amp;B of ""Fire Fly"", graceful despite its stunted, shuddering groove, while the sparkly, ruminative keyboard explorations of ""The Big 5ive"" capture the Stevie Wonder-at-the-Mos Eisley Cantina vibe that was always broken beat's favorite costume. The album's not entirely either/or, though: The title track offers a consummate (albeit forbidding) fusion of Smart's past and future, discordant synth chords and eerie, jazz-tinged vocals doing their best to pull the rollicking funky beat out of orbit.</p>
<p>Framing <i>Pretty Ugly </i>as a broken-beat album helps account for its pleasures, but can't entirely absolve its pitfalls, perhaps because much of what is true for funky remains true for broken beat, namely, that the flight into syncopation should not be heedless. The finest examples of broken beat-- best heard on mixes like Bugz in the Attic's <i>Fabriclive 12 </i>or Alex Attias' <i>Selector Series Vol. 1</i>-- may have reveled in jolting, rococo rhythmic patterns, but nonetheless always posited a through-line, a golden thread the dancer clings to in order to make sense of the madness. In the same way that funky dances <i>around </i>the ghost of house, you could discern in the best broken beat's melting pot of post-funk genres a kind of dancefloor <i>stock</i>, a basic core ingredient of compulsive groove.</p>
<p>Smart doesn't turn his back on this notion, but at every opportunity he renders his music's relationship to its source material so tenuous, so stretched under the weight of its contortions, that there is little for the dancer (or listener) to glean from his abstract shapes other than the mastery of abstraction itself. It's only on the widescreen balladry of album closer ""33rd Degree"", with its agile, momentum-building groove, that Smart allows his music to gesture toward the merely pretty. A momentary failure of nerve perhaps, but more moments like it would offer welcome succor amidst the crusade to uncover what prettiness conceals.</p></div>"|16377.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16377-pretty-ugly/|6.4|Tim Finney

From the raw punk-funk of early DFA Records to the more recent trend of stripped-down re-edits, bands and producers of the 2000s excised disco's gaudier, more extravagant traits-- diva vocals, symphonic sweeps of strings and brass-- in favor of grooves and attitude. But NYC disco-pop collective <a href=""http://www.phenomenalhandclapband.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Phenomenal Handclap Band</a> are swimming against the tide, indulging in disco's excesses and 70s lite-AM ambitions.</p>
<p>Their sophomore album's title, <i>Form &amp; Control</i>, immediately shows the band's strengths and their weakness: It's a smooth, utterly precise study of the formal elements that make disco and electro-pop tick, but with far too little of the body heat that actually gets that stuff going. Instead, the band delivers various pastiches of disco, electro-funk, and period-appropriate pop with an often frosty and detached air-- the sort of vibe that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2408-ladytron/"" target=""_blank"">Ladytron</a> pull off with greater charisma, fresher material, and far stronger songwriting.</p>
<p>It's not just the chilly tone that makes PHB's well-crafted grooves fail to ignite, though. It's also the way their songs feel overstuffed, or undecided. With eight people in the band, the temptation to give everybody some, to gild every rhythm with excess layers of vocal harmony and instrumental flourishes must be impossible to resist; the result is songs that don't breathe, disparate parts that rub up against each other and clash as often as they complement, and grooves that don't get the chance to develop to their fullest hypnotic potential.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the best tracks here are the simplest and most straightforward: the rubbery bassline and vampy chorus of ""The Right One"", the shushing disco beat and marimba/synth line of ""Give"", neither of which are lost in overly busy arrangements. Conversely, there's ""The Unknown Faces at Father James Park"" (even its title is overstuffed): The verse is one of the most appealing passages on the entire album, the band's female vocalists trading glassy background chants with a deadpan, staccato lead, but the song derails into a technically impressive but momentum-sapping harmonic chorus.</p>
<p>Either aspect alone could be stretched and variegated into a fine song, but crammed together they somehow stall. There's a disconnect, like a 5th Dimension or a Polyphonic Spree struggling to break out of the beat. (Another odd 70s touch: Several of the songs end by fading out on a refrain rather than resolving, which can have the effect of making them feel unfinished.)</p>
<p>The rift between disco grooves and hippie vocal harmonies plays out on the album level as well. About three-quarters of the way through, the record shifts from dance party to something else: we get the flowery blues funk of ""Afterglow"", the windy, wide-open guitar twang of ""All Cliches"", the light rock (and incongruous sitar) of ""Mirrors,"" and the wan vintage pop of ""The Attempt"". Throw the bombastic, heavy-thudding piano of the title track in here, too. These aren't exactly <i>good</i> songs, but they at least have a sense of purpose.</p>
<p>A good disco act makes a six-minute song feel like half that--or better, makes you want to hear it re-edited out to 10 minutes by some reel-to-reel DJ (that this happened with the best song of PHB's last album, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/13440-youll-disappear-prins-thomas-diskomiks/"" target=""_blank"">""You'll Disappear""</a>, proves that at least they have some decent beats in them). Hardly a song on <i>Form &amp; Control</i> goes substantially beyond the four-minute mark, and yet the whole album drags. Maybe the answer is to let those inner hippies out, and leave the dancefloor to someone else.</p></div>"|16385.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16385-phenomenal-handclap-band-form-control/|4.2|Eric Grandy

The songs on the project's latest, <i>Always</i>, would easily fit elsewhere in Jamie Stewart's disquieting catalogue. The music bounces from the shrill synths and howls of pro-choice anthem ""I Luv Abortion"" to the gentle whimper of the piano ballad ""The Oldness"", and it's all laced together with too-close-for-comfort lyrics like, ""Satan's cock/ Hell is hot,"" and, ""Your father was the first man inside of you."" Which is to say that the record functions as a well-executed sampler of the magnified pain and horror we've come to expect from this band. The difficulty for both casual and hardcore fans is that the receptors attuned to the Xiu Xiu experience have become desensitized, so that when a new album comes along, you have to ask yourself: Why should I even bother to listen to this? Why not let it fade into the ether and just revisit my favorite bits of <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8826-fabulous-muscles/"" target=""_blank"">Fabulous Muscles</a></i> or <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8821-knife-play/"" target=""_blank"">Knife Play</a></i>?</p>
<p>Fortunately, at the moments on <i>Always </i>when their most plainly brutal sonics are at their least effective, Xiu Xiu manage to find a fresh angle. One of the most alluring aspects of Xiu Xiu is their ability to spread consistently thorny lyrical content across a wide range of instrumental arrangements. The best songs on <i>Always</i> lean toward the poppier, breathier end of that range. It's not so jarring to hear Stewart sing about his brother's troubled domestic life, as he does on ""Joey's Song"", but it <i>is</i> jarring to hear him sing it over a lush, shoegaze-inspired synth-pop backing. The album is front-loaded with these inviting juxtapositions, where horrific lyrical imagery collides with rich instrumentation and melodies that scrape the underside of catchy.</p>
<p>The leftist blog ThinkProgress recently <a href=""http://thinkprogress.org/alyssa/2012/03/08/439370/xiu-xiu/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">called out</a> <i>Always</i>' ""I Luv Abortion"" for ""appropriating a woman's words and experiences... [as] some sort of proof of how cool and dark you are."" The music Stewart and his rotating cast of supporters make as Xiu Xiu is many things, but ""cool"" has never been one of them. Instead, his brand of darkness is painfully earnest, with a relentless decade's worth discomforting albums to prove it. Part of what makes Xiu Xiu refreshingly unfashionable is that this stuff is inimitable: bare-naked expressions of the pain tied to self-mutilation, military violence and everything between can't really be faked. And when you see Stewart’s influence trickle down to a fresh wave of artists, you know they must have forged a genuine connection to his music somewhere along the line.</p>
<p>When the musical elements line up just right on <i>Always</i>, as with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13193-beauty-towne/"" target=""_blank"">""Beauty Towne""</a>, a buoyant postscript to <i>Fabulous Muscles</i> highlight ""Clowne Towne"", it's hard not to dream about Xiu Xiu making a straightforward electro-pop record. (It could happen-- recall the Xiu Xiu <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/43073-listen-xiu-xiu-cover-rihanna/"" target=""_blank"">cover of Rihanna's ""Only Girl""</a>.) ""Clowne Towne"" paired impossibly hopeless ""no exit"" lyrics with a triumphant, breathy array of plucked strings, and ""Beauty Towne"" likewise takes a miserable theme and cuts it with an elegant melody, lending a feeling of redemption and hope.</p>
<p>The inspiration for ""Beauty Towne"" demonstrates how Stewart has guided and inspired a new generation of artists to explore difficult terrain. The single, he recently told <i>Spin</i>, is about some time he spent several years ago living in a ""rotted punk house"" with a group of people including Mike Hadreas, the Seattle singer-songwriter behind <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28685-perfume-genius/"" target=""_blank"">Perfume Genius</a>. ""Everyone in that house and the people who orbited it had overly enmeshed, dirty, and at times violent relationships,"" he said. ""All involved parties, to one degree or another, have remained a part of each other lives.""</p>
<p>The communal underpinnings of ""Beauty Towne"" seep nicely into the record elsewhere, too-- the jaunty, ""I-hate-waking-up-in-the-morning"" album highlight ""Honey-Suckle"" marks the first time someone besides Stewart (collaborator Angela Seo) wrote both the music and the lyrics for a Xiu Xiu song. Album opener ""Hi"" is a rare Xiu Xiu track in the second person that addresses a broad audience. ""If your curtain is closed/ Yet you are still standing behind it,"" Stewart sings. ""If you don't know what to say, say hi."" So long as there are people standing silently behind curtains, they'll need Stewart to sing for them, coaxing his fellow freaks away from the ledge.</p></div>"|16378.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16378-always/|7.3|Carrie Battan

Maybe the question is nothing more than warmed-over romanticism in your eyes, an abstract idea at best. For Jason DiEmilio, the Philadelphia-based founder, leader, and much of the time sole member of the <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/azusaplane"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Azusa Plane</a>, perhaps it was not.</p>
<p>Not when the guitar-derived sounds he made and released over six years of work from 1995 to 2001 were the sounds that later made him unable to perform any more, to seek refuge in close friendships and movies, to desperately hope for a medical solution to the double impact of tinnitus and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperacusis"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span class=""s1"">hyperacusis</span></a> that afflicted him as a result. Not when he felt he had no further relief or hope and took his own life in late 2006, severed from the artistic world he had taken so much joy in because it could only bring him horrific, indescribable, literally inescapable pain.</p>
<p>Not when the exultation, the sheer release, and beautiful joy in the sounds of feedback and drone and extremity was that powerful, not when he was remembered by so many as someone driven by his passions and dreams and humor and good spirit, as the liner notes in this new compilation on the Rocket Girl label all unfailingly, one after another, point out. Everything said is said with a sense of loss, and everything you hear on <i>Where the Sands Turn to Gold</i> is something that is heard two ways, as the expression of intense feeling thrillingly captured and as the mark of personal destruction.</p>
<p>Try, if you can, to separate context from the sounds, that sense of understandably automatic sympathy, and <i>Where the Sands Turn to Gold</i> almost leaves one breathless. DiEmilio feels like a prophet almost without honor now, somebody who, years before the time of artists releasing endless amounts of music on 20-copy runs or streaming mixtapes, did just that as a matter of purpose. Besides three formal studio CDs and a live collection, his songs would appear on compilations, split EPs, and cassettes across the world, seemingly on almost every continent. In those terms, Azusa Plane was almost a constant one-way conversation, something which the relative rarity of their live shows outside Philadelphia balanced out.</p>
<p>Those songs appear here two ways-- a complete mp3 collection of every one of those lost tracks and two CDs of full audio files cherry-picking from that massive overview, from the B-side of his debut single onward. The mp3 collection itself comes on a DVD containing a video of one of those live shows, the power-trio incarnation of the band in full raucous rapture, but that simply can't be seen as what the band was fully like, not when there was so much going on with just DiEmilio's work on his own, an argument that was simple but clear: ""You can just have an electric guitar and you can create worlds, individual worlds, distinct ones. And I'm going to take you there.""</p>
<p>Retrospection and celebration should not mean oversimplification. You can hear the roots and contemporaries throughout the collection; Azusa Plane was not a case of some lost soul rewriting the rulebook, but someone helping to expand the palette, making his own case to be taken as seriously as someone like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/search/?query=Loren+Connors"" target=""_blank"">Loren Connors</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2044-keiji-haino/"" target=""_blank"">Keiji Haino</a>, maybe not as extreme but no less adventurous, a fan with a sly sense of humor as well as talent. On ""Every Wave Has Its Own Integrity"" is the exaltation and beauty of mid-1980s Cocteau Twins with rougher edges; throughout the lengthy ""Two Views of the New Zealand Landscape"" is a clear nod to that country's own towering avatar of solo electric guitar, Roy Montgomery; on ""This is Not Spacerock"", frazzled static and lovely reverb sum up the appeal of Flying Saucer Attack in four minutes. Song titles reference members of the Velvet Underground and Sebadoh, the Who album titles, the Mountain Goats, and much more.</p>
<p>Yet for all the contexts, what mattered was the ditching of them. Consider the cover art of <i>Where the Sands Turn to Gold</i>, an obvious reference to the cover of the Smiths' <i>The Queen is Dead</i>. As the liner notes indicate, DiEmilio's greatest musical passions included the Smiths as well as Bruce Springsteen-- and think of how many bands now talk of the two in the same breath, and how many of them just want to <i>be</i> either of them or some other well-meaning combination together, and how many fail to be nothing more than that derivative well-meaning combination, a photocopy, a pixellated video clip. The work of Azusa Plane argues here, throughout, not for recreation but creation, to resist musical cowardice, to acknowledge where you came from but to never, ever stop within the comfort zone.</p>
<p>Combine <i>Where the Sands</i> with his three formally released albums, as well as a live collection, and the full portrait is one of power and delicacy and an escape from the everyday. Enjoy <i>Where the Sands</i> on its own, and the feeling is still similar, a great introduction even in its comprehensiveness, something that could have been simply the start of something more instead of a summary. Nobody would have wanted DiEmilio to suffer the fate he did, the horrible turning point, the final conclusion. <i>Where the Sands Turn to Gold</i> is a labor of love and loss, sometimes hard to appreciate in its own right through the sense of cruel catharsis. But damn, there's some fine music here, and that is reason enough to listen, and reflect, and remember.</p></div>"|16379.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16379-where-the-sands-turn-to-gold/|8.5|Ned Raggett

After all, when a group debuts with a single that's able to encapsulate everything great about the ever-widening hardcore/metal nexus-- the grandeur of Isis, the precision of Dillinger Escape Plan, the fury and power of a lot of other folks-- and inject it with the sort of unavoidable catchiness that's helped bring groups like Torche and Kylesa to wider audiences, one would hope that when an album arrives the trick is turned as often as possible. Instead, at just under 25 minutes, Primitive Weapons' first non-single recording barely qualifies as a full-length.</p>
<p>Primitive Weapons opted to play hard-to-get, waiting a full year between dropping their bombshell of a single and putting out anything else. And not only is <i>The Shadow Gallery </i>on the short side, it doesn't include anything from that debut single. Given the group's non-Weapons obligations-- <a href=""http://www.thelmagazine.com/TheMeasure/archives/2012/02/07/the-double-life-qanda-justin-scurti-saint-vitus-ownerprimitive-weapons-guitaristphotographer"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Justin Scurti</a>, for example, moonlights as a music photographer and guitar tech, plays in another band (I Hate Our Freedom), and co-owns Greenpoint's metal-friendly Saint Vitus Bar with guitarist <span class=""st"">Arthur Shepherd</span> (and a non-Weapon)-- the brevity of the album is understandable. The more likely explanation, though, is that Primitive Weapons know a little of a good thing goes a long way, and that their full-volume maximum-effort music straddles a delicate line between exhilarating and exhausting. Holding back on the song front might irk fans that want all the Primitive Weapons they can handle, but better to leave them wanting more than to wear out a welcome.</p>
<p>Working with producer Dean Baltulonis, this already fast and furious quintet gains an extra bit of strength and speed, which allows it to gleefully beat the listener senseless on every possible front, and in every possible fashion.  Mid-tempo tracks like ""Good Hunting"" and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13049-quitters-anthem/"" target=""_blank"">""Quitters Anthem""</a> are the primary currency here, but the group's attempt to get down in the sludge, albeit briefly, on ""Big Chief"" and ""Black Funds"", works just as well as the slightly higher-octane moments.</p>
<p>It helps that Primitive Weapons are willing to allow for slight deviations in their air-tight formula, such as the drumline-style intro for ""Oath"", or the nearly nü-metal-like climax of ""The Death of Boredom"". That creative openness extends to frontman David Castillo; while he works just fine when he's in scream-for-your-life mode, <i>Gallery</i> allows him exhibit the same sort of melodic flexibility as Dillinger Escape Plan's Greg Puciato, or metal fusion godfather Mike Patton.  These minor flourishes might become full-blown digressions that help make future Primitive Weapons releases a more varied experience.  But given that the one-note <i>The Shadow Gallery</i> hits so strong and so true, staying this particular course for a little while longer shouldn't bother anyone.</p>

The band came together after Stephanie Chan, Kate Hall, and Mark Greshowak became ex-pats of recently defunct punk bands (Finally Punk, Mika Miko, and Talbot Tagora respectively). They started the group while they were roommates in an L.A.-area house, which means they were making music together in a living room. The disconnect between their origin and <i>Noctiluca</i> is twofold. One: This is a big, ambitious album, and it's hard to imagine it played in any living room. Two: Despite their past allegiances, it'd be irresponsible to tag them as a punk band. They're far from it, actually.</p>
<p><i>Noctiluca</i> is an album teeming with lush, relaxed, jangling atmosphere. Part of the blame for that goes to Pete Lyman, who mastered it. Given the man's credentials, which includes production and mastering on releases by No Age, Abe Vigoda, Male Bonding, and Nite Jewel, it seems feasible that he's at least partially responsible for <i>Noctiluca</i>'s expansive nature. But that's not to take credit away from the band, whose echoing guitars and on-point percussion make the record. Chan's voice definitely achieves a Siouxsie Sioux boldness, but more often, she adapts to the tone of each song, like her hushed urgency on ""Red Gold"". And the harmonies and vocal tinges add to the atmosphere, like the solitary, high-pitched ""ooo"" that leads into ""Lonely Palm"".</p>
<p>Given that each member of Dunes came from a substantially noisier band (except maybe Talbot Tagora, which had a comparable noise level), it's not as much of a surprise that Chan's vocals are occasionally as loud as the guitar mix. But the sometimes unintelligible vocals are a missed opportunity; the lyrics are a definite highlight. They come out in these beautiful fragments, half-thoughts that are easy to miss and that mold together with the next line. Here's an example from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13170-vertical-walk/"" target=""_blank"">""Vertical Walk""</a>: ""Softly gliding barefoot/ Follow my friends from the past and present/ Abruptly ends/ Losing the pieces to make everything come into place."" Their phrasing is like that for the majority of the album, and Chan never lingers on a line for too long. She sings everything casually, almost making each moment an afterthought. Those lines pile up after 40 minutes, so the album unfolds more and more with each careful listen.</p>
<p>Some songs, however, don't lend themselves to repeat listens. Stuff like the more repetitive ""Shadow"", despite the band's consistently solid guitar sound, becomes unbearably repetitive after a few plays. And it's a good effort to add some sonic variety to the album, but the introduction of ""Cameron"", which starts with a deep, buzzing sound, feels tacked-on for that specific purpose. For the most part, they do a good job of varying the tone of the album by subtly shifting the mood, but they consistently toe the line of being samey. ""Living Comfortably"" and ""Tied Together"" are separated by five tracks, but they're pretty similar in tempo and tone.</p>
<p>There's a moment of unfiltered glee about 18 seconds into ""Falling"" that's pushed in the background. The words ""falling in love"" are airily sung behind a glowing, echoing guitar flourish. There are so many details like that throughout <i>Noctiluca</i>-- little moments that live beneath the album's glowing surface. Those little things, the half-sentences and the one-syllable vocal harmonies, make the big picture worth exploring. It's an album that's welcoming and beautiful; it makes sense that <a href=""http://larecord.com/interviews/2010/07/29/dunes-i-don%E2%80%99t-want-to-create-something-that%E2%80%99s-for-sale"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">their neighbors were fans</a>.</p></div>"|16386.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16386-dunes-noctiluca/|7.6|Evan Minsker

It looks like an outtake from <i>Caligula</i>, showing a world drenched in honey and other viscous liquids and engulfed in gaudy vulgarity. The song, like some put-through-the-dryer version of Led Zeppelin's ""D'yer Mak'er"", hops with a jovial reggae skip and gobbles up a variety of 1970s tropes (classic rock, disco, post-punk, others) before regurgitating them in a fashionably chewed-up, half-digested mass of musical references. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28716-ariel-pinks-haunted-graffiti/"" target=""_blank"">Ariel Pink</a> with a French-Canadian sneer?</p>
<p>Yes, this is record-collector rock for 2012, with all the flitting allegiances, stylistic dalliances, and short attention spans that come with the post-Tumblr world. It's a strange, lo-fi space where synths strain to possess color and the drum machines drag and sigh with VHS vapor trails: It all sounds a little dreamlike, but the rough textures keep it from blurring together too much. Aside from noodling synths and heavily affected guitars, the group's most distinctive element is its anonymous vocalists. The female singer bleats in a childlike speak-sing that resembles the Velvet Underground's Mo Tucker, while the lead dude sounds like a post-punk approximation of late-seventies David Bowie and Iggy Pop. Their voices aren't particularly <i>strong</i>, but they can work when allowed to carry a decent melody, as on ""In Decay"". The wonderful synth motifs on ""Cold Sunday"", on the other hand, are dragged down by the apathetic singing and god-awful attempt at rapping.</p>
<p>Bizarre attempts at hip-hop pastiche aside, Phédre often strike a rockabilly and doo-wop vein that sounds more than a little like a chill/goth update on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/853-the-cramps/"" target=""_blank"">the Cramps</a>. And they're most comfortable in an explicitly retro role: ""Ode to the Swinger"" is a deadpan surf-rock jam where the vocalists' apparent boredom works in their favor, and the doo-wop ebb-and-flow of ""Love Ablaze"" is delectably catchy, undercut by what sounds like a tortured organ (think ""White Light/White Heat""). As a whole, Phédre is about contrast-- pretty melodies sung in squawks, propulsive rhythms that never quite move anywhere, grandiosity rendered in 256 colors-- which, over the course of a full record, leads to a decidedly uneven listen. <i>Phédre</i> is the sound of a band trying to do too many things at once in too short of a time. They're clearly a playful bunch and have a melodic knack to match their visual aesthetic. Now they just need to sit down and flesh out the music some more.</p></div>"|16389.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16389-phedre/|6.7|Andrew Ryce

For a presumably rich man, he keeps busy. He also understands the value of what I like to call the ""container."" The container is a set of limitations, an acknowledgement that on any given project there's no feasible way to have it all, and attempting to have it all is one of the first steps to failure. This is why the idea of ""fusion"" food may seem exhausting to you, or why art that professes to ""defy genre"" tends to end up ""sucking.""</p>
<p>Blur's most celebrated album, <i>Parklife</i>, was basically a series of vignettes written in different styles, and Albarn's career since has taken the same tack on an album-to-album and band-to-band scale: The sneaker-store electro of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1767-gorillaz/"" target=""_blank"">Gorillaz</a>, the African blues of <i>Mali Music</i>, the moody dub-folk of <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27585-the-good-the-bad-the-queen/"" target=""_blank"">The Good, the Bad &amp; the Queen</a></i>. He's worked on four film soundtracks and a couple of operas. His approach to his art has been more like a film director's than a musician's, marked by collaboration, variety, and the attitude that it's the overall trajectory of his career-- rather than any one album-- that will define him.</p>
<p>The core of <i>Rocket Juice</i>-- an album of West African-style funk and psychedelia-- is Albarn, former <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2346-fela-kuti/"" target=""_blank"">Fela Kuti</a> drummer Tony Allen, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3538-red-hot-chili-peppers/"" target=""_blank"">Red Hot Chili Peppers</a> bassist Flea. As someone who has always appreciated RHCP's clean sound as temporary relief from the muddy, red-state testicle rock generally favored by my gym's sound system, Flea's involvement here is a plus. Like Allen, he is a precise, powerful player but also a nimble one, and it's their back-and-forth that defines the album's feel: Light, skipping, controlled, but slightly off-balance, the sound of a wind-up toy tottering along the sidewalk.</p>
<p>Twelve of <i>RJ</i>'s 18 tracks are under three minutes long, and most function as groove capsules, sketches, ditties, many of them anchored by funny sound effects and synthesizer noises, many without a central lyric or melody. While bands are free to break the mold whenever they like, my sense is that there's an internal friction between this group's loose, jammy approach and the lengths of the tracks, which don't really have time to work up to anything. Parts of the album feel like a continuous segue with no point of arrival. There are exceptions. Erykah Badu guests on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13236-hey-shooter/"" target=""_blank"">""Hey Shooter""</a>, and Albarn enlists a handful of African rappers and singers, including a few from the <a href=""http://www.africaexpress.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Africa Express</a> exchange program: Ghana's M.anifest and M3nsa, and Mali's Fatoumata Diawara. But <i>RJ</i> is, as far as I can tell, designed to sound loose and off-the-cuff, sort of like a party-- and like a party, it's more concerned with collective atmosphere than any single performance. The result is that the lesser-known performers here end up sounding more like placeholders than specific people: male rapper, female crooner.</p>
<p>It's when Albarn sings that the album seems to break its own mold. Despite the variety of styles he's worked in over the years, there is an easy 80-minute CD-R waiting to be made of pretty, dog-eared, rainy-day songs like ""Poison"", starting with <i>Parklife</i>'s <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6BaZrbWKVg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Badhead""</a>, moving through <i>The Great Escape</i>'s <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeDsYvsFeO0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Yuko and Hiro""</a>, and stopping at just about every one of his projects up through Gorillaz's 2010 single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11849-on-melancholy-hill/"" target=""_blank"">""On Melancholy Hill""</a>. What to make of songs like ""Poison"" in this context, though, I'm not sure: It's one of the album's more singular, coherent moments, but it's also when <i>RJ</i>'s container starts to feel leaky.</p>
<p><i>RJ</i> takes its cues from Fela Kuti, Funkadelic, Sun Ra, and scads of African artists-- most of them from Nigeria, Ghana, and other countries on the western coast-- compiled or reissued over the past 15 years. Good. Okay then-- the album knows what it's doing. But as someone who confesses to having a hard time getting through hour after hour of open-ended funk jams, someone who has always been suspicious of the idea that I need to listen more patiently to every second of every Sun Ra or Funkadelic or Fela album in order to really feel the full cosmic power of the grooves, <i>Rocket Juice</i> <i>&amp; the Moon</i> feels like a decent record, but an unfocused, meandering one-- an album, ironically, contained by its lack of containers.</p></div>"|16365.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16365-rocket-juice-the-moon/|6.1|Mike Powell

His aesthetic is well-defined-- he is the chillest of chill stoners, with a flow that twists and tangles organically like slowly released weed smoke-- and it has also proved to be at least somewhat influential (his old pal <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28233-wiz-khalifa/"" target=""_blank"">Wiz Khalifa</a> has ridden it and his own pop instincts to great fame). But you can see where Curren$y would feel the need to shake things up a bit, to momentarily snap himself out of a style that is so perpetually laid back. His intentions may have been good, but the resulting music is so jarringly out of step with what has proven to be a consistently winning formula that you almost wish someone had sued Dame Dash to prevent its release.</p>
<p>So, what good can be said about the album? Well, its nine tracks span just over 19 minutes, which is short even by Curren$y's standards. Along with that merciful bit of self-editing, there's also nothing really wrong with his rapping, which is only dragged down by the vehicle he's using to deliver it. But that's about it, as nothing here is replayable after the first listen unless you want to confirm that the album is as bad and misguided as it comes off as at first blush. There are moments where you can squint and almost see where it could have worked (like on ""Not So Much"", which approximates decent bar-room blues), but those glimpses are more than overwhelmed by the times where it very clearly doesn't (pick anything else).</p>
<p>Maybe the best news is that Curren$y almost certainly had little desire for the public to hear this. He wrapped the recording close to two years ago, and its release date was then pushed back 11 months to the middle of last February. Maybe most telling is that he just so happened to drop a short mixtape with Styles P two weeks after <i>Muscle Car Chronicles </i>walked the plank. That tape, like Curren$y's projects with producers Ski Beatz and the Alchemist, shows how good he is at picking collaborators that help build and slowly expand his aesthetic. <i>Muscle Car Chronicles</i>, on the other hand, quite blatantly and shockingly does not.</p></div>"|16384.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16384-muscle-car-chronicles/|3.8|Jordan Sargent

I can sympathize. The mini-LP is seeing distrubution via 100% Silk (a subsidiary of the Los Angeles-based experimental label Not Not Fun), an imprint that's coined repute on a strain of American dance music that, along with artists like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28242-blondes/"" target=""_blank"">Blondes</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27880-teengirl-fantasy/"" target=""_blank"">Teengirl Fantasy</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29673-miracles-club/"" target=""_blank"">Miracles Club</a>, has been unfortunately tagged by some as ""hipster house."" Many of the label's releases showcase distanced takes on house and techno with varying fidelity. The aesthetic seems more incidental than intentional-- remember, the people making this stuff are largely DIY experimental musicians, working on shoestring budgets-- but regardless, it's easy to see why some dance purists treat this movement with light derision. After all, what good is club music if the music itself sounds like it's being played in a neighboring room?</p>
<p><i>Kingdoms</i> is something of an aberration in the label's catalog thus far, then-- both in that it doesn't sound like dance music filtered through a giant paper cone, and in that the person that made this music is involved with honest-to-god Pop Music. Norris has been making music on his own since he was 14 years old, but for the last few years he's been playing keyboards and handling other assorted live duties for glossy nü-wave upstarts <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27831-la-roux/"" target=""_blank"">La Roux</a>. My favorite song from La Roux's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13181-la-roux/"" target=""_blank"">2009 self-titled debut</a> is <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7IGE58IPgo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I'm Not Your Toy""</a>, a spazzy piece of melodic tartness with synths that sound brittle and chintzy-- in other words, slow the tempo and run it through a few filters, and you just might end up with something that would sound perfectly at home on a 100% Silk release.</p>
<p>There's nothing brittle or distanced about <i>Kingdoms</i>, though-- quite the opposite, in fact. This is lush, deep house music, the kind of thump-thump that rubs up against your eardrums without giving you a headache (if the insistent vocal sample in opener <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13017-jack-rollin/"" target=""_blank"">""Jack Rollin'""</a> makes you reach for the Excedrin, though, it's understandable). Even the fuzziest elements-- a euphoric shout buried in the mix of ""Theo"", the piping clatter of tones that open ""I Need U""-- carry a certain crisp clarity to them, making for a record that sounds as expensive as the mondo-diamond being contemplated by the woman on the release's cover art.</p>
<p>Ironically, despite his Coachella-tent pedigree, gear fetishists would most likely consider Norris' tools used for <i>Kingdoms</i> to be ""quaint"": a lone synthesizer (a Yamaha DX7), and a seven-year-old laptop. Given what he's working with here, then, the range of sonic emotions on display is impressive, switching from hard-hitting ""going out"" fare (""Theo"", ""Jack Rollin'"") to moody, luxurious ""staying in"" slow-burners (""I Need U"", ""One Night""). Almost every song contains some sort of vocal sample, rippling through the album's steady 4/4 waters; a few of them-- the 4 a.m. highlight <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13240-say-something/"" target=""_blank"">""Say Something""</a>, especially-- transcend functionality and become burrowed earworms in their own right.</p>
<p><i>Kingdoms</i>' chocolate-and-peanut-butter combo-- smooth-as-silk house cuts with evocative vocals ping-ponging within the expansive space-- has led at least one person I know to draw a comparison between this record and Finnish producer Sasu Ripatti's landmark work as Luomo, 2000's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4929-vocalcity/"" target=""_blank"">Vocalcity</a></i>. On a surface level, the comparison's apt, but what sets Norris' work back when compared to those who make ""house music proper"" is its lack of scope and pure playfulness, a detriment that possibly results from his own technological limitations. There are a lot of excellent ideas on <i>Kingdoms</i>-- but that's all they are in the end, really, a group of singular ideas and not much more. Norris' debut effort is confident in its own right, and its comfort-food enjoyability hardly wears after the hundredth spin. Hopefully, he'll feel more of an urge to color outside the lines next time around.</p></div>"|16381.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16381-kingdoms/|7.5|Larry Fitzmaurice

Manic and jostling, it flings a series of genres-- grime! crunk! electro! dub reggae! post-punk!-- in front of you like so many disorienting flashbulb pops. <i>Father Creeper</i>, his second full-length and his first for Sub Pop, is too frantic to find a groove, attempting to make a virtue of its messiness instead. But it is a wearying listen, overcrowded and too loud and too harsh, and to engage actively with it is to feel your knuckles whiten with effort. It feels like being trapped at a loud party where too many interesting people are talking over each other at once.</p>
<p>It's a shame, because on paper, Mathambo is the kind of musician we say we all want-- fearlessly global, polyglot, making dance music fit for any country's floor. You want to root for him. And taken in isolation, there are lovely, unlikely sounds bleeding out all over the record: the darting-hummingbird synths that flit through ""Venison Fingers"", the clean-toned high-life guitar that sparkles on ""Dog to Bone"". The single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13055-let-them-talk/"" target=""_blank"">""Let Them Talk""</a> has a stiffly strutting live-band groove that recalls Franz Ferdinand. But nothing coheres, because nothing is allowed to stick around for more than 16 frantic seconds or so. The record's directive seems to be ""bum-rush the palette""; by the time women start singing ""yeah, we can work"" in an ersatz German-cabaret accent late in the record (""We Can Work""), you're not sure just what the hell is going on, and unconvinced Mathambo knows better.</p>
<p>It doesn't help that Mathambo himself is something of a cipher. His voice is a dry yelp, one without much expressive range, so even when he delivers a vivid polemic about the blood diamond trade on ""Put Some Red on It"" (""Papa head full of precious stones and oil well/ His greedy fingers dig for booga-booga him can sell/ Ashy old shit, crusty nasty old food/ Learn the slick-tongue trick from the mission school""), you never feel the heat of his indignation. He zips over every coverable inch of his album, but doesn't seem to leave a single mark on it. Lyrically, ""We Can Work"" contains <i>Father Creeper</i>'s clearest and most accessible plea: ""I guess I was raised to resent punching the clock,"" Mathambo says, as he weaves stories about his own shiftlessness around anecdotes about his Uncle Ciba, who never returned from ""his never-ending lunch break,"" and his mother, who was ""crushed by the weight of the rock."" In the song, Mathambo himself is puking at a bar, and the wry moment is one of few that he owns.</p></div>"|16382.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16382-spoek-mathambo-father-creeper/|5.7|Jayson Greene

It's probably safe to assume Chicagoan Aaron Allieta and Brooklynite Jimmy Giannopoulos picked the name <a href=""http://www.prettygooddancemoves.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pretty Good Dance Moves</a> to invoke a self-deprecating, relatable persona-- two likable guys who make dance music, but aw heck, they're just OK at dancing. Regardless of intent, ""pretty good"" is a qualifier that begs to be disproved. In order to overcome that tag of mediocrity, they've got to make a bold statement, assert themselves, or leave some kind of mark. They've got to make us feel <i>something</i>.</p>
<p>And the context clues suggest that there's something lively in the album's eight tracks. Just based on the album title, cover art, and ""electronic"" genre tagging alone, this looks like a party record. Naming their album <i>Limo</i>? Splattering their band's name on a black surface in DayGlo pink? Come on. This thing screams rave. Plus, some of their older tracks, like 2009's ""Leave Me Alone"" and 2008's ""Demon Dancing"", had movement and life.</p>
<p>But here's the thing about <i>Limo</i>: It's eight songs, called ""movements"", that bleed into one another and never exactly <i>move</i>. <a href=""http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-02-23/entertainment/ct-ott-0224-pretty-good-dance-moves-20120223_1_long-distance-collaboration-songs-sabina-sciubba"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">According to Allietta</a>, they set out to record ""background music,"" something ""chilled out."" And if that's what this album was-- unassuming music that could live in the background-- that might be OK. At the start, it sounds like they're going to fulfill that promise by opening with a quiet, slow burn. But it's not exactly as clear-cut as that. Shortly after the first movement, they introduce loud, squelchy, 8-bit synth lines, which are entirely tacky and bulldoze any calm the album was developing. By ""Movement 4"", they introduce horns and attempt a menacing tone. It's one of the first bold moves they make, but as with the rest of these ""bold"" elements on the album (the prominent synths, the occasional heavy beat), they don't springboard off of it with anything else. It's the same uninteresting riff repeated for two minutes, and then they go back to being quiet.</p>
<p>The best decision they made in making <i>Limo</i> was getting <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/593-brazilian-girls/"">Brazilian Girl</a> Sabina Sciubba on vocals. Her voice is a very welcome change of pace. She's got some breathy whispering strung throughout the album, which matches the band's bland movements, but her real stand-out performance comes in the album's final two minutes, where her sultry tone serves as a great closer. But despite its beauty, it's a reminder for how the rest of the album could've used more moments like that last one-- something prominently beautiful or bold or interesting that rises above everything else.</p>
<p>From movement to movement, it's unclear what they're aiming for. Is it incidental ambience or light dance music? It's hard to care either way, really, because of how damn monotonous most of these songs are. Yes, it's an album of movements-- one that flows smoothly from piece to piece-- so they get an A+ for sequencing. But isn't there something to latch onto? Could the stakes be any lower? As dance music, and as atmospheric incidental music, it doesn't quite reach ""pretty good."" Ultimately, it would be far more interesting to hear these guys fall on their faces while aiming for something ballsy, big, and dramatic. Instead, we get this: an unvarying, unmoving, 30-minute glob of mediocrity.</p></div>"|16383.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16383-pretty-good-dance-moves-limo/|4.7|Evan Minsker

Back in the early 2000s, during the heyday of McSweeney's and Wes Anderson, the precociously literary folk-pop of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2241-castaways-and-cutouts/"" target=""_blank""><i>Castaways and Cutouts</i></a> sounded fresh and playful, and in 2006 <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9472-the-crane-wife/"" target=""_blank"">The Crane Wife</a></i> suggested they had made the transition from Pac NW indie to a major label with all their charms and pretensions intact. But their ambitions got the better of them on <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12842-the-hazards-of-love/"" target=""_blank"">The Hazards of Love</a></i>, a would-be prog-folk opus that emphasized a heady conceptual framework over strong pop hooks. They overcorrected with last year's follow-up, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15000-the-king-is-dead/"" target=""_blank"">The King Is Dead</a></i>, which once again favored standalone songs but strained for Americana respectability.</p>
<p>That trajectory has proven strangely discouraging, as the band's concerns have shifted subtly but constantly across genres. Arriving at a point in their career when most bands have a firm grasp of what works and what doesn't, the Decemberists sound like they're still figuring things out. That keeps them loose and agile, but it means they haven't sounded settled in half a decade or so. This makes <i>We All Raise Our Voices to the Air</i> much more intriguing than most double live albums-- and of course it would be a double live album-- because it sets all their heady concepts, genre nods, and oddball experiments side by side. Surprisingly, they all gel fairly well, revealing not much distance between the early SoCal pop of ""Oceanside"", the tongue-in-cheek valedictory of ""I Was Meant for the Stage"", and the dress-up roots rock of ""June Hymn"". The setlist is heavy on their early KRS days, when their albums weren't saddled with overarching narratives or genre themes. Of the 20 tracks, 12 predate <i>The Hazards of Love</i>, but even later albums are represented here by judiciously chosen tracks that emphasize sturdy hooks over witty lyrics.</p>
<p>There is a nostalgic kick to hearing ""Leslie Anne Levine"" and ""Oceanside"" in this live setting, with Chris Funk adding flourishes of weepy pedal steel, and damned if all three parts of ""The Crane Wife"" (which were separated in the tracklist to the 2006 album) don't sound newly compelling as one 16-minute story-song showstopper. It may be the most naturalistic marriage of lyrics and music the Decemberists have yet devised: Colin Meloy may be too often dismissed as a winking actor, but there's an eloquent, even dignified melancholy to his lyrics and melodies, which are bolstered by the band's sensitive accompaniment. Drummer John Moen even comes across as a protagonist, stitching the song together rhythmically and propelling it along its narrative arc. Only the proggy keyboard riffs break the spell. They might as well be in quote marks.</p>
<p><i>We All Raise Our Voices to the Air</i> sounds less like a tour document than a greatest hits, struggling to sum up the band's career and find some new direction forward. A notorious track like ""The Mariner's Revenge Song"" doesn't sound quite as endearingly goofy in 2012 as it may have in the 2000s, as the historical moment for indie rock sea shanties and chimbley sweep ditties is long over. At 12 minutes, the revenge doesn't come swiftly enough, but a live album may be the perfect medium for such a back-catalog novelty, as the roar of applause gives it the heft of a fan favorite. In general, however, the setlist is well calibrated to emphasize Meloy's facility with sweeping pop melodies, his clever rhyme schemes that I'd argue rival <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2643-the-magnetic-fields/"" target=""_blank"">Stephin Merritt</a>'s, and the band's range and agility in soundtracking his storybook songs. This version of ""Billy Liar"" underscores the march-pop quality of the melody before breaking down into a delirious audience sing-along, and the band injects ""The Soldiering Life"" with an appropriate triumphalism that plays to its homoerotic rather than its military themes. The Decemberists do well to approach such serious subjects as war, violence, and corruption through the scrim of narrative-- the more unlikely the better-- but whenever they tackle the topical head-on, they sound wholly out of their element. This is why ""This Is Why We Fight"" will never carry the outrage and impact of ""Calamity Song"", which arrives at its anti-war subject via David Foster Wallace.</p>
<p>That points to the central contradiction of the Decemberists: Their literary proclivities might be unbearable if they weren't having so much fun with them, but too much fun produces some of their most unbearable moments. In that regard, a Decemberists live album is better than a Decemberists live DVD. They have notoriously extended their drama-club antics to their rock-club setlists, often climbing on each others' shoulders to re-enact famous battles in the middle of the audience. It comes across as too precocious, too juvenile-- not like a young-adult novel but more like a bunch of kids hanging around the school theater long after they've graduated. Such shenanigans were reportedly muted during the <i>King Is Dead</i> tour, but judging from Meloy's banter on ""Dracula's Daughter/O Valencia!"" and ""The Infanta"", that playacting remains very much a part of their set. Still, it's hard to begrudge them their recent success, even if this album suggests that aspects of their schtick played better in cramped clubs than it does at the top of the charts. On these songs they sound like a band that outlived its moment but is working hard to make another for itself.</p></div>"|16373.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16373-we-all-raise-our-voices-to-the-air-live-songs-411-811/|6.9|Stephen M.

He threw every trick in his playbook out there, and even if he got tripped up by the rigors of a superhuman album-a-month pace that took nearly two years to wrap up, the resulting 12-part body of work is so intimidating that it's bound to raise the kind of cultist cachet usually reserved for Grateful Dead or Sun Ra bootlegs. It's a project for the diehards-- the kind of people who share Madlib's rarefied enthusiasm for hip-hop as zooted prog laced with acrid weirdo comedy-- and it's that particular segment of undying dedication that a baker's-dozenth entry feels aimed at. A listener sticks with something like this for so long, they'll feel like they've earned a little extra, even if the phrase ""for fans only"" threatens to come to mind for folks who distractedly tuned out somewhere around <i>#8: Advanced Jazz </i>and are wondering what else could be said with a thirteenth installment.</p>
<p>Then again, if the faithful stuck around all the way up to <i>#12: Raw Medicine</i>, then <i>#13: Black Tape </i>might seem a bit superfluous, too. Like the bookend of the original dozen, <i>Black Tape </i>fuses rap a cappellas to Madlib's own hazy, no-fi dub-of-a-dub aesthetic. And even more so than <i>Raw Medicine</i>, it does so in a way that's intent on showing you all the seams and bumping listeners out of sync, jostling from track to track through a series of hastily edited <i>in medias res </i>jump cuts and snapping ears out of focus. At its best, there are some well-timed abrupt little starts-- the way Jadakiss' cackle at the beginning of his verse on <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMSY3zfLxRA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ghostface's ""Run""</a> just jumps out of the firmament early on is a fun jolt-- but there are enough sudden splices, truncated lines, and inexplicable mid-verse slow fadeouts that it feels like the actual polar opposite of a mix. What the hell do you call this? An interrupttape?</p>
<p>Without those distractions,<i> Black Tape </i>would be a solid listen. The backing tracks are the usual engagingly odd prog/fusion/psych obscuro stuff Madlib keeps pushing out toward the constantly expanding limits of what you can nod your head to. And the interstitial comedy-record stuff doesn't intrude too heavily, thematically disconnected as it is (though the ""Beverly Hills Blues Festival"" bit he used on <i>Raw Medicine</i> gets an encore here). But the choice of a cappellas, most of which fall into a general 1999-2004 timeframe, feels undermined by the irreverence. They seem deliberately picked out to evoke a very specific moment for hardcore hip-hop, best summarized in the verse from Blaq Poet's 2003 B-side ""A Message from Poet"" where the Screwball vet knits his brow over all the beef-for-beef's-sake running through the airwaves (""…and the whole Roc-A-Fella wanna get at Jaz-O!""). It's a solid selection of pivotal moments (""Nas Is Like""; ""Get By""; ""What Up Gangsta"") and deep cuts (""Nothin' Lesser"" from the UN, the group that gave us Roc Marciano; Eminem's still-brilliant 1999 Rawkus one-off ""Any Man"").</p>
<p>Some of the tracks are done justice through this recontextualization. Draining the intensity from the original beat for ""Run"" for a more suspenseful, loping drone draws out the focused resilience in Jada's voice that makes the lines about Timbs-as-Airs and asthma worries feel vicariously breath-stealing. And lifting Pharoahe Monch out of the blues-gone-g-funk of ""Fuck You"" for a fast-forward panic-attack pseudo-raga turns him from wiseass Denzel stand-in to a flat-out diabolical lunatic. Others feel like they got the rug pulled out from under them just when they were going from good to astounding; there's an obscure Redman verse filthy enough to put you off your eggnog that gets decapitated mid-bar at about the precise moment you know you want to hear more of it. On top of all that, the apparent Bush's-first-term flashback aspect is prominent enough to feel like an intended theme, but is undercut by the presence of a couple of remixes of some good but anachronistic recent Strong Arm Steady tracks. <i>Black Tape </i>has the feel of a long-shelved project stitched into something with a bit more running time and Frankensteined into an existence that doesn't seem intent on maintaining your attention. But if it means completing one of the most ambitious collections in recent hip-hop history, there are worse ways to spend a disjointed hour.</p></div>"|16362.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16362-madlib-medicine-show-13-black-tape/|6.1|Nate Patrin

It's hard to know why Matthewdavid (real name Matthew McQueen) is so fixated on the the Master, aside from the fact that his style derives from hip-hop, much like his mentor <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5058-flying-lotus/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Flying Lotus</a> (last year's debut <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15334-outmind/"" target=""_blank""><i>Outmind</i></a> was released by Flying Lotus' <a href=""http://www.brainfeedersite.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Brainfeeder</a> label; <i>Jewelry</i> is a freebie from McQueen's own <a href=""http://leavingrecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Leaving</a> imprint). Then again, McQueen's style also cherry-picks from screw music, jungle, psychedelia, and what feels like a hundred thousand other genres, all jumbled together, sometimes all at once. Odd thing is that Rakim, nothing if not a straight-shooter, seems like an odd spirit animal for a guy that, on principle, shoots from the hip, testing the limits of the traditional electronic beatscape.</p>
<p>But that third eye-- illustrated, spoken or merely implied-- does say something about his approach. Like Flying Lotus, McQueen's music can trigger out-of-body reactions, thanks to irreverent sampling, Ritalin-deprived drum programming and, more so in McQueen's case, texturizing that forces a quirky club track to sound unknowingly dosed (""Pendant (Remix for Dynoo)"") or a weightless, spatial dream palette (""Rolex (RFTW Flip)"") to feel chillingly arid. But unlike FlyLo, who can take these series of seemingly unrelated musical flecks and weave them into an affecting stream of consciousness, the music on <i>Jewelry</i> feels tailor-made for the unconscious. Meaning, in short, it might be easy to call bullshit on McQueen, who so often lets the soupy grooves of a screwed sample do most of the heavy lifting, or simply crushes so many things together at once that ambiguity seems to be the only real aim. But at the same time, as with most music that requires effort, paying more than a little attention to <i>Jewelry</i> can feel like a pleasantly tacky choose-your-own-adventure puzzle that, with investment, can lead to an engaging listening experience. Pay too much attention, though, and you could land yourself in the sanatorium.</p>
<p><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13273-gold-rope-stones-flip/"" target=""_blank"">""Gold Rope (Stones Flip)""</a> is a good example of how, when implemented properly, a well-known favorite can help orient a listener. Administering some gloppy bass notes, McQueen <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UgDsZQhJ4w"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">breaks into the case of wine early</a> and warps the track into a friendly, wobbling drunk. ""Pendant"" manages to achieve a similar sort of appeal by way of acclimation, built around an identifiable lurch, or in the case of ""Medallion (Remix for Princeton)"", some deft trashcan lid smashes. Otherwise, McQueen is left only with details, and while interesting (Parisian producer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28793-onra/"" target=""_blank"">Onra</a> and pretty much any <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhHa7ph5GLg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Sonic 2"" level that involved water</a> seem like identifiable points of inspiration), are often not as dynamic as a meatier constructions prove to be.</p>
<p>Most of <i>Jewelry</i> seems to come from McQueen's gut as opposed to his heart or his (at least conscious) mind. Obviously, it's a bit of a double-edged sword. On one hand, a little more structure would probably be able hit those pop pleasure centers he so frequently references and flirts with, but it would likely mean that he'd have to sacrifice some of his loopy id that makes these assemblages unique. It's an intimate balance, but there's no saying that McQueen won't be able to strike it, perhaps even soon. Like Rakim, McQueen can take a phrase that's barely heard and flip it. But with <i>Jewelry</i>, it's still not quite yet a daily word.</p></div>"|16376.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16376-matthewdavid-jewelry/|6.7|Zach Kelly

It's probably a safe bet to say <a href=""http://ketamines.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ketamines</a> were thinking about the drug's recreational uses when they picked their name. In addition to their dripping, trippy album cover and <a href=""http://hozacrecords.com/2011/07/ketamines/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the press photo</a> where they painted their skin green, they've given their music a coat of hallucinogenics-- every song is warbly and reverb heavy. The album is called <i>Spaced Out</i>, after all.</p>
<p>But even if it was their intent with the photos, art, and guitar effects, it's too simplistic to say these guys sound druggy. The Calgary band's debut LP sounds more like it was fueled by a sugar high. It's energetic and manic at the beginning, and by the end, it's slower, foreboding, and markedly more subtle. Opener ""Teenage Rebellion Time"", for example, is all primary colors. There's joyful screaming in the background, and it opens with a sunny riff, which is amplified by these cartoonish coconut percussion hits. But the joy's cut with a hint of bile-- during the chorus, high-pitched, manic voices screech, ""it's just teenage rebellion time."" It's pretty unsettling. By contrast, ""No Grand Design"", which surfaces toward the end of the album, is mournful, surf-tinged, and entirely instrumental. There's no hint of the opener's mischievous demons.</p>
<p>Thankfully, they don't just visit those two poles-- they find time to explore a middle ground in the album's 25 minutes. ""Ketamine Babies"", surprisingly not a theme song for the band's own fictional Saturday morning cartoon, tries its hand at ominous, but not in the sense that there's any real danger-- it's the same bouncy sort of menace that's incited by <i>Super Mario World</i>'s Bowser level music. It makes sense that these guys are adept at that aesthetic, given the wide-eyed enthusiasm of the opener. But not every attempt at incorporating weird elements works in their favor-- ""Spaced Out"" tries background screaming again and adds something that sounds like steel drums, but the song quickly grates and overstays its welcome.</p>
<p><i>Spaced Out </i>is at its most fun when Ketamines are boldly sloppy. The strongest example is ""Midnight Dawn"", where the opening verse is pretty much entirely slurred and unintelligible, but it's delivered with assertive confidence. They stick the landing with their catchy sing-along unison in the chorus, while also pulling out a handful of surprising change-ups. The percussion on ""Kill Me Now"" starts out on a continuous drive, but by the chorus, it loosens up into an unexpectedly fluid groove.</p>
<p>The best sell for <i>Spaced Out</i> comes from their palpable excitement to be making this music. ""Evil Intentions"" begins with the copied-and-pasted opening strains of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEEzbFxEbB8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Steppenwolf's ""Magic Carpet Ride""</a>. It's surprising that the song goes on to impress, since just the hint of that overplayed, infectious melody is a tough act to follow. But they springboard off of it with yet another romping riff, culminating in a satisfied, excited chorus, ""I've got evil intentions."" They pull it off because behind their eccentric tendencies and hallucinogenic moniker, these guys build solid song structures: verse, chorus, and bridge, all strung together by solid hooks.</p></div>"|16370.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16370-ketamines-spaced-out/|7.0|Evan Minsker

Recorded over two days after the March 2011 Japanese earthquake interrupted initial recording sessions, <i>BPM</i> is dedicated to the victims of that earthquake, with proceeds from sales benefiting the Japanese Red Cross. (And it goes without saying that, whatever my thoughts on this album, this is a generous use of Batoh's time and talents; <a href=""http://www.dragcity.com/products/brain-pulse-music"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">purchase it here</a>.)</p>
<p>Brain pulse music (henceforth ""bpm"") is made using a stereotypically goofy-looking contraption, one that features a wired headset and a readout monitor on a cart. If someone told me it was an object retrieved from Nikola Tesla's laboratory, I might believe them. (<a href=""http://www.dragcity.com/news/483"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">This photo</a> indicates that Batoh might be aware of the device's humor.) Bpm was initially conceived to treat patients with ""congenital abnormality of the cerebral nervous system."" It is generated via a device that consists of a headpiece, goggles, and a ""motherboard."" Brain waves are sent via radio to the computer, which translates them into wave pulses and then into sound.</p>
<p>Batoh had a bpm machine created for this project, which transformed from an experimental endeavor to a therapeutic one in the wake of the earthquake. The seven tracks on <i>BPM</i> were prayers and requiems, according to Batoh. Those words suggest a projected empathy to the victims; listening to <i>BPM</i>, though, it seems just as likely that the album was a vehicle through which Batoh and his collaborators coped with the devastation around them. Certainly it's difficult to imagine the discordant reeds of ""Kumano Codex 1"" or the morphing digital crevasses of ""Aiki No Okami"" being of much use to the injured or grieving, but I can absolutely imagine that long, meditative pieces here were salves for their creators.</p>
<p>The execution here, though, is too far divorced from the concept. Bpm is an esoteric, potent tool but it's utilized only twice here. ""Eye Tracking Test"" is the result of a woman ""playing"" the bpm as Batoh flashes images before her. It sounds like early computer music, like something off the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2106-ohm-the-early-gurus-of-electronic-music-1948-1980/"" target=""_blank"">OHM+ box set</a>: a tone poem whose technology defies meaningful composition. The second bpm piece, ""Aiki No Okami"", is fizzy dementia, industrial hiss mingling with strangled chants. Both tracks indicate the bpm is a valid noisemaker; whether it can be used for more substantive projects is unclear.</p>
<p>The remainder of <i>BPM</i> is a series of slow, sparse improvisations that Batoh and his collaborators concocted with traditional Japanese instruments. These are more conceivably ""prayers,"" and their tempos draw focus onto the types of sounds we usually associate with traditional, acoustic Eastern music: thin metals rubbing together, barely tuned drum skins, and the echo of light, hollow woods. The restraint shown during a track like ""Kumano Codex 3""-- eight minutes of wispy flute and drum patter-- is admirable. ""Kumano Codex 5"" sounds like a wind chime on a still day.</p>
<p>These ""Kumano"" tracks are pretty and somber; no doubt Batoh's veteran hand steered them. They're an odd fit, though, tonally and technically with the bpm tracks. <i>BPM</i> feels slapdash, no doubt a product of its rushed creation. As a benefit for earthquake victims and as an outlet for Batoh's grief and fear, there's plenty to recommend. As a pure sonic experience, it is a very novel, very undeveloped idea mingling with some very old ones.</p></div>"|16301.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16301-brain-pulse-music/|6.0|Andrew Gaerig

(They conquered it anyway, separately.) The clashing aesthetics that probably provoked the split are all too apparent when you compare <i>Speak and Spell</i> (written largely by Clarke) with the music Depeche Mode's made for the last 30 years (written mostly by Gore). <i>Speak and Spell</i> is blithe, bright, and bouncy, qualities Clarke took to projects like Yaz and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7319-erasure/"" target=""_blank"">Erasure</a>, which scored huge when he combined this bubblegummy synth-pop with over-the-top emoting and a little ersatz soul. Depeche Mode went for synth music's darker strains, turning it into digital stadium rock, draping themselves in leather and chains, delivering all that campy S&amp;M imagery and religious mania and gaunt raunch with a much-needed wink.</p>
<p>What initially brought them together was a love of electronic music and a yearning for stardom. The latter was what made their music pop, of course, turning their work (together and apart) into one of the key transition points from post-punk keyboard freaks tinkering in their bedrooms to synthesizer-wielding pretty boys taking over the airwaves. While their music may have reveled in new technological toys, as synths moved from expensive and inaccessible to the realm of consumer electronics, their delivery was pure showbiz, whether we're talking Clarke's Broadway brassiness or Gore's grim-but-cuddly goth melodrama. But it's that lifelong infatuation with beats and bleeps that's brought them back together, three decades after <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6FBfAQ-NDE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Just Can't Get Enough""</a>, as VCMG, with 10 tracks of the kind of fierce, instrumental, no-bullshit techno that was as left-field popular in 1988 as 1998 as 2008. It's often witty, with a kind of robots-running-amok charm, and always attention-grabbing, at least in small doses. But friendly it ain't.</p>
<p>On the one hand, their timing <i>seems</i> perfect, since instrumental dance music is enjoying a level of almost unprecedented mass-cult saturation in America. On the other hand, <i>Ssss</i> is appearing at a time when dance fans both overground and underground have violently veered away from the scorched-earth minimalism of VCMG tracks like ""Aftermaths"", whether it's indie kids running toward early-1990s pop house or Hot Topic habitués headbanging to Skrillex's screamo-meets-Aphex. Which isn't to say that there are no of-the-moment touches. ""Bendy Bass"" is six minutes of queasy wobble-- one hesitates to call it a ""drop"" since it practically consumes the whole track-- that doesn't recall dubstep so much as recent dubstep's debts to techno. But the overall vibe is more the-sound-of-six-or-seven-years-ago than hot-hits-of-just-last-week. If <i>Ssss</i> had come out in 2005, when hip producers were reviving the punishment of stiff electro riffs and exploring the bombed-out terrain of the darkest Detroit techno, it might have seemed like old pop stars bandwagon-jumping, and probably been as flimsy as you'd expect. In 2012, it feels like that rarest of side projects, two famous dudes exploring a sound they love for the hell of it, regardless of its commercial potential, with an intensity to match.</p>
<p>Since they no longer have to long for fame, having become Flashback Lunch Hour staples on various FM radio formats and revered grandpa figures in a number of subcultures, they don't need to offer a mass audience an easy way ""in."" And so the instrumental throbscapes of <i>Ssss</i> are stark and forbidding in a way that even Depeche Mode's flirtations with minimal techno weren't, since they at least had Dave Gahan doing his defiled-altar-boy routine. Anyone looking for the karaoke-grade choruses of something like Erasure's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pwzy-oVx7k"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""A Little Respect""</a> will instead find themselves sucked into a black hole of sub-woofer abuse, implacable drums, and a few synth frills with all the warmth of the earliest acid-house architects. For guys who can seem emblematic of the Big 80s, and all of the sleek dance-rock accessibility that implies, these tracks are far more likely to remind you of essentialist techno don <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5751-robert-hood/"" target=""_blank"">Robert Hood</a>, at least if Robert Hood ever deigned to be entertaining.</p>
<p>Because even after they scrape their music clean of pop and pare things down to the metronomic essentials, they still can't hide the fact that they were born to make music that sounds as big as possible. If most 21st-century minimal techno fetishized restraint and control to the point of boring you, Clarke and Gore keep the compositional scrupulousness while making things huge and bold and unignorable. In other words, it's not the dance equivalent of a Michael Bay movie, like the output of the post-Skrillex crew, but it's also not a Bresson flick, like the work of so many German dance tinkerers. The problem is, as usual, that an hour's worth of minimal instrumental anything, however loud and slamming, has the potential to wear you down rather than suck you in, and Clarke and Gore don't entirely escape that trap here. After a few tracks of nothing but boom and tick and woosh, non-technophiles may find themselves longing for the more ""obvious"" pleasures of <i>Upstairs at Eric</i>'<i>s</i> or <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11881-speak-spell-music-for-the-masses-violator/"" target=""_blank"">Violator</a></i>. But the one thing you can't say about <i>Ssss</i> is that it's uncommitted, and after decades of quickie cash-in collaborations between long-estranged old bandmates, that in itself is its own kind of pleasure.</p></div>"|16369.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16369-ssss/|6.5|Jess Harvell

This was in 8th grade, or my first year in high school, so we're talking the late 1980s/early 1990s, though the record came out earlier, in 1985. The three-song EP was Minor Threat's last 7"", the one that featured slower songs, an acoustic guitar, church chimes (or, at least that's what I thought of them as), and a cover of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3WVzPy4cw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Standells' ""Sometimes Good Guys (Don't Wear White)""</a>. I was too young to realize Ian MacKaye and company were fucking with the hardcore template and looking beyond the genre's horizon, but they were: Those songs worked as a bridge to ""Waiting Room"" and the rest of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1584-fugazi/"" target=""_blank"">Fugazi</a>'s self-titled 1988 EP and onward. All to say: Hardcore bands deciding to stop doing hardcore is not a new thing.</p>
<p>The Bay Area quintet Ceremony formed in 2004, playing especially raw, noisy, super-fast hardcore, something people tag ""powerviolence."" It's worth knowing that  <i>Violence Violence</i>, their 13-song debut LP (right, right), lasted just over 13 minutes. (The CD version appended a re-tooled take on the 2005, 7-song <i>Ruined</i> EP.)  Early on, though, they'd mentioned  Joy Division, Suicidal Tendencies, Pink Floyd, Negative Approach, and Tom Waits as influences, and by the time they released their third album, <i>Rohnert Park, </i>in 2010, they were doing something very different, essentially making good on the promise of their eclectic record collections. Ceremony slowed things down, got sludgier and noisier in a Siltbreeze sense, discovered some British post-punk roots, and reminded me at times of the Shadow Ring covering the Fall.</p>
<p>On<i> Rohnert Park</i>'s opening track, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CY1kq29K5k"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Into the Wayside Part I / Sick""</a>, vocalist Ross Farrar lists a bunch of things he's sick of, including Black Flag and the Cro-Mags. Fair enough. For a band who named itself after a Joy Division song, that's not necessarily surprising. It's especially unsurprising in 2010-- like saying you're sick of the records your father grew up listening to. If that wasn't enough, they finished out their time on the hardcore/punk label Bridge 9 with <i>Ceremony 6 Cover Songs</i>, an EP that found them tackling Pixies, Wire, and L7's version of ""American Society"".</p>
<p>Given their history, the stylistic shifts on <i>Zoo</i>, their fourth album (and first album for Matador), shouldn't be all that surprising. At least not for the reasons you might think. Yes, they've changed things up again and they've cleaned and clarified their sound, but we already knew they had a Wire homage in them. Plenty of bands have shed genre constraints to arrive at a successful second act, though even more have fallen flat on their faces. Those disasters can be interesting, at least. In Ceremony's case, they don't wipe out; worse than a colossal flop, they sound exceedingly mediocre, and this is their least compelling album by far.</p>
<p><i>Zoo</i> features a couple of good songs, including opener <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12943-hysteria/"" target=""_blank"">""Hysteria""</a>, a true group punk sing-a-long. But too much of it drifts into generic 1960s-nodding garage-rock territory. It's their best <i>sounding</i> record: the dense atmosphere is charged and fuzzed-out in the right ways, creating an ambiance I can get sucked into even when the songwriting falters. Kudos to producer John Goodmanson here, though people focusing on the indie rock portions of his resume should remember he has plenty of  experience with punk via those old Team Dresch albums, Bikini Kill's <i>Reject All American</i>, a couple of Unwound classics, and Sleater-Kinney's <i>Dig Me Out</i> and <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7239-all-hands-on-the-bad-one/"" target=""_blank"">All Hands on the Bad One</a></i>, among others. Here, he makes the band sound sturdier and more colorful than they've ever sounded. But it doesn't matter when the songwriting itself is monochromatic, mid-tempo Troggs rock.</p>
<p>All said, <i>Zoo</i> makes for a very long 36 minutes. By the time you get to the drifting feedback that ends the third track, ""Repeating the Circle"", they already sound bored. ""Quarantine"" would be a late-period Social Distortion song that didn't make it onto a late-period Social Distortion album. They nod to the Cramps on ""Hotel"" but by the end, you'll be nodding off. The more punked-up raver ""Ordinary People""? Very ordinary. They do offer an interesting look, and taste, on downcast closer ""Video"", the longest song on the collection: Here we see them stretching things out like they did on the more experimental <i>Rohnert Park</i>, controlling a pent-up intensity-- and pleasingly bleak atmosphere-- that they're able to maintain for the low-key, slow-burn track's four minutes and change. It's a great finale.</p>
<p>Ceremony will be inevitably be compared to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5160-fucked-up/"" target=""_blank"">Fucked Up</a> because they, too, are playing more ambitiously pop music than when they started, and for the same label. But Fucked Up pushed themselves in ways that paid big dividends: The multi-tracked operatics were as exciting for the listener as they were for the out-of-breath band. Here, it feels like a downgrade to go from the early frenetic madness or the rickety, exhilarating post-punk of <i>Rohnert Park</i> to these decent, very safe punk nods. There's not much on <i>Zoo</i> that you won't find on dozens of garage-rock albums released by smaller labels this year. It's hard to say why things went wrong, but on another of the better tracks, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13198-adult/"" target=""_blank"">""Adult""</a>, Farrar sings that, as we get older, ""we have to give up the things we love sometimes,"" a line that doesn't ring true.

For a band that's never met a meta-pop gesture it didn't relish, the premature best-of felt like the Chap's most extravagantly executed ruse yet, the ultimate comment on self-congratulatory celebrity culture and instant, internet-abbetted historicization.</p>
<p>Naturally, the Chap can't resist following one joke with another: After the faux-canonization of <i>We Are the Best</i>, they come crashing back down to the reality of being an unsung indie band-- albeit one <a href=""http://thequietus.com/articles/08145-the-chap"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">admired by Britian's most famous science writer</a>-- with <i>We Are Nobody</i>. But the new album reveals that <i>We Are the Best</i> was more than just an elaborate lark; its true purpose was to signal the closing of the Chap's first chapter. On 2010's transitory <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14291-well-done-europe/"" target=""_blank"">Well Done Europe</a></i>, the Chap began to temper their blitzkrieg pop with more sophisticated, sobering songs that were less about mocking urban-bourgeois mores than examining the stress of keeping up appearances. <i>We Are Nobody</i> marks an even more pronounced break from the Chap's prankster past, to fully immerse itself in feelings of insecurity, isolation, and peer-pressured anxiety.</p>
<p>Prior to <i>We Are Nobody</i>'s release, the Chap made the album's lyrics <a href=""http://www.thechap.org/discography/we-are-nobody-lyrics/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">available for perusal on their website</a>, and if you weren't aware of the source, a face-value reading of certain lines-- ""feel like a car crash,"" ""we were killed by this place long ago,"" and ""painkiller please!""-- would lead you to believe their authors were destined for psychiatric treatment, if not suicide watch. But the Chap couch this darker subject matter in their sleekest, most elegantly crafted songs to date, wherein the influence of pop's reigning sardonicists, Steely Dan, becomes as much musical as it has always been spiritual.</p>
<p>Thanks to their associations with labels such as Lo (in the UK) and Ghostly International (in North America), the Chap are often discussed in terms of electro- or synth-pop, even though their music is just as reliant on traditional guitar/bass/drums elements as any rock act. But such mechanistic descriptors are understandable given their songs' orderly arrangements, with every purposeful bass fill, keyboard line, maraca shake, and vocal harmony inserted into and removed from the mix with mouse-click precision. And, of course, Johannes von Weizsäcker's unwaveringly anodyne voice-- and ability to maintain his perfect diction even at breakneck velocities-- amplifies this robotic quality, as he delivers his grave prognostications on the modern human condition with all the sterilized amiability of a customer-service rep.</p>
<p>But in emphasizing these attributes and suppressing their berserker instincts, <i>We Are Nobody</i> feels more anonymous than previous Chap albums; while ""Talk Back"" and the title track see the band assuredly following through on the new pop promise of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15055-zonoscope/"" target=""_blank"">Cut Copy's <i>Zonoscope</i></a>, similarly structured and themed songs like ""Curtains"" and ""Running With Me"" tend to blur into the same easy-listening groove. But the Chap are nothing if not self-aware of their own machine-like properties: The late-game pick-me-up ""Hands Free"" is both <i>We Are Nobody</i>'s lone punk-rock rave-up, and also the song that wilfully draws the greatest attention to the artificiality of recorded performance. It essentially consists of Weizsäcker's  foil Berit Immig repeating the same line (""give me surrender or give me death"") in several different keys, as if toggling the settings on a synthesizer, before locking into the right one and kicking the song into blast-off mode. Thankfully, even on an album as world-weary as this, the Chap don't forget to put the ""oui!"" in ennui.</p></div>"|16372.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16372-the-chap/|7.0|Stuart Berman

One is the route of religious faith, and the other goes in a different direction, as in ""I'll be faithful to you, girl."" Well, <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/leefields"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lee Fields</a> hasn't suddenly turned to making gospel records, so you pretty much know what kind of record this is lyrically. In fact, it entirely avoids the topical detours that peppered his last album, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13333-my-world/"" target=""_blank"">My World</a></i>, in favor of love, loss, and longing, and it also finds a third way to be faithful in the sound of the music, which is old-school in every respect. Don't call it a throwback, though. Fields has been doing this since 1969, so in his case it's more a matter of sticking to your guns.</p>
<p>The old school in the case of this record isn't any particular soul scene. <i>Faithful Man</i> isn't indebted specifically to Atlantic or Stax or Philadelphia International or Chess or Fame or Motown so much as it's indebted to all of them at once, building out every song with towering horn arrangements, strings, and background vocals to augment the band. In some cases, it's a little too crowded. Fields has a good voice, but it's a fairly light instrument, and he can't overwhelm an orchestra the way a Marvin Gaye or Sam Cooke could, so occasionally he sounds a little like he's shouting to be heard over it. Inevitably, the songs that take a lighter or at least more varied approach to arrangement serve him best.</p>
<p>""Moonlight Mile"" in particular is a great showcase, backing him up with a bit of coral sitar and trembling flute, while a dark-toned electric piano carries the chords. It's one of a few songs that stretches the musical template into unique and challenging territory, and another reason that this comes off as much more than a throwback. Playing with the rules of your genre is a good sign you're in true command of it, and Fields does that. Check the way ""You're the Kind of Girl"" sets itself up as a nice and catchy pop-soul tune and then takes a completely unexpected left turn into subtle psychedelia near the end, dropping the orchestra out entirely at one point to let Fields just run with the drums for a bit.</p>
<p>If there's anything that keeps <i>Faithful Man</i> from equaling <i>My World</i>, aside from the occasional orchestral overkill, it's that the songwriting overall isn't quite as strong. If success really is mostly perspiration, Fields and his band get us 99% of the way there with his performance, but that other 1% is pretty crucial. One exception to both flaws is the fantastic closer ""Walk on Thru That Door"", which makes overkill work entirely in its favor and also happens to be a killer song. The arrangement channels <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13233-hot-buttered-soul/"" target=""_blank"">Hot Buttered Soul</a></i> in a big way with its fuzz guitar facing off against piles of strings and horns, but it knows when to pull back and let Fields take over. A little more of that balance might've gone a long way on the rest of the record, but <i>Faithful Man</i> is still a very enjoyable outing.</p></div>"|16371.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16371-faithful-man/|7.0|Joe Tangari

For the past year the label-- which issued the original compilation-- has commissioned a series of 12""s featuring remixes by luminaries in the house, techno, and bass communities. <i>Shangaan Shake</i> collects mixes by artists such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22117-theo-parrish/"" target=""_blank"">Theo Parrish</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29335-demdike-stare/"" target=""_blank"">Demdike Stare</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28985-actress/"" target=""_blank"">Actress</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4505-ricardo-villalobos/"" target=""_blank"">Ricardo Villalobos</a> and offers them on CD for the first time.</p>
<p>If these mixes have found their way into more podcasts and sets than actual <i>Shangaan Electro</i> tracks, forgive the DJs: the Shangaan tempos (usually north of 180 bpm) and organ-heavy instrumentation made them imperfect fits for the European and North American venues in which people listen to forward-thinking, adventurous dance music. Part of the purpose of <i>Shake</i>, I think, is to give these producers and DJs an opportunity to engage with <i>Shangaan Electro </i>on their own terms; the extent to which each remix preserves the spirit of the source material goes a long way in determining its success.</p>
<p>If you were drawn to <i>Shangaan Electro</i> for its home-stitched charm or for its undeniable otherness, you'll find <i>Shake</i> less compelling. Since adding color or energy to these tracks would border on the obscene, the producers here opt for dubby decay and filter-driven texture. The tracks here are often ""deeper"" than their inspirations inasmuch as they offer a dynamic range and mastering touch unavailable to the Shangaan musicians. They're slower as well: only Parrish opts to compete with the ruckus, offering a bustling 13-minute edit of Mancingelani's ""Vana Vasesi"" that, in keeping with his history of disco edits, grabs a potent instrumental bit and loops it.</p>
<p>Some of the lighter treatments are the best. Detroit techno stalwart Anthony ""Shake"" Shakir beefs up the low-end of BBC's ""Ngunyuta Dance"" (a popular choice amongst the producers here) and places an iridescent, wafer-thin synth sequence on top of it. Villalobos-- <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15797-re-ecm/"" target=""_blank"">again working with Max Loderbauer</a>-- submerges the Tshetsha Boys' ""Nwa Mpfundla"" under a bed of mineral bass. Burnt Friedman leaves Zinja Hlungwani's vocals mostly intact, erecting a haunting dub elegy. The smeared, psychedelic takes by UK artists Actress, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22787-peverelist/"" target=""_blank"">Peverelist</a>, and Demdike Stare (listen to their contribution <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13110-demdike-stare-meets-shangaan-electro/"" target=""_blank"">here</a>) turn the music's pointillist repetition against itself.</p>
<p>These are inspired, loving takes but they're also safe. Nothing here is as daring or wildly inventive as <i>Shangaan Electro</i> itself. Few producers here stepped outside their comfort zones. Two different Mark Ernestus edits of BBC, for example, sound every bit like Ernestus' spare, hypnotic work with sampled African chanting beneath them; the same method might have been applied to a remix of Neil Young or Nas. During a time when sonic maximalism has started to shoulder its way back onto dance floors, <i>Shake</i> is a tome of deconstruction. At times I long for more grappling with <i>Shangaan Electro</i>'s tempos and idiosyncrasies. By playing things close to the vest, however, <i>Shake</i> re-contextualizes these tracks in the varying states of Western electronic dance music, allowing us to re-engage it and reminding us of the global breadth of dance music.</p></div>"|16363.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16363-shangaan-shake/|7.7|Andrew Gaerig

Even the stuff we perceive to be ""confessional"" songwriting is just a parade of characters and personas (citation: <i>i</i>, an album-length meditation on the first person pronoun), every simple melody sounds a little bit better when buried under an avalanche of Jesus and Mary Chain-grade scuzz (see: the aptly titled <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11049-distortion/"" target=""_blank"">Distortion</a></i>), and music made with ""real"" instruments like acoustic guitars and ukuleles can easily sound just as artificial as music made on computers and synthesizers (the folksy yet artifice-guilded <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13876-realism/"" target=""_blank"">Realism</a></i>).</p>
<p>With a frontman iconically haughty enough to be a feasible answer to a <i>New York Times</i> crossword puzzle clue (L.A.-by-way-of-East Village curmudgeon; 14 letters)-- it has been especially easy during this run of albums to dismiss the Magnetic Fields as Ivory Tower pop, wrapped up in the cleverness of their own ideas and out of touch with the world below. But a quick glance around the cultural landscape shows Stephin Merritt's inquires to be pointedly, perennially relevant: There's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuAo7aFiQEI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dave Grohl at the Grammys</a>, professing the very conceit that <i>Realism</i> poked fun at; here's a whole slew of underground lo-fi bands taking <i>Distortion</i>'s dictum as gospel; there's the same voice that yelled ""Judas!"" at Robert Zimmerman shouting a whole string of unprintables at <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29855-lana-del-rey/"" target=""_blank"">Lizzy Grant</a>.</p>
<p>At the endless, stuffy cocktail party where everyone's going on about authenticity in music, Merritt's formalist convictions feel, at best, like a refreshingly icy gust of wind coming in through an open door. Or, at least, in theory. Because as interesting as these records might have been to think about or discuss, the fact is that their listenability varied greatly, with the most recent, the overstuffed <i>Realism, </i> pretty much unendurable as a front-to-back experience. Another tidy truth about pop music: You can't have a conversation about a record if you've never met another person who has cared to sit through it twice.</p>
<p>For anyone who found the Magnetic Fields' recent work too tethered to formal shtick-ery-- or who just missed the amiable synth-pop sound of <i>Holiday</i> or <i>Get Lost</i>-- the first few notes of their latest, <i>Love at the Bottom of the Sea</i>, peal like potential chimes of freedom. The record marks the end of their self-imposed ""no synth trilogy,"" and its opening track, the bleakly comic ""Your Girlfriend's Face"" is the first Magnetic Fields track to feature a synthesizer since 1999's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5041-69-love-songs/"" target=""_blank"">69 Love Songs</a></i>. Is this a return to form, or could it even be the beginning of a whole new direction? That seems possible on paper, since <i>Love at the Bottom of the Sea</i> is also the first Magnetic Fields album in a decade and a half that isn't organized around some kind of formal limitation. So is this record an exercise in liberation, an opportunity to explore bigger ideas, take risks, and reinvent the project as Merritt has so many times before? Well-- and isn't this becoming the damnedest phrase when it comes to this band-- in theory.</p>
<p>From the start, <i>Love at the Bottom of the Sea</i> seems to be a more welcoming listen than <i>Realism</i>. Two minutes in, we're greeted with an instant classic <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12971-andrew-in-drag/"" target=""_blank"">""Andrew in Drag""</a>, easily one of the band's best tracks since <i>69 Love Songs</i>. It's sharply funny (""A pity she does not exist/ A shame he's not a fag,"" Merritt laments, ""The only girl I'll ever love is Andrew in drag""), but it doesn't have the punchline-crazed flatness that some of his more self-consciously jokey songs do. Though just two minutes long, ""Andrew in Drag"" is an efficient, elegantly crafted character study, and once the initial jolt of its punchline wears away, it remains a surprisingly affecting parable about unattainable desire (""Ill never see that girl again/ He did it as a gag/ I'll pine away forevermore for Andrew in drag"") that smartly, swiftly ends before it has a chance to become maudlin. And while the droll tableau ""God Wants Us to Wait"" doesn't quite have much in the way of emotional resonance, it still sets the album off to a strong start thanks to a few vividly goofy turns of phrase (""I guess it's true I should have told you before/ And not have waited 'til we're nude on the floor"") and a catchy, Shirley-Simms-voiced melody.</p>
<p>But after these frontloaded highlights, it doesn't take long for <i>Love at the Bottom of the Sea</i> to become a rain-boot-worthy slog through water-logged mid-tempo material: There's a particularly plodding song called ""I'd Go Anywhere With Hugh"" that feels triple its two-minute runtime; there's the prancing, carousel vibe of ""The Horrible Party"" which feels like a retread of <i>Realism</i>'s weaker material; and then there's ""My Husband's Pied-A-Terre"", which rhymes the titular line with ""derrière."" They're all foregone conclusions: Knowing just the titles, you can pretty much imagine exactly what these songs will sound like and, as the lyrics unfold, what the next rhyme (or punchline) will be. That's the frustrating paradox of <i>Love at the Bottom of the Sea</i>: Though it finds the band shaking off the limitations of their formal exercises, it's actually the safest and most predictable thing they've put out in years.</p>
<p>Of course, that <i>Love at the Bottom of the Sea</i> is ornate, pun-crazed, and flagrantly synthetic is not necessarily a strike against it: Merritt's spun these qualities into gold before. Marking the return to longtime home Merge Records and their long-shunned electronic sound, <i>Love</i> has the feel of a band getting resettled and plotting its next move, but it ultimately amounts to something less than the sum of its parts: It has the feel of a collection of B-sides rather than a proper statement. There are enough good songs to put it a cut above <i>Realism</i> (including, late in the game, the sweetly vitriolic ""Quick!""), but it's a new kind of disappointment from a Magnetic Fields record: It doesn't even give you much to talk about.</p></div>"|16360.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16360-the-magnetic-fields-love-at-the-bottom-of-the-sea/|6.1|Lindsay Zoladz

First and foremost, the band's mistaking melodic and emotional obtuseness with alluring restraint. So I apologize for erring on the side of artless candor to express the single most obvious thing about them: They sound like Spoon. <i>A lot </i>like Spoon<i>.</i> Now, here's the major difference between White Rabbits and the hundreds of other bands of whom that's also true: They actually have Spoon's permission. Serving as producer on 2009's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13038-its-frightening/"" target=""_blank""><i>It</i>'<i>s Frightening</i></a>, Britt Daniel helped the Brooklyn-via-Columbia, Mo., sextet advance past the peppy dancehall-rock of <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10286-fort-nightly/"" target=""_blank"">Fort Nightly</a> </i>to become a streamlined and moody band that might find their prior enthusiasm somewhat embarrassing.<i> </i>And now on <i>Milk Famous</i>, they enlist Mike McCarthy (<i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10390-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga/"" target=""_blank"">Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7430-gimme-fiction/"" target=""_blank"">Gimme Fiction</a></i>) to produce, but rather than hearing a band use enviable mentoring to discover their own identity, there's something unnerving about how supplicant they are to this weird symbiotic relationship: White Rabbits get a crucial cosign, and Spoon ostensibly get a place to test drive studio tricks without worrying that their protégées will beat them at their own game.</p>
<p>Sounding like Spoon is hardly a non-starter, and in fact, a lot of bands could still stand to learn a lot from them. But <i>Milk Famous </i>falters by creating an Uncanny Valley effect by adopting the most easily replicable aspects without maintaining any sort of human element or offering anything that's identifiable as their own. Lead single ""Heavy Metal"" is perhaps their most blatant attempt yet to lionize their benefactors' sound sculpture over their songwriting, as it exchanges the verve and insistent rhythms of previous openers ""Kid on My Shoulders"" and ""Percussion Gun"" (their two finest songs) for a sonic game of <i>Concentration!</i>: To where can you match those backmasked synths, starchy basslines, eerily dead drums and edge-of-falsetto vocals? Are they from ""Eddie's Ragga""? ""Paper Tiger""? ""Was It You""? All three?  Either way, without a single melodic idea of substance, it's all trimmings, a Thanksgiving dinner of stuffing and cranberry sauce.</p>
<p>Which isn't to say White Rabbits have nothing at their disposal to distinguish themselves-- it's just they all get downplayed despite not being adverse to their new sonic goals in any way. It always bums me out to see a dual-percussionist setup underutilized, and while they give the drummers some shine with the showy polyrhythms of ""Everyone Can't Be Confused"" and ""Back For More"", they're mostly relegated to fill-free timekeeping and muffled funk. Likewise, Stephen Patterson has proven capable of leading ear-bending harmonies, which have been almost abandoned completely in favor of terse, disjointed phrases. Maybe it's all meant to reflect the communicative failures of brooding masculine figures, but it mostly ends up contributing to them as <i>Milk Famous</i>' lyrics sheet piles up clarifications, addendums, and corrections borne by self-reflexive cleverness (""It's nothing personal/ It's just that I'm not me”) and Yorke-ian magnetic poetry (""Don't tell me that it's all been sold/ The kitchen's on fire/ But you are self alone"") to sidestep what Patterson might actually mean.</p>
<p>I can't help but acknowledge that <i>Milk Famous sounds </i>great because it really is all carefully protracted sound, confirming that ""highly produced"" isn't necessarily synonymous with ""overproduced."" If you set out listening to <i>Milk Famous </i>simply for its use of stereo spacing and post-production treatment, it's as satisfying a record as you'll hear in 2012, every normally acoustic instrument triggering so many extraneous textures, you'd think they secretly longed to be <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1212-disco-inferno/"" target=""_blank"">Disco Inferno</a>. There's an intriguing tension at the outset of ""Danny Come Inside"", a stretched-thin vocal harmony sitting low against a hotly-mixed drum track, blunt riffs, and a sneaky hook, but all these interesting ideas just hang on, as the song itself is a four-minute jog to nowhere in particular. Likewise, all those neural bursts of guitar and patched-in drum flutters are perhaps intended as counterbalances to the austere lyricism and almost ambient use of melody, but it's a completely lopsided see-saw.</p>
<p>In White Rabbits' defense, otherwise potentially solid MOR bands treating choruses and song structure as vestigial organs of less-evolved times is seemingly as reflective of indie rock in general as it is their own personal path. But ultimately, this is a band overestimating its ability to be <i>interesting </i>instead of likeable, misjudging the chasm between its ambitions and its talents. Or, yeah, they pretty much want to be Spoon too, but you'd think they'd remember who warned listeners to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1hZVDLkJDc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""get free from the middleman.""</a></p></div>"|16311.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16311-milk-famous/|5.6|Ian Cohen

The 22-year-old Compton-born MC's biggest claim to fame was that his cousin is that guy Travie McCoy from the emo-rap band Gym Class Heroes. His 2008 debut album, <i>No Introduction</i>, was executive produced by Pete Wentz of Fall Out Boy and was a weird, mall-punk take on Black Eyed Peas-ian hip-hop.

Now all of a sudden, people are reassessing Tyga. Does he have any other songs-- let alone a whole album's worth-- anywhere near that good?</p>
<p><i>Careless World: Rise of the Last King</i> tries its damndest to answer this question in the affirmative. Tyga isn't a gifted lyricist, but he has a few key things going in his favor: a workmanlike ability to ride a beat, a solid singing voice, and a great ear for melody. Executive producer Jess Jackson (previously an unknown UK garage guy who asserts himself as an emerging hitmaker here), leverages this by giving him juicy, hook-laden cuts. These songs don't reinvent the wheel and sometimes openly cop from existing hits. ""Muthafucka Up"" is basically <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12065-six-foot-seven-foot-ft-cory-gunz/"" target=""_blank"">""6'7""""</a> Part Two, ""Black Crowns"" takes a moody page out of Noah ""40"" Shebib's playbook, and so forth. Still, they sound big and sturdy, built for the radio.</p>
<p>In terms of persona, Tyga goes a long way here to establish himself as a complicated and sensitive dude. Clearly he's seen Drake's success and understands the value of adding some introspection into the mix. So while there is no shortage of flossed-out hedonism (not only ""Rack City"" but the equally gooey Lil Wayne collaboration ""Faded""), you've also got several lovelorn jams. Occasionally this feels forced, and he's clearly not operating on a <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwyjxsOYnys"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Marvins Room""</a> level, but for the most part he pulls it off. ""And when I said I love you, yeah, I fuckin' meant it, and we ain't gotta bring your moms and your sister in it,"" goes one line in ""Love Game"" that feels like a specific bad memory from a specific bad argument.</p>
<p>Pair these moments with elegant summertime jams like ""This Is Like"" (featuring the poor man's Justin Timberlake, Robin Thicke) and you've got yourself a surprisingly solid pop-rap effort. Its one major flaw, aside from a few cringe-inducing moments-- there is at least one brostep breakdown, one track features a voicemail from Tyga's mom telling him how awesome he is, and that <a href=""http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.18734/title.tygas-careless-world-reportedly-recalled-over-martin-luther-king-jr-sample"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">inexplicable MLK sample</a>-- is that it's way, way too long. Twenty-one tracks at nearly one-and-a-half hours is an insane length for an album with this kind of pop instinct. Set aside that complaint, though, and I'm left without much to pick at. ""Rack City"": Not a fluke.</p></div>"|16367.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16367-careless-world-rise-of-the-last-king/|6.7|Joe Colly

After steamrolling their stamp onto tunes by the Beach Boys, Slade, and the Rolling Stones, the Australian trio attacks the Ramones' ""Loudmouth""-- and it actually sounds like the Ramones! Well, if the Ramones were woozy from too much sludgy guitar and sledgehammer bass. Feedtime stretch the original melody with muscular low-end, chugging along like a freight truck fighting gravity. As they did in their own music, here they share the Ramones' knack for making a few simple chords seem like all the world needs. So there's your catchphrase-- feedtime were the heavy Ramones.</p>
<p>Of course, no catchphrase can sum up a band, and there was a lot more to feedtime than Ramones similarities. They could speed up like a two-ton hardcore band, or back down nto Black Sabbath-like dirge (see the <i>Cooper-S</i> take on ""Paint it Black"", whose slow burn out-spooks the Stones' original). They could sound like weightlifters sweating though pounding beats, or surfers riding waves of distortion. Most vitally-- and again like the Ramones-- they found ways to make lots of interesting music from repetitive elements and narrow sonic parameters. If that formula sounds attractive, you might find the 1980s albums collected in <i>The Aberrant Years </i>(alongside bonus tracks from 7"" singles and compilations) as compelling as the Ramones' early work.</p>
<p>That formula was pretty simple, built on a power-trio nucleus that rarely deviated from its set path. But it had a unique catalyst in the weighty bass-playing of Al (all three band members went by their first names). His mates often made heavy sounds too, but even when Rick's sliding guitar spun around him or Tom's bullet-hole drums fired at him, Al's bass was the anchor-- the gravitational center around which everything else rotated. The result was music with unavoidable pull. Feedtime named their 1989 LP, <i>Suction</i>, after an in-joke term for rock-industry buzz, but it's actually a perfect description of their quick-sand sound, which sucks all the air and matter around it into a hypnotic vortex of noisy rock.</p>
<p>That might sound like difficult listening, but it's not-- feedtime made visceral, catchy music that shot closer to the gut than the brain. That's likely a product of their wide tastes. When Al and Rick formed the band in the late 1970s, they were inspired not only by rock and punk, but blues and even Cajun music. One highlight on their 1985 self-titled debut is a cover of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_Fred_McDowell"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mississippi Fred McDowell's</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhvxRB08pEA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I Wonder What's the Matter with Papa's Little Angel Child""</a>, which the trio morphs from a lonesome prayer into a growling, engine-revving workout. Much of the album has an even bluesier feel, alternating hard-charging tunes with darker songs that drip with primal angst.</p>
<p>That's a potent mix, but feedtime hit their stride with 1987's <i>shovel</i>, a record that never backs off even when its songs slow down. Many tracks feel like alternate-universe hits-- take the greasy hardcore stomp ""Mother"", the three-chord swinger ""Gun 'Em Down"", and the surprisingly anthemic <a href=""http://soundcloud.com/subpop/rock-n-roll"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Rock N Roll""</a>. ""Well some of the people, all of the time/ They don't like rock'n'roll,"" Rick sings, sounding like the last brave defender of an art form the band had clearly mastered. That mastery continued on <i>Cooper-S</i>, a thoroughly entertaining glimpse at how feedtime's sound could survive anyone's songs, and <i>Suction</i>, which mixes moments of acoustic guitar and female vocals in with its pedal-to-the-metal noise-punk.</p>
<p>Now that more than two decades have passed since that brand of noise-punk was in full swing, it's tempting to claim that feedtime presaged or even helped create grunge. There's probably some truth to that-- you can hear a lot of the 1990s fuzz-and-howl obsessions in Al and Rick's riffs and guttural screams, and they clearly influenced <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/2860-mudhoney/"">Mudhoney</a>'s Mark Arm, who recently <a href=""http://soundcloud.com/subpop/sets/your-favorite-feedtime-songs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">posted a stream</a> of his favorite songs from the box set. But listen to all of <i>The Aberrant Years</i>, and you'll probably get too caught up in feedtime's bracing songs to think much about bands that came after them. Al, Rick, and Tom had lots of influences and loved to play other people's music, but their sound was a world of its own.</p></div>"|16368.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16368-the-aberrant-years/|8.0|Marc Masters

It's at once nasal and deeply resonant, and it buzzes kind of like a vibrating string. Part of the pleasure of listening to his <a href=""http://www.mexicansummer.com/shop/mike-wexler-dispossession/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mexican Summer</a> debut is simply getting the opportunity to sit for a while with the natural, androgynous byproduct of air funneling up his throat. But what makes Wexler's voice particularly strange is that it never sounds like it's trying to be-- especially when we compare him to other, better-known veterans of the ""weird folk"" revival of the past decade.</p>
<p>In 2007, Wexler released his stylistically hybrid, melodically ambitious <i>Sun Wheel </i>debut to an indie music community whose ears were already trained upon the more high profile eccentricities of artists like Joanna Newsom and Devendra Banhart. Several years in the making, <i>Dispossession</i> sees his gymnastic compositions pried open into something much larger than their humbler, finger-picked origins might suggest, thanks to Exile Studio’s Matt Marinelli and an extended cast of backing musicians assisting with everything from traditional rock instrumentals to strings, synths, and brass.</p>
<p>Recalling philosopher <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Benjamin"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Walter Benjamin</a>'s notion of the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelus_Novus"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Angelus Novus</a> (or ""Angel of History""), opener ""Pariah"" presents us with the image of an angel flying backwards into the future, its eyes focused only on the past. This would seem an appropriate metaphor for the album's sound, which, like most music of these times, is something of a dip into the information archive. Even as it weaves together inflections of British folk, improvised jazz, Indian raga, and psych-rock à la Pink Floyd, however, <i>Dispossession </i>always feels more like an intuitive reckoning with these influences than a pointed exercise in musical tourism. ""Whose is the form that is forbidden you to take but yours alone?"" Wexler intones over space age organ, blues guitar, and the kind of brushed drums that would sound very much at home in a bebop band. Perhaps ""uniqueness"" is a word that no longer applies to indie music in 2012, but at least Wexler seems to be hip to the problem, and to reckon with it gracefully.</p>
<p>While we're talking comparisons, there is a complexity to Wexler's compositional style, for example, that will remind some of reclusive folkster<a href=""http://www.myspace.com/cassmccombs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> Cass McCombs</a>-- the unforeseen chord and time signature changes, the almost unnecessarily accidental-rich vocal and guitar melodies. Unlike McCombs, however, the storytelling here seems to take place less through words than through the music. <i>Dispossession</i>'s lyrics tend toward the metaphysical and the abstract, more vehicles for his voice than points of interest in themselves. We could try and figure out exactly what Wexler is trying to say to us on ""Spectrum"", for example, when he details the fractals of light produced by a prism, but we're unlikely to be hit over the head with any epiphanies before getting carried away by its pattering tablas, its husky strings, and the soaring key shift that occurs between the verse and the chorus.</p>
<p>As with a beautifully carved piece of furniture, what makes <i>Dispossession </i>one of the most inspired folk records I have heard in a long time has less to do with large revelations than with the finer details of craftsmanship: the entry of a vibrating synth chord at just the right moment during a rhythmic instrumental break (such as on ""Pariah""), or the rapidly ascending and descending scale that interrupts the cantering momentum of ""Prime"" while also somehow pushing it forward. The thoughtfulness of the album's construction extends to its architecture at large, which begins and ends with a crescendoing, mantric rocker, and offsets the baroque complexities of ""Prime"" with the unadorned, almost a cappella spaciousness of ""Glyph"". At the end of <i>Dispossession</i>, it's hard not to feel like we've really traveled somewhere, though of course, we've been moving in the tiniest of increments all along.</p></div>"|16366.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16366-mike-wexler-dispossession/|7.8|Emilie Friedlander

But that dream is only true for a very, very, very few people. It seems if you weren't born in the right place or if you didn't come from the right town, or if you believed in something that was different from the next person, y'know..."" With those words, <a href=""http://brucespringsteen.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bruce Springsteen</a> summed up his entire ethos-- searching for the American Dream and coming up short and then searching some more-- during a time of rampant unemployment and disquieting economic inequalities. The year was 1981. Yeah, Bruce has been here before.</p>
<p>Back then, Springsteen expressed his blossoming political awareness as well as the no-way-out stories of his friends back in small-town New Jersey with the stark vignettes of <i>Nebraska</i>. Recorded alone on a four-track, the album hovers like candlelight through a pinhole, its hope-deprived characters somberly trying to reconcile faded dreams with the realities in front of them. The album is an empathetic work with Springsteen's disillusionment coursing through it, offering a personalized stamp on America's Promise, and what happens when that bond becomes weak.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to present day: While the State of the Union may feel familiarly shaky, Bruce Springsteen is attacking his country's hypocrisy, greed, and corruption in an entirely different way on his 17th studio album, <i>Wrecking Ball</i>. The keyword is ""attack."" Several songs here are polemics from a man who has been betrayed one too many times. ""If I had me a gun, I'd find the bastards and shoot 'em on sight,"" he threatens on ""Jack of All Trades"", while nothing less than the sound of shotgun fire is heard at the climax of ""Death to My Hometown"". Perhaps inspired by the folk songs he covered on 2006's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7729-we-shall-overcome-the-seeger-sessions/"" target=""_blank"">We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions</a></i>, Springsteen fills the first side of <i>Wrecking Ball</i> with his own protest music. Like pretty much everything Bruce does, it's a noble gesture-- biographer Dave Marsh pegged him as ""the last of rock's great innocents"" in the 1970s, and the title still holds-- but it can also sound misguided.</p>
<p>With <i>Nebraska</i> Springsteen was updating the folk music tradition, whether that was his intention or not. The record was insular and personal, which fit its increasingly splintered times. <i>We Shall Overcome </i>was a communal throwback, but it re-energized its dusty source material with spirited performances and an approachable shagginess that's often eluded Springsteen on record over the past couple of decades. <i>Wrecking Ball </i>guns for such sing-alongs-- its musical roots call back to Civil War snares, gospel howls, and chain-gang stomps-- but it fails to support them with ample life.</p>
<p>Part of this can be chalked up to the album's production, which, like nearly all of Springsteen's post-<i>Tunnel of Love</i> material, continually finds a way to professionalize the singer's blue-blooded rawness. While a few E Streeters make cameos here and there, the bulk of the album was played by Springsteen and new studio partner Ron Aniello, whose previous credits include Bruce's wife Patti Scialfa, along with Candlebox, Guster, and Barenaked Ladies. The production isn't a disaster, but most of the stylistic flourishes can feel gimmicky or, at worst, like dry history lessons; the ""Taps""-like horns on ""Jack of All Trades"" could be announcing the song's own funeral, and a startlingly bland concluding guitar solo by Tom Morello doesn't help matters. There's also the tugging sense that Springsteen and Aniello are trying to cover up some of the album's lackluster songwriting.</p>
<p>Springsteen never fell into punk's nihilism in its heyday, instead opting for fuller and more ambiguous pictures of the problems of the American working class. So it's odd to hear him rail against those up on ""Banker's Hill"" in the sort of black-and-white terms that continue to plague and cleave his home country. Not to say he has a moral obligation to tell the banker's story-- he doesn't-- but his lashing anger largely gets the better of him (and his writing) on <i>Wrecking Ball</i>'s opening half, from the simplistic thieves of ""Easy Money"" to the overly broad characterization of ""Jack of All Trades"". For Springsteen, the Promise has always been a complex notion, and there's beauty in the tangles. Nothing is easy, not joy nor vengeance. There are always repercussions, always second and third and fourth thoughts behind any given action. ""The road of good intentions has gone dry as a bone,"" he sings on opener <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/45388-video-bruce-springsteen-we-take-care-of-our-own/"" target=""_blank"">""We Take Care of Our Own""</a>, and the plea is unfortunately carried through the record's first five songs.</p>
<p>In that light, <i>Wrecking Ball</i>'s back half acts as something of a rescue mission, for Springsteen's soul, and for the album itself. The two best songs are here, and not coincidentally they're the oldest tunes of the bunch, ones that were written with the full E Street Band in mind. Both of them-- ""Wrecking Ball"" and especially ""Land of Hope and Dreams""-- also feature the unmistakable sax blares of Clarence Clemons, who passed away last summer. That added emotional weight certainly contributes to these songs' heft, but so does the fact that they fit in with Springsteen's lifelong mission in a way that the rest of the album does not. ""Wrecking Ball"" was originally written to pay tribute to the Meadowlands' Giants Stadium in 2009, when Springsteen and the E Street Band played the venue's final concerts. And indeed, Springsteen personifies the stadium in the song: ""I was raised outta steel here in the swamps of Jersey some misty years ago,"" he starts. Now, this might seem a little goofy and random. But keep in mind that Giants Stadium was being raised in Springsteen's home state just as his own career was taking off in the 1970s, and that he opened the Meadowlands' Brendan Byrne Arena (now the Izod Center) with six sold-out shows in 1981. These hulks of steel mean a lot to Springsteen-- they're his pulpit. And outlasting one of them is no small feat. Across ""Wrecking Ball""'s six minutes, Springsteen is harkening back to his sprawling arrangements of yesteryear, and marking it with a glorious bridge that acknowledges the 62-year-old's mortality while defying it all the same. ""Bring on your wrecking ball,"" he sings, over and over, relishing the joy of this ending.</p>
<p>""Land of Hope and Dreams"", written around the time of the E Street reunion tour in 1999, follows suit-- it's sprawling at seven minutes and boasts not one but two prime Clemons solos. (In the <i>Wrecking Ball</i> booklet, Springsteen breaks down the duo's invaluable accomplishment: ""Together, we told an older, richer story about the possibilities of friendship that transcend those I'd written in my songs and in my music."") This song is huge, not only in length but scope, and is imbued with an all-encompassing, arena-blowing bigness that Springsteen has shied away from in his new material for years. It rolls along using one of Bruce's favorite metaphors: the train. This is the one Curtis Mayfield was talking about on ""People Get Ready"" (which is called out here), the one critic Greil Marcus rhapsodized about in his essential tome <i>Mystery Train</i>, the one that welcomes all Americans regardless of class, race, creed. Coming out of Springsteen's mouth-- and Clemons' horn-- it's still a touching ideal, a testament of hope when we need it most. And for going on 40 years now, that's Bruce's job-- to remind us of what brings people together when everything around us seems hellbent on proving the opposite. Too hokey? Probably. But the true power of a song like ""Land of Hope and Dreams"" lies in its ability to overcome self-consciousness and cynicism, a feat that's tougher to achieve now than ever. Hard times come and go-- why spew anger when exultance is in your grasp?</p></div>"|16364.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16364-wrecking-ball/|5.9|Ryan Dombal

But it makes sense that <a href=""http://www.bowerbirds.org/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bowerbirds</a>, a North Carolina duo known for its soft and folksy paeans to nature, would reckon frankly with The End on <i>The Clearing</i>: Nowhere else is death quite as palpable-- sensible, even-- as the garden, the forest, the backyard. ""Oh, my dear friend, everything falls to death,"" Phil Moore sings on the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12829-tuck-the-darkness-in/"" target=""_blank"">opening track</a>. ""We tuck the darkness in.""</p>
<p>Bowerbirds' first two LPs-- 2007's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10353-hymns-for-a-dark-horse/"" target=""_blank"">Hymns for a Dark Horse</a></i> and 2009's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13312-upper-air/"" target=""_blank"">Upper Air</a></i>-- were relatively spare productions, but <i>The Clearing</i> is broad and ambitious, featuring more (and richer) instrumentation and unprecedented studio gleam. In the three years since <i>Upper Air</i>, Moore and girlfriend/bandmate Beth Tacular have grappled with a spate of challenges-- Tacular fell ill (then recovered), they broke up, they got back together, they rescued and adopted a dog (the same one they accidentally walloped with their tour van), they hand-built a little cabin in the woods (""The logs we peeled and stacked in a ring/ And then we crowned it, our tiny house, with tin""). Plenty of things broke; a few got fixed. All those ends and beginnings ultimately became creative fodder, and <i>The Clearing</i> is imbued with a kind of stubborn tenuousness: Here we are, still holding on, waiting for the thaw. ""There's a hope that we have what we need,"" Moore and Tacular harmonize on ""Stitch the Hem"", and it seems, just then, like the only hope worth having.</p>
<p>Bowerbirds have mined this space before, and most of the lyrical memes here-- nature, alienation, love-- are familiar. Nearly every track references the earth in one way or another: the soil, the stars, the sea, the long winter. But erstwhile fans might be a little spooked by the record's production. <i>The Clearing</i> was mostly recorded at April Base, Bon Iver's Wisconsin studio-house-retreat, with Brian Joseph (who engineered <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15551-bon-iver/"" target=""_blank"">Bon Iver</a></i>), and includes bountiful layers and plenty of moving parts (violin, cello, trombone, clarinet, organ, vibraphone, to start). <span> </span><i>The Clearing</i> is deliberately polished for a folk record, but what it lacks in scrappiness it makes up for in its precise, artful construction. Just like Moore and Tacular's home in the forest, <i>The Clearing</i> feels lovingly erected, fashioned bit by bit. Making something-- slotting different parts together, building a whole from disparate elements-- is a reasonable way to grapple with all the ancient, exhausting burdens of new adulthood: to make sense of a tough year.</p>
<p>Moore stretches his vocals in places, pushing into an upper register that conveys a welcome sense of desperation (and a necessary contrast to the album's otherwise shiny surfaces). It's not surprising that a record preoccupied with life cycles would contain at least one origin story, and ""Brave World"" lifts a few key lines-- ""My name, it means nothing/ My age it means less/ The country I come from is called the Midwest""-- from Dylan's anti-war anthem ""With God on Our Side"", but it's less about fighting than the places we come from. Over nervous, tapping percussion, Moore lays it out, his voice rising: ""I'm dust and you're dust and we're honest.""</p>
<p>For all its dark moments, <i>The Clearing</i> is ultimately hopeful. ""Now We Hurry On"", the closing track, echoes a lyric from ""In Our Talons"", the standout moment from Bowerbirds' debut. ""No, you're not alone,"" Moore promises. There's the sun and the sparrows and the red dirt path, there's ""me and my true love."" Plenty, in other words, to find solace in.</p></div>"|16359.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16359-the-clearing/|7.9|Amanda Petrusich

This has its disadvantages (it would be hard to imagine any person calling him their favorite artist), but it also has its advantages (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29288-mellowhype/"" target=""_blank"">MellowHype</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14850-blackenedwhite/"" target=""_blank""><i>BlackenedWhite</i></a> is much easier and fun to listen to than any of Tyler's albums). It's pretty easy to enjoy <i>Untitled</i> once you accept that it won't be the source of any thinkpieces or essays, but that said, it does lack the crackling energy and unpredictability of his work with MellowHype. Taken together, the two records paint a full picture of who Hodgy is-- with <i>BlackenedWhite</i> indebted to the hyper, moshing persona that we see on stage and <i>Untitled</i> representing the guy who hangs around smoking weed and reblogging photos of cars and cats on Tumblr-- but it's the former that grabs you and demands your attention.</p>
<p>That's only a minor issue though, as <i>Untitled</i> knows what it wants to say, how it wants to sound, and it accomplishes both of those things in a digestible nine tracks. The production comes straight from the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29043-curreny/"" target=""_blank"">Curren$y</a>/Wiz Khalifa school of music for stoners, with some beats relying on soothing soul samples and others nodding towards jazz and easy listening. The production palette isn't a stark departure from what you hear on most OF albums, but someone like the Alchemist has been doing this for decades, and there's a welcome professionalism here that stands in contrast to the amateurism that can make even the best Odd Future albums jarring listens.</p>
<p>Hodgy spends most of <i>Untitled</i> talking generic shit, and on the one hand he's a perfectly competent rapper who can twist words well enough to make you perk up every once in a while, but he's still not an overwhelming personality on his own and his songwriting is still developing. On a track like ""Cookie Coma"", Hodgy asserts himself adequately, but despite his technical aptitude, it's hard not to wish that the beat had been saved for some forthcoming collaboration between the Alchemist and Curren$y. And then there's something like ""Lately"", which makes a feeble attempt at writing a hook and in the end comes off sounding like a nursery rhyme.</p>
<p>In the end, whether Hodgy's able to push past these sorts of generics is probably not that big of a deal. <i>Untitled</i> isn't blowing the doors off of anything, but plenty of rappers have trouble releasing records this tight and thematically consistent, and ultimately, Hodgy makes his name and money with MellowHype, and that group has shown no signs of slowing down.</p></div>"|16355.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16355-untitled-ep/|6.7|Jordan Sargent

Confidence in her own skin is something Winston revels in and turns into her most powerful weapon on her debut record, <i>King Con</i>. Her songs are undeniably poppy and well-produced but reject the ice-cream gloss or ambiguity of many other contemporary pop artists. Instead there's a homespun feel here, and the layered production is stuffed with detail and component parts. It's an approach that makes the songs feel driven on piston power rather than Pro Tools.</p>
<p>Her voice is full of quirks, too, and more often than not she sounds closer to more alternative singers such as <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xckBwPdo1c"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kate Bush</a>, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcHjAUhtSrk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Joanna Newsom</a>, or even <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAfcBwYuNDU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Karen O</a>. Transplanting imperfect, personality-rich influences like this to a set of powerful pop songs is an interesting move and one that mostly pays off on <i>King Con</i>.</p>
<p>The sound that opens ""Velvet Elvis"" is a worn, gently warping vinyl stuck in a groove. This nostalgia wash acts as the bedrock for the busier elements that join the scuffle before bursting into a typically big chorus. Winston's narratives here and elsewhere feel just out of reach; they're fantastical but never come across as forced. That's thanks in part to the infectious feeling of excitement she gives off in each her performances. There's no hint of irony on <i>King Con</i>. There is a lot of heart, though, and there's something to be said for that in a realm of music where it's easy to feel manipulated. (That's not to say Winston doesn't pull some strings of her own. The togetherness in songs like ""Medicine"" and ""Host"" echoes the ""us-versus-them"" anthemic sway of a band like <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWgmRvwR0a8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Arcade Fire</a>.)</p>
<p>Despite being over a year old, ""Locomotive"" still feels like a highlight amongst this set, and the song hasn't changed a lot since <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12114-locomotive/"">we wrote about it last February</a>. The edges have been heated up a little, and if anything Winston sounds even looser and more idiosyncratic. The song's feverish momentum is both a high point and vital characteristic of <i>King Con</i>, where each victory feels hard won.</p>
<p>The downside to the relentless energy is that the record can get tiring, particularly after the impressive, but front-loaded first half. ""Benny"" is the only restrained moment here; even that feels too brief and comes too late. A large part of <i>King Con</i>'s charm is its confidence in direction, but toward the end, the sheer weight of similarly paced songs ends up dragging it down. For the most part, though, <i>King Con</i>'s an enjoyable collection, one that presents Winston as an artist with a strong enough personality to overcome that dip and to stand out in a scene where it can be hard to make an impression.</p></div>"|16354.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16354-alex-winston-king-con/|7.4|Hari Ashurst

Back when internet access was a luxury rather than an assumption, music consumers were familiar with a certain sensation that surfaced after the announcement that their favorite band had hit the studio. Release dates meant something-- you marked a date on a calendar, circled it in red, and let the excitement and dread build. But we've become accustomed to a constant stream of content-- new albums every year, an EP every six months, a tour-only 7"" here, a digital compilation there-- all stuffed down the feeding tube and shoehorned into our RSS feeds. (The wait is over; it never really had a chance to begin.) At this point, it's almost pleasant when a band chooses to buck the trend and follow its own pace, pouring as much time and effort as they see fit into the creation of a record. Their fans are given a taste of actual anticipation, and unless we're talking a washed-up 1980s buttrock reunion album or a flaccid slice of warmed-over nü metal, odds are it's going to taste that much sweeter once they're finally able to sink their fangs into it.</p>
<p>The Canadian black/death metal band <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/revengeattackbloodrevenge"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Revenge</a> understand this. It's been four years since their last record, 2008's <i>Infiltration.Downfall.Death</i>. Those familiar with the group's mastermind, J. Read, and his twisted approach to songwriting have been anxiously awaiting the arrival of their fourth full-length, <i>Scum.Collapse.Eradication</i>, since their U.S. label, Nuclear War Now! Productions, announced its release a ways back. Those fans spent hours scouring message-boards for news, listening to the song samples that eventually surfaced, and speculating endlessly about what the band would sound like now that longtime member Pete Helmkamp (Order From Chaos, Angelcorpse, Kerasphorus, etc.) had defected. (Spoiler alert: His absence barely registers).</p>
<p>For those unfamiliar with the group, Revenge are gods within their realm, and virtual unknowns outside it. Formed in Edmonton, Alberta, in 2000 after the collapse of Read's previous band, Conqueror, Revenge have long served as a cornerstone of the international black/death-metal scene, releasing a handful of essential records via French label Osmose (with earlier EPs surfacing courtesy of Dark Horizon and War Hammer) before aligning with California's Nuclear War Now! Productions. Fair warning to the uninitiated: Unless you already know and love the likes of Read and his compatriots, or have an affinity for lo-fi, relentless walls of black noise, you might not ""get"" this album. ""Niche"" is an understatement.</p>
<p>Revenge are perfectly content to leave it that way. They march to the beat of their own war drums, and have built an unfuckwithable name for themselves based upon an unabashedly confrontational approach, disdain for trends and outsiders, and immobile commitment to nothing but total armageddon. Themes of intolerance, elitism, and spite course through the veins of every track. The music is both brutishly primitive and intimidatingly complex, veering between guttural blasts of noise and dizzying instrumental prowess in a blink. This is black metal ground down to its ugliest, most primal essence,  spat out at furious powerviolence tempos and dredged through a filthy  morass of down-tuned death metal.</p>
<p>That said, even for outsiders, <i>Scum.Collapse.Eradication</i> is more than worth a listen. Read is one of the best and least recognized extreme metal drummers out there. His power lies in his willingness to dumb himself down, rolling into simple, effective beats as often as he careens off into complex, inhuman blasts, all crashing cymbals and typewriter hits. The guitar work follows a similar pattern, alternating between primitive, pummeling grooves (check the apocalyptic stomp on""Parasite Gallows (In Line)"") and screaming, fret-mangling leads (most viciously exemplified at the tail end of ""Burden Eradication (Nailed Down)"") . The vocals are not of this earth, as a litany of rabid snarls and echoing, subhuman gurgles give tongue to Read's proclamations of world downfall and rampant paranoia. Compositionally, there's no fat to be trimmed: Each song is a pointed insult, pure hatred distilled into five minutes or less of blown-out extreme noise terror.</p>
<p>Aided and abetted by longtime session collaborator Vermin, who holds it down on bass and guitar, Read has given volcanic birth to the most fully realized Revenge album yet. <i>Scum.Collapse.Eradication</i> builds upon the band's formula, maintaining the animalistic ferocity and hellacious black/death assault while utilizing a more open production than in the past. Their characteristic raw, oppressive atmosphere remains intact, but this production separates and highlights each riff, blast, and growl for maximum impact. As always, Revenge settle for nothing less than victory, intolerance, and mastery of their craft. This album is a challenge, and a triumph.</p></div>"|16361.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16361-scumcollapseeradication/|8.0|Kim Kelly

The human, religious, and geopolitical layers are the ones that get the most play in popular music, for obvious reasons. They're immediate to our everyday existence-- we're more likely to think about the role love plays in our day than the role of cell division. Over the course of his career, <a href=""http://giveitaway.andrewbird.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Andrew Bird</a> has gradually added more layers to his songwriting, very often intertwining the political with the microscopic, the humdrum with the fantastical, the made-up word with the pointed phrase. Pop music is steeped in a certain kind of language-- it's largely informed by a spiritual and emotional understanding of the universe. Rational understandings of the way things work and the hidden worlds behind the world we experience simply haven't established much of a foothold in our emotional vocabulary, but Bird has probably made more strides toward developing this kind of vocabulary than any other prominent songwriter.</p>
<p><i>Break It Yourself</i>, his latest album, opens with a song that jumps right into these kinds of concerns. ""Desperation Breeds"" wrings more than a little haunt out of the precipitous loss of bee populations, and from there, we're off to the races, winding through ruminations on the way death's promised end point can inject meaning into life's mundane moments (""Near Death Experience Experience""), to ""Sifters"", whose point that the ""moon plays the ocean like a violin"" works both metaphorically and literally. Certain themes recur. One is the slipperiness of truth and memory-- ""Lazy Projector"" throws itself straight into wondering how much of our memory is our own, while ""Lusitania"", a duet with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5367-st-vincent/"" target=""_blank"">St. Vincent</a>, transposes the thought to collective memory, capping a verse that touches on events from World War I and the Spanish-American War with the line, ""We don't study these wars no more.""</p>
<p>Another recurring theme is perhaps more germane to the sound of the album. There are several moments where Bird seems to grapple with his own decision to distance himself from the world on his farm. He's working much more collaboratively with a band on some songs here than he has in a long time. Lead single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13036-eyeoneye/"" target=""_blank"">""Eyeoneye""</a> is a pretty straightforward indie rock track by his standards, though honestly its bashing straightforwardness makes it one of the least captivating songs here. Still, though, when on ""Danse Carribe"" he sings, ""Then one day you'd had it/ Exiled your closest advisors,"" it sounds like he's talking to himself, even as his band builds around him. The song is one of his best, picking up a completely unexpected Afro-Caribbean groove halfway through, then mixing it with the type of fairly traditional fiddling he hasn't done much of since he went off on his own and rebuilt his tonal vocabulary around his layered violin, whistling, and glockenspiel.</p>
<p>The fact that he has his own sound is essential to making all this work. A lot of people I know find Bird's lyrical flights unpalatable, and many feel the same about the whistling, but for me, it all amounts to a constructed world that sounds outré at first but winds up being a startlingly astute reflection of our own as you settle into it. The world is so much stranger than we commonly assume, and I like that Bird points his lights into the quantum corners to gain a different perspective, and does it while committing to the quirks of his own strange sound. That strange sound becomes positively majestic on ""Hole in the Ocean Floor"", an eight-minute fever dream that caps the album with just a few words scattered through the soundscape of looped and layered violins. It's a piece of music no one else could have made, on an album no one else could have made. And it's a little like the world-- the longer you live with it, the more the details become apparent and the more you can feel it all working together.</p></div>"|16356.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16356-break-it-yourself/|7.5|Joe Tangari

I am a classic, yeah, I live at the MoMA,"" <a href=""http://www.estellemusic.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Estelle</a> says in ""The Life"", the opening song from her new album <i>All of Me</i>. The UK rapper/singer intends this as a boast, of course, but it also highlights a key difference between her and most of the other women in her field. Which is to say, in a genre where a certain amount of flash has come to be expected, Estelle is decidedly un-flashy. She raps and sings well but doesn't rely on quirk or theatrics. She incorporates styles from reggae to boom-bap into her songs, but doesn't try to forge weird new genre hybrids. She sings about grown-up stuff like personal contentment and finding clarity after a break-up. For lack of a better term, she's normal.</p>
<p>This works both for and against her. On the one hand, it's hard to get really excited about Estelle. Unlike, say, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2935-mia/"" target=""_blank"">M.I.A.</a>, there's no sense of danger or what-will-she-do-next anticipation. On the other, she's solid and consistent, and her songs almost always sound good. She's also capable of making a hit. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIK1IzWl_Xc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""American Boy""</a>, her bouncy, disco-flecked Kanye collaboration from 2008 charted at No. 1 in the UK and was pretty much inescapable stateside that summer. I liked <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11498-shine/"" target=""_blank""><i>Shine</i></a>, the LP that track came from, a good deal more than my colleague Joshua Love, but it didn't produce any other big singles. On <i>All of Me</i>, Estelle seems keenly aware of this. She's focused more on hitmaking than crafting a cohesive album statement.</p>
<p>It's hard to blame her; this is the trend in pop these days. Because of the way people consume music now, a record has more commercial value as a scattered collection of hits than a unified, thematic concept with one or two possible breakout tracks. Look at Beyoncé's all-over-the-place but ultimately quite good <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15585-4/"" target=""_blank""><i>4</i></a>, for example. Whether or not you think this is another sign of the Death of the Album is a whole other article-- the important thing is that Estelle and her producers work well within these constraints. From Swizz Beatz to Mark Ronson, <i>Shine</i> was all about big-name production, but this album does more with less. Some its best cuts come from unlikely sources: David Banner, Wyclef Jean, and lesser-known guys like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Cannon"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Don Cannon</a>.</p>
<p>Most tracks here make no bones about aiming straight for the radio. Choruses are airy and open, melodies are sticky and straightforward and tend to lodge in your head with or without your approval. The Banner contribution ""International"" brings Estelle's reggae instincts together with American bass punch, roping in R&amp;B Lotharios Chris Brown and Trey Songz for the hook. It's big and effective. The sunny ""Wonderful Life"" is the stuff of romantic comedy trailers but isn't cloying; ""Back to Love"" sounds like a Coldplay song in the best possible way. These are tracks built for repeat play across multiple formats. Lyrically they aren't bad, either. Estelle can come off restrained at times, but the best material finds her managing love and loss like a responsible adult.</p>
<p>""I thank you for making me a woman,"" she sings to an estranged partner on ""Thank You"", a track patterned after Lauryn Hill's classic <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSQq_mU7jUg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Ex-Factor""</a>. This is quintessential Estelle, to talk not about the devastation of heartbreak, but how she grew from it, how living with the pain taught her to be more whole, more normal. ""I'm much clearer now than I've ever been,"" she mentions at another point. In an era of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXkK7-HUdxo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Stupid Hoe""</a> and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3Jv9fNPjgk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I'ma ruin you, cunt,""</a> I can certainly understand how some could find these to be boring sentiments. We've been trained to want to be titillated and/or shocked at every turn, and there's no ""wow"" moment attached to peace of mind or feeling stable and realized. Shouldn't we all be so lucky?</p></div>"|16344.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16344-all-of-me/|7.0|Joe Colly

Whether their <i>Trouser Press (4th Edition)</i> idolatry came off as ingratiating or grating, there's no question Mr. Dream did what they did very well.  That said, sometimes imitation is simply imitation, and these guys tend to cross into that realm more often than folks with their skill and savvy should.  While many folks (including <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15170-trash-hit/"" target=""_blank"">Pitchfork's Matthew Perpetua</a>) thought <i>Trash Hit</i> closer ""Learn The Language"" was a stop-the-presses highlight, it left me wondering why they were coping their moves from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3763-shellac/"" target=""_blank"">Shellac</a>'s ""Prayer To God"", and (more importantly) to what effect. <i>Fatherland</i>'s ""The Room"" strikes a similar bum note at the end of the EP, though credit to Mr. Dream for picking some choice source material.  If you're going to ""pay homage"" to a track as notable as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23514-public-image-ltd/"" target=""_blank"">Public Image Ltd.</a>'s ""Poptones"", though, a wry nod or wink works a whole lot better than shameless over-the-top mugging.</p>
<p>All my grousing aside, it's not so much the outright thievery that grates, but the fact that Mr. Dream's trying to make like an in-your-face bruiser just isn't a good look for them.  They definitely try to sound the part, thanks in large measure to the EP's Albini-esque production, which brings over the wrecking-ball rhythm section and pavement-saw guitars from <i>Trash Hit</i>.  Instead of also emulating that album's agreeable polish and shine, there's a cruddy layer of reverb on everything; vocalist Adam Moerder (who, along with drummer Nick Sylvester, has contributed to Pitchfork) often sounds like he's singing into a tin can rather than a microphone, and the guitars  sometimes take on a queasy, nauseating tone.  Where <i>Trash Hit</i> sounds like something made by folks primed for a post-<i>Nevermind</i> major label deal, <i>Fatherland</i> is squarely the product of a beloved yet forgotten mid-1980s group that once opened for down-roster Homestead Records signees.</p>
<p>Still, as tracks like ""The Room"" and ""Fatherland"" demonstrate, this purposefully regressive sound doesn't necessarily make the group's tough-guy poses any more believable.  Moerder's more than capable as a vocalist, and the fact that he can veer from Cobain-esque mewling to Lydon-esque howls without much warning is impressive.  Those kinds of gymnastics are wasted on these tracks, unfortunately, as he's left to backflip and cartwheel all over the place while the music throws an array of punches that never quite land.  It's like Mr. Dream wants to be heavyweights, but they're just not able to hold their own in that weight class. What they can do is infuse their tighter, more melodic efforts with just the right amounts of dissonance and power.  It's on tracks like ""Palace Complex"" and especially ""Believing And Shitting"" where the songwriting, the playing, and the production choices all seem to have their eyes on the same prize, which is to make songs that emulate your <i>Surfer Rosa</i>s and <i>Secaucus</i>es and other alt/indie touchstones with sounding exactly like them.  The EP's (and the group's) lone acoustic number, ""Slow Learner"", could possibly be on par with those tunes if Moerder didn't have his heart set on making the song submit to the power of his voice, but in lieu of half-hearted attempts to grab a younger <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23399-corey-rusk/"" target=""_blank"">Corey Rusk</a>'s attention by recapitulating his label's highlights, these kinds of detours are most welcome.</p></div>"|16351.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16351-fatherland-ep/|5.7|David Raposa

It's a collection of spindly, shuffly, sorta countryfied indie rock, with the genial, slightly goofy Fite cracking wise over top. It's a long way from his one-man answering service days with Little T and One Track Mike-- of turn-of-the-millenium mtvU staple <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBmlyfWd5GQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Shaniqua""</a>-- and even his earlier salvaged-from-samples solo work. Fite's often overeager delivery and anything-goes genre pastiche frequently felt like it was bending over backward to impress, an overall itchiness that the warm, worn-in <i>Ain't</i> seems to correct. Though his gradual shedding the sub-Odelay cornballery that plagued much of his earlier work has done wonders for Fite in the past, <i>Ain't</i> finds him a bit unsure as to how he'll replace its abundance of personality without going full <i>Adbusters</i> with it, as he did on last year's anti-consumerist <i>Over the Counter Culture</i>. So while this record rarely proves less than pleasant, its muted melodies and the jittery lyrical juvenilia rarely feels like too much more. Basically, <i>Ain't</i> finds Fite making that classic nice-guy mistake: confusing being nice with being interesting.</p>
<p>The album gets going with ""Hold Me All Night"", with Fite pitching a sweetly naive sort of woo over a traipsing, backporch-ready melody. These dusty lanes are where <i>Ain't</i> fares best; Fite's rural roots may've shown through a little too well on his earlier yes-y'alling, but he's found an easygoing way with country not unlike that of Seattle sunburners <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5467-the-cave-singers/"" target=""_blank"">the Cave Singers</a>. Fite's voice is still plenty chameleonic; at times he comes close to approximating the rich husk of TV on the Radio's Kyp Malone, while other moments find him sliding into the deadpan skitter of Soul Coughing's Mike Doughty. Here, Fite's vocal shapeshifting's is more relaxed, more palatable; you might not always dig what the guy's saying, but you'd be hard-pressed to mind the guy who's saying it too terribly much.</p>
<p>And Fite says plenty on <i>Ain't</i>; trouble is, it's not always clear what exactly he's getting at. Scant on detail and prone to unlikely flights of fancy, Fite's <i>Ain't</i> lyrics travel from the mundane to the just plain daffy so quickly-- sometimes in the course of the same song-- you start to wonder whether even he knows what he's on about. Fite's lovable-loser routine's certainly his most coherent; he reminds us on the loungy lead-in to ""Bunnies"" that ""whoever keeps the score knows I haven't scored for a while,"" and that slightly dour, largely unexplained mood hangs over a good bit of <i>Ain't</i>. But in propping up all that sadsackery next to the easy, breezy timekiller ""Joyriding"" or the weird whimsy of ""Tiger Shopping"", Fite's message, such as it is, feels muddled, operating on its own peculiar whims; he may no longer be literally trying on as many voices, but <i>Ain't</i> still seems to favor quirkiness over cohesion, and seems to think that merely hinting at his own outsider status is enough to get the listener in his corner.</p>
<p>With at least two songs about honest-to-God bullying-- the bland aspersion-casting of ""Bully"" and the grislier, name-naming ""Girard""-- and another, ""We Are All Teenagers"", that gently gnaws at the shackles of youth, it's clear Fite's looking to connect with the indoor kids here, but something about the thirtysomething Fite's junior jumble feels a little forced. Sure, bullying's no joke, and being 19 is its own kind of drag, too. But Fite's not really adding anything to that conversation here beyond the suggestion that he, too, has been there; at that age, you take your allies where you can get them, but that first Violent Femmes album this isn't. And when Fite starts sputtering on about ""the lining of the silver lining"" on ""Girard"", or quite literally detailing the purchase of a jungle cat on ""Tiger Shopping"", what separates this music from, say, Raffi isn't always clear. Affable even when he's down, Fite plays the nice guy through it all: tangent prone, slightly neurotic, relatably dorky. But between the innocuously rambly music, Fite's toned-down vocal mannerisms, and this pencils-up-the-nose persona, <i>Ain't</i> is a record that's hard to dislike, but nearly impossible to imagine loving. ""We are all teenagers,"" Tim Fite offers, ""waiting on the day when we won't be teenagers."" Are we, though? In the end, <i>Ain't Ain't Ain't</i> exposes a painful truth about guys as nice as Fite: They don't often finish last, but plenty wind up somewhere in the middle.</p></div>"|16358.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16358-aint-aint-aint/|4.8|Paul Thompson

That struck me as the case with <a href=""http://dinowalrus.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dinowalrus</a>' <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13977-percent/"" target=""_blank"">2010 debut <i>%</i></a>, a classic fixer-upper, a flawed yet promising record that showed obvious chops, taste, and ambition but not enough in the way of artistic vision: It knelt before the influence of post-punk and no-wave provocateurs alike, but without a similarly pioneering impulse, it felt regressive, a defense mechanism for a band that might not have been sure about its own capability.<i> Best Behavior </i>is far more accessible and enjoyable than <i>%</i>, but presents a strange conundrum on how to assess whether this is a legitimate leap or realization of potential: Is the slate of identifiable influences this time simply <i>preferable </i>to the previous ones?</p>
<p>It's a curious thing, because they haven't changed too much in terms of actual musicianship, even with the significant turnover in personnel. Sole permanent member Peter Feigenbaum is a subtly inventive guitarist with real-deal technique and the drum patterns are stuttering and busy on a micro level but turn into mesmeric loops when you telescope outwards. These things were also true on something like ""I Hate Numbers"", the one time <i>% </i>verged on anthemic, and clearly the jumping-off point for <i>Best Behavior</i>. So, sometimes, fulfilling your promise requires a system that can encourage your talents, and within the first minute of ""Phone Home From the Edge"", you see a proper application of weapons already at their disposal. Feigenbaum unleashes a brief flurry of tapped guitar runs and a bungee-like use of a pitchshifter pedal meant as hooks rather than repellants, and soon Dinowalrus go widescreen toward a wondrous and tersely worded chorus that could pass for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15393-deserters-songs-deluxe-edition/"" target=""_blank""><i>Deserter</i>'<i>s Songs</i>-era Mercury Rev</a>. It's a natural progression from the playful and purposeful opener ""The Gift Shop"", where bubbling bongos, contrapuntal guitar riffs and falsetto ""oooh-oohs"" weave in and out of the mix and establish a constant momentum and fluidity. Within the album's first 10 minutes, Dinowalrus prove to have just as many disparate ideas as they did on <i>%</i>; they're just better at organizing them now.</p>
<p>Or they've simply discovered that writing actual songs can be more challenging and rewarding than relying on established methods of rock deconstruction. Nearly every track on <i>Best Behavior </i>has a chorus of some sort, and they're often swooping and gliding in a way that's compatible with Feigenbaum's crystalline, back-of-the-throat timbre that recalls Faris Badwan from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4990-the-horrors/"" target=""_blank"">the Horrors</a>, a band who similarly ditched a highly stylized set of abrasive and cred-baiting influences for regally-paced, panoramic art rock. The claims of Madchester and Factory influence don't exactly scan-- while <i>Best Behavior </i>does maintain a consistently rhythm-based approach, it's more in the Stone Roses sense where the ""dance"" aspect presents itself in appendage to classic song structure, as with the slo-mo tropical percussion of ""Riding Eazy"", or the swirling synth arpeggios of ""Radical Man"" that are quickly overtaken by typically glistening guitars. The closest you get to a true floor-mover is ""RICO"", which in a number of ways is the closest link to <i>%--</i> for one thing, the octave-toggling bass and a disco strut of the verse is pure New York City circa 2002, and that it unwittingly turns a sample from ""Fly Like an Eagle"" into a dance-punk number feels like a remnant of their confrontational side, as does ""What Now"", which features a barely recognizable Patrick Stickles (Feigenbaum was a touring guitarist for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5651-titus-andronicus/"" target=""_blank"">Titus Andronicus</a>) and the one time where the hook sounds more like the revving of engines than the verse.</p>
<p>And yet, I hesitate to call it the proverbial ""leap,"" because it still feels like the band is holding something back. While the cushy layer of reverb surrounding Feigenbaum's vocals give them textural concordance with the surrounding music, it can also render <i>Best Behavior </i>a little unknowable. Regarding ""Phone Home From the Edge"", Feigenbaum stated, ""whether the song is about ET, U2, or the waterfront condo-ization of Williamsburg is still up in the air,"" and sometimes, you'd wish they'd take after U2's abilities to resonate rather than simply reverberate. But there's that thing about what you're not hearing again: <i>Best Behavior </i>is a strong record on its own merits, perhaps more so if you feel a sort of investment in Dinowalrus after hearing <i>%, </i>but it leaves something to the listener's imagination in order to make it truly exciting in addition to something sturdy to build upon.</p></div>"|16324.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16324-best-behavior/|7.0|Ian Cohen

Understandably so. While <i>Leave Home</i> was often ugly and brutal, it felt almost physically necessary, an allergic reaction to the repression of all things abrasive and loud amidst indie rock's digitized echo chamber. The music itself was bracing enough, but perhaps the biggest shock of all was hearing a Brooklyn band that didn’t carry themselves like they were primarily motivated by a desire to make friends.</p>
<p>But for fans of aggressive indie rock as described in <i>Our Band Could Be Your Life</i>, that's an easy image to project on the Men and, as the band told us in a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/rising/8759-the-men/"" target=""_blank"">Rising interview</a> earlier this year, not necessarily a correct one. Now a steady four-piece, they're setting the record straight on <i>Open Your Heart</i>, the title of which<i> </i>is so plainspoken and commonplace it's easy to overlook just how much the band backs it up by maintaining every last bit of visceral power of <i>Leave Home</i> while letting in so many more people to the party. <i>Open Your Heart </i>is both tremendously physical and friendly, knocking you on your ass one second, then immediately helping you back up to put a beer in your hand.</p>
<p>And I can't stress the word ""party"" enough, because it's difficult to remember a rock record that managed to be this much fun without resorting to cheerleading. Most people I've played opener ""Turn It Around"" for have remarked on its resemblance to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1534-foo-fighters/"" target=""_blank"">Foo Fighters</a>' introductory salvo ""This Is a Call"". It's pretty on-point: Mark Perro's vocals sound remarkably similar to those of a young Dave Grohl on this particular song, but what's crucial is how they align in spirit. ""Turn It Around"" comes off like a tribute to the pure rejuvenating powers of rock'n'roll itself by going nuts with all the things that got you hooked the first time: breakneck Zep riffs! Duel-guitar leads! Drum solos!  It's essentially a teenager's highlight reel, and the giddiness of <i>Open Your Heart </i>comes through in ostensibly meaningless slogans like ""I wanna see you write a love song!/ I wanna see you go down!/ I wanna see you when you try so hard!/ I wanna see you when you turn it around!"" Compare it to the only lyric of <i>Leave Home's </i>opener ""If You Leave…"": ""I would die.""</p>
<p>While there's a surface shift in attitude, <i>Open Your Heart </i>shares <i>Leave Home</i>'s uncanny ability to balance reverence and irreverence, enthusiasm, and expertise, treating the last four decades of rock music like an amusement park rather than a museum. ""Country Song"" isn't even the one song on <i>Open Your Heart </i>deserving of that title (that would be ""Candy""), but it shows how their minds work. A gummy tremolo riff, whining pedal steel, and an atypical waltz beat are the raw ingredients, but through the Men's artistic prism, it becomes something akin to a Southern bar band saying ""fuck it"" and letting their freak flag fly for a lengthy last-call jam.  Likewise, is the title of ""Presence"" an indication that they're trying out the sort of loose, blues-prog of that particular <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2439-led-zeppelin/"" target=""_blank"">Led Zeppelin</a> album? With its patient, patient build and tamboura-ish drone, maybe it is, but like most of <i>Open Your Heart</i>, the referential recognition is a bonus rather than the end result.</p>
<p>Of course, the question with <i>Open Your Heart </i>is how it can manage to be such a thrill despite conceivably doing nothing actually <i>new</i>. Not to demystify what the Men do here or downplay the artistry, but these guys strike me as fixers and problem solvers.<i> </i>I hear a band analyzing modes that have just become tired and stodgy and delivering them back running smoother than ever. Liked the coed ragers from the last <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5160-fucked-up/"" target=""_blank"">Fucked Up</a> album, but wish it wasn’t neutered by thousands of overdubs? Have a blast with the all-id caterwaul of ""Animal"". Wish krautrock ditched the metronomic straitjacket and actually <i>rocked</i>? There’s ""Oscillation"", which hums more like a motorbike than a motorik, punctuated with blasts of pure <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6071-mc5/"" target=""_blank"">MC5</a> ruckus. Want <i>Isn't Anything-</i>styled shoegaze with a backbone? An SST throwback without the razor-thin production? Alt-country without having to deal with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5492-deer-tick/"" target=""_blank"">Deer Tick</a>'s obnoxiousness? Enjoy the midrecord trifecta of ""Please Don’t Go Away"", <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13042-open-your-heart/"" target=""_blank"">the title track</a>, and ""Candy"".</p>
<p>It isn't diversity for diversity's sake, though-- <i>Open Your Heart</i> is smartly sequenced to metabolize genre and morph like a masterful DJ mix, subtly rationing out its true peaks even while seemingly going full-throttle throughout. After the 1-2 headbutt of ""Turn It Around"" and ""Animal"", ""Country Song"" provides a momentary breather and also a swooning leadup to the Men at their most gorgeous and overwhelming, the tail end of which has ""Please Don't Go Away"" ushering in <i>Open Your Heart</i>'s most traditionalist stretch. But just when it feels like Side B is going to be the Men's straight-up indie rock record, they burn that bridge with the willfully destructive two and a half minutes of ""Cube"", which then builds another one towards the LP's bright and expansive closers. And while <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13183-ex-dreams/"" target=""_blank"">""Ex-Dreams""</a> doesn't overtly sound like a curtain call, there are two points during <i>Open Your Heart</i>'s finale where everything drops out but a steady, crowd-pleasing drum break and you can all but imagine Perro happily lending the listener a chance to give themselves a round of applause for being such a good audience.</p>
<p>We haven't talked much about what the Men actually say on <i>Open Your Heart</i>-- about half of its 10 songs are instrumentals or something close. To get to its lyrical center, you'll have to go through ""Candy"", the one I imagine many might consider the dud or at least the outlier on account of foregrounding acoustic guitars. On the toast-worthy chorus, Perro sings ""When I hear the radio play/ I don't care that it's not me."" Around the same time I stared hearing ""Candy"", many of my colleagues were pushing ""Radio"" as the true standout on<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29855-lana-del-rey/"" target=""_blank""> Lana Del Rey</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16223-lana-del-rey/"" target=""_blank""><i>Born to Die</i></a>, a song that uses hearing oneself on the airwaves as a means of self-validation and smiting one's enemies. That sort of thing can only help ""Candy"" to be misread as being another in a long line of ""Left of the Dial""-type, anti-mainstream indie rock lectures-- that its drunk-country shamble recalls <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3559-the-replacements/"" target=""_blank"">the Replacements</a> doesn't hurt either.</p>
<p>But when you consider the lyrics that come immediately after-- ""Remember the days I'd shout anything for you to see me/ I could never sing now my voice it rings.../ I just quit my job/ now I can stay out all night long""-- it's clear that like most of <i>Open Your Heart, </i>it's not at all angry and, in fact, quite content.  All four members of the Men are at the border of 30, an age where you have enough critical distance from your youth and life experience to really start to figure out what success means to you. If I read ""Candy"" correctly, it's about being able to make a living off this thing while being a very loud band with no radio prospects whatsoever on a boutique label: the rewards seem modest by most standards, but once achieved it means <i>everything</i>, the sort of self-sufficiency that's inspired indie bands to form since forever.</p>
<p>Before <i>Leave Home </i>became their first widely available LP, the Men's recorded output consisted mostly of self-made cassettes that they recently gave away for free through their website.  They had to play a little rough if they wanted to be heard.  A year later, <i>Open Your Heart </i>is the sort of record that proves while pain and loss are often viewed as great art's true catalysts, bands like the Men can be inspired by the sort of confidence born of the bills being paid and the boss no longer breathing down their necks. And they're passing on the goodwill to everyone who made it possible: if you bought their t-shirt, came to their show, raved about <i>Leave Home </i>on your Tumblr, or seek to carry on tradition by starting your own band, <i>Open Your Heart </i>is the Men thanking you in the best way possible.</p></div>"|16295.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16295-open-your-heart/|8.5|Ian Cohen

<p class=""MsoNormal"">It makes a certain kind of sense that Nite Jewel's music sprung from the underbelly of L.A. Despite its unpolished aesthetic and Ramona Gonzalez's professed aversion to more conventional ideas about glamour (there she is, spewing neon vomit at a swanky photo shoot in the clip for ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYLDPsUjpL8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Artificial Intelligence</a>""), her music exists in the realm of gauzy fantasy: it is a dream world made reality. Up until now, all of the slinky, lo-fi electro-pop that Gonzalez has made as Nite Jewel has been molten and surreal, conjuring Dali paintings with drum machines and keyboards melting in place of clocks. Some of the moments on her 2009 debut <i>Good Evening</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> and her 2010 </span><i>Am I Real?</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> EP shone brighter than others, but they all crafted an atmosphere of mystery: it was nearly impossible to glean any specifics about the lyrics, not to mention the persona of the singer uttering them. Her latest LP, </span><i>One Second of Love</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> prompts a question that most artists who've carefully cultivated a sense of enigma have got to confront sooner or later (just ask the Weeknd or Lana Del Rey): what happens when mystery evaporates?</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">In the context of her catalogue, then, the cover of <i>One Second of Love</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> feel like the Nite Jewel equivalent of </span><i>Meet the Beatles</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">. The image-- like the music it represents-- is forthright and clear; you immediately get the idea that this record is her coming out party. And from the opening moments of ""This Story"", there's an obvious change in her sound: with its lucid, minimalist production, </span><i>One Second of Love</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> is the first Nite Jewel record that sounds like it takes place in the waking world. It's also an attempt to bring the poppier impulses to the forefront of her songs. The press release cites plenty of avant-garde influences, but also-- perhaps most importantly-- the 1990s R&amp;B-pop of TLC and SWV.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The expertly minimalist lead-off single ""One Second of Love"" makes an early argument that this new sound is definitely a step in the right direction. The track has a buoyant, danceable beat (it's been said that Nite Jewel makes the kind of dance music that you can't actually dance to, but this is Gonzalez's strongest ever rebuttal to that claim), and an uncluttered atmosphere that blooms-- thanks to some Gary Numan-like synths and backing vocals from Julia Holter-- at just a couple of choice moments. The ballad ""In the Dark"" slows things down but still boasts one of the record's catchiest choruses, while the funk-inflected, sputtering-yet-smooth ""She's Always Watching You"" sounds like the Dirty Projectors covering Sade. ""These girls are always smilin'/ At these late night events,"" she sings, perhaps professing some of the stresses of<span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;""> </span>living out married life on a stage (her husband, Cole M. Greif-Neill of the Samps and formerly Ariel Pink's Haunted Graffiti, plays on the record and in her touring band). ""Baby, can't you see that I am through?/ Cause she's always watching you.""</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><i>One Second of Love</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> runs into some problems in its second half, particularly during the slower, starker tracks like ""Unearthly Delights"" and ""No I Don't."" Even on her lo-fi records, Nite Jewel's best when anchored by some kind of beat; </span><i>Good Evening</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> tracks like ""Bottom Rung"" and ""Universal Mind"" show how vague and occasionally downright tedious her music can become when it's not tethered to some kind of driving pulse. And because </span><i>One Second of Love</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> eschews </span><i>Good Morning</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">'s layered, kitchen-sink atmospherics, its dull moments feel exceptionally dull because the atmosphere is so thin. Though the gentle groove of the penultimate track ""Autograph"" provides a late jolt to the album, its back half feels particularly disappointing given that the A-side boasts some of Nite Jewel's strongest material to date.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">In the end, <i>One Second of Love</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> is enjoyable but slight: its stronger moments render the weaker ones particularly forgettable. ""One Second of Love"" and ""She's Always Watching You"" show that minimalism do occasionally suit Nite Jewel well, but in cleaning up her sound she's also scrubbed away too many of the textures that made her music so distinct. Still, </span><i>One Second of Love</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> marks an unmistakably huge progression for Gonzalez as a songwriter: she's developing a keener ear for melody and a more confident delivery. This record isn't quite the breakout statement that it seems to be shooting for, but its highlights are ample proof that there's more to Nite Jewel than just smoke and mirrors.</span></p></div>"|16347.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16347-nite-jewel-one-second-of-love/|7.1|Lindsay Zoladz

The Chicago hip-hop crew gained online renown with 2009's ""Chi Don't Dance"", an insidiously catchy successor to the juke-hop hybrid popularized by fellow Windy City rappers Dude N Em's ""Watch My Feet"" a couple of years earlier. Although BBU's name is short for both Bin Laden Blowin' Up and Brown, Black, and Ugly, their song's political charge was easy to overlook amid all the regional references, breakneck flows, and, yes, dance-friendly electronic beats. The rest of their 2010 mixtape <i>Fear of a Clear Channel Planet</i> was more overtly ideological, but also more muddled.</p>
<p>In another sense, though, if BBU's strident views on social and economic justice were obscured by the quality of the group's best-known song, it only shows they're doing something right. Jasson Perez, Richard ""Epic"" Wallace, and Michael ""Illekt"" Milam, BBU's core members, are politically impassioned rappers who clearly understand it's usually better to throw a party than to give a lecture. On new DJ Benzi-hosted mixtape <i>bell hook</i>s, titled after the pen name of black feminist thinker Gloria Jean Watkins, BBU realize they can have it both ways. They don't <i>have</i> to tone down their fiery rhetoric. In fact, it can be more thrilling to fan the flames.</p>
<p>All of which is not to say <i>bell hooks</i> is devoid of more traditional party fare. Despite a title shout-out to an American slam poet, synth-blasting rump-shaker ""Beau Sia"" should soon be known on campuses throughout the land as ""that 'what's your major?' song,"" with its goofy come-ons, male-female call-and-response choruses, and stream-of-consciousness references (<i>Abbey Road</i>, Lil B, chicken strips). Another production by Chicago DJ Stefan Ponce, ""The Wrong Song"", is just as well suited for a slightly sketchy Friday night. And like Das Racist, who guest here on last year's spare, electro-fuzzed ""Please, No Pictures"", BBU know enough to lace their diatribes with sly, knowing humor. Even the skits and interludes manage to bring chuckles that withstand repeat listens.</p>
<p>What makes <i>bell hooks</i> such a step up for BBU, though, is the way the righteous fury fuels the celebration, the truth becomes the beauty, with barely a whiff of curmudgeonly condescension. ""Too many conscious rappers can't face facts/ That drug dealers happen to make better raps,"" Perez sneers on ""The Hood"", a surging anthem built over martial, horn-emblazoned soul. Later: ""Guess what? I don't think this country is great!"" There's a cathartic release when, on the similarly soul-radicalized ""Jumpers"", Perez envisions Sarah Palin's reaction to a black and gun-wielding Tea Party rally, Epic reps Black Panthers, and Illekt suggests a lot of rappers just aren't hip to who's really in charge (remember the first time DMX heard of Obama?). On breakbeat-happy ""Outlaw Culture"", BBU welcome, refreshingly, both ""sisters in the struggle who fought to be seen as queens"" and ""young queer kids that never fit in your scene."" But unlike last year's clueless portrayal of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/806-common/"" target=""_blank"">Common</a> as a thug, when FOX News comes after these guys, it will be with good reason. And that will be fun, too.</p>
<p><i>bell hooks</i>, then, is an extraordinarily self-assured mixtape, and that extends to BBU's list of producers and guests, which skews decidedly local. The 1970s-tinged tracks are the best fit for the visceral material, but the eclectic beat selection is impressive and distinctive; ""Kurt De La Rocha"" might not quite live up to its Nirvana-Rage double reference, but it's a bold flip of the bird toward the very process that sells us bird-flipping as somehow rebellious. As for rappers, aside from Das Racist, there's Chicago's own GLC, who underscores BBU's complicated relationship with gangsta rap by acknowledging, on ""The Hood"", his own ill-gotten youthful earnings. Chicago underground mainstay Mic Terror brings a harder, more violent edge to the Ultramagnetic MCs-sampling ""Spaghetti"", a track that somehow manages to invoke both Bernie Madoff and Ani DiFranco.</p>
<p>""This is a wake-up call,"" concludes the spoken-word opener, a chilling reading of a poem by then-Lincoln Park High School junior Malcolm London. Yes, BBU tend to repeat their choruses a few too many times, and no, not every song is to the high standard of the best tracks here.

The sound of <i>The Belbury Tales</i> lies equidistant between those two poles, with the familiar smell of dusty old textbooks and public information films mixed in with a loose, quietly psychedelic feeling. This opening up of the Belbury Poly sound can partly be attributed to founder Jim Jupp welcoming in a couple of guest players on a number of tracks-- Jim Musgrave on drums and Christopher Budd on bass and electric guitar. It feels like a strand picked up from the fissure Jupp sliced open on ""Scarlet Ceremony"" from 2006's <i><a href=""http://ghostbox.co.uk/products/product_theowlsmap.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Owl's Map</a></i>, where a faint sense of groove was breathed into the astringent Belbury Poly template.</p>
<p>It's a similar action to the overhaul <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3945-stereolab/"">Stereolab</a> took on <i>Emperor Tomato Ketchup</i>, bringing space and depth into their sound through the muted funk of ""Metronomic Underground"". Here, it helps widen the scope of an act that felt like it was getting backed into a corner on <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12759-ritual-and-education-from-an-ancient-star/"">From an Ancient Star</a></i> in 2009, which was a pleasing but somewhat pro forma exercise in the kind of work we had come to expect from Belbury Poly. Many of the central tenets of the sound remain intact, with Jupp's impressively fussy arrangements the foundation on which he hangs a series of loopy and fascinating musical notions. It's often about finding an unusual sort of proximity in styles, such as the startling introduction of a child’s off-kilter vocal in the standout track ""Green Grass Grows"", which floats like a spectral presence over analog synth runs that pay tribute to old 1970s <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Station_identification"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">station idents</a>.</p>
<p>Naturally, that kind of feeling is something anyone acquainted with Jupp and Julian House's <a href=""http://ghostbox.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ghost Box</a> label have come to expect. But most of <i>The Belbury Tales</i> falls shy of creating musical phantasms. Instead, shades of folk-tinged prog acts emerge, particularly those from the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canterbury_scene"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Canterbury scene</a> that Jupp confessed to be a fan of in a recent <a href=""http://www.factmag.com/2012/02/01/belbury-poly-on-ploughmans-lunches-prog-rock-and-avoiding-clarksonwakeman-territory/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">FACT</a> interview. But it's a Belbury-ized interpretation of those works, delivered through a filter of antiquated synths, creepy 1970s horror features, and esoteric library music. The prog influence can be heard seeping through the cracks in ""A Pilgrim's Path"", which feels like it's one or two chords away from toppling over into the excesses of that genre. But Jupp has a headmasterly way with his music, quickly reining in any signs of disobedience via carefully plotted structures and neatly clipped synth lines, which form like a plume of chalk dust rising from a blackboard eraser slammed hard on an old wooden desk.</p>
<p>That type of reserve Jupp utilizes in Belbury Poly aligns him with a number of English acts well versed in rock history but with a distinctly <i>un</i>-rock approach to the art, who sometimes work in pop or on the fringes of it. Bands that listen to mountains of old psych 7""'s with yellowing sleeves then distill the feeling from them while shearing out all the fatty excess-- the long hair, the flowing tie-dye ponchos, the hoary old guitar solos. Bands like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3682-saint-etienne/"">Saint Etienne</a> or House's former collaborators in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/473-broadcast/"">Broadcast</a>. So on ""Now Then"", the wildly distorted guitar passages come with a muzzle attached, pushed into the background over loops of the most un-rock instrument of all-- the panpipes. ""Chapel Perilous"" and ""Goat Foot"" even threaten to boil over into solid rock grooves, only for Jupp to skillfully pull back by smothering them in great whirls of electronics and processed sound, comfortably anchoring it in Belbury land.</p>
<p>One of the crucial aspects of Belbury Poly is the notion of ""building worlds,"" as Jupp put it in a recent interview with the <i><a href=""http://www.thewire.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wire</a></i>. But there's always something held back, something not clearly defined, making the listener do the work to fill in the gaps. <i>The Belbury Tales</i> is stranded somewhere between the abstract work of Jupp's past and the fuller sound of the live instrumentation he is applying, making this feel like his most pleasingly open-ended release so far. There's fantastic detail in the packaging, as we've come to expect from Ghost Box, with a short story from <i><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Electric-Eden/dp/0571237525"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Electric Eden</a></i> author Rob Young decorating the pages of the CD booklet. Even the variations in paper in that booklet-- sleek and soft on the outside, coarse and craggy on the inside-- feels like an aesthetic choice that was labored over for days. That's the world of Belbury Poly, like a meticulous sketch of an old town plan that never got finished, leaving plenty of scope for its creator to pencil in the blanks.</p></div>"|16308.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16308-the-belbury-tales/|7.2|Nick Neyland

Software like Ableton, Reason, and Maschine have steep learning curves but long plateaus. True amateurs don't sound blocky and tinny like vintage 808s-- that can require real skill-- but merely undistinguished.</p>
<p><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13910-the-minimal-wave-tapes-vol-1/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Minimal Wave Tapes</i></a> captures a group of far-flung amateurs putting themselves through the paces of learning early model drum machines and synthesizers, nibbling on techno, electro, and industrial music in ways that led to a distinct sound. I imagine their relationship to these instruments to be much the same as children tormenting one another: learning what parts to pinch, twist, and pull in order to achieve the desired effect. <i>The Minimal Wave Tapes Vol. 2</i> is again compiled by Stones Throw head <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6136-peanut-butter-wolf/"" target=""_blank"">Peanut Butter Wolf</a> and Minimal Wave label founder Veronica Vasicka. It offers no new narrative or stated focus and thus represents nothing more than the second gleaning of tracks from the cloistered minimal wave universe.</p>
<p>Still, there's something undeniable here. We're dealing with a sound that grew in loosely knit local networks hundreds of miles from one another and decades later has inspired DIY archivists and collectors. If nothing else we can say that this sound-- still reedy, red-eyed, and frayed-- is magnetic enough that disparate groups have arrived at it without much aid. Minimal wave is, perhaps, a natural sound to produce when you're isolated and have machines to fondle. And these musicians understood how isolated they were: ""The Drum"", a severe, pothole ridden jam, opens with a warped voice, ""Hello, my name is O-ha-ma, and I live on a potato farm in western Canada."" The liner notes for <i>Vol. 2</i> are short but specific, often naming the specific drum machines, keyboards, and recordings equipment used. I'm reminded of the famous Silver Jews line, ""When the sun sets on the ghetto all the broken stuff gets cold."" Replace ""ghetto"" with ""small European city.""</p>
<p>Intentional or not, <i>Vol. 2</i> sounds more robust. There's fewer papier-mâché dance numbers and more carbonated sequencer work. The proto-techno of Antonym's ""Cinnamon Air"" and the congested arpeggios of Das Ding's ""H.S.T.A."" shift focus from the tinny drums that dominated <i>Vol. 1</i>. ""What Happened to You?"", by Belgian duo Subject, builds lo-fi science fiction around a stone-simple 2/4 rhythm. These mostly instrumental tracks are ripe for remixing. The only ""modern"" track is Geneva Jacuzzi's ""The Sleep Room"", recorded in 2004, and it employs buzzy post-punk to detail a haunted, psychedelic village: ""Love to the village with the holes/ In their heads.""</p>
<p>At the end of his review of <i>Vol. 1</i> in <a href=""http://www.thewire.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>The Wire</i></a>, Mark Fisher said ""This compilation is like the <i>Nuggets</i> of early 1980s bedroom electronica."" Maybe. <i>Nuggets</i> tracks were cumulative, each one participating in a national explosion of psychedelic rock. It made sense to pile them on top of one another. These minimal waves are are less celebratory and sometimes I feel that by collecting them I'm participating in a no-longer-imposed isolationism. That's dramatic, though. Minimal wave, as a genre, is rich enough to warrant a second compilation aimed at non-obsessives. <i>Vol. 2</i> once again contains a kind of stylized amateurism that's all but extinct.</p></div>"|16327.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16327-the-minimal-wave-tapes-volume-2/|6.7|Andrew Gaerig

That's California singer and songwriter <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29994-julia-holter/"" target=""_blank"">Julia Holter</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/rising/8769-julia-holter/"" target=""_blank"">talking to Pitchfork recently</a>. This passage from the interview leapt out at me because it gets at what makes her second full-length album special. Like a lot of home-recorded music in the indie sphere in the last few years, <i>Ekstasis</i> makes heavy use of atmosphere. There's plenty of reverb and vocal tracks are braided together into drones; it's the kind of swirly production that's good for hiding mistakes. But nothing Holter does feels random. This album is above all <i>careful</i>, and its deliberate construction allows it to work on a different plane from most music that scans as ""ethereal."" <i>Ekstasis</i> is not the sort of oceanic wash you lose yourself in; instead, Holter's music has a way of snapping tiny moments and small sonic gestures into focus. <i>Ekstasis</i> is above all <i>smart</i>, and it makes no apologies for it.</p>
<p>Holter's work exists at the intersection between pop and ""serious"" music. The mayor of that particular corner is <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5366-laurie-anderson/"" target=""_blank"">Laurie Anderson</a>, and there are obvious parallels between the two. You can hear Anderson in Holter's flat, chant-like inflection, which allows her music and lyrics to do the emotional work. You can also hear it in her love of simplicity and approach to mixing traditional instrumentation and electronics. Another touchstone is the dark magic of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/24961-klaus-nomi/"" target=""_blank"">Klaus Nomi</a>. It's not just that the tracks like ""Fur Felix"" bear a similarity to Nomi tracks like <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IB5yD9QVpPI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Keys of Life""</a>, there's also an undercurrent of ritualism and theatricality in Holter's music. <i>Ekstasis</i> is certainly mysterious, but not because meaning is hard to pin down; it's more that there are so many possible meanings, so many places to focus your attention.</p>
<p>Listening to <i>Ekstasis</i>, I keep thinking about how it differs from music that feels superficially similar. The music of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27876-julianna-barwick/"" target=""_blank"">Julianna Barwick</a>, for example, has liturgical overtones, bringing to mind stone and glass and voices rising in cathedrals. Barwick wants to tap into something beyond words. But Holter's music sounds like it was assembled in a dusty library a floor or two below the sanctuary. It's a few shades darker, but it's also based on ideas first and intuition second. Despite using vocoders, drum machines, and electronics, it feels ""old"" in part because Holter so deliberately connects her music to the distant past. On her <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15932-julia-holter/"" target=""_blank"">debut album</a>, she did so by basing her songs on a play from ancient Greece by Euripides; here, she pulls words and scenarios from literature and mixes them with her own idiosyncratic approach to words. The songs include quotes from the likes of Virginia Woolf and Frank O'Hara. A line from O'Hara's poem ""Having a Coke With You""-- ""I look at you and I would rather look at you than all the portraits in the world""-- animates ""Moni Mon Ami"", nestled amid the twinkling synths, strings, and keyboards that sound like harpsichord are original lines like ""Hours become years when you're gone!""</p>
<p>Where Holter's <i>Tragedy</i> felt more like a tapestry, with vocal tracks mixed in with instrumental bits and interludes, <i>Ekstasis</i> leans toward proper songs, and it palette is more uniform. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13089-in-the-same-room/"" target=""_blank"">""In the Same Room""</a>, despite its chintzy drum machine and mechanized hand-claps, is actually a drama unfolding in close quarters. ""In this very room, we spent the day and looked over antiquities. Don't you remember?"" to which the other character replies, ""Do I know you? I can't recall this face but I want to."" You see it play out on paper on the lyric sheet and it feels like a linear exchange, but Holter twists the voices together and the narrative folds in on itself. It's there as pure, gorgeous sound if you want it-- you don't need to know what the songs are about to immerse yourself in this record-- but the deeper you go, the more the songs open up.</p>
<p>""I can see you but my eyes are not allowed to cry..."" is a lyric from ""Goddess Eyes"", a new version of a song that appeared on <i>Tragedy</i>. It's a line from the Euripides play that inspired her first album, and it's delivered in processed voice reminiscent of a vocoder. So we have a 2,000-year old phrase run through a device that makes a human sound like a 1970s version of the robots of the future. And at the center of all this time travel stands Julia Holter, pulling in references and sounds from everywhere and shaping them into a music that's both haunting and life-affirming, something to make you dream and think.</p></div>"|16352.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16352-ekstasis/|8.6|Mark Richardson

Overdriven riffs, snare rolls, embarrassingly huge climaxes, and even lusher comedowns: Trance, prog, and electro are seeping through the pores of underground dance music. Berlin-based UK expat Paul Rose has been leading the charge with this sort of stuff, stirring controversy with his overtly trancey <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12316-adrenalin/"" target=""_blank"">""Adrenalin""</a> and crafting a hypnotic sugar rush with ""Loss"". Long split between the worlds of 4/4 and bass music, I proposed that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15928-dj-kicks/"" target=""_blank"">last year's <i>DJ-Kicks</i> mix</a> spelled the end of the divide between his bass-oriented Scuba alias and the techno-driven SCB, and his third Scuba album, <i>Personality</i>, meshes well enough with this idea.</p>
<p><i>A Mutual Antipathy</i> had Scuba excavating dubstep structures, and <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14076-triangulation/"" target=""_blank"">Triangulation</a></i> showed him sending out feelers in all sorts of directions, but <i>Personality</i> is essentially a techno album. It's a day-glo, plasticine sort of techno, and it's loaded with way more vocals, hooks, and tuneful melodies than the past output from a producer whose all-encompassing dourness seemed to encroach on even the prettiest moments of his catalog (see <i>Triangulation</i>'s heartbreaking ""Before""). I've always thought that <i>Triangulation</i>'s album cover-- an empty and bare concrete walkway-- was the best visual encapsulation possible for an artist whose music sounded completely devoid of humanity, all computer click, industrial clank, manipulated ciphers, and hollow drums. But look at <i>Personality</i>'s cover art: There's a real piece of a human on there.</p>
<p>Don't let the arm and the sun fool you: opener ""Ignition Key"", even with its wafting breezes of ecstatic ""ooohs,"" is every bit as cold and steely as the rest of his output. It's just reflecting more light, underpinned with the same rubbery bass sounds that defined last year's ""Adrenalin"" 12"". It's followed by the heaving <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29200-shed/"" target=""_blank"">Shed</a>-esque techno of ""Underbelly"", which uses <i>Triangulation</i>'s array of manufacturing sounds: Maybe this new Scuba isn't so unfamiliar after all?</p>
<p>Then we hit ""The Hope"". If you thought ""Adrenalin"" was divisive, well, ""The Hope"" feels like internet trolling. With a lumbering somersault of a beat that combusts into obnoxious blasts of distorted synth, ""The Hope"" is a transparent Big Beat homage, a mid-1990s Chemical Brothers leftover right down to the cheesy and slightly uncomfortable vocal (""Got the camera/ Got the zinc/ Teenage girls/ Stop to think""). It feels defiant and irreverent coming from Scuba, but it works because it's so much fun-- ""big room"" in pretty much every way you can imagine. If you aren't swept up in the serotonin rushes, you're gonna be battered and bruised by its bulldozing path anyway.</p>
<p>From then on, <i>Personality</i> sticks to a fairly consistent template: metallic drums, detached synths, and cheeky vocal samples, all largely sounding deliriously cheery and upbeat. The only thing more surprising than the ""never seen ya break it down like this!"" chipmunk squeak on ""Ne1butu"" is the way the track explodes into a rollicking piano riff. ""July"" deals in the ""Miami Vice"" synth pop of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29058-hyetal/"" target=""_blank"">Hyetal</a>, ""Tulips"" is sickly sweet garage full of feminine pressure-- only weighed down with Scuba's usual leaden low-end-- and even the fairly tepid drum'n'bass exercise ""Cognitive Dissonance"" features a dog bark as one its rhythmic devices. Almost every track features some kind of luxurious, decadent breakdown; songs dissolving into gorgeous vapor trails and glowstick reveries halfway through before coming back up for air-- the same device that made ""Adrenalin"" such a monster and one that doesn't show any signs of diminishing returns.</p>
<p>That's not to say the album is all skittles and sunbursts: ""Action"" is high-octane twitch techno that coasts on snowballing momentum until it sounds like its going to explode from its own energy, and ""Gekko"" sounds a bit like he got lost in his own personal vision of <i>Involver</i>, all writhing basslines and indefatigably chugging chords. Scuba saves the most explosive for the closer: ""If U Want"" takes all of the album's hysteria teases and genre flirtations and bundles them into one convenient package, a four-to-the-floor stormer that recalls the most maximalist extremes of 1990s techno into a sleek, powerful vehicle. Brushed by swirls of synth that hint at climax, triumphantly euphoric chords, and a bassline that sounds like a malfunctioning engine, it's unapologetically enormous, leaving anything close to subtlety in the dust trails behind it.</p>
<p>It's a fitting end to <i>Personality</i>: Perhaps the most go-for-the-jugular thing Scuba's produced, ""If U Want"" still fits into his overarching discography like the rest of the album. Even at its most novel-- and there are a lot of firsts here for Scuba-- you can still hear the same grumbly, bearded guy behind the beats. Where he once used dubstep as the foundation for his distinctive productions, this time he's taking prog house, trance, big beat, rave, old techno, and synth pop, and packaging it up in something stylishly retro, all coated in a futuristic 2012 sheen. It's bound to ruffle feathers and turn off old fans, and in a way, going so outright ""pop"" is one of the gutsiest, risky things a pillar of the scene like Scuba could have done. Thankfully, his Midas touch extends to this stuff as well.</p></div>"|16341.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16341-personality/|8.1|Andrew Ryce

Maybe that crew of neighborhood revivalists has a convincing frontman, too, a would-be Bruce Dickinson or Klaus Meine waiting in the local wings. They've probably got an exquisitely campy name, too, and an allegiant flock that loads into the neighborhood bar for riffs after work on a Friday night. This sort of crossroads between hard rock and heavy metal has a history of inspired legions and full arenas; it has a present, however, of working-class lifers smoking up in late-night practice spaces far and wide.</p>
<p>But most of these bands don't have Christine Davis, a front<i>woman</i> who trades the tight t-shirt machismo of Christian Mistress' more obvious peers for an understated, alluring command. On <i>Possession</i>, the quintet's second LP and first for Relapse, her warm rasp leads the band through no-frills proto-thrash, grandiose classic rock, and smoky doom. On ""Pentagram and Crucifix"", she perfectly mirrors the band's chug-and-release motion, singing in tense spurts before stretching out to howl about wicked religious hierarchies. She practically coos at the start of ""There is Nowhere"", an existential debate about the benefits of mortality, played out over a swampy acoustic rumble that gives way to piercing twin guitars and a meat-grinding march. ""I see truth in the madness,"" Davis roars at the song's peak. ""I will chase it to my last breath."" Looking at another set of contemporaries, she's the kind of female bandleader out in front of several bros that you want to come back to in spite of any stylistic morass, not unlike <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2240-sharon-jones-and-the-dap-kings/"" target=""_blank"">Sharon Jones</a> and her Dap-Kings or Brittany Howard and her Alabama Shakes.</p>
<p>Those comparisons should tell you something about the caliber of the band behind Davis: Guitarists Oscar Sparbel and Ryan McClain match every bit of Davis' versatility, pairing an ear for texture and thickness in the verses with solos that are not only accomplished but also committed to pushing along the songs' momentum. The same goes for bassist Johnny Wulf and drummer Rueben Storey, the two players who, despite being the most removed from the spotlight, best provide the sort of flexible backbone needed for an album with this much range. The title track, for instance, is a resplendent and faithful cover of a song by Swedish doom squad Faith. Storey and Wulf neither plod nor overplay; rather, they saturate the song's space with low, long tones while chasing the guitars. During ""Black to Gold"", the album's true anthem, all five elements coalesce better than they have for Christian Mistress. Davis lends an inescapable hook, Sparbel and McClain duel like two DJs spinning stacks of classic wax, and the rhythm section pushes forward and pulls back with fists-in-the-air enthusiasm. If<i> this</i> band were in <i>that </i>bar in your town on a Friday night, most everyone would raise a sweaty can of a cold domestic and chase the word shit, fuck, or hell with an exclamation ""yeah, that was awesome.""</p>
<p><i>Possession</i> closes, as you might guess, with a slow-build that rises across six minutes from a smoldering acoustic intro that blows kisses<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8581-jimmy-page/"" target=""_blank""> Jimmy Page</a>'s way into a glorious burn-out of slashing solos and manic drum fills. Christian Mistress pulls toward the end, Sparbel and McClain letting their guitar lines linger a little longer beside the drums. During the last minute, all of the elements fade out one by one, with a loop of Davis' wordless incantations circling above the new calm. It's an appropriate taunt from a crew that could be from your town but isn't-- largely because bands like this often aren't lucky enough to find singers this subtle, striking, and strong.</p></div>"|16350.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16350-possession/|7.6|Grayson Currin

Here, the instrumentation is almost self-consciously goofy-- the strings are tinny, the beats are pre-fab, and fade-outs prevent several of these tracks from ever having to actually resolve-- but Knapp's sweet and craggy vocals still manage to temper (and, in some cases, even justify) the goofiness of her backing tracks. The easiest analogue is Julee Cruise, who famously collaborated with David Lynch on the ""Twin Peaks"" soundtrack; Knapp's singing imparts a similar ghostliness, a sense of odd, unsettling discontinuity. The lush ""Nothing to Lose"", especially, feels like it was reverse-engineered to soundtrack a Lynchian moment: something absurd, something sinister, a high, breathy voice cutting through the darkness.</p>
<p>Mostly, though, the record's AM gold-aping sheen is the aural equivalent of smearing a camera lens with Vaseline: these are tracks for dreamily circling a roller rink in tiny shorts, or gently waving your bell-sleeved arms in the air (see Stevie Nicks circa 1976). The atmospherics are paramount, but periodically overwhelming, and when Knapp duets with labelmate <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5231-bill-callahan/"" target=""_blank"">Bill Callahan</a> on two tracks-- ""Spiderweb"" and ""Weeping Willow""-- his voice lands like a brick, leaden and heavy. It's a welcome presence-- an anchor in the fog-- and when Callahan ducks back out, you'll feel yourself craving his unmistakable corporeality.</p>
<p><i>Into the Waves</i> is stylized, but its presentation still manages to suit its content. Mostly, Knapp is searching for a way to slow things down, to allow herself time to catch up: ""Just a little, not a lot/ Just a little time/ is all we've got,"" she sings on ""Close to Me"", before the track blossoms into a kitschy, kicking disco jam. Knapp's is an awfully sympathetic predicament-- whether she dances it off or not.</p></div>"|16348.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16348-into-the-waves/|7.0|Amanda Petrusich

""Nauseous"" is a battering ram in the middle of the album that opens with a set of fuzzed-out power chords and crashing percussion. The guitar solo aims for the rafters while kinetic energy builds for the song's full three minutes. But despite their belligerence, Terry Malts never scream. Actually, throughout the record, frontman Phil Benson's voice rarely shifts out of ""croon."" The vocals make sense considering all three members are also in the ranks of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28886-magic-bullets/"" target=""_blank"">Magic Bullets</a>, a band where Benson's singing owed quite a bit to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2837-morrissey/"" target=""_blank"">Morrissey</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6163-robert-smith/"" target=""_blank"">Robert Smith</a>. And throughout <i>Killing Time</i>, the Bay Area trio explores that balance between their aggressive delivery and their melodic, relatively reserved vocals. So while Benson establishes a toned down version of his post-punk pout from Magic Bullets, everything else launches straight from the punk rock gut.</p>
<p>Their wall of fuzz is the key to <i>Killing Time</i>'s success: It's the equalizer between vanilla singsong and raucous house party. And most of the credit for the ballsier end of the spectrum goes to guitarist Corey Cunningham, who rips. When he's not pumping out an absurdly dynamic guitar solo, he's churning through power chords or adding jagged fills. That's not to say that Benson and drummer Nathan Sweatt aren't pulling their weight, but instrumentally, Cunningham's guitar is the stand-out. Even on songs that swoon more than pummel, like ""Tumble Down"" and ""No Good For You"", he manages to push through a few excellent riffs.</p>
<p>The other end of that balancing act is important, though, as Benson's singing and the band's melodies keep Terry Malts from becoming a classic punk sound-alike. There are vocal hints of their post-punk allegiances in the verses of ""I'm Neurotic"", but songs like the gleeful ""I Do"" owe more to pop punk than Moz. That said, when their balance leans too hard in one direction or the other, things can get tedious. ""Waiting Room"" tones down the noise and puts Benson's voice up front, and it's one of the longest and most repetitive tracks.</p>
<p>And lyrically, these guys are pretty uneven. For the most part, they sing about love: On ""Something About You"", it's all on the table (""I just want to be with you""). And while the straightforward love songs never fail them, things get dicier with the weightier topics. The opening verse of ""Nauseous"" tackles religious acceptance (""I'm not trying to tell you how you should live your life/ So why then should I listen to you condemn me for mine?""), but it could be a commentary on any lifestyle. Universality works in their favor there, but ""No Sir, I'm Not a Christian"" doesn't dip into a gray area (""I don’t believe in a divine wisdom""), and its bold message doesn't wear well after multiple listens. The worst offender is ""Mall Dreams"", a jumpy, by-the-numbers attack on consumerism (""Who are you when all you do is consume?"") that's anchored by a jokey chorus that's funny maybe once (""A zombie's still a zombie in J. Crew!"").</p>
<p>Both Benson and Cunningham have made it clear that they started Terry Malts because they were tired of the comparatively clean Magic Bullets sound. ""After years of over-thinking songs, we wanted to simplify and get to our inner Trogg,"" <a href=""http://exclaim.ca/Reviews/PopAndRock/terry_malts-killing_time"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Benson said</a>. With their harmonies and swooning vocals, they're never quite Troggs-level elemental, but these guys clearly know how to wail. So thank god they cranked that distortion up and dumbed the chord progressions down.</p></div>"|16349.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16349-terry-malts-killing-time/|6.9|Evan Minsker

It can bring to mind the slower, low-tuned psychedelic metal of post-Sabbath American groups like Saint Vitus, Trouble, and Pentagram along with Sweden's Candlemass, UK act Cathedral, and descendants who are crustier (<a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/4719-yob/"" target=""_blank"">YOB</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/show-no-mercy/6478-show-no-mercy/"" target=""_blank"">Asunder</a>), more flatlining (<a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/3984-sunn-o/"" target=""_blank"">Sunn O)))</a>), seemingly suicidal (Loss), and exceedingly smoked-up (<a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/23954-sleep/"">Sleep</a>). Then come the backward-glancing modern traditionalists like weathered North Carolina crew Hour of 13, Rhode Island upstarts <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30187-pilgrim/"" target=""_blank"">Pilgrim</a>, and now, even more gloriously, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30107-pallbearer/"" target=""_blank"">Pallbearer</a>.</p>
<p>The Little Rock, Ark., quartet sounds much older than its years on its fantastic debut LP, <i>Sorrow and Extinction</i>. The band released a <a href=""http://pallbearer.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">three-song demo</a> in 2010, but reach greater heights here, due to both sharper songwriting and better production. Really, even though they end their <i>Sorrow</i> thank-you list with a blushing ""and, of course, Black Sabbath,"" they go much deeper than that. You could throw in Saint Vitus and early Candlemass (1986's <i>Epicus Doomicus Metallicus</i>, especially), but it almost makes more sense to reference post-Sleep duo <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3222-om/"" target=""_blank"">Om</a> for the way each song insistently, specifically reaches for a focused transcendence. That said, there's more variation and catharsis here, despite the occasional <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9239-mick-barr/"" target=""_blank"">Mick Barr</a>/all-nighter riffing. It seems like a simple formula, and maybe it is,  but the execution's flawless. It also shifts subtly and  continually: They mix  in psychedelia, 1970s prog melodies, clean vocal  harmonies, and ambient keyboards without sacrificing a certain  smoked-up genre purity.</p>
<p>We get five songs in just under 50 minutes, each  mountain of slow, majestic chords bleeding into one glorious cathedral  of riffs and soaring vocals. Here is where their insistence on an overall flow pays off. The longest and best piece is the scene-setting opener, ""Foreigner"". It starts with tentative, pretty nylon-stringed acoustic guitars that, after two minutes, are joined by carefully played, delicate drums until everything crashes with a huge distorted crescendo. The riffs are beautiful and memorable, somehow both gentle and crushing, but the real key here is vocalist (and guitarist) <span class=""st"">Brett Campbell, who I first heard via his soaring (and surprising) guest spot on Loss' beautifully bleak 2011 collection, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/show-no-mercy/8717-best-albums-of-2011/"" target=""_blank""><i>Despond</i></a>, an album that more usually features a guttural vocal gargle.</span></p>
<p>That contrast is an essential aspect of the band, which is why when we posted an <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12846-an-offering-of-grief/"" target=""_blank"">""An Offering of Grief""</a>, I mentioned the Pallbearer featured ""[a] vocalist who sings."" Campbell has been described as a young Ozzy Osbourne, and that influence is certainly there, but imagine if a young Ozzy had the ability to transform into Geddy Lee. This is music that would be interesting as instrumentals-- the guitars are that good-- but when you add a singer who can match that kind of dynamic surge, it goes somewhere else entirely. The songs have room to be extra patient in part because Pallbearer possess this weapon. On ""Given to the Grave"", for instance, we get more than five minutes of the acoustic strumming before the crunch and an ever-escalating Campbell. There's no need to rush when the climaxes are that huge, and with his voice, there's always one new wrinkle on the horizon.</p>
<p>The clean, anthemic feel is reminiscent of <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/30084-40-watt-sun/"" target=""_blank"">40 Watt Sun</a>'s 2011 LP, <i>The Inside Room</i>. That band features vocalist and guitarist Patrick Walker of the 1990s UK doom group Warning taking five songs to just about 50 minutes, but with a more obviously introspective feel than we have here-- <i>The Inside Room</i>'s an apt title-- with moments that feel a bit like slowcore heroes <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/18712-codeine/"" target=""_blank"">Codeine</a>. <i>Sorrow and Extinction</i> isn't first-person in that way, and it's more clearly metal: This is sweeping, outdoor, mountaintop music. The lyrics have a mannered, sword-and-sorcery feel, situating death and sadness in towers, pyres, journeys, and the ancients; but even if you don't follow along with what the songs ""mean,"" Campbell has one of those deliveries that brings shivers regardless of what he's singing.</p>
<p>That's the other thing that sets Pallbearer apart: As ""down"" and death-focused as the words and band name might be, this is uplifting stuff. (When the overlapping solos and subtle, arcing synth haze of ""Given to the Grave"" bring <i>Sorrow and Extinction</i> to an ecstatic end, you'll be thinking more about life than death, believe me.) Ultimately, it feels like Pallbearer have created their own version of a traditional jazz funeral march, or like they went ahead and invented some sort of ""celebratory doom."" Whatever you want to call it, the record's a triumph.</p></div>"|16345.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16345-sorrow-and-extinction/|8.4|Brandon Stosuy

After all, its immaculate textures and brisk, glossy electro-pop are the kind you hear in moderately high-end clothing stores or spinning classes-- places where people reconnect with their need for quick fixes. But SVIIB's career to date has been a process of streamlining and economization: since their 2008 debut, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7374-school-of-seven-bells/"" target=""_blank"">Alpinisms</a>, </i>they've continuously pared down song length, sonic clutter, as well as personnel, and now on <i>Ghostory</i>, Alejandra Deheza and Ben Curtis come across like they've achieved a Zen sort of perfection as a duo. Whereas the sound they courted on <i>Alpinisms</i> intended to recreate the overwhelming physical bliss of shoegaze, <i>Ghostory </i>takes after a fundamental meditative tranquility, where thoughts and emotions are acknowledged as they pass through the calm without being judged as intrinsically good or bad.</p>
<p>Though <i>Ghostory</i> claims a conceptual framework involving a ""young girl named Lafaye and the ghosts that surround her life,"" plainspoken song titles like ""Love Play"" and ""Show Me Love"" give you a fairly accurate survey of what to expect topically. And perhaps the departure of Deheza's sister Claudia from the fold resulted in SVIIB jettisoning the insular mysticism of old for intelligible emoting-- ""The light of day gives me no relief/Because I see you in everything,"" ""You take my love and leave me empty/ And all you feel is a fist of draining sand."" Those are the first lines on the first two songs, and <i>Ghostory </i>ultimately invests in the strange tension they achieve by Deheza's frictionless vocals.</p>
<p>Though unerringly composed, Deheza doesn't sing with the brassy confidence of a pop star, but rather the steadiness of a surgeon-- ""this happened, here's how I feel,"" and melodies move straight and orderly, dots continuously connected. It uses the unease of romantic disturbance as some kind of baseline, breakups far enough in the past to allow perspective, but new loves never <i>too </i>new (oddly enough, this is the sort of mundane restlessness that triggers consumer culture). By <i>Ghostory</i>'s end, Deheza coos, ""you kindle me, babe,"" but note she's not ablaze or smoldering. In short, recast most of <i>Ghostory </i>with acoustic guitars and suck out the aggressive beats and you might have something similar to an Imogen Heap or Dido record that might otherwise be off your radar until they get sampled by your favorite cloud rap producer. Or those ""comedown"" ballads that got stuck on Chemical Brothers albums with BPMs closer to their surroundings. Or, perhaps the club remixes of similarly prosaic love songs like Coldplay's ""Clocks"" or Sarah McLachlan's ""Sweet Surrender."" If you can't concede the awesomeness of those, then we're not gonna get very far here.</p>
<p>If you <i>can</i>, <i>Ghostory </i>is at its best a very pleasurable realization of niche.<i> </i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12847-the-night/"" target=""_blank"">""The Night""</a> hurtles towards a chorus of Deheza repeating, ""devour me,"" with an inappositely chipper tone as 32nd-note hi-hats surround her like piranhas, while ""Love Play"" contrasts vocal shimmer with busily heaving bottom-end in case you've forgotten Curtis' former gig <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27524-the-secret-machines/"" target=""_blank"">Secret Machines</a> had one of the most righteously loud rhythm sections going. While those are distillation, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12978-lafaye/"" target=""_blank"">""Lafaye""</a> shows compositional advancement, initially sounding like wheelhouse SVIIB with its geysers of processed guitar distortion before a vowel-driven hook gets subtly recast in three ways-- at first in a striking but standard minor key, then as a major-key pivot and a more tonally ambivalent final chorus that releases its pent momentum. It's when they curb the momentum that <i>Ghostory </i>reveals its limitations: Without any percussive underpinning, ""Reappear"" and ""Show Me Love"" can't succeed in developing atmosphere, simply because you can't have atmosphere in an airlock. The overwhelming textural sterility brings to mind Curtis and Deheza's recording in the clinical white studio gracing the cover of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7057-now-here-is-nowhere/"">first Secret Machines record.</a></p>
<p>Since <i>Ghostory</i> as a whole tries to present SVIIB as a scientific process, it's fitting that its last two tracks come off like a final synthesis. ""White Wind"" is SVIIB as a platonic ideal, Deheza achieving robotic actualization (indeed, the melodies are similar to that of a digital touch-tone) as Curtis and drummer Christopher Colley go nuts with percussive studio tricks.  All of which sets the band up for an ultimate date with destiny. While the breakbeat and honking synth riff of ""Bye Bye Bye"" inspired Amy Granzin <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16337-ghostory/"" target=""_blank"">to allude to</a> the impact My Bloody Valentine's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvkK0mO7fXg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Soon""</a> had on <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16337-ghostory/"" target=""_blank""><i>Disconnect From Desire</i></a>, I think she jumped the gun since <i>Ghostory</i>'s eight-minute closer ""When You Sing"" is quite possibly the most blatant ""Soon"" homage in recorded history. Still, there's something actually quite charming about how overt their intentions are: If you've been called an electronic act <i>and </i>a shoegaze act <i>and </i>a dance act, ""Soon"" is your K2, and maybe that drum loop and cycle of gelatinous guitar chords are just public domain now, no different from a band of record collectors utilizing the ""Be My Baby"" drum intro or vinyl crackle to evoke a certain realm of emotions.</p>
<p>It's crucial to acknowledge this crack in the veneer, since it's tough to think of SVIIB as being nerds of any type, having crushes on music or people. I suppose we should just come to an agreement that a record that doesn't explicitly tell you how to feel isn't necessarily doing something wrong, and make no mistake, SVIIB clearly know what they're after on <i>Ghostory</i>.  Maybe too much so, since the combination of protracted sterility and innate desire typically manifest in things like an oppressively planned Valentine's Day or one of those inner-peace retreats that cost a shitload of money. Those are the pretty, mixed messages that <i>Ghostory </i>sends.</p></div>"|16337.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16337-ghostory/|6.9|Ian Cohen

Their song ""Shut Up and Let Me Go"" appeared on an <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMB5fELD0iw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">iPod commercial</a> in 2008 and last year in the UK ""That's Not My Name"" trailed numerous <a href=""http://youtu.be/rNm6RHgZmQ4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">sponsored ads</a> for ""The X-Factor"". Their music is highly effective in these short bursts, competing with all sorts of other sensory noise in a game of who can be the loudest.</p>
<p>The Ting Tings' sophomore record is titled <i>Sounds From Nowheresville</i>, and the Nowheresville invoked might as well be ad-land itself. The restless genre-hopping vibe makes this feel less like an album and more like a series of tracks written to briefs. They flit from noir-electro (""Silence""), cod reggae (""Soul Killing""), and bratty guitar riffs (""Hang It Up""). The only common thread is how uniformly bad everything is. I suppose on that level it works: <i>Sounds From Nowheresville</i> makes me want to buy chocolate, try on clothes, take a holiday-- anything but listen to this record.</p>
<p>""Give It Back"" has a nice beat to it, and it should-- it's pretty much a wholesale rip from LCD Soundsystem's <a href=""http://youtu.be/gJ2np7R-Uwg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""North American Scum""</a>. Likewise, the heavy guitar pop of ""Hang It Up"" feels like it could exist on the same playground as Sleigh Bells; but where that band makes triumphant school-bell jams, the Ting Tings come over like the class bully: the song feels heartless, cynical in conception, and concerned only with its own sport. Later on, a rap verse from Jules de Martino, the usually silent half of the duo, makes a strong case for a bad record's worst moment.</p>
<p>As ridiculous as Martino's rapping might be, lead singer Katie White one-ups him at every turn. Her spoken-word verses on ""Guggenheim"" are a perfect example. Delivering a particularly phony tale of heartbreak, her story is-- like most things on this record-- something you've heard a million times: girl falls for boy; boy caught in bed with a beautiful, popular girl; and the relationship is lost. The narrative calls for at least a veneer of vulnerability, but her delivery comes across like she's reading a script. White displays no emotion here or elsewhere: There are two modes, shouting or shouting a little louder. When she finally reaches the payoff chorus, all she has is one ridiculous unrelated line: ""This time I'm gonna get it right/ I'm gonna play my bass at the Guggenheim,"" delivered with all the pent-up fury of Eric Cartman.</p>
<p>It almost feels like folly to try and engage with discussing this thing musically-- it's so cold and random. Most of the time, <i>Sounds From Nowheresville</i> evokes the same sensation as being <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rickrolled</a> for the 40th time, or watching the entirety of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZZ7oFKsKzY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Nyan Cat's 10-hour flight</a>. Essentially, things you don't choose to experience. But then, that's the crux of the Ting Tings. As long as they keep writing this sync music bait, it won't matter whether or not you choose to hear <i>Sounds From Nowheresville</i>, it'll end up finding you anyway.</p></div>"|16334.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16334-the-ting-tings-sounds-from-nowheresville/|1.8|Hari Ashurst

There were certainly plenty of associations that could be drawn between that song and other artists-- it fed off an unholy amalgam of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4134-the-stooges/"">Stooges</a>' grit, the blissful repetition of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/666-can/"">Can</a>, the planet-sized riffing of <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Loop"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Loop</a>. But there was poise to it, a sense of all those elements running off one another to create a glorious noise, mapped out in a place you could retreat to and get lost in for days at a time. The touring undertaken to promote <i>Guider</i> brought <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3872-sonic-youth/"">Sonic Youth</a>'s Steve Shelley into the Chicago-based band's fold-- a natural fit for the eternally cyclical guitar lines singer Brian Case and Jonathan Van Herik were obsessing over at the time. Shelley returns on <i>Pre Language</i>, now a fully paid-up member of the band, on the most concise account of Disappears' music to date.</p>
<p>Instead of acting as a jumping-off point to something new, ""Revisiting"" has been treated as a dead end, a place where the group's fixation on repetition was shoved out to its natural brink. It's not altogether surprising to find Disappears acting this way. There was a strong shift in style between their 2010 debut, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14162-lux/"">Lux</a></i>, and <i>Guider</i>, from sweet-toothed guitar pop to the nihilistic Detroit 1969 abandon of tracks like ""Halo"". <i>Pre Language</i> is a further modification, with Case clearly keen to show off his Anglophile tendencies by channeling <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1445-the-fall/"">the Fall</a>'s Mark E. Smith on a number of songs (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12966-replicate/"" target=""_blank"">""Replicate""</a>, ""Fear of Darkness""). Strangely, considering Shelley's involvement, there's also a whiff of 1990s alt-rock also-rans, the kind of acts that trailed in Sonic Youth's wake. ""All Gone White"" could be a track by long-forgotten <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/St.+Johnny"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">St. Johnny</a>, one of the many eyebrow-raising recipients of a major deal (at DGC) during the storied post-grunge feeding frenzy.</p>
<p>That same fate isn't likely to befall Disappears any time soon, but on <i>Pre Language</i> they are producing their most commercial work to date. When it peaks, on the forceful ""Hibernation Sickness"" and through the shivery guitars of ""Brother Joliene"", there's a natural buoyancy at work, with the band's psych impulses, pop flair, and scratchy guitar passages all working in tandem. But too often it slides into unremarkable sludge, making it feel like the blown-open sound and ambition of <i>Guider</i> isn't being capitalized on. ""Minor Patterns"" resembles an inconsequential <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1006-the-dandy-warhols/"">Dandy Warhols</a> album track when the chorus rolls in, wandering aimlessly in a haze of shoegazery fuzz. Even tracks that lean back into Disappears' trusted framework of repetition don't find the same kind of purpose as before, with ""Love Drug"" trudging aimlessly in place for much of its duration.</p>
<p>The fundamental difference between <i>Pre Language</i> and its predecessor is a sense of identity, that ability to turn obvious touchstones inside-out to land in a place easily defined as Disappears' own territory. This album feels more like a series of genre exercises, a place in which they occasionally work up a palpable tension, but never enough to make this more than an adequate diversion from the resources they're obviously sourcing. It's possible that ""Revisiting"" was so monolithic in size that it became something from which Disappears needed to make a hasty retreat, fearing such an exercise couldn't be equaled. There would certainly be no point in repeating something like that again. But there's heightened aspiration there, a sense of loosening the band's tightly wound sound to see where it would take them, bringing them to a place <i>Pre Language</i> doesn't arrive at often enough.</p></div>"|16343.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16343-pre-language/|6.2|Nick Neyland

""And I wanna write a fiction inspired by these events. And I've already got the soundtrack floating in my head: MELODIES OF TENSION, SHAME, DARKNESS AND SECRECY."" In a recent interview with <a href=""http://www.thestoolpigeon.co.uk/features/interview-james-ferraro.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Stool Pigeon</a>, he talked up <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29855-lana-del-rey/"">Lana Del Rey</a>'s shaky <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/45092-watch-lana-del-reys-performances-on-tonights-saturday-night-live/"">SNL</a></i> appearance, calling it ""a high point in our civilization right now."" After tooling away in the noise underground for years, the modicum of exposure afforded to Ferraro via the acclaim for <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15992-james-ferraro-far-side-virtual/"">Far Side Virtual</a></i> has given him a platform, and his calloused fingers are hammering away at his touchscreen (a bootleg Android phone, natch, as per the Quietus interview) in an attempt to maintain our digital gazes. ""VAPORS N 1 HOUR,"" he yelped on <a href=""https://twitter.com/#!/BODY_GUARD_/status/172741531269201920"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Twitter</a>, just prior to delivering this free mixtape under his new Bodyguard moniker.</p>
<p>This is a quickie follow-up to the similarly released <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16171-bebetune-inhale-c-4/"" target=""_blank"">Inhale C-4 $$$$$</a> </i>under Ferraro's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30097-bebetunes/"">Bebetune$</a> name, thankfully dropping much of the hip-hop inspired material pockmarked throughout that release. Instead, we get Bodyguard, apparently the name of a band Ferraro has formed, who mostly trade in all-caps track titles with occasional hashtags and underscores thrown in (""#FLAMETHROWER"", ""Ice_Cut_Digital""). It continues Ferraro's preference for spewing digital debris all over his work, a feeling akin to piling up a dumpster with Tumblr detritus and funneling it into song. Much of it bears the same kind of off-the cuff, hit-a-preset-and-go feel of his most recent work, with sets of tinny loops curling around one another, occasionally edging toward the eight-minute mark. <i>Silica Gel</i> is a long-ass grind for the Ritalin-addled audience Ferraro is courting, with the combined runtime just over the one-hour mark.</p>
<p>But at least there are a few threads of inspiration to cling onto on here, which sets it apart from the dead-zone drudgery of <i>Inhale C-4 $$$$$. </i>The opening ""H.U.M2.E.R."" makes it feel like this might simply be more of the same, with a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5310-rihanna/"">Rihanna</a> sample clumsily poking through the glitchy gunk. But that proves to be a false start to an uneven mixtape, which lacks the conceptual weight that hooked people into <i>Far Side Virtual</i>. Instead, this feels like a loose collection of ideas Ferraro had hanging around his hard drive. Occasionally it's pretty, on the yapping dog groove of ""E-CIG"", or in the gently oscillating pulse that lopes through ""Ice_Cut_Digital"". At other times there's a towering build of maximal fury (""#ACIDRAIN""), a limp dip into malfunctioning R&amp;B (""RAIDEN - BLUE LIGHTS # NZT - 48""), and plenty of attempts at assimilating the feeling of staring into a cracked iPhone screen while crunching a disgarded Nintendo 3DS underfoot (""SEX TAPE"", ""BLACK AND RED"", ""BLOOD TYPE : 5 HOUR ENERGY"").</p>
<p>It looks like Ferraro will spend a decent portion of this year with Bodyguard. Live shows and a debut album are <a href=""http://hipposintanks.net/bodyguard/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">promised</a> for the summer. If that's the case, he would be wise to flesh out the concept a little, which is the central problem with this mixtape. After being so assured in his vision, <i>Silica Gel</i> is Ferraro spinning his wheels, occasionally finding flashes of inspiration, but mostly chasing his own (animated .gif) tail. In his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16171-bebetune-inhale-c-4/"">review</a> of <i>Inhale C-4 $$$$$,</i> Pitchfork's Brandon Soderberg talked about <i>Far Side Virtual</i> being critic-proof, partially because negative reviews could be dismissed as listeners' not getting the joke. But there's some truth in the saying that a good joke never needs explaining, and in interviews it sometimes feels like Ferraro is falling over himself in an attempt to get his point across, albeit in an entertaining and highly readable manner. Here, there doesn't even seem to be a point. Which, considering his track record, may well be the point.</p></div>"|16346.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16346-silica-gel/|5.2|Nick Neyland

Her recent marriage nearly didn't last as long as Kim Kardashian's suspiciously short nuptials (though they later reconciled) and her drug problems proved more humiliating, albeit less damaging, than Lindsay Lohan's. And yet I'd argue that O'Connor's motivations are very different from those of her younger co-headliners, and that's before I heard the fame-is-bullshit anthem ""V.I.P."" that closes her latest album. For a quarter-century now, she's been a professional mess, with an often antagonistic attitude toward her audience and seemingly no self-censoring apparatus. When that outrage fueled her music, the mess could be fascinating, but when it inspired albums of big-band or reggae numbers, the mess was tedious, tiring, alienating, self-sabotaging. But lately it's been mostly heartbreaking, with an ill-fated marriage, a bad drug buy, and reports of suicide attempts exposing the increasingly frayed lines between her public and private personas.</p>
<p><i>How About I Be Me (And You Be You)?</i> might seem self-exploitive if it didn't so thoroughly comment on and confound her recent controversies, or if the songs didn't sound like they emanate from the same place as her romantic catastrophes. It's been ages since O'Connor's music so perfectly reflected her struggles, and about as long since she's released an album quite so devastating. In truth, these songs are actually a bit unwieldy and occasionally ugly, as she relies so relentlessly on rudimentary rhyme schemes and clunky lyrics. Such flaws are all the more apparent given the diligent unobtrusiveness of the solemn piano chords and trenchant guitar strums. But the lyrical coarseness serves an important function, reinforcing the urgency of O'Connor's performances and creating the impression that she has worked hard and fast to document her emotions at their rawest and wildest. These songs don't sound like they were written; they sound like they were scrawled in a shaky but determined hand.</p>
<p>The album doesn't start at a place of devastation, but with a sweetly sincere declaration of love and commitment. Against a rhythmic acoustic strum that gently mimics a hip-hop beat, ""4th and Vine"" captures the excitement of new love and the invigoration of devoting yourself to another person, and O'Connor's voice, which conveys rage so perfectly, is soft, even playful. Of course, it doesn't work out-- not in real life and not in the narrative of the album. What follows that first burst of contentment is a bleak psychological portrait of the artist as lover, mother, and public figure, and the dark depths of these songs only make the exuberance of ""4th and Vine"" all the more harrowing. On the next song, O'Connor steps into the perspective of a junkie on ""Reason With Me"", and the parallels between the character's problems and herself are obvious: ""If I loved someone, I might lose someone.""</p>
<p>Perhaps the best song here is dedicated to her youngest son. On ""I Had a Baby""-- which is as straightforward as that title suggests-- she wonders how to tell her child that he was born out of wedlock, the result of an affair with a married man. But her caustic despair springs not from her anger with the father but with her own powerlessness to protect her child from this sad predicament. In most cases, we as listeners and especially as critics are supposed to keep the art separate from the artist, to avoid letting real-life events shade the music with too much meaning or context. With <i>How About I Be Me</i>, however, that's impossible, not simply because her failed marriage is too fresh in our memory, but because O'Connor doesn't let herself or her listeners make such tidy distinctions.</p>
<p>What to make, then, of the fact that the most embittered track here is not an O'Connor original, but a cover of a track by John Grant? With its graphic imagery, startling admissions, and even a self-deprecating bald joke, it doesn't even sound out of place: ""You tell me that my life is based upon a lie,"" O'Connor howls. ""I casually mention that I pissed in your coffee."" She doesn't back away from any of its ungracious sentiments, but owns up to even the most shameful confession. It's the anti-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12105-someone-like-you/"">""Someone Like You""</a>, although it achieves roughly the same effect: By so thoroughly humanizing the spectacle, <i>How About I Be Me</i> makes it impossible not to sympathize with and even root for O'Connor.</p></div>"|16339.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16339-how-about-i-be-me-and-you-be-you/|7.6|Stephen M.

I developed this position at a time when it was useful to a have a Thing and for that Thing to kindle debate. Garden-variety contrarianism? A little, but I was a liberal arts major on a Midwestern state university campus, and for the first time in my life the most cred-heavy rocker in the immediate vicinity. There was hot indie truth to be spoken to power. In head Loafer Eric Bachmann, I'd found my wingman: Here was a guy who gave zero fucks, one who came from an era in which the appropriate response to a buzzstrong debut was to retreat to your undersized Cali label and record an album about just how full of shit everyone is, yourself included.</p>
<p>That album was 1995's <i>Vee Vee</i>. It arrived after <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15688-icky-mettle/"" target=""_blank"">Icky Mettle</a></i>, the debut that saw AoL emerge as underground heroes during a period that also saw their home base-- Chapel Hill, North Carolina-- championed as a launching pad, like a Brooklyn that someone had papered over with dogwoods. The band probably bristles at the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3268-pavement/"" target=""_blank"">Pavement</a> comparison above, but the liner notes to this reissue contrast the bands, and the <i>Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain</i> reissue jokes of an upcoming book titled <i>Better Than Archers of Loaf: Pavement for Dummies</i> (imagine me upon its release, red-faced amidst my college newspaper colleagues).</p>
<p>The Loaf started out as affable goofballs with a penchant for scene politics. When they returned with <i>Vee Vee</i>, they were changed. Suddenly brawny and ill-tempered, they sounded upset. I was too young to catch <i>Vee Vee</i>'s bluster, but like holiday tunes and odes to cities, songs about ""the scene"" are evergreen. So I was scribbling lines like, ""The underground is overcrowded,"" and, ""It's too bad that your music doesn't matter,"" in spiral notebooks years after they'd arrived, years before I might have embarrassed a future self with them on Facebook. <i>Vee Vee</i> is a particular kind of screed, one that is as smart and accurate as it is angry and self-destructive. It's also funny as hell: Run Bachmann up against whichever lampooner you think has indie culture by the balls and see who comes out ahead. (I'll submit this line, from ""Death in the Park"": ""It's always the same people/ Pissing the same people off."") <i>Vee Vee</i> might just have easily been reissued with a Blogspot/Tumblr doublepack instead of the traditional collector-detritus disc two.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Bachmann's well-honed bark serves as a base to all his acid. It never sounded better than on bloody-chin classics like <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25ymumzyWMU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Harnessed in Slums""</a>-- a college radio smash-- and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bg4eHKwLRMA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Fabricoh""</a>. The best of the second disc-- <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eocnxDw0i5Y"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Telepathic Traffic""</a>, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwIeuFuE6xE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Bacteria""</a>-- don't add to the band's legacy so much as remind how pleasant it is to be yelled at by Bachmann. He has a way of laughing at his peers, his audience, and himself without seeming dickish. On ""Fabricoh"" and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41e1g4eMFGs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Underdogs of Nipomo""</a> he plays vocal <i>Tetris</i>, stacking phrases into solid walls, missing often enough to leave holes.</p>
<p>The band, too, was never stronger or more pungent. The guitars do that distinctly mid-1990s indie thing in which notes bend or dissipate before phrases finish. On the slow-swinging chorus of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwAkLW_V3wc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Floating Friends""</a> they vine upward and offer a prettiness rare to this band. The everyman rhythm section is drunk, but only a little. When the group distills Bachmann's derision into a mild torpor on <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4cBgM4-bfg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Greatest of All Time""</a>, the Loaf sound like the only band on the planet smart enough not to apply for the title.</p>
<p>The remastering here is nice even if <i>Vee Vee</i> always sounded great. The second disc drags on several early demos but is a valuable archive (splitting hairs: The band's best-ever non-album material, <i>Vs. The Greatest of All Time</i> EP, belongs here spiritually, sonically, and chronologically but was sacrificed to the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15688-icky-mettle/"" target=""_blank""><i>Icky Mettle</i> reissue</a>). AoL reached their greatest heights on <i>Vee Vee</i>, but it's also the album where they overplayed their hand. Indie rock deserves to be clowned as hard and as often as anything, but when you reach the point where you're screaming <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsEQrqZYuPw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Nostalgia!""</a> at your audience, or towing around the flatulent <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGhBifYDwg8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Underachievers March and Fight Song""</a>, you might just need a vacation.</p>
<p>Bachmann wasn't a prophet or a culture vulture. I think he was a smart guy who made smart observations about things that irked him, but his cynicism corroded <i>Vee Vee</i>. On songs like <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axOnO7TLTvo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Worst Has Yet to Come""</a>, I can hear Bachmann convincing himself that his position is untenable. The first line of that song is, ""We're on the outside/ And we're all making fun of you."" This level of bitterness can seem the Truth, but it takes so much energy; <i>Vee Vee</i> is as wearying as it is incisive. By the time I was actually listening to this music, Bachmann had gravitated toward the quotidian concerns of the American songbook with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/860-crooked-fingers/"" target=""_blank"">Crooked Fingers</a>. <i>Vee Vee</i>'s humor, commentary, and song-by-song knockout punches make that energy seem worthwhile. As when the biggest guy in the bar has your back, <i>Vee Vee</i> is filled with extra spittle and bottomless bravado. When I want to laugh at, scream at, or revel in indie rock's existence, <i>Vee Vee</i> is what I reach for, and Bachmann is still the guy I want on my side.</p></div>"|16333.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16333-vee-vee/|8.4|Andrew Gaerig

Composed of soft vocals, grand piano, and subtle electronic elements, it's a dead ringer for Gilles Peterson's label's typical sound. What makes Will Ozanne slightly different is that he takes away both the usual acid-jazz and soul undertones and replaces them with a stone-faced funereality that brings him closer to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28425-james-blake/"" target=""_blank"">James Blake</a> than anything else. In fact, given Ozanne's remarkable vocal similarity to Blake, it's easy to see <i>The Keychain Collection</i> as a sort of alternate-universe <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15081-james-blake/"" target=""_blank"">James Blake</a></i>, a collection of half-written piano chamber-pop trifles, only without all the defiantly fucked electronic manipulation.</p>
<p>Opener ""Heavy Petting"" lays it all out nicely: pitched-down vocal samples, gently submerging basslines, artificial percussion, and various gasps of silvery synth map out a backdrop behind Ozanne's breathy whispers. It has all the low-end physicality of bass music, but it's meted out with the care and caution of cocktail-lounge fare, a paradoxical combination that both endows <i>Keychain Collection</i> with a sort of languid torpor but also raises it above just another album of chillout electronica. He does get more assertive occasionally: The wildly panning, crushed-frequency drums on ""To Repel Ghosts"" add much-needed grit to the wandering piano, while the sonorous <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2233-plans/"" target=""_blank"">Plans</a>-</i>era Death Cab-isms of ""Pebble Dash"" are saved by woozy chords and strange bleeping noises.</p>
<p><i>Keychain Collection</i> is primarily a record built on those little details: A casual perusal reveals some distantly pretty piano melodies, but listen closer and something like ""Tissues &amp; Fivers"" is an elegant watercolor of textural intricacy and contrast, turning that single piano motif into something dynamic and transformative, while ""I Don't Want You Calling"" throws raucous Pearson Sound-like drum machine samples onto a plaintive backing track, erecting a twisting rhythmic skeleton out of pretty much nothing.</p>
<p>Even if it's hard to escape how much Ozanne sounds like James Blake on the vocal tracks, it's this sort of intimate exactitude of production that separates him from his ostensible peer. Normally a perfectly trained ear breeds stuffiness and rigidity, but here it works in Ozanne's favor. ""Fancy Restaurant"" is built around a single, endlessly repeated vocal phrase, constructed from all the same elements as the rest of the album-- brushed drums and flinty synths-- but Ozanne's gorgeous piano melody tumbles through the gauntlet of electronic noises gracefully, like water trickling down a knotted cliff face. It's the album's most addictive song and one of its unashamedly simplest, proving that even if Gang Colours can be reduced to a formula, it's at the least a highly enjoyable one.</p>
<p><i>The Keychain Collection</i> is the kind of album likely to be eaten up by the sort of casual electronic music fan who devours the rest of the Brownswood catalog. Let's be honest with ourselves: This is pretty much coffee-shop fare. But it's smart, clever coffee-shop fare, with enough substance and and detail to stand on its own two feet, however dainty they might be. It's not a record that's going to hit you over the head-- it's almost fatally unassuming and more likely to meekly ask if you maybe wanted to spare a few seconds to listen-- but it's one that will offer a surprising amount of replay value if you accept its coy, hesitant invitation.</p></div>"|16338.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16338-the-keychain-collection/|7.0|Andrew Ryce

Take the charmingly shambling <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/mickmanmoose"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pond</a>, a psych-rocking Australian three-piece that shares two members with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28673-tame-impala/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Tame Impala</a>, the psych-rocking Australian four-piece responsible for 2010's terrific <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14279-innerspeaker/"" target=""_blank""><i>Innerspeaker</i></a>. That debut put a revisionist spin on guitar-driven psychedelia so much so that, unlike other bands mining for retrograded, kaleidoscopic gold, <i>Innerspeaker</i> felt beholden to no specific time or place. So it's with <i>Beard, Wives, Denim</i> that Tame Impala alumni Nick Allbrook and Jay Watson (here with Joseph Ryan) give the same kind of sounds and textures a more worldly setting with Pond. This album may not deviate much from the Tame Impala playbook (and, as sort of a guiding principal, trades the sheer scope of that record in for something more organic), but instead welcomingly recontextualizes that sound while offering it in easily digestible bites.</p>
<p>Recorded in a ""ramshackle old farmhouse in Western Australia"" over two weeks back in 2010, <i>Beard, Wives, Denim</i> feels like some very capable musicians getting back to their play-it-loose-and-fast roots. The communal, freewheeling looseness is one of the album's greatest assets, as you feel as if you were a party to the making of the record in Eagle Bay, too. This is obviously not a record meant to transport you to anywhere except the small little universe in which it was created, helpfully buoyed by a genuine sense of good humor, evidenced by the press release's silly accompanying track notes (""Nick B slept for upwards of thirty hours, becoming the human-koala"") and the odd stitch of audio caught while the tape was still running. ""That was pretty shit, that one,"" a voice notes amid laughter at the end of ""Dig Brother"". Nothing here could be classified as being pretty shit, but at almost an hour there's certainly some trimming that could've been done. ""Tangent-heavy"" seems like a more appropriate criticism. But brevity clearly isn't the aim: <i>Beard, Wives, Denim</i> exists and works in very much the same way a high school battle of the bands would, where whichever band can wedge a freaked out, three-minute improv into a perfectly fine two minute pop song will probably lay claim to the prize.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that said pop songs are mostly used as vessels, there sure are some pretty sweet ones here. As opener <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdF3Ce0kWM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Fantastic Explosion of Time""</a> suggests with its deliciously warped take on the British Invasion, there isn't much mystery to where these songs' influences sprung from. Like Tame Impala, Pond's genre sampling feels authentic under the canopy of an established sound, with odes to swaggering 1970s cock-rock (<a href=""http://stereogum.com/936092/pond-moth-wings/mp3s/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Moth Wings""</a>), twist-n-shout good vibes (""Leisure Pony""), and some relatively bluesy shit-kicking western wanderers (""Elegant Design""). All would make fine singles, if only it weren't for the jammed-out extentions and loose-limbed codas that each song eventually falls subject to. Most of the detours are massively fun, like the immersion-blender-to-the-dome shred fest that intersects ""Sun and Sea and You"", and the terrific little details tucked into just-okay tunes, like the desert mirage guitars on ""Mystery"". Getting a little lost along the way, it would seem, is kind of the point.</p>
<p>It may be unfair to compare Pond to Tame Impala too much, but when a band like the former's shadow looms so long, it's difficult not to. And in instances where Pond get a little too comfortable, focusing intently on the kind of horizon-gazing slow-bloomers that Tame Impala manage to render so elegantly, you may find your skip-button finger itching. More at fault might be Pond themselves, who are clearly very good at nailing tracks with a best-of-both-worlds approach, fusing those indulgent chunks of far-outness with fundamentally solid rock'n'roll tunes. And thanks to the communal tack, none of these ideas were given much time to stagnate. So it's hard to complain when the trips in between take a little longer than expected. But if your guy happens to have some of that high-test left, and you've got a little time tucked away, you're going to be just fine.</p></div>"|16340.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16340-pond-beard-wives-denim/|7.0|Zach Kelly

But when Baths signed to Anticon, Brainfeeder lost their experimental pop artist, the kind of producer who could marry head-swiveling beats to ghostly vocals.</p>
<p>Consider that niche filled. <a href=""http://www.lapalux.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lapalux</a>, aka Stuart Howard, makes a similar type of sparkling deconstructed pop. He fits the Brainfeeder aesthetic perfectly, as he likes to envision his songs as aural paintings-- a visual tie-in obviously appealing to a synaesthete like FlyLo. Lapalux's snares first started snapping on his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12458-for-love-i-come-lapalux-flip/"" target=""_blank"">remix of Thundercat's ""For Love I Come""</a>. Suddenly, a relatively straightforward love song turned fuzzy and discombobulated, as if the track had been put on small wheels and spun around a room until it was too dizzy to keep its parts in order.</p>
<p>The Essex native's aesthetic has advanced on the <i>When You</i>'<i>re Gone</i> EP. The tracks sound like amniotic imaginings of more accessible songs: all parts present but re-arranged with avant-garde abandon. The structure of ""102 Hours of Introductions"" is practically non-existent on first listen: gliding with faint keys and a wispy voice, as though Howard's setting up the listener for a massive drop. Instead, the beat is disarmingly light, softly swathed in a vocal that repeats <i>ad infinitum</i>: ""I've been waiting so long. Give your love to me, baby.""</p>
<p>For a label that's made its name on galvanizing the spare parts of hip-hop, soldering them into novel formations, and blasting that formation into the stratosphere, <i>When You</i>'<i>re Gone</i> is surprisingly needy. But that's the point of Brainfeeder: Expectations are expected to be upended. Lapalux's specialty is fusing the label's sense of meticulous beatcraft to tease out the meanings behind the sampled lyrics. ""Moments"" begins with a lyricist languidly confessing: ""I keep moments of you trapped in film."" As the song unfurls, the singer's utterings become swamped in sonic ooze, mirroring the song's theme. The effect is jarring, and at the song's conclusion, he cuts through the sentimentality, warping the moment that the singer once deeply treasured.</p>
<p>But it's not all dark. The best songs, the bewitching single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12987-gutter-glitter/"" target=""_blank"">""Gutter Glitter""</a> and stuttering disco workout ""Yellow 90's"", are lithe and light. The former starts with an elliptical loop but quickly skitters into a James Blake-like R&amp;B track-- a voice hovering above buzzing bass and fluttering synths. Howard acts as a conductor here, demanding that specific sections express themselves with more volume. ""Yellow 90's"" seems the most traditionally ordered and even veers toward danceable. Yet once you're locked in the groove, the chair is removed and the song unravels. However, the song stays afloat, ending on a patch of gorgeous haze and a delirious lingering confusion.</p>
<p>Howard's Brainfeeder debut shatters expectations, offering an always shifting balance of alien and familiar. It's not perfect. The closer, ""Face Down, Eyes Shut"", tries so hard to be enigmatic that it dissolves into nothing. But more often, <i>When You</i>'<i>re Gone</i> reveals a stunning beauty within its small moments.</p></div>"|16329.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16329-when-youre-gone-ep/|7.4|Jonah Bromwich

Then again, <a href=""http://anchorandhope.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dirty Three</a> didn't so much dramatically break up as simply run out of roads to travel. From 1993 to 2005, the band had pushed its minimal violin/guitar/drum set-up to epic extremes, from desert-storming ragers (1996's <i>Horse Stories</i>) to exquisitely melancholic meditations (1998's <i>Ocean Songs</i>) to Godspeed-sized pomp-rock spectacle (2000's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2329-whatever-you-love-you-are/"" target=""_blank"">Whatever You Love, You Are</a></i>). But the Australian trio's last release, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2332-cinder/"" target=""_blank"">Cinder</a></i>, felt like a conscious act of retreat, what with compact three-minute compositions and Cat Power cameos nudging their once-volatile sound toward NPR-friendly accessibility. But it's not as if Dirty Three have been spending the past seven years trying to refine and build upon <i>Cinder</i>'s pop overtures; as <i>Toward the Low Sun</i> strongly suggests, it's just taken them that long to unlearn everything they've known before in an attempt to start anew.</p>
<p>Of course, violinist Warren Ellis had a lot of practice in the deconstruction department during the intervening years, having reported back to active <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26031-nick-cave-the-bad-seeds/"" target=""_blank"">Bad Seeds</a> duty for the especially sleazy <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11375-dig-lazarus-dig/"" target=""_blank"">Dig, Lazarus Dig!!!</a></i>, while joining Nick Cave's even more depraved offshoot act <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5203-grinderman/"" target=""_blank"">Grinderman</a> for a two-album skronk-rock joyride. So it's fitting that <i>Toward the Low Sun</i>'s torrential opener, ""Furnace Skies"", sounds like it was recorded with Grinderman's still-warm equipment; it reintroduces us to Dirty Three mid-freakout, with ever-astounding drummer Jim White treating his snare drum like a machine-gunned target at a firing range, while Ellis and Mick Turner respectively poke through the percussive melee with teaser violin refrains and random shards of electric guitar. The appearance of a three-note Farfisa riff partway through introduces some semblance of shape to the piece, but ""Furnace Skies"" is essentially what you'd expect from a band that hasn't played together in several years: It's a warm-up exercise, an opportunity to get the limbs loosened, the blood pumping, and the instruments tuned. But it also sets you up for a big payoff that the rest of <i>Toward the Low Sun</i> isn't so keen to deliver.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.thelineofbestfit.com/2012/02/warren-ellis-dirty-three-interview/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">In recent interviews</a>, Ellis has not been shy in admitting that <i>Toward the Low Sun</i> was a difficult album to make, delayed by false starts and aborted sessions and, as such, there's a hesitant feel to the recordings that more readily captures the sound of a band getting reacquainted rather than reinvigorated. Even on the tracks with more easily discernible forms-- like the countrified lope of ""Moon on the Land""-- Dirty Three prefer to drift along and let structure materialize by happenstance, rather than impose any predetermined script on the compositions, while songs that carry the suggestion of intensifying into something more powerful (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12992-rising-below/"" target=""_blank"">""Rising Below""</a>, ""The Pier"") pull back before they truly erupt. As a result, <i>Toward the Low Sun</i> is never so bold as to match the horsehair-raising crescendos of Dirty Three's early signature works, nor does it offer the melodic immediacy of <i>Cinder</i>. It's an album that presents a series of beautifully desolate valleys, but without the volcanic peaks to lend them a greater definition.</p>
<p>It's tempting to view <i>Toward the Low Sun</i> as the sort of record that was sequenced according to the order the songs were recorded, as the performances grow markedly more assured and intuitive the deeper you venture into the collection. ""That Was Was"" provides a welcome jolt in the form of a grungy, ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-b76yiqO1E"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Cortez the Killer</a>""-style grind that showcases the delightfully nasty qualities of Ellis' fiddle, while the absolutely stunning ""Ashen Snow""-- guided by Turner's gentle piano melody and Ellis' beautifully mournful violin line-- affirms this band's ability to devastate even in the absence of their usual string-slashing, stage-stomping gestures. After an iffy start, <i>Toward the Low Sun</i> thankfully picks up a head full of steam in its closing stretch-- hopefully, this momentum won't dissipate over another seven-year layoff.</p></div>"|16336.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16336-dirty-three/|6.8|Stuart Berman

Denise Nouvion was a photographer who took dreamy, spectral-haunted photographs, and Evan Abeele a music school grad with an equal love of neo-classical composers and My Bloody Valentine. After meeting through friends a few years ago, Nouvion and Abeele embarked on a collaboration: He composed minimalist instrumental tracks to soundtrack her short films and accompany her photo exhibits. At some point, though, Nouvion's plaintive, placid-lake vocals got added to the mix, Abeele started writing bridges and choruses, and Memoryhouse<span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;""> </span>morphed into a full-fledged dream pop band.</p>
<p>It's fitting, then, that the band's full-length debut, <i>The Slideshow Effect</i>, which they say refers to ""the photographic/cinematic technique of zooming and panning to animate still images"" (I guess <i>The Ken Burns Effect</i> lacked a certain poeticism), is scattered with pictures. In ""Bonfire"" Nouvion sings about throwing photos in a pool and, later, holding a print up to light to wistfully observe the fingerprints it bears, while on the gently melancholy ""Punctum"" she comes to a conclusion that will ring true to anyone who's ever fallen into a late-night abyss of Facebook photo flipping: ""It's not enough to live your past through photographs.""</p>
<p>It's tempting-- given the band's creation story and the record's overall aesthetic-- to dismiss Memoryhouse as the ultimate example of a <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/features/resonant-frequency/8713-this-is-me-music-making-as-re-blog/"">tumblr come to life</a> and calling itself a rock band. (The cover, shot by Nouvion, doesn't help.) But a closer listen to <i>The Slideshow Effect</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> reveals that there's more to them than that: Unassuming as they occasionally feel, the tracks have a solid construction, visible through the fog-free clarity of Abeele and recently recruited bassist Barzin Hassani's production. Operating in a subgenre where every producer's M.O. seems to be ""I've got a fever, and the only prescription is more reverb,"" Memoryhouse's sound is refreshingly articulate.</span></p>
<p>They're at their best when they kick up the tempo-- the bright, drum-machine sputter of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12898-the-kids-were-wrong/"" target=""_blank"">""The Kids Were Wrong""</a> is an early highlight-- though they don't seem to have realized this yet: The back half of the record sags with pleasant but near-indistinguishable slow jams such as ""Pale Blue"" and ""Kinds of Light"". Still, in its more compelling moments, <i>The Slideshow Effect</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">'s overall vibe of glistening inertia isn't a strike against it, but rather an embodiment of its central theme. The album is a painstaking portrayal of the dissolution of a relationship, which makes its frozen, photogenic poses take on a kind of poignancy: Stay stock-still and everything will remain as it's always been; move a muscle and it all falls apart. Nouvion uses some variation of the phrase ""lie still"" at least half a dozen times. ""Go to sleep, nothing's changing,"" she sings with a potent twinge of self-denial on ""The Kids Were Wrong"", ""I'll be right here by your side.""</span></p>
<p>Memoryhouse frequently get compared to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4957-beach-house/"" target=""_blank"">Beach House</a>, who explored similar themes on their magnificently gloomy 2010 album, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13872-teen-dream/"" target=""_blank"">Teen Dream</a></i>. Memoryhouse have a ways to go before they're creating music with as much melodic power or depth of feeling as their dream-pop contemporaries. But as their development from the gallery to the stage has shown, there's every reason to believe that <i>The Slideshow Effect</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> is just a baby picture.</span></p></div>"|16326.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16326-memoryhouse-the-slideshow-effect/|6.6|Lindsay Zoladz

The former <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/14503-japan/"">Japan</a> singer has spent a great deal of time reflecting on his solo output in recent times. In 2010 he released a retrospective of his non-album collaborative work, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14812-sleepwalkers/"">Sleepwalkers</a></i>. If that record was a treat for fans, <i>A Victim of Stars</i> feels like a crack opening in the door for anyone left behind, a way to get a feel for Sylvian's far-reaching mood swings since Japan disbanded in 1982. It's neatly ordered, beginning with a hint of the early trappings of his solo career via a version of his former band's ""Ghosts""; taking in a smattering of material from his full-length albums; and closing with a new song bearing a title that summarizes the divisive areas of exploration that break-up his career arc: ""Where's Your Gravity?""</p>
<p>Sylvian's voice is a unique beast, pitched somewhere between the type of feigned disinterest typical of all the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1479-bryan-ferry/"">Ferry</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/438-david-bowie/"">Bowie</a> acolytes the New Romantic movement produced, but with greater cracks and world weariness appearing with age. By the time <i>A Victim of Stars</i> lands on ""Small Metal Gods"" from 2009's excellent <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13496-manafon/"">Manafon</a>,</i> there's a buckle and strain to his singing, a distinct warble in his throat, a palpable swoop down toward earthier terrain. But it's still grounded in the unreal, demonstrating Sylvian's preference for keeping his audience at arm's length. If there's one element of style that remains in place on this compilation, it's the tendency to untether his voice, to leave it floating in space, while the instrumentation-- sometimes fussy, sometimes so minimal it's barely a whisper-- politely searches for space around it, as though the singer is performing an awkward first dance with his own work.</p>
<p>Dialing back from ""Small Metal Gods"" to the material from 1984's <i>Brilliant Trees</i> is like taking a leap from someone at peace with their place on the planet to someone still figuring out who they are. But even the shift from ""Pulling Punches"" to ""The Ink in the Well"" (the first two tracks from <i>Trees</i>) is substantial, with the former all 1980s lipstick traces and watery slap bass, while the latter is sunk in a bed of acoustic thrumming and gently brushed drums. Both are perfect ease-in access points to Sylvian's solo work and among the best-known material here. But a better early warning of what was to come is ""Forbidden Colours"", Sylvian's 1983 collaboration with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3683-ryuichi-sakamoto/"">Ryuichi Sakamoto</a>. It's a fully formed piece of orchestral pop, with Sylvian taking on the mantle of wraithlike torch singer-- the vantage point from which he's clearly most comfortable as a performer.</p>
<p>One of Sylvian's biggest detours from that mode of operation was <i>Secrets of the Beehive</i> (1987), a largely acoustic-driven work represented by a clutch of songs here. On ""Waterfront"" from that album it's easy to detect the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4636-scott-walker/"">Scott Walker</a> influence that continually reemerges in his career, while ""Let the Happiness In"" is the kind of low-key, jazz-inflected ballad that would fit easily into <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1967-mark-hollis/"">Mark Hollis</a>' solitary solo album. Fellow outliers such as Walker and Hollis are the kind of company Sylvian has comfortably kept throughout his solo work, and, like them, he has often deviated tangentially in pursuit of untried provinces; <i>Secrets of the Beehive</i> was followed by two protracted instrumental collaborations with members of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/666-can/"">Can</a>, <i>Plight &amp; Premonition</i> (with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/880-holger-czukay/"">Holger Czukay</a>) and <i>Flux and Mutability</i> (again with Czukay, along with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12027-jaki-liebezeit/"">Jaki Liebezeit</a>, Marcus Stockhausen, and Michael Karoli).</p>
<p>It would have been difficult to bring in such work on <i>A Victim of Stars, </i>on account of the sheer length of the material in those collaborations. As such, it's important to note this is only a small part of Sylvian's story, a few splintered factions that hint at fuller, more expansive stories told elsewhere on his full-length recordings. But as a handhold into those tales this works surprisingly well, occasionally even dipping into the uninhibited environments Sylvian likes to extend to, such as the subdued funk of the nine-and-a-half-minute opener to 1999's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7682-dead-bees-on-a-cake/"">Dead Bees on a Cake</a></i>, ""I Surrender"". It also highlights his immaculate taste in collaborators, with earlier work alongside Sakamoto and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6049-robert-fripp/"">Robert Fripp</a> complemented by <i>Blemish</i>-era compositions marked by the spooked-out electronics of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7520-christian-fennesz/"">Christian Fennesz</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/280-derek-bailey/"">Derek Bailey</a>'s guitar passages. The ghostlike curls of feedback on ""Late Night Shopping"" from that record are the perfect place to drop Sylvian's voice, where his tenderly accented tones lightly vacillate between calm and disquiet.</p>
<p>Sylvian's partnership with Fennesz now stretches over a number of recordings, with both clearly sharing an appreciation for abstraction in art. It's an impulse that loops back to the earliest song present here, ""Ghosts"", which fleetingly lapses into glitch-heavy electronics at crucial junctures in its evolution. It's not easy to string a single narrative from <i>A Victim of Stars</i>-- Sylvian's career is in a permanent state of flux and reinvention. But he works best when his songwriting is pulled away from the concrete, when there's open-endedness for him to spin his focus around. But nothing here is ever wholly drawn into that world. Sylvian's role often feels like that of a curator, tugging in elements of free improvisation but never letting it overshadow, lest his absorption with songcraft, opulent orchestration, ambient electronics, and dozens of other impulses suffer. <i>A Victim of Stars </i>doesn't offer much to anyone already immersed in that world. For everyone else this is an engaging scratch at the surface of a wide-open mind.</p></div>"|16332.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16332-a-victim-of-stars-1982-2012/|8.2|Nick Neyland

Both groups are from Toronto, both are press-averse man-woman duos, and both draw from nasty-sounding synthesizers and the 1980's for musical inspiration. Just as Crystal Castles have found themselves at the middle of fair-use controversies, Trust could be accused of copying the copiers themselves: Last year's single on Sacred Bones, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/tv/musicvideos/1721-bulbform/"" target=""_blank"">""Bulbform""</a>, reappears on the duo's debut LP, <i>TRST</i>, and its trance-y backing melody bears more than a passing resemblance to ""Baptism"", the five-alarm steamroller of a tune featured on Crystal Castles' <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14190-crystal-castles/"" target=""_blank"">second self-titled album</a> from 2010.</p>
<p>I'm willing to write it off as coincidence-- not just because Crystal Castles didn't write the e-book when it comes to specific synth patterns. Whereas that band's punkish, neck-whipping performances suggest music designed to be enjoyed in a communal, sweaty setting, Trust's music sounds introverted by comparison. The missing letter in the album title is ""U"", and it's fitting; <i>TRST</i> often sounds like Alfons and Postepski are doing this more for themselves than anyone else, with synth melodies that yo-yo into the unknown and atmospherics that change from warm to coruscating with the turn of a phrase. Even the most ""single""-ready material here-- ""Dressed for Space"", <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13025-sulk/"" target=""_blank"">""Sulk""</a>, ""Chrissy E""-- carries a drug-sick lurch, somewhat akin to trying to make your way out of a dark club <i>and</i> your own head simultaneously.</p>
<p>A fair amount of <i>TRST</i> is cut from the same cloth as the brittle, gloomy melodrama of coldwave, but Alfons and Postepski's music does more than just flirt with analog affectations. Last year, NYC coldwave duo <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29947-xeno-oaklander/"" target=""_blank"">Xeno &amp; Oaklander</a> brought swarming lushness to the genre with <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15927-sets-and-lights/"">Sets &amp; Lights</a></i>; comparatively, Trust take their own extraordinary machines and slather them in gloss, resulting in the sonic equivalent of what a fashion show might look like if it were put on by depressive pill abusers. This stuff sounds malevolent, but mighty sexy, as Alfons' pinched whine of a voice takes on both characteristics with ease.</p>
<p>About that voice: Like so much of <i>TRST</i>, it's not exactly for everyone. At his most accessible, Alfons sounds like a reedier, less faddish version of Interpol's Paul Banks, while elsewhere, he ribbits and warbles in various keys-- as one colleague has put it, like a goth version of Eeyore. Personally, I quite like Alfons' voice; it has a slithering, grimy quality to it that increases the raunch-factor on particularly dirty-sounding tracks like ""Shoom"" and ""Bulbform"", and when he struts his stuff on ""Sulk"" and ""Dressed for Space"", he sounds like the kind of personality-heavy singer indie culture's been hesitant to embrace over the last few years. (He also outperforms Postepski's few vocal takes on <i>TRST</i>, which range from brief, throaty bursts to flatlined vocalizing.)</p>
<p>Despite the fact that moody, goth-flecked synth-pop has been in vogue for the larger part of a decade now, ""unique"" fits <i>TRST</i> like a leather face mask. Despite the fact that Trust's band bio is roughly the length of a couple of Tweets, it doesn't sound like Alfons and Postepski are hiding behind anything; instead, they wear their affectations proudly, exercising a frequent willingness for weirdness. Also, there are just so many bands using synths these days-- but how many of them are making their synths sound <i>this</i> rich and room-filling? <i>TRST</i> is not a brief album-- it stops just short of an hour in length-- and while the amount of raw material here may be daunting for some, there are plenty of surprising melodic moments to indulge in, from the gorgeous melodic drop that takes place midway through ""Shoom"" to all six-and-a-half minutes of ""Sulk""'s sighing pop majesty.

And while follow-up <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14123-la-la-land/"" target=""_blank"">La La Land</a> </i>traded the requisite Montreal orchestration for Hollywood namedrops (""Tom Cruz"", ""American Idol"", ""Kon Tiki""), there was a still a Lebowski-like insouciance to it, a projection from a place where beards and beer flowed equally free. Point being I never thought that whether Plants and Animals were good dudes was up for debate, but while <i>The End of That </i>doesn't go too far beyond the <i>La La Land</i> DMZ between indie folk and jam-band, they've got some dark and heavy shit on their minds this time out-- they attempt to take unsparing inventory, offer sincere amends, and confront the responsibilities of adulthood. But the unyielding geniality of the music and slackjawed lyrics show a band either unwilling or unable to commit to its own emotional ballast or offer a sense of real stakes, the result of which is <i>The End of That </i>confusing a bummy hangover with a full-blown existential crisis.</p>
<p>In a vacuum, it's admirable that Plants and Animals are finding inspiration in a life pivot that doesn't get much play in rock music: The characters in these songs are still partying and waking up on friends' couches, only now they come to while their buddy's wife is making breakfast for the kids. That's essentially the lyrical thread running through the title track, ""Crisis!"", and ""No Idea"", the three songs here which most explicitly delineate the titular catch-all of ""that."" On ""The End of That"", Warren Spicer admits, ""I tried the cocaine just to know what it could do/ I had to try it again just to give it a second chance,"" and the mundanity of it is actually rather bold for a topic that often results in exploitative oversharing or impenetrable metaphor. But as soon as you want to pull up to Spicer's barstool, he loses the plot, referring to an object of affection as a ""fucked-up bumblebee/ Headed for the potpourri,"" and continuing to spit game from there: ""You turn me on so with your bee-sting lips/ And your pepper-grinder hips/ Like a thread in the needle/ We're just typical people/ We're hoping to be friends and do cool stuff and be equal."" It's frankly pretty impressive how many different linguistic devices are used for the same cringeworthy effect.</p>
<p>And that's generally how most of <i>The End of That </i>goes, getting in a totally sincere and totally awkward sentiment before Spicer's lyrics perilously tailspin over endless Stones-y vamps. While the tone of the lyrics and music are jarringly discordant, the compositional methods for both align all too perfectly. ""Crisis!"" serves as the literal and figurative centerpiece of <i>The End of That, </i>a sloppy lanyard of guitar and vocal threads that barely tries for melodic structure and lyrics that similarly favor first-take immediacy. ""Well holy matrimony!/ Everyone is gettin' married or breaking up/ And the stroller situation on the sidewalk is way out of control,"" Spicer sings, and like so much of the record, it initially sounds plainspoken and charming until you realize absolutely nobody talks like that. Preceded by a false count-off and some friendly studio chatter, everything is arranged so that you have no reason whatsoever to think ""Crisis!"" wasn't actually made up completely on the spot. And as these things usually turn out, it's the longest song on <i>The End of That</i>, even more forbidding back to back with the equally aimless six minutes of ""2010"".</p>
<p>Occasionally, as on solemn opener ""Before"" and the driving, minor-key ""Control Me"", there's enough drawn shades obscuring the sunlight so that intent and execution can properly parallel, and with Spicer's voice bearing a similar grain to Nash Kato, they hint at Urge Overkill's genuinely despairing <i>Exit the Dragon.</i> But for a record that <i>sounds </i>like memories of better times, there's a disheartening shortage of hooks or melodies that aren't hitched to lyrics you'd rather forget: ""Lightshow"" has a spunky riff but never advances past it, while Spicer barges into a McCartney-styled piano progression on ""No Idea"", asking, ""Do you fear loneliness?/ Do you fear getting left behind?/ All your friends are getting married/ They're having... <i>a time</i>."" Look, kudos to Plants and Animals for intervening on themselves without the help of the local authorities or concerned family members, but whether it's the trailer preview-friendly bop of the music, the utter lack of palpable conflict, or the stilted dialogue and shoulder-shrugging catchphrases, I can't shake the feeling that <i>The End of That </i>is ultimately a Matthew McConaughey character come to life.</p></div>"|16309.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16309-the-end-of-that/|5.0|Ian Cohen

After it's over, what comes next? These are some of the Big Questions Seattle singer/songwriter Mike Hadreas addresses on his second album as <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/kewlmagik"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Perfume Genius</a>. <i>Put Your Back N 2 It</i> follows Hadreas' overlooked 2010 debut, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14457-learning/"" target=""_blank"">Learning</a></i>, and it feels like a proper sequel to that album's suite of dysfunction and devastation. On his first album, Hadreas tackled subjects such as molestation, substance abuse, suicide, the complications of inappropriate sexual relationships, and the struggle for acceptance from those you love. The morose subject matter and melodic simplicity of <i>Learning</i>'s piano-based songs drew comparisons to indie-pop artists like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2742-stephin-merritt/"" target=""_blank"">Stephin Merritt</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/698-casiotone-for-the-painfully-alone/"" target=""_blank"">Casiotone for the Painfully Alone</a>'s Owen Ashworth. But Hadreas' ability to set a scene and convey detail, which brought to mind <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3947-sufjan-stevens/"" target=""_blank"">Sufjan Stevens</a> circa <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7512-seven-swans/"" target=""_blank"">Seven Swans</a>, </i>lent the songs extra force. There were moments of impressionistic, synth-smeared beauty on that first record, but the overriding sense of despair and hopelessness could be overwhelming. On <i>Put Your Back N 2 It</i>, there's a crack of light coming through the darkness.</p>
<p>Hadreas is still exploring the more harrowing corners of human behavior. ""Dark Parts"" details the abuse his mother suffered at the hands of her grandfather; opener ""AWOL Marine"" takes inspiration from a tape of homemade pornography that Hadreas viewed, in which one of the participants admits, camera still rolling, that he's just trying to get medication for his wife. ""Floating Spit"" also deals with drug addiction, ""Take Me Home"" explores prostitution in the context of the need to be loved, while ""17"" uses a metaphor of a body stuffed into a violin, covered in semen, and hung up on a fence to shine a light on corrosive self-loathing. So don't let the whimsical album title fool you: If you're looking for something low-key to vibe out to, you've come to the wrong place.</p>
<p>The ""light"" the album allows has to do with how Hadreas approaches the material. He has a brilliant feel for poetic imagery (""The hands of God were bigger than grandpa's eyes/ But still he broke the elastic on your waist,"" from ""Dark Parts"", is particularly haunting), but he's mostly moved away from storytelling to explore emotional themes at their most fundamental. <i>Put Your Back N 2 It</i> is an album about love-- what happens when we feel sheltered by it, how we fail to love ourselves and the people around us-- but amidst the heartache and bruised tenderness, there's hope, too. Hadreas sums it all up in the hollowed-out torch song ""No Tear"": ""I will carry on with grace.""</p>
<p>For all its violence,<i> Back </i>radiates warmth. Much of the beauty is due to the expanded instrumentation, from the swooning, countryish guitar bends of ""Take Me Home"" to the interspersed snare rolls on ""No Tear"". The brutal low fidelity of <i>Learning</i> is gone, replaced with clarity and sonic intimacy that, when paired with these rich songs, raises every hair on the back of your neck. The more expansive sound gives room for experimentation, from the submerged electronic percussion on ""Floating Spit"" (contributed by UK producer David Edwards, aka Minotaur Shock) to the robust and surprising full-band blast of ""Hood"". The latter, with its bloom-and-burst structure, is the perfect example of Hadreas' growth as a melodic songwriter, having moved well beyond the the functional melodies that marked <i>Learning</i>.</p>
<p>Many of these songs-- ""Hood"", <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12843-all-waters/"" target=""_blank"">""All Waters""</a>, ""Take Me Home"", ""17""-- forego resolution and basically build tension and drop everything, in silence. Hadreas likes to steer clear of cathartic release, since in this world, there is no easy way out. On ""All Waters"", he begins singing in a low register and ends in his highest falsetto, as the song dissolves in wordless cries and frissons of far-away distortion. The song is a wish for a world where he and his boyfriend, Alan Wyffels (who also serves as his main musical collaborator), can hold hands in public without fear, and the lyrics (""When all waters still/ And flowers cover the earth"") suggest that it's not going to happen any time soon.</p>
<p>Mike Hadreas is gay, and many of the songs here focus on the issues that young gay men face in their lives (he referred to ""17"" in a press release as ""a gay suicide letter""), even as <i>Back</i>'s sustained exploration of love and hate has resonance for anyone. There is a lot of <i>him</i> in this music, the minutiae obviously pulled from a single person's life and experiences. But the album is less about confession as a form of release and more about trying to bring something positive into the world. ""I don't want it to seem like I've been through more than other people..."", he says in promotional materials for the album. ""Staying healthy can be more depressing and confusing than being fucked up. But I want to make music that's honest and hopeful.""</p>
<p>With so much recent conversation about marriage equality and gay teen suicide, and with the predictable election-year demonization of homosexuality, Mike Hadreas' work is not only satisfying on a purely musical level, it also feels of-the-moment and above all <i>necessary</i> (it's so topical, he found himself in the middle of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/45217-matador-says-googleyoutube-rejected-perfume-genius-promo-video-for-being-not-family-safe/"" target=""_blank"">a standards-of-decency ""family values"" battle</a> earlier this year between his label, <a href=""http://www.matadorrecords.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Matador</a>, and internet-media titans Google and YouTube). Independent music has woefully few artists dealing with these issues and asking difficult questions, and doing so in a context that never forgets about the importance of songwriting. That's a disappointment, but at least a handful of people like Hadreas are doing something about it.</p></div>"|16335.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16335-put-your-back-n-2-it/|8.4|Larry Fitzmaurice

Dalton hated recording and felt at best ambivalent about performing in front of strangers (she much preferred playing for friends, on porches and in living rooms), which means that although she's got one of those voices that gets talked about in hushed, reverent tones by everyone from Bob Dylan to Devendra Banhart, she preferred to sit out the kind of rituals that secure a person a snug spot in the canon. She didn't don face paint and a gypsy costume and hit the road with the Rolling Thunder Revue, she didn't dance <i>The Last Waltz</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> under Scorsese's spotlights, and-- years after her flight from Greenwich Village to Colorado-- she's present on the <i>Basement Tapes</i> only as the elusive subject of Richard Manuel's beguiled plea: ""Dear Katie, if you can hear me…/ How much longer will you be gone?""</span></p>
<p>Dalton has a Mona Lisa voice: it gestures toward a whole universe of unknowable things, and the way it makes notes curl up at the corners seems to suggest-- no matter how sad the song-- that its keeper is slyly smiling to herself about something you'll never quite comprehend. I can think of few better examples of this quality of her voice than her arresting take on Tim Hardin's ""Reason to Believe"", which opens <i>1966</i>, the latest collection of unearthed Dalton recordings. The song's most famous version, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ-zvISzY3Q&amp;feature=related"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rod Stewart's 1971 cover</a>, is all stomping melodrama, and even Hardin's comparatively subdued <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bW6VZi0ICs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">original</a> has an air of tragedy: It is an accusation, a wounded person blaming an unfaithful lover. Dalton finds something else in the song. Her gentle cascade of finger-picked notes and plaintive, drama-free vocals (""If I listen long enough to you/ I'd find a way to believe that it's all true"") turn the song into something of a koan: It becomes an acceptance of love's co-existing light and shadow. She sings the same words as Stewart and Hardin, but in her care they take on an entirely different meaning. Like so many of her other classics-- her versions of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_FwUR4SQIo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""When a Man Loves a Woman""</a> and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPzK_ABS_mE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved by You)""</a> come to mind-- the track presents a solid argument that Dalton (who never wrote any material of her own) is one of the most subtly skilled interpreters in the history of American folk.</p>
<p>The Oklahoma-born Dalton put out just two studio albums in her lifetime, 1969's <i>It</i>'<i>s So Hard to Tell Who</i>'<i>s Going to Love You the Best</i> and 1971's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9623-in-my-own-time/"" target=""_blank"">In My Own Time</a></i>. In the past few years, though, the number of Dalton tracks known to the world has more than doubled, thanks to two reissues from the Delmore Recording Society: the home recordings of <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12009-green-rocky-road/"" target=""_blank"">Green Rocky Road</a></i>, and the double-disc <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10832-cotton-eyed-joe-the-loop-tapes-live-in-boulder-1962/"" target=""_blank"">Cotton Eyed Joe</a></i>. The latter is the Karen Dalton equivalent of a live album: just she and her 12-string, deftly plucking traditional folk numbers in a Colorado bar called the Attic, the end of each track punctuated by the applause of maybe a few dozen people. It's a mesmerizing performance, and comparing <i>Cotton Eyed Joe</i> against some of the more bombastic live records of her contemporaries, its unpretentious intimacy is as refreshing as a breath of mountain air.</p>
<p><i>1966</i> finds Dalton in a setting even more intimate: her own cabin in Colorado, rehearsing with her estranged husband, fellow Village ex-pat Richard Tucker. Dalton had no intention for these songs to be recorded; the 14 tracks here exist only because Tucker's friend Carl Baron brought a portable reel-to-reel over one day and captured the couple preparing for an upcoming gig. Some tracks feature Dalton solo, and some feature her and Tucker together, working out the kinks of some the duets in their repertoire, like ""Mole in the Ground"" or Fred Neil's ""Other Side to This Life"". As their voices and guitar stylings unite and occasionally veer off into imperfect harmony, <i>1966</i>'s more unpolished moments invite a glimpse into their process, while the occasional snippets of dialogue from the couple (who split shortly after) straddle the line between poignancy and black comedy. ""Wow, what an ending, we just did it perfect,"" Tucker sighs at the end of a rendition of Hardin's ""Shiloh Town"". ""No, we didn't,"" Dalton mutters. ""I didn't know what you were doing.""</p>
<p>The material on <i>1966</i> spotlights two songwriters in particular (and two of Dalton's closest friends): blues-folkie Neil and confessional songwriting pioneer Hardin. Neil's ""Little Bit of Rain"" and Hardin's ""While You're on Your Way"" would later become some of Dalton's signature tunes, but these are the earliest known recordings of her interpretations. 1966 was also the year that Hardin released his acclaimed debut, <i>Tim Hardin 1</i>; shortly before Baron's recordings, Hardin had traveled to Colorado to personally play his new songs for Dalton and Tucker. Since she was used to singing almost exclusively traditionals before 1966, there's something moving about how many of the songs on <i>1966</i> are penned by either Hardin or Neil (who released his own classic <i>Bleecker &amp; MacDougal</i> a year prior). By bringing them into her oeuvre, Dalton's saying she thinks the songs her friends were writing were just as good as the classics (and they way they're juxtaposed here show that she was right), and her adapting them to her own style foreshadows the forays into contemporary pop she'd explore on <i>In My Own Time</i>.</p>
<p>Dalton had a hard life: She struggled with a drug addiction that she never overcame, and she was more or less homeless when she died in New York in 1993. <i>1966</i> augments her legend not by romanticizing the tragedy of her life, but instead by showing the skill and depth of feeling that Dalton brought to even her most informal performances. It was an ordinary evening that Baron captured on his reel-to-reel, and the moments when his recorder drops out (like the clipped 40 seconds of ""Hallelujah"", as if snatched from the ether, that conclude the disc) only add to this collection's poetry-- they suggest the hundreds, maybe thousands of other times that Dalton played sets like this one for nobody in particular. Another testament to the riveting power of her music, <i>1966 </i> is one more piece to a puzzle that will never be complete-- which is of course how Dalton herself would have had it.</p></div>"|16312.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16312-karen-dalton-1966/|8.0|Lindsay Zoladz

Considerably further underground, another veteran hard-rock band, Raleigh, N.C.'s three-decade-old <a href=""http://www.coc.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Corrosion of Conformity</a>, is answering the same nostalgic muse. As with the Roth and Sammy Hagar Van Halens, it's helpful to think of C.O.C. as two different bands: On one hand, you've got the trio that recorded 1985's <i>Animosity</i>, a whirlwind of a record that drew equally on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/275-bad-brains/"" target=""_blank"">Bad Brains</a>' frantic sprint and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/379-black-sabbath/"" target=""_blank"">Sabbath</a>'s sinister swing, epitomizing what used to be called crossover. On the other, there's the quartet responsible for three far more commercial LPs-- filled with polished but still potent blues-rock, a grunge-era update on Mountain, and other early riff disciples-- from the mid-90s through 2000. Other memorable LPs (including 1991's <i>Blind</i> and 2005's <i>In the Arms of God</i>) featured their own unique lineups, but essentially, the C.O.C. tale amounts to <i>Animosity</i> vs. <i>Deliverance</i>, the 1994 Columbia album that spawned two minor alt-rock hits.</p>
<p><i>Corrosion of Conformity</i> indulges in revisionist history. The lineup here is the same one that recorded <i>Animosity</i>-- bassist-vocalist Mike Dean, guitarist Woodroe Weatherman, and drummer-vocalist Reed Mullin-- and in the absence of 1994-2005 frontman Pepper Keenan (currently focusing on the Southern-metal supergroup Down but rumored to be returning to the C.O.C. fold), the three set the Delorean controls back to 1987, just after the still-punkish <i>Technocracy</i> EP and just before maturity set in. Dean, Weatherman, and Mullin reconvened in 2010 to revisit the 1980s material live-- see them if you can; they sound amazing-- and now they're adding to that repertoire, crafting as fortysomethings a record they never got around to in their 20s. As enjoyable as the Keenan-centric records were, they could seem labored, as if someone were angling for a breakthrough à la Soundgarden, or even White Zombie; on <i>Corrosion of Conformity</i>, those ambitions go right out the window.</p>
<p>It's not quite as simple as that. <i>COC</i> is a much more varied, shrewdly paced record than <i>Animosity</i>, yet it still seethes with a swampy rawness that the band hasn't embraced since the 1980s. Part of that is due to principal frontman Mike Dean, whose unhinged whine, at once ugly and profoundly soulful, rarely aspires to anything so civilized as singing, whereas Keenan had developed into a full-on crooner by the time he left the band. A crisp, no-nonsense production job (realized with the help of Dave Grohl, a longtime C.O.C. fan who lent out his L.A. studio for the project) and a purist avoidance of Pro Tools-y perfectionism also help; the performances often sound like they're coming unglued, and that adds greatly to the record's old-school charm. <i>Corrosion of Conformity</i> does overstay its welcome with a couple of second-rate tracks, but overall, the album manages to both recapture <i>Animosity</i>'s feral energy and reach compositional peaks that the 1985 versions of Dean, Weatherman, and Mullin couldn't have accessed.</p>
<p>A few songs simply recap the <i>Animosity</i> template. In the opening seconds of lead track ""Psychic Vampire"", Weatherman crunches into a bulky doom riff and Dean lets out a cathartic groan, like he's casting off the weight of the previous two decades, during which C.O.C. traded caffeinated adolescence for grown-up discernment. Bass and drums enter, and the trio quickly accelerates to a hardcore gallop. The tempo change feels like a secret handshake with longtime fans: The creature lives, and he's wearing a flipped-up skate cap, Vans, and baggy jean shorts.</p>
<p>Crucially, though, there's much more to <i>Corrosion of Conformity</i> than strict reanimation. As good as <i>Animosity</i> is, only a few songs stand out from amid the blur; here, many of the tracks feel lived-in, nearly epic. If C.O.C. ever compile a greatest-hits comp (and they really should, given their diffuse discography), ""River of Stone"" belongs on it. Dean's possessed wail-- like the raving of a crazed seer-- leads the band through a chugging blues-metal verse and a grinding half-time chorus. The trio downshifts into an eerie, molasses-slow bridge, and the track takes on a somber grandeur that trumps both <i>Animosity</i> and the Keenan era for sheer emotive power. By the time the verse returns, you sense the song's proggish sweep; C.O.C. aren't just switching tempos, they're taking you on a journey. The driving anti-government rant ""Your Tomorrow"" is another standout. C.O.C. previewed the track on a 2010 Southern Lord 7"", but the new version ups the intensity; Weatherman's riffs writhe grotesquely, as if they were playing him rather than the other way around, and Dean and Mullin add a shaggy, drunken-giant swing. The trio sounds as commanding here as it ever has, thriving on proud anti-virtuosity: punk spirit inhabiting a metal anatomy.</p>
<p>As a whole, <i>Corrosion of Conformity</i> is smartly sequenced for maximum variety. ""Leeches"", a bellowed hardcore outburst, sits next to the album's lone instrumental, ""El Lamento de Las Cabras"", drumless desert blues shaded with acoustic guitar; and the prog-punk mini suite ""The Moneychangers"" (part cowbell-abetted uptempo shimmy, part Floydian mood piece) segues into the proudly grungy doom-rocker ""Come Not Here"" (the record's clearest link to the Pepper Keenan years). It's a shame, then, that <i>Corrosion of Conformity</i>'s two least-memorable tracks, the macho kiss-off ""What We Become"" and the 1983-style mosh-pit singalong ""Rat City"", follow one another late in the album. The songs add drag to an otherwise admirably streamlined LP. (Spring for the vinyl or deluxe CD versions, and you get two top-drawer bonus tracks, ""Canyon Man"" and ""The Same Way"".)</p>
<p>Uneven patch aside, <i>Corrosion of Conformity</i> is what you want out of a comeback record: not just a reclamation of lost vigor but a meaningful update on a vintage sound. If <i>Animosity</i> seemed like an ugly duckling back in the mid 1980s-- too punk for the metal crowd and vice versa<i>-- Corrosion of Conformity</i> registers similarly today. In an era when doom metal keeps growing bleaker and artier, and hardcore skews ever more dire, the album serves as a reminder that swagger, soul, and songcraft still have a place in the heavy-rock underground. Corrosion of conformity, indeed.</p></div>"|16328.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16328-corrosion-of-conformity/|7.6|Hank Shteamer

""This album is more focused than the last one."" ""They added band members, so the songs are fuller."" All of those statements apply to <i>Splendor Squalor</i>, which is a good thing, right? <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/xrayeyeballs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Xray Eyeballs</a>' debut, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15364-not-nothing/"" target=""_blank"">Not Nothing</a></i>, hinted that the band could head in a few directions, so if O.J. San Felipe and Carly Rabalais wanted to fill out their sound, polish the fidelity, and reach for one genre instead of trying out a few, that's a good move. If this sophomore album is evidence of anything, it's that they picked one approach and ran with it: new wave steeped in hollow, jangling synths. It's a look they wore well on parts of <i>Not Nothing</i>, so they could theoretically pull off an album full of it.</p>
<p>Sonically, the aesthetic honing works. Their percussion is more clear-eyed and controlled than ever, thanks to new drummer Sarah Baldwin. The synths, from Liz Lohse, bring a welcome new layer to the mix that fills out their sound. The band's octave-separated vocals work well with their new sheen, especially on ""Blue"", where they're especially tight. The case could be made that the jangle and the synths are overly reminiscent of Eyeballs' swooning, 1980s forebears, sure, but since they make up the most dreamy and pleasant moments of <i>Splendor Squalor</i>, it's hard to care.</p>
<p>Execution isn't the problem. The main issue here is that when they find a sound they like, they bury themselves in it. For instance, they ruin perfectly good hooks by singing, ""Downtown is such a drag!"" (""Gator"") or ""I control you! You control me!"" (""X"") on near-infinite repeat, to the point that those phrases come to mean nothing. It's made worse by the overall lack of variation in tempo and tone. Each song drags-- it's amazing the record's only 40 minutes long-- and it all culminates in ""Summer Daze"", an excruciating five-minute monotone listing of summertime imagery, including tacos, snow cones, pubes, and DJ Pauly D. Really.</p>
<p>Perhaps most telling is that the best song on the album is a cover of a song by Rabalais and San Felipe's other band, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28507-golden-triangle/"" target=""_blank"">Golden Triangle</a>. ""Cold Bones"" gets a shiny new-wave makeover, but despite its status as a <i>Splendor Squalor</i> highlight, it's not as powerful as the original. The Golden Triangle cut has grit in its comparatively cruddy production; this new version has a fresh coat of jangling gloss. Worse is the drum sound, which is brittle compared to the original's robust, powerful drive.</p>
<p>""Four""'s chorus of, ""Take your time, blissful night, big brown   eyes, never die/ And fall apart, from the start, lost in love, and have   some fun,"" is telling: There's so much love and fun and whimsy here, but it takes forever to deliver. The title <i>Splendor Squalor</i> invokes having a wonderful time despite your poor economic, hygienic, or social condition. That message would've been more effective with editing. Between a few of their choruses and that final tortuous laundry list of summertime activities, fun has never sounded quite so exhausting.</p></div>"|16317.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16317-xray-eyeballs-splendor-squalor/|5.4|Evan Minsker

That's not all he's done-- he's been involved in tons of <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/artist/Aaron+Dilloway"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">other releases</a> too, with my favorite being either 2007's rattling <i><a href=""http://www.discogs.com/Aaron-Dilloway-Chain-Shot/release/1165417"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Chain Shot</a> </i>or 2008's <i><a href=""http://www.discogs.com/Aaron-Dilloway-C-Spencer-Yeh-The-Squid/release/1250380"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Squid</a>, </i>a collaboration with like-minded noise pal <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28288-c-spencer-yeh/"">C. Spencer Yeh</a>. But in terms of scope and ambition, <i>Modern Jester</i> is Dilloway's <i>War and Peace</i>. It covers practically all of his sonic obsessions, stretching them to lengths at which he can explore every detail and tangent. The result-- seven pieces encompassing four sides of vinyl-- feels like a major statement, even if it's made of wordless, sometimes harsh noise.</p>
<p>What exactly is Dilloway trying to say? That's open to interpretation, which is probably his intention. He's into ambiguity, both musically and discographically (he already released a tape called <i>Modern Jester </i>back in 2008, though only one track from that survives here). But as amorphous as his message may be, it's always about the power and attraction of loops. Each track here features some kind of repetitive cycle, whether it's off in the distance or up in your face. Some are lopsided and woozy; others are sharp and punchy; still others are so subtle they're more like ambient atmospheres or dense drones. But dig in deep enough, and you'll find Dilloway repeating some sound, whether miniscule or massive.</p>
<p>Those sounds flow together so seamlessly that he's often like a noise DJ, beat-matching his loops so it's hard to tell where each begins and ends. Aptly enough, the piece where he does that best is called ""Body Chaos"", a 19-minute journey taking up all of side two. Portions are like an alternate-universe dance track, as noises melt into each other, burst into anarchic climaxes, then recede into sparse echo. When Dilloway settles into that steady mode, <i>Modern Jester </i>becomes a travelogue where words and pictures are replaced by sonic textures.</p>
<p>Such naturalism makes sense given Dilloway's obsession with field recordings. He originally left Wolf Eyes to live in Kathmandu, where he amassed an archive of real-life audio. He released some of it in the fascinating 4xCD-R box set <i><a href=""http://www.discogs.com/Aaron-Dilloway-Sounds-Of-Nepal/release/1155123"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sounds of Nepal</a></i>, but he's also used it throughout his solo recordings, and I suspect parts are embedded in <i>Modern Jester</i>. Many moments feel environmental-- at points I imagine a train rolling down tracks, a printing press clacking out sheets of paper, and a power plant chugging smoke into the sky. And even when his music sounds more like a broken circuit or a skipping record, it has the primacy of life's routines-- the way the world seems to loop around you in repetitive patterns as you navigate your way through it.</p>
<p>That universality doesn't mean this album is for everyone. It takes some stamina to get lost in these lengthy sound essays. But then Dilloway has never done anything the easy way. If he tried to make his music more accessible, it would likely lose its core power. Instead, he's supremely patient, and he wants you to be, too. If you're up for it, <i>Modern Jester</i> rewards that patience infinitely.</p></div>"|16330.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16330-modern-jester/|7.7|Marc Masters

When Jan St. Werner and Andi Toma debuted under that name in 1994 with <i>Vulvaland</i>, a pillowy-soft album that found threads between UK post-rock and ambient house, other artists on their label included Th' Faith Healers, Moonshake, Seely, and Laika, bands that would be pretty much done by the turn of the millennium. But Mouse on Mars endured and, though they never ""broke through"" in any real sense, they've managed to remain part of the conversation. They stayed relevant by adapting and changing, applying their mastery of music-making technology (which was changing rapidly in those early years) to a distinct sense of structure. Mouse on Mars albums such as <i>Autoditacker</i> and <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5463-glam/"" target=""_blank"">Glam</a></i> sounded futuristic in their own way, but their charms had less to do with the way they pushed the limits of sound design and more to do with how you tended to remember things like chord changes, melodies, rhythms.</p>
<p>The band's sense of experimentation ramped up in the 2000s, as they tried their hand at straight electro-pop (<i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5467-radical-connector/"" target=""_blank"">Radical Connector</a></i>), collaborated with Mark E. Smith of the Fall as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5296-von-sudenfed/"" target=""_blank"">Von Südenfed</a>, and made excursions into dense, abrasive sound that bordered on noise music (<i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9379-varcharz/"" target=""_blank"">Varcharz</a></i>). After that, they went away for a while, working on side projects (Jan St. Werner with his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2497-lithops/"" target=""_blank"">Lithops</a> alias, Andi Toma doing studio collaborations with bands including Junior Boys) and now they return with their best record since 2001's hyper-eclectic <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5461-idiology/"" target=""_blank"">Idiology</a></i>. While that release found them dabbling in mutant ska, blown-out noise, and lush acoustic instrumentals, <i>Parastrophics</i> is diverse within narrower parameters. This is very much an electronic album, though it covers a tremendous amount of ground in that broad terrain.</p>
<p>What's most striking about <i>Parastrophics</i> is how, despite sounding very much like Mouse on Mars and in some ways coming over as a throwback to the dense, colorful style they were perfecting between 1997 to 1999, it sounds very much in tune with the maximalist electronics of the moment. Since their comparatively muted first two albums, St. Werner and Toma have not been known for restraint; if there's an open part of the sonic spectrum, they're going to fill it. But while current artists like Rustie and Flying Lotus foreground technology, packing their tracks full in a way that makes you think of a bent and shaped data stream, Mouse on Mars have a weird knack for putting the technology of the music in the background. The songs here are music first and sound excursions second. And they manage to string a staggering number of tightly packed nuggets of melody and texture into 46 minutes.</p>
<p><i>Parastrophics</i> flows like a suite, with very few pauses and chances to catch your breath. Everything is constantly in motion. One moment there are string-like stabs that sound pulled out of the score from <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYbsBcPDVQM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the factory scene in <i>Modern Times</i></a>, another there's a swooning slide guitar that brings to mind a plasticized version of Hawaiian tiki; there are bass drops and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YPiCeLwh5o"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Numbers""</a>-like synth pulses and voices that are looped and even sort of rap. The lines between tracks, instruments, and genres are continually blurred, but it never feels incoherent.</p>
<p>The defining aspect of that sensibility is something that is very rare indeed in the world of electronic music: Mouse on Mars are funny. It's hard to talk about instrumental music in terms of humor, but Jan St. Werner and Andi Toma make music that is playful and sometimes even silly. Part of it is their sound palette, which tends to favor cartoony bleeps and squelches and toots, and part of it is their feel for rhythm, which always injects a charming bit of awkwardness into the beats. So while the playful spatter-house of ""Polaroyced"" can get heavy, and the bouncy electro of ""They Know Your Name"" has a tough low end, these tracks are also shot through with goofiness, a sort of exaggerated top-heavy strut.</p>
<p>But if the textures and beats are winking and mischievous, the overall sense of musical structure is dead serious and, ultimately, virtuosic. The songs grow, change, build, and resolve, and never stay in one place for long. They are surprising, filled with non sequiturs that tend to accrue logic with repeated listens. They can be strange, crawling, drone-ridden things with pinched, heavily processed vocals, such as ""Syncropticians"", or they stream-roll with a rapid-fire rap and industrial grind that bring to mind <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hbYGioZ8XY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mu's ""Lets Get Sick""</a>. The peculiar genius of Jan St. Werner and Andi Toma is that they make all these things sound like they could come from no one else. The fact that they are still doing it 18 years after their first album, and still capable of making some of the best music of their career, is inspiring.</p></div>"|16331.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16331-parastrophics/|8.2|Mark Richardson

Then again, one gets a feeling in listening to their music that such a circumstance would have been contrary to everything about their art. Following in the vein of such personal musical heroes as Talk Talk, Bark Psychosis, and Disco Inferno, brothers Chris and Richard Adams, plus a continually rotating group of supporting players, went from a pleasant if sometimes derivative start-- in their case including numerous short, sometimes fragmentary lo-fi tape experiments and rushed songs that were very early-1990s indie-- to a different place, a blend of something modern and timeless, suffused with an apparent serenity that in reality was never entirely at ease with the rest of the universe.</p>
<p>A fairly big claim, perhaps, but as the six-disc box set <i>Recollected</i> makes clear, the end results can be described almost in no other way. It's not a full career overview-- that would have meant a literal doubling in the size of the set, counting all their other archival efforts and earliest albums, including four CDs' worth of singles and compilation appearances alone-- but a close focusing on their work for the Domino label: four albums, a one-disc collection of singles and EPs, and an expanded reissue of their post-<i>Outside Closer</i> tour CD, <i>The Hood Tapes</i>, plus liner notes, photographs, and further details.</p>
<p>Due to longer song lengths and the production and touring membership of Third Eye Foundation's Matt Elliott, <i>Rustic Houses, Forlorn Valleys</i>, their full length Domino debut from 1998, was seen at the time as a contextual response to acts such as Mogwai as well as a more formal allegiance to a drone-rock scene at the other end of the country in Bristol. But it now sounds like its own genteel creation, ominous but not empty, referencing nature and time, while hints of the modern seep in through the arrangements-- consider the almost glitch-like feel of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsZLqXPKtno"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Light Reveals the Place""</a>, elements suddenly stopping and starting even while the overall flow continues. The dry but wounded speak-singing of the Adams siblings often felt more isolated as a result, distant cries from the titular locations.</p>
<p>1999's <i>The Cycle of Days and Seasons</i> felt like a slight return given the shorter songs, including three brief instrumentals, but the mood of cryptic contemplation remained central, skeletal arrangements with lots of space in the mix filled by equally cryptic noises and textures. Voices echo and loop, a slightly fuzzy recording of church bells recurs at points during the album, and the crackle and buried beats of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Slzyv07XZJw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""In Iron Light""</a> implicitly suggest what else was happening in the sonic universe. That one particularly delicate, focused number, following in the vein of earlier self-referential titles, is called <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmEUT9bbGss"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Hood Is Finished""</a> acts as both in-joke and summary: The band's approach had become so beautifully refined that it almost seemed as if anything further could be gilding the lily.</p>
<p>This made the shift evident on 2001's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3917-cold-house/"" target=""_blank"">Cold House</a></i> all the more appealing. From the opening full-on glitch loop of one of three <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/781-clouddead/"" target=""_blank"">cloudDEAD</a> collaborations, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uEVPiZRDXY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""They Removed All Trace That Anything Had Ever Happened Here""</a>, set against a still understated but more cleanly energetic performance from the group, there's a clear sense of having turned a corner. The feeling of real dislocation as aesthetic move was now fully clear, a more frenetic, in-the-moment atmosphere complementing and sometimes disrupting but never overwhelming the calm they'd already established. A song like <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lECOaTP8zw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I Can't Find My Brittle Youth""</a> is almost them in anthemic Wedding Present territory but in <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=in14WpNcwP8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""You Show No Emotion At All""</a> they had a perfect single showcasing their latest approach-- crisply propulsive, poised, and still reticent, guitars and keyboards as pinpoint touches and horn arrangements as a further startling glaze around a poised vocal performance about concern and distance.</p>
<p>If <i>Outside Closer </i>turns out to be the final album Hood release, then it found them building on <i>Cold House</i>'s new balance extremely well-- if <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbmwckPGb4c"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Negatives...""</a> was, again, at heart, a softly sung contemplation, its arrangement was practically a soul stomper in context, with shimmering samples and melodies swirling throughout. ""Winter 72"" and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFjCjeHneIc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Closure""</a>, in turn, worked with techniques clearly inspired by dub while the stellar <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doInC-r6Eyw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Lost You""</a>, a kaleidoscopic collage of beats and shifting arrangements, found Hood just as indebted to Timbaland as to Disco Inferno's Ian Crause or Talk Talk's Mark Hollis. Earlier glitch fascinations continued elsewhere on songs like <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdY4hiOx1KQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Any Hopeful Thoughts Arrive""</a> with further depth and detail, arrangements building steadily into dramatic conclusions.</p>
<p>The EPs collection mostly covers the latter half of the period, starting with 2001's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34UOUPzP7Yw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Home Is Where it Hurts""</a>, capturing the group in a transitional space and continuing through the B-sides for ""The Lost You"" and ""The Negatives..."", including fine songs such as ""The World Touches Too Hard"", <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wb34VvCV0I8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Over the Land, Over the Sea""</a>, and ""Across the Lonely Writing Side"". A key number is at the start, however-- <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhDNLaVxosw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Useless""</a>, a 1997 vinyl A-side that many fans consider the band's best, capturing their Disco Inferno fascination for the unexpectedly anthemic with a mix of rough guitar, very Crause-like vocals, and a low-key woodwind melody. The bulk of <i>The Hood Tapes</i> covers rough and ready sessions following <i>Outside Closer</i>, less detailed but as always exploring various acoustic/electronic combinations, with further rarities including the lovely tour-only single ""Winter Will Set You Back"", a rare dip into full acoustic/string waters, and the split-single effort ""You Shins Break My Heart"", an engaging interpolation of Talk Talk's ""New Grass""'s core arrangement into their own approach.</p>
<p>It's a bit overwhelming to take in all at once, and each disc's strengths almost come out better in isolation. But as a welcome and well-deserved overview, <i>Recollected</i> covers the continuing evolution of a band that, having established a strong identity over time, then proceeded to transform it to avoid repetition of what it'd already achieved. Would that more performers could be so bold, and secure enough in themselves to feel that taking a break is no bad thing.</p></div>"|16248.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16248-recollected/|8.5|Ned Raggett

But that's the way <i>Audience of One</i>, released by his longtime label <a href=""http://www.touchmusic.org.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Touch</a>, is panning out. Ambarchi is also known for his collaborative work with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3984-sunn-o/"">Sunn O)))</a>, with whom he's recorded and played live, complementing his extensive solo releases and further alliances with musicians including <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2044-keiji-haino/"">Keiji Haino</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3176-jim-orourke/"">Jim O'Rourke</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7520-christian-fennesz/"">Christian Fennesz</a>. Other guests emerge on <i>Audience of One</i>'s four pieces. Among them are impressive contributions from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29517-warm-ghost/"">Warm Ghost</a>'s Paul Duncan, providing vocals on the opening ""Salt""; and <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Eyvind+Kang"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Eyvind Kang</a>, filling out a chamber arrangement on the expansive ""Knots"".</p>
<p>There's a sense of new life forming, of Ambarchi's re-contextualizing his place in the world. His music has taken in vast stylistic shifts in the past, but here he forges deeper into the unknown, loosening control over his work to allow his collaborators to leave a more indelible footprint and pushing many of the shapes he forms into a tighter framework. Those shapes on the opening ""Salt"" mirror the glass-like ambience of Markus Popp's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3187-oval/"">Oval</a>, sifting a stilled beauty into the track as Duncan's keening vocal echoes softly over them. When a hushed swell of strings momentarily enters the frame it scrapes close to the kind of work <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3914-spiritualized/"">Jason Pierce</a> was experimenting with circa <i>Pure Phase</i>, where a chilly tone-drift provides a simple backdrop for raw, unhampered emotion.</p>
<p>That may be a surprising comparison for longstanding fans of Ambarchi's work, but on <i>Audience of One </i>he's clearly happy to buck a few expectations. On the 33-minute centerpiece ""Knots"", there's a greater widening of his vision, bringing in the pitter-patter of drummer Joe Talia's metronomic ride-cymbal playing, initially counterbalanced by shards of abstract noise, ranging from barely extant slivers of sound to a blackened, all-encompassing bedlam. It's strung up in an unusual space, full of gaps for the musicians to move around in but also striding forward with purpose and goal, ricocheting back and forth between the known and the unknown. It's reminiscent of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1472-thomas-fehlmann/"">Thomas Fehlmann</a>'s work with the Montreal Symphony Orchestra on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12077-dfm/"">""DFM""</a>, where all the players are intuitively aware of how to expand into spaces without overwhelming the track's fragile fabric.</p>
<p>""Knots"" is intricate and fascinating, the kind of piece that's impossible to digest in one or two hearings, always holding back secrets to reveal on further plays. There's a lightness and a density to it, with Ambarchi's black-hole soloing at the midway point falling back into near-quiet in the final third before a series of forceful, metallic clangs push and pull it to a barbed close. The only way out after that is to return to the buttoned-up euphoria of what came before, with singer Jessika Kenney cooing over ""Passage"" while Ambarchi caresses out ambient noise by kneading the rims of a series of wine glasses. It's a necessary climb-down from ""Knots"", an escape hatch that stops the mind from reeling on what came before.</p>
<p>To complete the picture, and to continue the strain of reinvention that runs throughout <i>Audience of One, </i>the album closes with a cover of Ace Frehley's ""Fractured Mirror"". It's a marginal lift in tone after ""Passage"", with the plush march of a drum machine providing a steady pulse for glass-cut guitar playing to echo around. In 2004, Pitchfork's Brandon Stosuy reviewed Ambarchi's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/152-grapes-from-the-estate/"">Grapes from the Estate</a></i>, wondering what the guitarist could do with Van Halen's ""Hot for Teacher"". ""Fractured Mirror"" may be the closest we get to an answer, with the overabundant guitar playing of Frehley's version sucked out and replaced with a downplayed beauty that's just about perceptible if you listen closely to the original. But that's typical of Ambarchi's approach on <i>Audience of One</i>, which feels like he's listening harder than ever to feel out new ways to move forward, causing him to quietly cleanse his vision in ever more compelling ways.</p></div>"|16320.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16320-audience-of-one/|7.0|Nick Neyland

And he's been giving it to us for over a decade now, both solo and as a member of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1422-engineers/"" target=""_blank"">Engineers</a>, regardless of whether or not these homages to 4AD's imperial years and the less convoluted side of Warp offer anything new or vibrant. Schnauss has managed to make a career for himself on being just pleasant enough to keep you from turning off any of his records in mid-flow, but I can't think of any Schnauss track that's surprised me or stuck with me or compelled me to click ""repeat."" And even if you class Schnauss as an ambient artist, well, even the best ambient music makes you want to linger in its world for one more play.</p>
<p>The very title of <i>Underrated Silence</i>, his new collaboration with fellow Engineer Mark Peters, poses a probably unintentional, sort of mean but not entirely unfair, question about Schnauss' approach. Given the terabytes of sound you've probably amassed at this point, is enjoying a few moments of silence preferable to filling that time with something this pretty but anodyne, well-made but insubstantial, polite to the point of barely registering? All the familiar notes from Schnauss projects past are struck here, and once again they all verge on stirring some emotion without usually doing so.</p>
<p>More unfortunate are the moments when Schnauss and Peters aim for surprising or affecting and veer straight into kitsch. ""The Child or the Pigeon"" wants to be some sort of pastoral ambient/folk hybrid and winds up bringing to mind a new age album that John Denver never got around to making. Elsewhere the borrowings are both more blatant and less icky, but nonetheless bland when strung together. ""Forgotten"" somehow manages to evoke a half-dozen familiar sounds-- Julee Cruise coos, Tangerine Dream synths, Cure gloom, the tick-tock rhythms of early electronic music-- without managing to evoke much in you, the listener. ""Amoxicilin"" is to Frippertronics what generic caffeine-free diet cola is to chasing slugs of Red Bull with spoonfuls of sugar.</p>
<p>There's been no shortage of this sort of ethereal strum-and-woosh (with or without beats) over the last 25 years, but every so often someone will come along with a take that makes it all seem grand (if not exactly revelatory) once again. Schnauss is never going to be that guy, and at this point you're either okay with that or you stopped listening around 2006. Way back then, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7026-far-away-trains-passing-by/"" target=""_blank"">Pitchfork's Mark Richardson wrote</a> that Schnauss' music ""begs for a riskier approach, something with bolder strokes and an infusion of drama that risks cheesiness."" Six years later, that remains truer than ever, and while there's nothing wrong with being the kind of musician who fixes on small gestures and easily identifiable reference points, the luster is still steadily wearing away from Schnauss' bricolaged miniatures.</p></div>"|16325.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16325-underrated-silence/|5.0|Jess Harvell

Last year's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15239-too-young-to-be-in-love/"" target=""_blank"">Too Young to Be in Love</a></i> proved to be a valuable contrast to the heterosexuality of first-wave rock'n'roll, but more importantly, it was an enjoyable garage-pop record. Bogart and his ""punkettes"" sounded like they had a ball recording it, embracing the kitsch of malt-shop soundtracks. And while the album certainly possessed the air of ""sock hop night"" at your favorite gay bar, it also had a universal emotional core, with many of the songs detailing the highs and lows of teenage infatuation-- which, in spite of what you're told, doesn't get much more mature when you enter young adulthood.</p>
<p>When it was announced that Bogart would record a solo album, speculation arose. A Hunx record with no punx, no punkettes, and no Shannon Shaw to potentially steal the show. Is Bogart heading into pensive singer/songwriter territory? Would he go from the unbridled fun of <i>Too Young to Be in Love</i> to releasing his own <i>Nebraska</i>? Recorded by Bogart and <i>Too Young</i> producer Ivan Julian (with help from Daniel Pitout of British Columbia punk band Nü Sensae on drums), <i>Hairdresser Blues</i> finds Hunx reflecting on the past in a major way, writing ballads to his old friend Jay Reatard, his departed father, and the Bay City Rollers. With the newfound emotional weight comes punchier production and fuller arrangements, sacrificing the girl-group harmonies of songs like ""Lovers Lane"" for driving surf-rock numbers and Flying Nun-indebted Farfisa organs.</p>
<p>The songs still traverse into the realm of Nifty Fifties homage by way of pastiche à la <i><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095270/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Hairspray</a></i> (""Do You Remember Being a Roller?"", right down to the title, is the album's most overt nod), many of them still carry an undercurrent of writhing lust. (Hint: ""Private Room"" isn't exactly about those spaces in the library hallway with the opaque glass doors.) But whereas <i>Too Young to Be in Love</i> was the excited doodles of a crush's name in a notebook, <i>Hairdresser Blues</i> is the discarding of the love letters that came after.</p>
<p>Most of the album's songs finds Bogart singing about wanting to turn the clock back to past experience, the time-honored method of dealing with bleak periods by thinking about simpler times. ""Say Goodbye Before You Leave"" is an ode to Reatard, with Bogart singing of the fun he had opening for him on tour and their late-night phone conversations, wishing he could run his fingers through his hair or just hang out one more time. (When he sings, ""We can talk about girls,"" in the second verse, there's a clear hint of compromise in his voice, a plea that they could do whatever he wants to do, as long as he just comes back.)</p>
<p>Closer ""When You're Gone"" is the classic case of when a departed loved one feels like a phantom limb, when it hasn't quite sunk in that someone is gone for good, and all you do is wait for them to come back. Like <i>Too Young to Be in Love</i> closer ""Blow Me Away"", the song is about his father, who passed away when Bogart was a teenager. Through heartbreak and death, <i>Hairdresser Blues</i> is very much an album about loss and the different ways it affects us. But the darker recesses of Bogart's memory are tempered with moments of levity, the moments of waiting up for someone who's never coming back sitting alongside dreams of Bogart having a blow dryer between his thighs.</p></div>"|16313.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16313-hairdresser-blues/|7.2|Martin Douglas

But in retrospect it's hard not to view that moment as a symbolic passing of the torch, akin to proud working-class parents sending their kids off to an Ivy League school in anticipation of future success. While the National's more melodramatic take on Tindersticks' patented pop-noir balladry has landed them in hockey arenas and presidential-campaign videos, Stuart Staples and co. have been defiant in their refusal to follow their disciples' charge into the mainstream.</p>
<p>Since signing to Constellation and introducing a revamped lineup with 2008's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11462-the-hungry-saw/"" target=""_blank"">The Hungry Saw</a></i> and 2010's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13849-falling-down-a-mountain/"" target=""_blank"">Falling Down a Mountain</a></i>, Tindersticks have gradually drifted away from the string-swept epics that defined their astounding first three albums and the studious soul tones that defined the next three; by loosening up their performances, amplifying their psychedelic side, and projecting a greater degree of playfulness, they've practically become the world's most dignified jam band. While the more freewheeling approach has provided this veteran group with a renewed sense of inspiration by stretching their signature sound into uncharted territory, their first two Constellation efforts didn't yield the sort of cardiac-arresting emotional wallop that's synonymous with the Tindersticks brand. But with <i>The Something Rain</i>, Tindersticks strike the sweet spot between experimental sprawl and hot, bothered soul, and if it doesn't achieve the same weightiness as their 1990s-era name-making triptych, it's fully on the level of their exceptional early-2000s releases <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8074-can-our-love/"" target=""_blank"">Can Our Love...</a></i> and <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8071-waiting-for-the-moon/"" target=""_blank"">Waiting for the Moon</a></i>.</p>
<p>Tindersticks have traditionally favored low-key opening tracks to gently lure you into their harrowing headspace, but <i>The Something Rain</i> effects a pronounced break from that logic with ""Chocolate""-- for one, it clocks in at nine minutes, making it the lengthiest track in the band's dense catalog. More significantly, it marks a return to the spoken-word soundtrack format of their 1995 signature ""My Sister"", setting a short-story account of a first date to a molten acid-rock refrain that gradually erupts into a brass-blasted climax that heralds the welcome reintroduction of long-time associate Terry Edwards. And just when you start to question why such a seemingly mundane narrative warrants such an over-the-top presentation, there's a ""gotcha!"" denouement to the story that constitutes the band's most broadly humorous gesture to date.</p>
<p>In both tone and form, ""Chocolate"" is by far the most atypical track on <i>The Something Rain</i>, but its audaciousness translates into the fiery performances that follow. Where Tindersticks tend to deploy 1970s soul and R&amp;B signifiers to cut through their albums' prevailing air of despair-- and the cheerful, cha-cha-cha strut of ""Slippin' Shoes"" and the gorgeously languid ballad ""Come Inside"" serve a similar purpose here-- <i>Something Rain</i> standout ""Show Me Everything"" uses its smoky Hammond-organ groove, shots of brass, and female backing singers to coax a masterfully intense vocal turn from Staples, with images of latex-gloved hands pressed against glass that ooze with seedy suggestion. ""This Fire of Autumn"" works a similar trick to equally captivating effect, but at a quickened tempo that turns more anxious with each verse/chorus pass; glockenspiels have rarely been used to such unnerving effect.</p>
<p>Where Staples' downcast narratives were the driving force of the band's early works, the retooled Tindersticks' power lies in their skills of arrangement; structurally, these songs don't really change once they begin, but they accrue considerable force through the layering of complementary string/horn patterns and Staples' pushing his perennially bruised croon to heightened levels of desperation. That makes the heady rush of ""Frozen"" all the more amazing-- though the song never breaks out of its skittering, wah-wah-accented rhythm, it still feels completely weightless and disorienting, with Staples' echo-drenched voice contorting in and out of the mix while Edwards' free-flowing horn squawks swoop in like stormy gusts of wind. And each time Staples repeats the line, ""If I could just hold you,"" it starts to sound less like a call to a faraway lover than the predatory intimations of a stalker. It may have taken them two albums to find their proper footing with their new line-up but, with <i>The Something Rain</i>, Tindersticks provide a wholly convincing reminder that they are, by definition, an incendiary device.</p></div>"|16307.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16307-tindersticks/|8.1|Stuart Berman

His early work with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5764-ecstatic-sunshine/"" target=""_blank"">Ecstatic Sunshine</a> veered toward shaggy guitar rock, while <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5037-ponytail/"" target=""_blank"">Ponytail</a> was like an unhinged version of Deerhoof with odd hooks and wordless vocals. Wong's solo work, though obviously springing from the same headspace, consolidates and unifies his aesthetic.</p>
<p><i>Dreams Say, View, Create, Shadow Leads</i> follows 2010's solo debut <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14802-infinite-love/"" target=""_blank"">Infinite Love</a></i>, a conceptual album based in part on a psychedelic experience. It featured the same material-- repetitive, layered guitar lines and a tiny dose of drum machine-- presented in two similar renditions across two discs. <i>Dreams Say </i>has a similarly out-there origin, with a title inspired in part by his dreams. But the album's actual construction is more compact and solid than its predecessor. Wong <a href=""http://www.thrilljockey.com/thrill/Dustin-Wong/Dreams-Say-View-Create-Shadow-Leads"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">has explained</a> his creative process-- the way he uses a guitar and a series of pedals-- in terms of a textile factory. The pedals that change the guitar's tone add texture, delay pedals weave a pattern, a loop pedal replicates the sounds, and an envelope filter colors them. It's a powerful explanatory tool for thinking about <i>Dreams Say, View, Create, Shadow Leads</i>, but after receiving piles and piles of such exquisitely crafted sonic fabrics, I'm left with the question of what to do with them.</p>
<p>The answer to that challenge is surprisingly broad. On the one hand, it seems as though Wong's music is naturally introspective. It lacks the rock immediacy of Ecstatic Sunshine, and there aren't Ponytail frontwoman Molly Siegel's pre-verbal vocal yelps to divert from all the intricacies. Some songs, such as ""Space Tunnel Graffiti"", sound like basalt blocks being dropped around your head. Alternately, ""Feet Prints on Flower Dreads"" starts with an urgent guitar figure and builds slowly into an industrious, vaguely conventional pop song with chorus-drenched chords and competing lead lines that cut sharply across the audible spectrum. None of the songs are simple, and they mostly all build to surprising and surprisingly weird heights.</p>
<p class=""p1"">A twin strength/weakness of these songs is that they generally start discretely, as simple guitar figures onto which Wong piles more loops and lines. The album's strong sense of pacing leads to moments where, as each song crests, you tend to think, <i>This, right here, is the highlight</i>. Then it ends, and the next song starts from point zero. Which is good and bad. ""Toe Tore Oh"", something of a centerpiece, builds slowly and doesn't hit a groove until about four minutes in. Two minutes later, it stops abruptly, and the listener's given a new fabric to examine.</p>
<p class=""p1"">In a way, each song's pattern is like an aural Rorschach test. (Wong's textile  analogy is apt.) You hear the music, sure, but only the parts your  brain latches onto. Even on good headphones, it's difficult to catch  everything that's going on. Your mind wanders along one guitar path, and  then you realize you've necessarily missed five or six branching paths. That's not a huge knock, though, since the album does reward repeat listens. In fact, it requires them. One go around might emphasize the Motown-style bassline in ""Purple  Slipped Right"", and on another you'll notice the ghostly harmonic  artifacts popping up among the pizzicato muted string rhythm. Wong uses the loop pedal like a factory machine stamping out parts, and the little imperfections and accidents that get captured and preserved only add to each layer's complexity.</p></div>"|16314.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16314-dreams-say-view-create-shadow-leads/|7.7|B Michael Payne

To come to grips with the music of the prolific American composer, arranger, and violinist, you would need to sift through upwards of 50 albums, each with its own secret but palpable internal guidelines. (Lots of them have to do with ""<a href=""http://www.allmusic.com/album/theater-of-mineral-nades-r347995"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">NADE</a>,"" a Sanskrit word with a <a href=""http://artofthestates.org/cgi-bin/piece.pl?pid=257"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">number of obscure connotations</a> that has a mysterious significance for Kang.) And you would have to range far beyond the composer's own works, through those of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5366-laurie-anderson/"">Laurie Anderson</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3984-sunn-o/"">Sunn O)))</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5804-mike-patton/"">Mike Patton</a>, <a href=""http://www.tzadik.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">John Zorn</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3571-marc-ribot/"">Marc Ribot</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1568-bill-frisell/"">Bill Frisell</a>, and many other hard-to-classify artists. To generalize, Kang refracts strategies from global classical, jazz, folk, and experimental music though his esoteric personal interests, which are always changing. He's a musical polymath who writes in his own voice instead of self-consciously ""crossing genres."" Boundaries are aren't smashed, but simply ignored, dreamily melting away.</p>
<p><i>The Narrow Garden</i> features an exotic array of strings, winds, horns, and percussion, performed by an international cast of more than 30 musicians from three different ensembles. Written at home, on an island near Seattle, but partially recorded in Barcelona, the record purports to explore the medieval concept of courtly love. We all know that ""explores the concept of"" often boils down to ""mentions in the liner notes,"" but you don't have to strain too hard to hear Kang's intricate weaving of soft, romantic consonances and harsh, anxious dissonances as an expression of the quicksilver joys and miseries of formalized desire. Taking in lyric poetry, Western choral music, Middle Eastern and South Asian modes, and ""ashugh"" singing (a popular folk tradition heavily associated with the Caucasus), <i>The Narrow Garden</i> features some of the most sunny and flowering music that Kang has created, seamlessly joined with a couple of sinister threnodies. If the Middle East-tinged jazz of Wyatt, Atzmon &amp; Stephen's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14761-for-the-ghosts-within/""><i>For the Ghosts Within</i></a> had been aggressively produced by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5161-svarte-greiner/""><span>Svarte Greiner</span></a>, it might have come out like this.</p>
<p>At one extreme, there are ravishing compositions of deceptive simplicity, which accumulate delightful embellishments. These include ""Pure Nothing"" (a sultry setting of a <a href=""http://www.guilhem-ix.org/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Guilhem IX</a> poem translated into English by <a href=""http://www.poets.org/poet.php/prmPID/123"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">W.S. Merwin</a>) and ""Forest Sama'i"", where a serpentine melody seems to hover over Eastern and Western classical modes without alighting on either one; the playful variations unfold until the song abruptly takes flight in a scherzo-like dance animated by trembling whistles. At the other extreme are the title track and ""Usnea"": dense, metallic braids of screeching strings, ear-spearing flutes, and other distressed timbres. Kang knows how to sculpt and compress clashing harmonies until they take on an inviolable collective form, like a perfect cube of mangled cars fresh from a compactor. But the best thing about the record's tonal variety is how neatly it all blends together, especially on epic closer ""Invisus Natalis"", where a fleet of guitars, basses, strings, and bassoons taper down to a liquid cacophony, dissolving all of Kang's thought-provoking musicological contrasts into a flawless, golden glow.</p></div>"|16321.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16321-the-narrow-garden/|7.5|Brian Howe

In 1997, when the Texas singer-songwriter was only 15, <i>The New Yorker</i> chronicled the major-label bidding war for his alternative rock band Radish, en route to an appearance on <i>Late Show With David Letterman</i>, European tours, and a commercially disappointing debut album. By 2002, at only age 20, he was living in Brooklyn and making a modestly successful comeback, with the shaggy yet sweetly melodic pop of solo debut <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4552-sha-sha/"" target=""_blank"">Sha Sha</a></i>, a charming distillation of influences from Weezer and Ben Folds Five.</p>
<p>A Ben Folds Five reunion album is on the way, and Weezer's echoes live on in more recent bands such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28248-surfer-blood/"" target=""_blank"">Surfer Blood</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28604-yuck/"" target=""_blank"">Yuck</a>, but <i>Go Fly a Kite</i> has remarkably little to say about the present. After <i>Sha Sha</i>, Kweller sanded away some of his endearing idiosyncrasies for 2004's more straightforward <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4553-on-my-way/"" target=""_blank"">On My Way</a></i>, an approach he took further on 2006's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9531-ben-kweller/"" target=""_blank"">Ben Kweller</a></i>, before decamping back to Texas and trying his hand at alt-country on 2009's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12647-changing-horses/"" target=""_blank"">Changing Horses</a></i>. It's silly to quibble over which is best, though, because it seems like a pretty good bet that any fan's favorite Kweller album is whichever one you heard first. Accordingly, Kweller's latest solo full-length, his first to be independently released-- on his own Noise Company label-- brings it all back home, resulting in a retrenchment that's as understandable as it is frustrating.</p>
<p>Kweller's impeccably competent craftsmanship is not in dispute. The Steve Miller-tinged Southern rock of ""Free"" builds toward a bluesy guitar solo exactly where it should, despite being unwilling to deploy an F-bomb, and the Wall of Sound-scaling ""Jealous Girl"" packs in enough references-- 1950s pop, Bruce Springsteen, the Cars, John Lennon's ""Jealous Guy""-- for a Girl Talk meta-mp3 binge. Even in the album's lesser songs, such as piano ballad ""The Rainbow"", country-tinged weeper ""I Miss You"", or tempo-shifting organ rocker ""Justify Me"", evidence of Kweller's 15 years putting songs together professionally is on full display. If pastiche means ""speech in a dead language,"" then Kweller is a fluent practitioner.</p>
<p>For an album that includes the guitar chords for every song in its packaging so you can play along at home, however, <i>Go Fly a Kite</i> sure is coy when it comes to memorable hooks or lyrical detail-- particularly when compared to Kweller's past songs ""Wasted and Ready"", ""Lizzy"", or Guster collaboration ""I Hope Tomorrow Is Like Today"". On the waltzing piano-popper ""Gossip"", we get portentous guitar arpeggios that recall the Beatles' ""I Want You (She's So Heavy)"", but little to talk about beyond the observation that gossip is ""gonna get you down."" The Pavement-ragged lurch of ""Time Will Save the Day"" contains the following opaque revelation: ""I went through the fortress, I slept with the mistress/ I read through the Bible, it gave me revival."" Which tells us... something. Kweller never makes a mistake, but he never does anything here risky enough to be considered a mistake, either.</p>
<p>The most disappointing aspect of <i>Go Fly a Kite</i> is that it sounds so <i>satisfied</i>, almost smug, in its complacency. At 30, Kweller and I are the same age, and we're both fathers, but I'd rather keep chasing our ever-evolving pop culture and risk looking silly than dig in and try to hold onto my 20-year-old self (who, it must be said, could be a total ignorant asshole sometimes). ""Don't regret anything I ever did,"" Kweller insists in John Lennon double-track on scorching new-wave opener ""Mean to Me"", adding, ""'Cause I always knew where I was coming from."" Well, that makes one of us.</p>
<p>""I've come full circle,"" Kweller futher declares over the CSNY-style folk of ""Full Circle"", which could easily have been the album's title. By jaunty back-porch closer ""You Can Count on Me"", though, it's unclear whether Kweller has learned anything along the way, or whether he's just back where he started from-- without the youthful impulsiveness that made him likable to begin with: ""It's a sad day 'cause all my old friends have changed/ I just want you to know that I'm still the same,"" he promises. Well, fuck that, Kwell-dog. As a much older, forever-young man once sang, ""He not busy being born is busy dying."" An even better title for <i>Go Fly a Kite</i> would've been <i>Get Off My Lawn</i>.</p></div>"|16323.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16323-go-fly-a-kite/|5.5|Marc Hogan

Its ubiquity isn't a surprise. Rap is forever falling in love with a production style and then shamelessly squeezing all the life out of it. But at the risk of sounding like a curmudgeon, something is different this time around. It's all a bit more numbing than usual. Thanks to computer technology, which makes spot-on mimicry quite easy, and facilitated by the industry's embrace of ruthlessly utilitarian music (see also: dubstep, four-on-the-floor euro-pop), there's no demand to gently tweak the Lex Luger formula.</p>
<p>808 Mafia, Lex and fellow Atlanta producer Southside's personal crew of  guys mining the Luger sound (Be-Bop, Bobby Beats, Purps, Tarentino, and  Trackman), are creative enough to keep this rapidly aging-out style  vital. The joy of this mixtape is hearing it done by originator-approved copycats and observing the way that each production subtly differentiates itself from the other.  Often, it's with something as simple as throwing in a distinctive sound, like the flickering synth on Be-Bop's ""Gold 2"" or the thick, Vangelis score fog in the background of ""Ripe"" by Tarentino.</p>
<p>On the best tracks, though, it's a precarious balance between giving listeners exactly what they're anticipating and slyly tipping the sound in a new direction. Mixtape highlight ""Genn"" from Purps could easily be mistaken for some forgotten strain of UK dubstep. Anchored by a whirling, creepy organ and ominous synth horns, it seems more leisurely than the rest of the instrumentals. This is a Luger beat that isn't in a rush to unleash the drums-- a beat-drop anticipated by trap-rap fiends much the same way bassheads wait for dubstep's drop-- and it seems just as excited to fill the downtime with stoned-out atmosphere.</p>
<p>Is it necessary for Bobby Beats' ""808 One"" to stretch to seven minutes? Probably not, but it's a terrifying march of a beat, and the confidence to let it rattle and pound for this long suggests some kind of strange ambition. But when the rewards of loud, evil rap beats are in the tiniest of details, something is seriously wrong. Had <i>808 Mafia</i> arrived a year or so ago, perhaps it would have been a bit more mindblowing. The problem is, instrumental hip-hop, thanks to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29765-araabmuzik/"" target=""_blank"">AraabMuzik</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29547-clams-casino/"" target=""_blank"">Clams Casino</a>, and others, has made 808 Mafia's beat-tape approach seem underwhelming.</p>
<p>A fun game for your ears though, is trying to imagine the Lex Luger beat as new again, not pounded into the ground by popular radio. Luger and his peers, minions, and imitators cut trap-rap's mid-2000s Wagnerian synth bangers down to size, removing the grandiosity, replacing it all with an ugly, eardrum-attacking snap and crack, and turning mix shows into an hour-long crunk-punk cacophony. <i>808 Mafia</i> isn't a game-changing instrumental mixtape, but it is a nice reminder of the vitality of the increasingly limp Lex Luger sound.</p></div>"|16322.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16322-808-mafia-808-mafia/|6.5|Brandon Soderberg

The strings are followed by brushed, rolling snare drums. Soon, Kurt Wagner, the band's singer, stumbles into the mix. ""Don't know what the fuck they talk about,"" he sings. His voice sounds beery and disoriented. It seems possible that he's in the wrong room.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Coming from some singers, the line might sound like a challenge, but coming from Wagner, it's a simple admission. <a href=""http://www.lambchop.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lambchop</a> is a band that has spent the past 20 years in Nashville building its own idiosyncratic universe. For better and worse, the current state of music, its trends and its innovations, pass them by completely. Even during the days when alt-country seemed like a viable art form, Wagner's ornery sense of humor-- the kind that drives you to cap your album with a 40-second-long song called ""I Sucked My Boss' Dick""-- made them seem totally out-of-step with their supposed contemporaries. In a lot of ways, Lambchop is a band that seems committed to its own irrelevance.</p>
<p>Irrelevance, though, isn't a burden for Lambchop as much as it is a jumping off point for what makes them <i>them</i>. ""I see your Pitchfork I-rock saviors,"" goes one line on 2006's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9354-damaged/"" target=""_blank"">Damaged</a></i>-- ""I'm sorry, I still prefer Jim Nabors."" If you aren't sure who Jim Nabors is and you're still reading our reviews about I-rock saviors, you've unknowingly participated in Wagner's self-definition: He hears the conversation going on but damn if he'll take part in it.</p>
<p>Nothing on <i>Mr. M</i> is designed to pop, not in the conventional sense of the word. To describe the band's current style is to invoke genres with an almost negative cultural cachet: lounge, 1970s country, Burt Bacharach-- styles so fixated on sounding high-class that they run the risk of feeling trashy. On paper, Lambchop is a band that would appeal primarily to grandparents and drunks. <span class=""s1""> </span></p>
<p>Wagner's voice is a low, wounded-sounding instrument whose character has only deepened with time (though Wagner, in his self-effacing Wagnerian way, has attributed it to cigarettes). At root, he's a crooner, but his croon sounds alternately fragile and gruff-- the elderly neighbor who returns your lost dog one day and commands you to step off his azaleas the next, spittle hanging from his lip.</p>
<p>His lyrics are a mix of minor, concrete observations and poetic flights. ""We have crawled among the elements, taking pictures of our phones"" is one. ""Sleep makes you possible"" is another. His writing has the power to transform the everyday into a mystery, but his voice-- and the music behind it-- attempts to transform the mystery into something unplugged and emotionally direct-- to make ""The wine tasted like sunshine in a basement"" sound a little bit like ""I love you.""</p>
<p>If Lambchop's music bears some essential ambition, it's to marry ambivalence and sentimentality. My favorite turn on <i>Mr. M</i> is on ""Buttons"", a portrait of a small-town loser by a narrator who seems to neither love nor hate the man he sings about. ""Been better times for those that are in trouble,"" Wagner sings, ""and maybe there'll be better times for you. The weight you've gained has made your head a bubble, and your button eyes are brown and not her-- black and blue.""</p>
<p>On the last words-- ""black and blue""-- Wagner's voice warps into an almost grotesque croon, like he's either about to giggle or weep over the string section, and yet the image in my head is of a pudgy, small-town loser and the woman who he may or may not have beaten with his own sad fists. What we are supposed to do with these mixed emotional cues, I have no idea. It's to Lambchop's credit that their music avoids comfortable resolutions. Instead, it hangs there, no moral, no judgment.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Apprehending <i>Mr. M</i> does not take a genius, nor does it take an English degree, nor does it take 180-gram vinyl and an $800 Scandanavian turntable with counterweights made out of rare geodes. What it does take, I think, is patience. I like tarted-up, throat-grabbing music as much as the next frantically inattentive twentysomething. I also find a deep satisfaction in Lambchop's subtlety, which never makes the mistake of thinking that being high-minded or instructive will get us over to their weird team. Nobody, not even the most depraved among us, needs to be slapped on the wrist in order to see beauty. And still, despite Wagner's protests that he doesn't know what the fuck they talk about, <i>Mr. M</i> sounds aware of itself as an argument-- an argument for the kind of patience the music on it demands.</p>
<p>And so we return to this idea of Lambchop's irrelevance. For the purpose of barroom reductions, <i>Mr. M</i> sounds like a bunch of guys tapping delicately on acoustic instruments from deep within a mausoleum, or the sound of wind blowing gently through the pages of an open book resting on a front-porch rocking chair. But how rare is it that a band asks you to listen to so little, and how much rarer is it that they make it sound like so much?</p></div>"|16221.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16221-lambchop-mr-m/|8.3|Mike Powell

In fact, the songs on his very first release, 2000's <i><a href=""http://www.discogs.com/Jozef-Van-Wissem-Retrograde/release/1625287"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Retrograde Renaissance Lute (A Classical Deconstruction)</a></i><span style=""mso-bidi-font-style: italic;"">, are literally inverted. He took traditional lute tablatures and rewrote them upside-down, then cut up and rearranged the results to form new compositions. Since then, Van Wissem has continued to invert his baroque instrument in order to be, as he <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/features/the-out-door/8766-regression-is-a-virtue/4/"">told us</a> earlier this month, ""a lute player with a punk rock attitude."" He's written musical palindromes (melodies which sound the same played forwards or backwards), delved into experimental techniques like field recordings and improvisation, and collaborated with modern-styled string players such as <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/629-james-blackshaw/"">James Blackshaw</a> and <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/194-tetuzi-akiyama/"">Tetuzi Akiyama</a>.</span></p>
<p>Those players dip into classical styles themselves too, but the musical mindset of Van Wissem's latest collaborator, <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/28502-jim-jarmusch/"">Jim Jarmusch</a>, was formed in the punk-drenched milieu of late-1970's New York. There the now-famous indie film director played keyboards and sang with the <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/features/articles/6764-no-the-origins-of-no-wave/"">no-wave</a> band the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Del-Byzanteens"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Del Byzanteens</a> and shot no-wave films starring musicians like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lurie"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">John Lurie</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Edson"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Richard Edson</a>. Which makes the pair's debut album the first full release Van Wissem has made with an actual punk rocker. (Jarmusch added guitar to one track on Van Wissem's 2011 solo album, <i><a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/features/the-out-door/8012-the-out-door-16/"">The Joy That Never Ends</a></i>).</p>
<p>Such a meeting of divergent backgrounds could result in a kind of tonal car crash, but Jarmusch easily and compellingly weaves his playing into Van Wissem's era-bridging craft. At times their sounds connect like rhyming lines of poetry; in other places, like opener ""Apokatastasis (Restoration)"", Jarmusch's long tones form the echo of Van Wissem's patient, precise notes. In a few instances, such as when Jarmusch plays acoustic guitar, it can even be tough to tell these twin souls apart.</p>
<p>That complementary vibe is due in large part to Van Wissem's simple, sparse melodies, which leave lots of room for Jarmusch to enter and move around in. <i>Concerning the Entrance </i>has its moments of contrast and tension, too. On ""The Sun of the Natural World Is Pure Fire"", the way Jarmusch grinds out caustic noise behind Van Wissem's exploratory plucks produces a mesmerizing dissonance. Later, on closer ""He Is Hanging By His Shiny Arms, His Heart an Open Wound With Love"", he interrupts Van Wissem's solo playing by reciting St. John of the Cross' poetry with a cool, detached tone, sounding oddly like Thurston Moore at 16 rpm.</p>
<p>Still, the best moments come when Van Wissem and Jarmusch share a single musical mind. The most blending comes during the album's middle track, ""Continuation of the Last Judgement"". As Van Wissem devoutly spins out a lute loop, Jarmusch adds small accents, then slides into electric guitar waves that slyly bend around Van Wissem's cycles. Here, the duo's capacity to find interlocking patterns feels infinite, making ""Continuation"" the best possible title. You can imagine these comrades spinning their wordless yarns long after the album ends.</p></div>"|16306.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16306-concerning-the-entrance-into-eternity/|7.3|Marc Masters

That's the number of years into Seattle singer/songwriter <a href=""http://damienjurado.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Damien Jurado</a>'s career that he linked up with production extraordinaire <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4137-richard-swift/"" target=""_blank"">Richard Swift</a> for the former's 2010 LP, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14258-saint-bartlett/"" target=""_blank"">Saint Bartlett</a></i>. The album saw the former painting his works with broader brushstrokes and an expanded palette of colors, exercising an accessibility that made the album stand out like a gloriously sore thumb in a catalog of Pacific Northwest folk rock that, for most of the previous decade, had only registered with the closest-watching of observers. As much credit as Jurado obviously deserved for making the leap from ""good"" to ""great,"" though, it's inarguable that teaming up with Swift, whose reputation as a studio collaborator grows with every release, was Jurado's most inspired choice during <i>Saint Bartlett</i>'s genesis. The echoed claps of the swooning opener ""Cloudy Shoes"" sounded like the remaining pieces of a puzzle, hidden for way too long, had been found and snapped into place.</p>
<p>Soulmates are hard to come by, and Damien Jurado definitely agrees. For his latest album, <i>Maraqopa</i>, he reunited with Swift in the latter's National Freedom studio in Oregon, the pair sharing performing duties. The results are kind of a sequel to <i>Saint Bartlett</i>: Like its predecessor, <i>Maraqopa</i> is largely varied in sonic mood, changing its tone song-to-song to include soft-psych freak-outs, rainy folk, haunted 1960's pop, and slow-burning oddball sparseness. That might sound like an unfocused mess on paper, but this collection's success lies in Swift and Jurado's restless experimentation. You can almost feel the heat off of the pair's kinetic synapses, as it radiates off every unspooling guitar line on the stormy opener ""Nothing Is the News"", or the gorgeous warbling that lies under ""Working Titles"".</p>
<p>Press materials for <i>Maraqopa</i> have pointed out that the title references a fictional, far-away place, going as far to subtly suggest that the record is a loosely drawn concept album. I'm not buying it-- partially because Jurado can't help but evoke the very real section of the United States he resides in, from the title of ""So On, Nevada"" to the Washington references in ""Working Titles""-- but that's not to suggest that <i>Maraqopa</i> is lacking in concept. Jurado recently mentioned on Twitter that he drew inspiration from <i><a href=""http://www.aquariumdrunkard.com/2010/11/29/the-end-is-at-hand-pt-1-2-a-homemade-psych-compilation/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The End Is at Hand</a></i>, a double-zip homemade compilation from California blog Aquarium Drunkard that rounded up obscure 1960s/1970s psychedelic folk and guitar music attached to the Jesus People's Movement.</p>
<p><i>Maraqopa</i>'s first half is, indeed, cloaked in the long shadow of religion, with references to ""golden crowns,"" stars aligning, and the spookiness of faith (and, at times, lack thereof). The spectre of belief literally haunts a few of these songs; ""Life Away From the Garden"" elicits chills via organ stabs and faded, childlike call-and-response backup singing, as Jurado exercises his sneaky lyrical talents with double-meaning (""There was a time/ When we were golden/ Like the sun/ We were lights in the world""). By the time the spooky, deeply felt weirdness of the invisible-fame non-fantasy ""Reel to Reel"" arrives, Jurado's belief-fixated eye has shifted from the intangible to the tangible, underlining a motive that's run throughout his career: always ask questions, whether you're staring at the sky, down below, or the people around you on solid ground.</p>
<p><i>Maraqopa</i> feels less revelatory than <i>Saint Bartlett</i> on pure impact; while the latter was a fine balance of chewy folk-pop delicacies and the basement-borne shadowy expressions that Jurado's built his fanbase on, this album is more of a mood piece, its melodic rewards teased out over time and drenched in the type of steady rain that his home state is known for. So, it's the second-best album of his career, then-- which is nothing to sneeze at, really. <i>Maraqopa</i> marks 15 years since Jurado's debut album, the Sub Pop-released <i>Waters Ave S</i>, and yet this fruitful renaissance has seemingly just begun, injecting new life into an artist who had less been written off than he'd been lost to the hype-obsessed, new-new-new sands of time. Whether the destinations be real or fictional, it'll be a real treat to watch where Jurado-- hopefully with Swift in tow-- will end up next.</p></div>"|16318.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16318-maraqopa/|7.6|Larry Fitzmaurice

True to stylistic expectations, these 10 songs are indeed rife with deicide, genocide, apocalypse, upheaval, bloodshed, and biting. The horror-house images are occasionally compelling, too, like the loaded descriptor ""bound in serpent's coil"" or the suggestive ""a drop of blood in water."" During opener ""Collapse in Eternal Worth"", there's talk of perdition and sacrifice, decay and slaughter, extinction and returning ""these false gods to realms of disease."" Elsewhere, heavens burn, virgins bleed, underworlds hunger, massacres gratify, and zombies rise. In a brilliant moment of deadly entendre, the narrator even intends to ""awake the mourning into onyx dawn.""</p>
<p>In an age of Mediafire links and nabbed torrents, though, you're rightly asking yourself who even reads death metal lyrics-- or lyrics at all-- really? Why take the time to pore over these 2,500 words concerning demons and death when you could simply let these 38 minutes blast at high volume? Wouldn't that be more fun? Generally, yes, but <i>Blood for the Master</i> is such a tedious listen from a tired band that the lyrics are more entertaining than the sounds behind them. Each of these 10 verbose tracks pummels through three to four minutes of rote, static death metal, racing through the motions with an edict that suggests not the obliteration of humanity or the heavens but instead imagination itself. If reading lyrics is boring, <i>hearing</i> these is a step worse. Musically, <i>Blood for the Master</i> is bland enough to make mid-song trade-offs between singer Louis Falgoust's serrated sneer and Sammy Duet's deeper bellow newsworthy, because it pretty much encapsulates the extent of any given song's dynamic. When the two briefly shout together during ""When Steel and Bone Meet"", it's a cause for care that passes as quickly as it happens. And when the second side opens with a spiraling web of acoustic and electric guitars played by producer Erik Rutan, there's an instant when you might even believe <i>Blood for the Master</i> can save itself. It returns immediately, however, into its own morass of circumscription.</p>
<p>It wasn't always this way for Goatwhore: Though they've never been a great band during their 15-year tenure, they've occasionally been interesting or, at the very least, promising. In 2006, <i>A Haunting Curse</i> trussed touches of their homeland's scuzz to the death metal tide, while traces of sprinting grindcore and mid-tempo Motörhead added depth. Nearly three years later, Goatwhore pulled the reins for <i>Carving Out the Eyes of God</i>, excising some of those excess strains while still allowing for enough black metal rushes and tempo twists for some measure of unpredictability. But <i>Blood for the Master</i> is completely codified so that little but the basics-- a lot of thrash, a load of weak solos, a pair of vocalists who mirror more than complement each other-- survive. Goatwhore offer a glimpse of black metal at the start of ""Beyond the Spell of Discontent"" before returning headlong into their own orthodoxy; on ""In Deathless Tradition"", they at least nod to a different tempo, sinking into sludge beneath Cookie Monster imprecations.</p>
<p>Pretty much everywhere else, though, Goatwhore stand boldly for the boilerplate, or sounds that have been captured with more enthusiasm and adventure countless times before. For a band that's lyrically so devoted to upsetting the order, Goatwhore sound unequivocally content with replaying the past. ""Praise the order of chaos,"" Falgoust barks at one point, just above the endless din of his ostensibly sanctimonious revivalists. Well, OK, but you first.</p></div>"|16319.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16319-blood-for-the-master/|4.8|Grayson Currin

It's the short fanfare ITC Entertainment used in its <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfT1ARWBDoA&amp;feature=related"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">mid-1970s pre-show identification</a>, smothered under enough reverb and crackle to evoke something not entirely dusted off before being spooled up, and if you recognize it at all it's probably from one of two contexts: either the beginning of ""The Muppet Show"" or <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us1M7ijbnxY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""It's a Big Daddy Thing""</a>. Say what you will about pop-music hauntology and its reliance on plucking at our memories, but that kind of cue isn't the entire conversation-- just an attention-getting way to start one.</p>
<p>Once <i>Lilacs &amp; Champagne </i>strikes that nerve, it pulls you through one of those experiences unique to sample-based, mostly instrumental music-- reconstructed old sounds built up into a theater of the mind, the soundtrack for a story that exists only in the blanks that listeners fill. Alex Hall and Emil Amos have spent enough time in Grails to have both the desire and the means to translate their ear for psych-inflected desert rock into something a bit different, more indebted to sounds that already exist but still have new juxtapositions in there somewhere. And the album that Hall and Amos put together is as much an evocation of Stones Throw genre-hoarding fadedness as it is of post-Syd, pre-<i>Dark Side </i>Pink Floyd in European-art-film-soundtrack mode. Think of the spookiest bits, intentional or otherwise, of small-press acid rock, library-music ephemera, or trans-continental exotica-- <i>Lilacs &amp; Champagne </i>brings it all to a head.</p>
<p>At its simplest, <i>Lilacs &amp; Champagne </i>runs its MPC fodder through a hangar-sized cavern of reverb, a move that gives its musically cinematic allusions the sensation of bringing dark, movie-theater isolation out into the great wide sunlit open.This gives its guitar/percussion interplay a sort of twangy, nerve-rattling airiness, another logical midpoint on the dub/rock continuum that <i>Internal Wrangler </i>tangled with a dozen years back. ""Sensations"" and ""Laid Fucking Back"" in particular have the cast of bleary-eyed, heatstruck codeine rock, Blue Öyster Cult's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyLMgIR69G4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Then Came the Last Days of May""</a> stretching on into an endless summer. Yet those cuts aren't alone in maintaining an overarching mood of sun-yellowed strangeness, even as they're interspersed with DOOM-ready slabs of grindhouse oddness like ""King of Kings"" and ""Listener X"" that wrangle the stoner-rock lineage into more explicitly hip-hop territory.</p>
<p>But above and beyond the memory-blurring allusions to vaguely experienced times and places that come with this kind of stylistic hybrid, the feel of <i>Lilacs &amp; Champagne </i>and its counterculture-exploitation-soundtrack appeal trades on a certain distinct self-awareness of its own evocative potential. It helps that there's an undercurrent of emphasizing what happens when mellow pleasantness, of-the-moment fad-chasing, and feel-good sophisticated kitsch grow unsettling with age. Love-scene string sections and guitars that sound like they could've come from an earnest hippies-for-Jesus folk mass are phased into decaying oblivion. The chipper Quaalude frolic interpolation of ""Anything Goes"" that ""Nice Man"" opens with could be the remnant of some now-irrelevant celebrity's hokey network variety show, but the lo-fi tape wobble that so many wave-gazers filtered their bedroom pop through turns this particular clip into the stuff of <i>The Shining, </i>especially when the skittering horror-movie pianos roll in. And the lounge-crooner refrain of ""Lilacs"" that gives the group and album their name bobs with an almost disembodied shakiness over a bed of synthesizers suited more to stalkers than romantics. It's sort of campy stuff, but it's gripping in its willful oddity, and its synthesis of long-lost psych and longer-lost B-movie mood-setting is dead on. The only way it could be more faithful to that experience would be if you stumbled across it at 3 a.m. while channel-surfing, and spent the next hour wondering if anybody at the station knew something this strange was even being aired. Assuming you weren't dreaming it.</p></div>"|16300.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16300-lilacs-champagne/|7.8|Nate Patrin

A minute in, a massive, Valhalla-pound  drum hit resounds, the synths explode sideways, and Frankie hurls us  down a flume ride of descending vocal harmonies. It's the most  colorful, thrilling music of her career, and as grand a pronouncement as one can make that <i>we</i>'<i>re not doing things the same way anymore</i>.</p>
<p><i>Interstellar </i>is a big, second-album leap of faith into deeper waters, a sparkling synth-pop record that wants very badly to mean something to dreamy, hyper-emotional twentysomethings. For her model, she's taken the impression of some of the dreamiest, most hyper-emotional records of her youth. The production on <i>Interstellar</i> is gorgeous, and clearly modeled on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/873-the-cure/"" target=""_blank"">the Cure</a>'s big, panoramic pop records, like <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14288-disintegration-deluxe-edition/"" target=""_blank"">Disintegration</a></i>: booming-canyon drums, acres of spannable horizon. The drum beat  that opens up <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12916-know-me/"" target=""_blank"">""Know Me""</a> is virtually identical to that of ""Close to Me"", and the silvery guitar leads on ""Gospel/Grace"" are pretty much mimeographed from ""Plainsong"". But although Rose indulges pretty heavily in the Cure's  primary colors, she paints something distinctly her own with them. The world of <i>Interstellar </i>is a vision of paradise as lifted from the front of a Trapper Keeper: air-brushed, pastel-hued, and gloriously vivid.</p>
<p><i>Interstellar</i> is not a thematically rich experience-- it basically has one single invitation, and that is to swim with Frankie in the glorious bath of echoes she's drawn for herself. ""All that I want is a pair of wings to  fly/ Into the blue, a wide open sky/ Show me your scars, I'll show you  mine/ Perched out of the city on a pair of power lines,"" she sings over  and over on ""Pair of Wings"", and you can hear this yearning for escape echoed in the record's every upward-spiralling note. Her singing has always been breathy and modest, but on <i>Interstellar</i>, her voice seems to mist on contact, even when she's swirling herself into a prismatic mini-choir of Frankies. On her record, she's just another celestial body orbiting larger ones.</p>
<p>The resulting album isn't one you actively explore so much as bask in gratefully. The longer I spend immersed in it, the more I appreciate its details: the haunting, truncated piano chords that the melody of ""Apples for the Sun"" clumps around, or the way Frankie's voice melts into and becomes one with the bloom of synthesized strings in the last minute of ""Gospel/Grace"". Rose is tapping the same slightly shameless  clear eyes/full hearts well of teen melodrama that sourced <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15881-hurry-up-were-dreaming/"" target=""_blank"">M83's <i>Hurry Up, We</i>'<i>re Dreaming</i></a>, and she demonstrates the same kind of focus and vision in carrying it off. On <i>Interstellar</i>, she transports us further and takes us higher than she ever could have as the drummer of an indie pop revivalist band. Amen to breaking free of sonic restrictions when  they outlive their usefulness.</p></div>"|16304.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16304-frankie-rose-interstellar/|8.4|Jayson Greene

Where he once found inspiration in the fast-changing and endlessly malleable world of laptop computers and customized Max/MSP patches, he eventually made a deliberate shift to explore the more limited possibilities of earlier technology. Electronic music was once the domain of academics and researchers with access to vast rooms filled with pulsing tubes and clusters of snaking cables. Only those with a commission were allowed anywhere near the machinery. Whitman has spent much of the last decade revisiting the approach and technology of those days and finding ways to personalize and update those tools, bringing the worlds of analog and digital together in a series of lower-key albums and EPs.</p>
<p>Whitman has an uncanny knack for taking the analog soundmakers and ring modulators of yore and applying his precise and detailed theoretical constructs to something that sounds, above all, <i>musical</i>. Pieces build and shift and go to unexpected places; textures feel grounded in a tradition but also open and exploratory. These characteristic virtues are here on his new album. ""Generator"" is a piece that Whitman premiered in 2009 and performed in different variations over the next couple of years. These two versions of the piece, very different in tone but with some overlap in terms of musical elements, were recorded at separate shows in September 2010.</p>
<p>There's a tiny detail in the early going of ""Issue Generator (for Eliane Radigue)"", recorded at a show paying tribute to the French electronic music pioneer, that lets us know we're in for something special. As a sine wave hum in the 100 Hz range fades in, we can hear someone coughing and weight being shifted on chairs. This is, in other words, a recording of live electronic music that was made by positioning microphones in a space rather than taking the feed from the sound board. That it's a recording of sound in a room rather than just an electrical signal is important; Whitman's M.O. is to explore the emotional possibilities at the intersection of disparate technologies and histories-- where digital meets analog, ""live"" meets studio, old meets new. And on these two tracks, we're hearing the results of these experiments in an approximation of how they sounded to those in attendance, imperfect rooms with their own resonances and people with respiratory issues and squeaking chairs.</p>
<p class=""p2"">After that opening drone, ""Issue Generator (for Eliane Radigue)"" shifts to a piece of classically pulsing minimalism, the rich tones of Whitman's synth rig spilling out notes and scales and rhythm. Sometimes the movement of the piece takes on an almost baroque air, echoing the mathematical perfection of Bach in the way phrases are proposed and resolved, and it is tuneful and melodic even as the structure is hard to apprehend, lingering just out of reach. It feels weirdly short even at 17 minutes, as its constantly shifting patterns and harmonic combination hint at a piece that could conceivably be endless.</p>
<p>While ""Issue Generator (for Eliane Radigue)"" is gorgeous and endlessly replayable, ""High Zero Generator"" veers further in the direction of experiment. Its first nine minutes are all crackle, bleep, static, and whirr, a lengthy excursion into the realm of pure texture. While the sound of the pinging tones and groaning springs have their own sort of magic, the piece's first half winds up feeling like a long build-up to the sequenced notes of its second, which uses textures and a compositional arc similar to the first piece. While ""Issue Generator"" is rich and full, ""High Zero Generator"" feels pinched and claustrophobic, as if fat synth tones were being shoved into a small hole and frayed into pieces. Together, the ""Generator"" pieces form a terrifically engaging contrast, a fascinating 35 minutes of electronic music that, while drawing heavily from the past, also sounds like nothing else out there now.</p></div>"|16315.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16315-generator/|7.5|Mark Richardson

It's become something of a minor cult classic; with<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2J_nnjUoSV8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> a Gucci-sampling hook</a> and a beat that is basically just a loop of Robert Miles' trance song <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC5ca6Hsb2Q"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Children""</a>, ""Rollin'"" still doesn't sound like any other dance music/hip-hop blend, because its goal was not to operate as functional dance music in any capacity. Compared with the four-on-the-floor Guetta sound common today, Block Beattaz had laced Jackie with a track that emulated ecstasy's emotional rush while leaving the dancing to someone else.</p>
<p>Jackie's latest tape with DJ Nick Catchdubs, <i>After Hours</i>, follows a similar formula. Despite the frequent references to club sounds new and old, the tape is closer in function to the Beatnuts' brand of ignorant party-rap than to Pitbull or Flo Rida. Instead of sampling the dance music of the 1960s, 70s, and 80s, though, this music draws on sample sources that rose in the wake of the rave. What helps make this release work is that it studiously avoids being just a club record; it simply references club records. ""Moving"" runs off of a sample that was everywhere the past few years; Etta James' ""Something's Got a Hold on Me"" was transformed into trance by Avicii, which was in turn remixed by Skrillex and played everywhere; shortly afterward, Flo Rida borrowed the same vocal sample. But Jackie's version actually uses Pretty Lights <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sk9XYQMRiLY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Finally Moving""</a>, which is primarily lounge-esque trip-hop, not functional club music.</p>
<p>To keep this interesting, it helps that Catchdubs has given him a wealth of clever and unexpected reference points; there are obvious novelty club samples from Scatman John's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIMWudFLsaY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I'm a Scatman""</a>.  The album's climax is ""Molly"", an ode to the ubiquitous ecstasy pill with a euphoric saxophone sample swiped directly from Guido's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLg_6Igz14E%20"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Mad Sax""</a>. There are exceptions, but-- thanks in part to Catchdubs' excellent work sequencing the record-- they end up feeling like a part of the overall ebb and flow. It's doubtful that DJ Burn One-- a largely traditionalist ""southern rap tunes"" advocate-- planned that his ""Don't Violate"" production would provoke the overwhelming nausea of a bad trip, but that's effectively its role on the tape.</p>
<p>One of the things that keeps the record relentlessly entertaining, of course, is Jackie Chain himself. He's a completely one-dimensional personality, which is perfect; it's a performance of party-rap ignorance with few peers, and his distinctive, shouted, caps-lock flow is the perfect blunt object to effectively convey raw ego. Not that the record is one-note; it manages to capture a wide range of variations on the partying theme. It's just that Jackie's role is to be the same consistent hardhead throughout. His character has no flaws or vulnerabilities; he's simply a partying everyman, his only motivations drugs, booze, money, and women. No one likes thinking about the consequences of stupid behavior, and that's exactly what Jackie Chain is offering: consequence-free hedonism in exactly the right setting.</p></div>"|16316.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16316-jackie-chain-after-hours/|7.8|David Drake

Generally, the practice is to take an album that was already good, put its songs in the hands of other artists, and cross your fingers in hopes that they'll turn in something interesting. Then, they give it to the label, pick the best (and/or catchiest) songs, and repeat the album release cycle with minimal legwork. At best, you'll have an interesting collection of tunes, one that does things the artist would have probably never tried. At worst, the whole process will be every bit as cynical as it sounds. In rare cases, you'll end up with an album that can hold its own against your best material.</p>
<p>That said, the idea of a band reinterpreting its own work, in spite of its also being a crapshoot, rarely ceases to be a fascinating venture. Even if it manages to be a drudge of a listen, minimal to the point of being skeletal, or simply a mess, there's always the thought process-- whether a clear musical narrative, an exploration into uncharted territory, or simply an attempt to improve the original-- that serves as a conceptual anchor. For a band as wildly cosmopolitan as Brooklyn's <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/labigvic"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">La Big Vic</a>, a trio that includes Pitchfork contributor Emilie Friedlander, it serves as a chance to recontextualize itself without dulling its sonic expansiveness. In fact, the group's sound houses so many components that paring them down and using a clear focal point yields some tremendous results.</p>
<p>As a lot of <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15602-actually/"" target=""_blank"">Actually</a></i> was built on the improvisational instincts of the band, it's no surprise that the dub plates used here are simply a foundation for them to mess with the (already loose) structure of the originals, to venture off into even more far-out territory. Fragments of the original songs are chopped, blurred, and stretched to fit their new grooves, while new harmonies, instruments, and even looped snatches of digital ephemera from other songs (and what sounds like a retro radio commercial) are woven into the whole. <a href=""http://mp3.imposemagazine.com/La-Big-Vic_Mr-Broken-Bird-Dub.mp3"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Mr. Broken Bird Dub""</a> dulls the propulsive bounce of its source song into something of an anticlimax when filtered into dub-- the opposite effect of the original-- but most of the tracks do a fine job of adjusting.</p>
<p>La Big Vic's proclivity for improvisation is best exemplified on ""LYNY Dub"" and opener ""Everybody Needs Jah (FAO Dub)"", where they take the most recognizable melodies of their originals and fuse them with a host of elements: pedal-treated synths, exploratory guitar work, even a section of uncut dialogue from Friedlander, trying to make heads or tails of a freshly recorded take. The concentration required to seamlessly merge as many styles as they do is the calling card of La Big Vic, but just as important is their innate ability to go off-script, creating a sound as natural, imperfect, and human as it is out of this world.</p>
<p>When you think about it-- as far-flung as their members are, as many world-music elements are subtly used in their music-- La Big Vic making a dub album isn't very far out of the realm of possibility. Dub is essentially a platform for experimental artists to utilize their most improvisational techniques and couple them with a strong (but not unbendable) rhythmic anchor. <i>Actually</i> was an album that achieved these goals by throwing out the rule book. It's not surprising then that a remix album that sets a clear template, while allowing the band to explore the outer recesses of its sound, is every bit as vital as the work from which it was derived.</p></div>"|16310.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16310-dub-the-world-actually-remixed/|7.4|Martin Douglas

He recorded the <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15134-mind-spiders/"">self-titled debut</a>-- a collection of lo-fi garage, glam, punk, darkwave, and rock'n'roll-- largely by himself out of boredom during the Marked Men's hiatus. When people showed interest, <a href=""http://www.latenightwallflower.com/site/2011/03/29/interview-with-mark-ryan-of-mind-spiders-the-marked-men/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">he found it strange</a>. Then, when he started getting requests to play some Mind Spiders festival sets, he did what Cloud Nothings and Wavves did before him: put together a band that would later accompany him in the studio. But while Dylan Baldi had three guys on <i>Attack on Memory</i> and Nathan Williams brought two along for <i>King of the Beach</i>, Ryan wrangled a veritable murderer's row of Texas garage staples for <i>Meltdown</i>: an additional guitarist (Stephen Svacina of Uptown Bums), a bassist (Daniel Fried of Bad Sports and Wax Museums), an organist (Peter Salisbury of Stumptone), and two drummers who play at the same time (Mike Throneberry of the Marked Men and Gregory Rutherford of High Tension Wires). Talk about everything being bigger in Texas.</p>
<p>But the mob effect is well-placed on <i>Meltdown</i>, where most of the songs have enormous hooks and use the extra hands for a fuller, more powerful soundscape. The loud-quiet-loud ""Play You Out"", for example, utilizes the extra guitar well-- during the softer moments, one churns the rhythm while the other adds tinges of harmony. When it picks up speed, the extra guitar amplifies the volume, naturally, but also adds another palpable layer of power. As for the second drum set, you have to listen carefully for it-- the occasional fill or cymbal crash will hang over the album's continuous drive-- but the extra kit seems to strengthen each song's percussive backbone. That said, it's not entirely necessary to have all the extra men in the studio-- the supplementary cymbals that follow the soaring opening riff of ""Beat"" could easily be added in post. But it's an album of robust garage-punk fare, and part of the appeal is that it'll sound just as sturdy and huge live.</p>
<p>The majority of that energy and volume is stacked right at the front of the album, the A-side brimming with anthemic riffs. It's hard to take opener ""You Are Dead"", a near perfect bit of chugging, under-two-minute power pop, off repeat. Ironically, that opening song also points to one of the biggest potential pitfalls for Ryan: Several tracks on <i>Meltdown</i> hold a not-so-subtle resemblance to Jay Reatard. The hooks, melodies, and even Ryan's voice are eerily similar. See ""More Than You"", which has an organ-led balladry format reminiscent of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uA_caYlBGeA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I'm Watching You""</a>. That's not to say Ryan copped Jay's style so much as the two men ran in similar circles and have always had like-minded sensibilities when it comes to songwriting. (See most of Marked Men's recorded output.) And really, it's hard to complain when the songs are as exciting and over-the-top as they are at the front of <i>Meltdown</i>.</p>
<p>For the first Mind Spiders album, Ryan didn't put too much emphasis on organization-- he jumped through different genres and styles. By contrast, <i>Meltdown</i> is organized with a loose sonic narrative. Synths start infiltrating the B-side, which works for the most part, but by the final track, ""Meltdown"", the live band is chucked out and replaced by a lengthy, unmoving, useless synth jam. And maybe that's the concept here-- that the album gradually ""melts down"" into <i>Computer World</i>-lite. After so much muscle, it's a disappointing finish (especially since it's placed directly after potential perfect album closer, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12967-wait-for-us/"" target=""_blank"">""Wait For Us""</a>).</p>
<p>That sci-fi instinct to melt rock'n'roll into synths is at least, thematically, a good fit for Ryan. He named the band after Fritz Leiber's 1961 sci-fi collection <i>The Mind Spider and Other Stories</i>, and he's said that he loves Brian Eno. On <i>Mind Spiders</i>, he communicated those interests by including the word ""spider"" in nearly every song for an ""old sci-fi movie plot"" effect. That seeps into <i>Meltdown</i> on several songs, like ""Upside Down"" (""the spiders are all around"") and ""More Than You"" (""When my head starts to crack/ And the spiders attack"").<a href=""http://www.austinchronicle.com/music/2011-02-04/x-ray-visions/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> According to Ryan</a>, it's not symbolic of any deeper meaning; instead, it's an attempt to appropriate sci-fi for rock'n'roll fun, as the Ramones co-opted horror movie imagery for ""Pinhead"" and ""Chain Saw"". And, until that last song, fun persists in the album's absurdly infectious hooks without being marred by concepts or meaning.</p></div>"|16272.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16272-mind-spiders-meltdown/|7.7|Evan Minsker

Their debut, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14251-treats/"" target=""_blank"">Treats</a></i>, may be the first record to fetishize the negative consequences of the Loudness War, with guitarist and producer Derek E. Miller pushing an already bombastic sound to absurd extremes by deliberately narrowing the music's dynamic range to the point of clipping even at moderate volumes. <i>Treats</i> owes its greatness to its simple, direct hooks, but the band's overly hot recordings were also thrilling in that they tapped into our positive associations with cranking stereos up to the maximum volume because we loved what we were hearing.</p>
<p>Sleigh Bells' second album, <i>Reign of Terror</i>, is plenty loud, but it doesn't rely on this volume trick. Instead, the duo emphasizes the delicate elements of their sound that mostly got crowded out in the midrange of <i>Treats</i>' speaker-melting din. Alexis Krauss, the former teen-pop singer turned punk-rock badass, is foregrounded throughout the record, and her roots in Clinton-era bubblegum are more fully integrated with Miller's heavy riffing. The beats are less indebted to hip-hop this time around and the guitar parts have gone full-on metal, alternating between elemental AC/DC-like hooks and late-80s harmonics.</p>
<p><i>Reign of Terror</i> is a brash, hyperactive set of songs, but Miller and Krauss' synthesis of disparate strands is exceptionally graceful, with traditionally macho and girly sounds flowing together seamlessly in dynamic, often ecstatic pop tunes. They refine their take on girl-group pop and cheerleader chants on ""Leader of the Pack"" and ""Crush"", and set shoegazer swooning to machine-gun drum fills on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12895-born-to-lose/"" target=""_blank"">""Born to Lose""</a>. More impressively, Krauss' melodies somersault over Miller's waves of alt-rock buzz guitar and colorful keyboards on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13002-comeback-kid/"" target=""_blank"">""Comeback Kid""</a>, and they fully commit to the gentle, sentimental melodies of ""End of the Line"" without compromising their noisy aesthetic. ""You Lost Me"", one of three consecutive songs that lean hard on metal harmonics at the end of the set, is straight-up gorgeous, with layers of clean notes, slow-motion drones, and breathy coos building to a headbanging catharsis.</p>
<p>Sleigh Bells pull off this more sophisticated and nuanced approach without calling attention to their improved craft or maturity. They remain obsessed with overwhelming their audience with excitement and pleasure, and their heaviest moments on <i>Reign of Terror</i> eclipse those on <i>Treats</i>. ""Demons"", the record's fist-pumping centerpiece, is an adrenaline rush sustained over three minutes, with Krauss affecting her most sinister tone above an overpowering riff straight out of the (original) ""Beavis and Butt-Head"" series. Miller has mastered the big dumb riff, but his arrangements are full of subtle touches that embellish and reinforce the bludgeoning attack of his chords. All through <i>Reign of Terror</i>, he and Krauss hit upon an ideal balance of texture and simplicity, expanding on their basic formula without losing any of their direct, unfussy charm.</p>
<p>The band makes such incredibly physical music that the lyrics would seem to be beside the point, but it's notable that so many songs on both records are fixated on winning and losing. This isn't a surprise, really-- given the triumphant sound of this music, what else would you want to sing over it? Krauss often sings from the perspective of a supportive confidant, offering a sweet pep talk on ""Comeback Kid"", or empathizing with a friend's suicidal thoughts on ""Born to Lose"". She spends a good chunk of <i>Reign of Terror</i> dwelling on the aftermath of violence and tragedy, seeking out ways of coping, moving on, and thriving despite the chaos. Themes of suicide pop up throughout the album, climaxing with ""You Lost Me"", which seems to be at least partly inspired by a pair of Nevada teens who attempted suicide while listening to Judas Priest in 1985. (One survived and their parents famously sued the band.) Krauss avoids moralizing on the subject, opting instead to project understanding and concern. In a small way, her approach is refreshing and subversive-- this sort of aggressive, over-the-top rock is traditionally a vehicle for narcissism, but she invests this music with kind-hearted concern for others.</p></div>"|16297.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16297-reign-of-terror/|8.2|Matthew Perpetua

Ital is Martin-McCormick's house-music project, or more accurately, the project in which he jumbles up house signifiers until they represent something sloppy and shaggy. <i>Hive Mind</i> is his first full-length as Ital after three excellent 2011 12""s helped launch <a href=""http://notnotfun.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Not Not Fun</a> sublabel <a href=""http://www.listentosilk.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">100% Silk</a>'s foray into electronic dance music.</p>
<p>A sound-world almost pathologically obsessed with its own neatness, house is an excellent foil for Martin-McCormick. It wasn't always this way: In its early Midwest ""disco on a budget"" incarnations, house music's wild, amateur, and experimental nature overwhelmed the mechanical precision of drum machines. Hive Mind isn't nostalgic, necessarily, but its unhinged attitude has more in common with early Trax recordings than, say, the note-perfect imitations offered by revivalist acts such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29053-azari-iii/"" target=""_blank"">Azari &amp; III</a>. Those early recordings were oriented toward social and communal issues; <i>Hive Mind</i> is smaller and more private. It's body music meant for the mind, though some distance from the living-room techno peddled by labels such as Smallville and Dial.</p>
<p>Recognizable four-on-the-floor kick drums provide a backbone from which Martin-McCormick can hang his gargled synths. In this way the beat and the tempos are familiar, but everything else is askew. See the diva-soup of album opener <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12954-doesnt-matter-if-you-love-him/"" target=""_blank"">""Doesn't Matter (If You Love Him)""</a>, which samples Lady Gaga and Whitney Houston. The message is simple enough-- dance music's wailing mantras are vainer and darker than their lyrical content often implies-- but the method is eerie and confrontational. <a href=""http://soundcloud.com/backspinpromo/ital-floridian-void-planet-mu"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Floridian Void""</a>'s glistening synths might've been an anthem, but Martin-McCormick interrupts them with half-heard conversations. Snippets of oration also dominate ""Israel"" before it settles into a slurred cowbell groove. Again, mind over matter: If the point of <i>Hive Mind</i> is to gain purchase on the dance floor, there are easier ways to go about it.</p>
<p>This mangled formalism is new for Martin-McCormick, who has traditionally operated under the everything-goes umbrella of post-punk (the interstitial industrial workout ""Privacy Settings"" is the only track here that forfeits composure). Martin-McCormick retains his fondness for long, engrossing pieces, stretching three <i>Hive Mind</i> tracks past the 10-minute mark. Unconcerned with whipping dancers into a frenzy, the tracks shift and swing unexpectedly. ""First Wave"", which contrasts a sickly sweet synth melody with grumpy, tumultuous rhythms, drops its melody repeatedly and randomly, and the result is the rare house track that feels as if it's decaying rather than building. The massed, clipping vocals of ""Doesn't Matter"" are <i>annoying</i>, intentionally so. Sonically familiar, <i>Hive Mind</i> subverts the expectations and structures of house music.</p>
<p>Perhaps you prefer the wild imagination of Mi Ami or Sex Worker; what Martin-McCormick accomplishes on <i>Hive Mind</i> is trickier and, frankly, more impressive. He's hardly the first artist to turn an experimental eye toward house, but his instincts are good, and it seems that he could churn out proper bangers if he weren't so mischievous. Important too is that <i>Hive Mind</i> doesn't feel wholly loving: There's healthy skepticism built into these readings, which are less about tearing down walls than rearranging the furniture. By reining in his more abstract impulses, Martin-McCormick has delivered as messy and thoughtful a take on house as we're likely to hear this year.</p></div>"|16256.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16256-hive-mind/|8.0|Andrew Gaerig

And even if Warp is still mostly considered a forward-thinking electronic label, it shouldn't be much of shock when they release something doesn't sound exactly like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/168-autechre/"" target=""_blank"">Autechre</a>-- see <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1843-grizzly-bear/"" target=""_blank"">Grizzly Bear</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4959-born-ruffians/"" target=""_blank"">Born Ruffians</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2956-maximo-park/"" target=""_blank"">Maximo Park</a>. But this Bushwick-via-Philly quintet's debut album somehow manages to exist in both of those realms. Despite being so out of character and anti-fashionable, it circles around to be its own kind of fashionability. While Fred Coldwell sings with a Yankee accent, this bleary-eyed and heartsick comedown rock is almost always associated with the UK or called ""classic rock"" by people who like to believe the Velvet Underground's popularity is equal to their influence. More than anything, <i>In Ghostlike Fading</i> sets out to make you think, ""they really don't make 'em like this anymore.""</p>
<p>Or, more accurately, they haven't made 'em like this since 2008. That's the last time we got new albums from Spiritualized and the Verve. <a href=""http://mybestfiend.com/HOME.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">My Best Fiend</a> come from a similar place, one where, to borrow a phrase from Richard Ashcroft, the drugs still work and they just make you worse. That said, <i>In Ghostlike Fading </i>lacks those bands' dope-sickness or cosmonautic ambition. Most of these songs follow a similar pattern: a few basic chords strummed on an acoustic soon joined by Coldwell's pleasingly adenoidal sneer, maybe a little electric piano or bluesy noodling tossed in to make it clear things are just warming up. The drums eventually come in and play so intently and unobtrusively that it's easy to overlook that they go missing for several minutes at a time. And then those same chords get played louder, and maybe a saxophone or slightly gospel-infused backing vocals makes things a little more widescreen but never too overblown. Given these elements, I can't help but think of <i>In Ghostlike Fading </i>personified as a dumpy apartment of college kids hungover on keg beer milling about, shooting the shit, and waiting for that one last guy to come out of hiding so they can <i>finally </i>get some brunch.</p>
<p>Which is to say that even with the cushy song lengths and top-shelf influences, <i>In Ghostlike Fading </i>feels like comfort food. There are certainly individual moments that stand out-- <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12933-cracking-eggs/"" target=""_blank"">""Cracking Eggs""</a> spends approximately 60 percent of its runtime in climax mode, windmilling guitar chords and massing group vocals on top of each other. On the opposite end, the gorgeous title track creates a florid, stare-at-the-sun psychedelia, and the ethereal arpeggios that cycle through the entirety of closing waltz ""On the Shores of the Infinite"" follow in that vein with an almost creepy delicateness.</p>
<p>But for all of its immediate pleasure, <i>In Ghostlike Fading </i>feels slightly vacant, valuing tribute and stylization above personal expression. Sonically, My Best Fiend have enough ""copy of a copy"" accusations to face, and Coldwell's lyrics are fittingly heavy on standard religious tropes and vague drug references placed <i>just so</i> that <i>In Ghostlike Fading </i>feels often inexpressive beyond a surface level (and potentially raises the question of just how much Chris Owens' biography influences our assessment of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1826-girls/"" target=""_blank"">Girls</a>' doing something similar). Take, appropriately enough, ""Jesus Christ"", if the mere title of the supine acoustic strummer ""One Velvet Day"" doesn't do it. I have no reason to think the feeling behind something like, ""Jesus Christ, I know that I'm wrong/ But I swear to God, I won't do it much longer,"" is somehow inauthentic-- lord knows, it's not aiming for the zeitgeist. But similar platitudes pop up all too frequently.</p>
<p>My Best Fiend can charm by never betraying the fact that they're still young, and it's understandable that they have a better feel for their record collection than they do their own voices. So <i>In Ghostlike Fading </i>shows a group still admirably ready to open up for arena bands or play early daytime shifts at festivals. It's not a stretch to think My Best Fiend's next batch of songs could come from those experiences, and hopefully they can do more to make them sound like theirs alone.</p></div>"|16281.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16281-in-ghostlike-fading/|6.2|Ian Cohen

They mixed black metal with math-rock and ecstatic classicism while writing a manifesto, making electronic music, and quoting David Tibet. Some people didn't like their attitude. And then there was <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15996-lou-reed-metallica/"" target=""_blank"">Lulu</a></i>, a collaboration between five very rich men who were so important to so many people in so many different contexts that culture critic Chuck Klosterman deigned to, once again, write about heavy music-- for a website bankrolled by ESPN, no less. Both of these scenarios included, for better and worse, someone crossing into new territory and subsequently raising either hackles or heckles.</p>
<p>But every battle doesn't have to be won or lost on a bleeding edge, an axiom that the young and enthusiastic doom metal trio <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/hailthepilgrim"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pilgrim</a> keeps sacred. There's nothing shocking or even provocative to report about these three, except maybe that their <i>noms de guerre</i> are incredible: the Wizard sings and plays guitar; Krolg Splinterfest, Slayer of Man slays his drums; and Count Elric the Soothsayer thumbs the bass. Otherwise, the news is that their debut album, <i>Misery Wizard</i>, is an extraordinarily enjoyable if stylistically ordinary entrée into a field that's spawned dozens of offshoots and hybrids during the last four decades. The primary influences here are as obvious as they are legion-- Black Sabbath, Cathedral, Candlemass, Sleep, Saint Vitus, and Electric Wizard, just to shake the ashes off the tip of the old joint.</p>
<p>But in a realm where the old-school and the experimental push against one another in an eternally dynamic non-equilibrium, it's certainly not about who your influences are. It's, of course, about how you use them. Pilgrim simply have fun with these predecessors, renewing old sounds with the zeal of teenage boys worshipping cheap Sabbath posters on their bedroom walls and the skills of players who've been at this for a while. Pilgrim sing about devils and tears, paying dues and surviving adventures, taking care to touch on most of the requisite tropes while not pushing any one too far. <i>Misery Wizard</i> isn't the sort of record whose importance will likely outlive its 55 discipleship minutes, but that has more to do with time and context than quality. This is an excellent debut from a preternaturally developed upstart.</p>
<p>In <a href=""http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2012/01/an_interview_wi_57.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">an interview</a> last month, BrooklynVegan baited the revivalist hook perfectly for Pilgrim, asking if the band was interested in integrating strains of other doom alloys into its sound. ""No, that stuff doesn't really interest us. We like 'true doom metal,' the classics!"" replied full-throated singer and riff-lurching guitarist the Wizard. ""We don't have time to sit around sulking. We are always ready for whatever quest lies before us."" Actually, Pilgrim sound more than ready. With a level of control that suggests contemporaries Yob, they march through each of these six tracks with steely resolve, not a miss among the bunch. The four-minute onslaught ""Adventurer"" manages all of the impact of ""Masters of the Sky"", a beastly, teasing, 11-minute trudge that spotlights the band's understanding of pacing and patience. Though their espousal of doom is spot-on, they twist a few tricks into <i>Misery Wizard</i>, like the coda of ""Quest"" that suggests post-rock heights and a demon-invoking chant on the back end of closer ""Forsaken Man"". And like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30107-pallbearer/"" target=""_blank"">Pallbearer</a>, the Arkansas doom squadron whose debut arrives only a week after this one, Pilgrim are as good with vocals as without them. On opener ""Astaroth"", for instance, while the band crackles over a hypnotic groove, the Wizard's bellow retrenches the force rather than distracting from it. In spite of age or debut status, Pilgrim works as an efficient unit. That's always a pleasure to witness, no matter the transgression or relative lack thereof.</p></div>"|16305.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16305-misery-wizard/|7.2|Grayson Haver Currin

I'm sorry, lyric sheet is something of a misnomer, this is a full-on <i>libretto</i>. Knowing the concept behind <i>I Am Gemini </i>is the easy part-- by now, you should know that <i>every </i>Cursive record is organized by some conceptual framework, and Tim Kasher has been more than happy to do the heavy lifting for us. Here, it's ""twin brothers separated at birth, one good and one evil, their unexpected reunion in a house that is not a home ignites a classic struggle for the soul."" Got all that? Now just try to imagine some misguided fool who downloaded this without the 13-page booklet laying out all the characters (which include twin sisters conjoined at the head), indicating ""stage direction,"" and generally letting you know what the hell is going on. But if that sounds a little too Mars Volta for comfort, there's good reason. Kasher similarly leaves you impressed by his dedication to this project even as you have no way to meaningfully interact with it.</p>
<p>And that inability to connect is troubling. Because even while <i>Cursive</i>'<i>s Domestica </i>and<i> The Ugly Organ </i>remain some of the most purposefully narcissistic albums to ever bear the emo tag, their lyrical acts of emotional martyrdom understandably inspired an intense cult. The feelings behind ""The Recluse"" and ""The Night I Lost the Will to Fight"" aren't exactly healthy, but they're human and worthy of being expressed where they could be related to rather than projected outwards. But lest you think Kasher was simply a breakup opportunist, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3646-album-of-the-year/"" target=""_blank"">the Good Life's </a><i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3646-album-of-the-year/"" target=""_blank"">Album of the Year</a> </i>proved he could make a compelling, fictional couples record. And though uneven, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9323-happy-hollow/"" target=""_blank"">Happy Hollow</a> </i>and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12818-mama-im-swollen/"" target=""_blank""><i>Mama, I</i>'</a><i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12818-mama-im-swollen/"" target=""_blank"">m Swollen</a> </i>had plenty of expressive moments where Kasher got outside of himself in order to make the same withering points about religion and consumerism as he did about relationships.</p>
<p>But here, Kasher's intent is less clear. Is it some sort of morality play, a grotesquerie exposing greed, ambition, and exploitation? You get some clues in songs that hint at underlying substance abuse, sibling rivalry, and schizophrenia, but the themes are cruelly underdeveloped, hinting at a prequel Kasher forgot to inform us about. If you zoom out far enough, you can ascertain the major plot points easily enough, and Kasher pads things out with references to homemade elixirs, amateur surgery, avian metaphors, Greek mythology, the book of Genesis, <i>Frankenstein</i>, and<i> Freaks</i>. But none of it's in service of establishing any sort of wider resonance or universality of the story, instead just spiking the punch with false potency as cadences bulge with overripe penmanship.</p>
<p>Conceptual tomfoolery aside, the music aligns with Kasher's increasing tendency to sand off the edges of his prickly attitude and serrated vocals, and <i>I Am Gemini </i>is by far Cursive's most playful record and almost <i>fun</i> at points. But it isn't necessarily catchier than their previous work, lacking the abrasion and unnerving over-sharing. Cursive were never the place to go for hooks, so how are Kasher's strengths transferrable? While <i>Gemini</i> gets off to an auspicious start with ""This House Alive"" and the new wave-ish ""The Sun and Moon"", unlike the ""singles"" from a similarly linear record like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7533-a-grand-dont-come-for-free/"" target=""_blank"">the Streets' <i>A Grand Don</i>'</a><i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7533-a-grand-dont-come-for-free/"" target=""_blank"">t Come For Free</a></i>, they're all but meaningless as vignettes. And soon thereafter, <i>Gemini </i>loses itself in its plot turns with an undifferentiated mash of rambling, almost randomly pitched vocal melodies, goofy keyboards, buzzing riffs, sarcastic harmonies, and a mocking delivery that sees its subject material as beneath him.</p>
<p>At one point on ""Wowowow"", Kasher sings in puns taken from Cursive titles, and this kind of meta exercise makes a sad kind of sense within the context of <i>I Am Gemini</i>'s impenetrability. After all, main characters like Cassius, Pollock, Young Cassius, Young Pollock, and the Narrator are <i>all</i> voiced by the same guy the same exact way, a more concrete way of essentially pointing out that the whole of <i>I Am Gemini </i>is Kasher talking to himself.</p></div>"|16291.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16291-i-am-gemini/|4.7|Ian Cohen

Digital interfaces invade our imagination in strange, tangible ways, and with each day I spend in front of my computer screen, the red Gchat dots representing my friends and co-workers start to look more and more like <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qnd-hdmgfk&amp;feature=related"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">HAL</a>. Have you ever caught yourself trying to open a new tab in your brain? Was the Wikipedia blackout of 2012 as important a cultural moment as the New York City blackout of '77? Do androids dream of electric sheep, or do you not have an app for that yet?</p>
<p>""Post-internet"" is a term that's stuck all too easily (<a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15751-geidi-primes/"">guilty as charged</a>) to Grimes' airy cyborg-pop, thanks in part to her endless quotability in acknowledging the digital world's influence on her aesthetic (""The music of my childhood was really diverse because I had access to everything."") But<i> Visions</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">,</span> the latest and best album from one-woman project of Montreal-based Claire Boucher, <span style=""font-style: normal;"">complicates the all-too-tidy ""post-internet"" tag by bringing into focus the many contrasts at the heart of her music: tensions between pop structure and diffuse atmosphere, between technology and the human body, between sensory-overloaded hyper-presence and transcendence. More solidly constructed and a lot more fun to listen to than anything she's put her name to so far, the electro cotton-candy of <i>Visions</i> is an inviting entrance into Grimes' peculiar kind of bliss.</span></p>
<p>On her first albums, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15751-geidi-primes/"" target=""_blank"">Geidi Primes</a></i> and <i>Halfaxa</i>, Grimes buried pop impulses within textured muck and gloomy tones. But <i>Visions</i> finds Boucher mining not just the clean brightness of Aphex Twin-like atmospherics but also the immediacy of straight-up mall-pop: ""Vowels = space and time"" recalls nothing so much as <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfBdGT4dn4E"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Stacey Q's 1986 hit ""Two of Hearts""</a>, while ""Infinite Love Without Fulfillment"" sounds like Boucher broke into the Apple store after hours and turned on all the display iPads to the same Lisa Lisa &amp; Cult Jam video, rhythmically looped into something sublime. Some of Grimes' reference points call to mind the experimental pop of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27668-nite-jewel/"" target=""_blank"">Nite Jewel</a> or some of the artists on the <a href=""http://www.listentosilk.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">100% Silk</a> roster. But that music seems interested in obscuring pop's immediacy or keeping a distance from the pleasure center, while <i>Visions</i> is an unabashed embrace of its source material, whether it's K-pop, new age, or bubblegum.</p>
<p>Boucher spends most of <i>Visions </i> singing in a vaporous falsetto. She occasionally manipulates her voice (as on the steely,<i> Transformers</i>-jam ""Eight"") but mostly she just loops it, layers it, and cloaks it in reverb; there are moments when what she's doing doesn't sound too far off from what <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27876-julianna-barwick/"" target=""_blank"">Julianna Barwick</a>'s music might sound like if she were interested in making a synth-pop record. The most common complaint I've heard of Grimes come from people wishing her songs were more structured or hooky, or that her voice was more ""present."" But-- never mind the fact that even the haziest moments on the record are anchored by melody-- this diffuseness is one of <i>Visions</i>' most refreshing charms. Another oft-cited quote from Boucher the ""post-internet"" poster girl: ""Basically I'm really impressionable and have no sense of consistency in anything I do."" This is pop music for ambient fans, but it's also a welcome change for anyone exhausted by post-Gaga pop's tethers to artifice, theatricality, and skronky, turned-up-to-11 beats. To reach out and touch this music would be like putting your hand through a cloud.</p>
<p>But there's still that tension: Song titles such as ""Be a Body"", ""Visiting Statue"", and ""Skin"" are all testaments to <i>Visions</i>' interest in the corporeal. When she sings the titular lyric on ""Be a Body"", it sounds like a nagging request to come back down to earth, while ""Skin"" (which has a sputtering sensuality, like a robot programmed to write a slow jam) feels even more revealing: ""Soft skin/ You touch me with it and so I know I can be human once again."" Still, don't confuse these moments with any kind of new-agey, back-to-nature longing. One spin of ""Genesis"" is enough prove it: Post-humanism sounds like a blast.</p>
<p>Late last year, Simon Reynolds <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/features/articles/8721-maximal-nation/"">described</a> electronic music's response to our digitized world as a new kind of maximalism: ""a hell of a lot of inputs... in terms of influences and sources, and a hell of a lot of outputs."" That's an apt description for the music that Grimes was making before, but <i>Visions</i> showcases a streamlined aesthetic, resulting in a statement that feels focused, cohesive, and assured. It's simple enough to leave room for Grimes to grow, but this thing is so compulsively listenable it's hard to come away from it wanting much more. Anchored to the digital imagination but unbridled from its skittish anxiety and concerns, <i>Visions</i> gestures skyward and beyond.</p></div>"|16211.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16211-grimes-visions/|8.5|Lindsay Zoladz

The Bristol expat doesn't appear to care too much for exposure, quietly releasing album after album either as a progenitor of the kind of dusky soundscapes dubstep would come to inhabit under his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4212-third-eye-foundation/"">Third Eye Foundation</a> guise, or turning to the mopey ruin of the folk-tinged work under his own name. <i>The Broken Man</i> is his latest stab at the latter, a rigidly austere set of seven songs enveloped in blood, sorrow, and torment. At times it feels like Elliott made it after falling flat on the studio floor, face down, choking on dust and bitter rumination. But these aren't ""small"" songs; this is an all-encompassing misery, grandiose in its own way, with great rushes of strings and doomy multi-tracked vocal hums zooming into the frame to pull Elliott up by his bootstraps. On the lengthy ""Oh How We Fell"", there's even the clang of an ominous church bell, acting as a wonderfully dramatic portent of changes in mood and focus.</p>
<p>Elliott has sunk down to this place before, on equally remorseful work such as the appropriately titled <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2755-drinking-songs/"">Drinking Songs</a></i> from 2005. The touchstones here are similar. When he lets his pangs of grief flush out on lengthy tracks such as ""If Anyone Tells Me 'It's Better to Have Loved and Lost Than to Never Have Loved at All' I Will Stab Them in the Face"", it's reminiscent of the sweeping mixture of guts and grief that make up <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1089-dirty-three/"">Dirty Three</a>'s stylistic métier. Like that band's music, there's a ruptured form of beauty here too, and it's one that takes a great deal of care and consideration to uncover. The standout ""Dust, Flesh and Bones"" takes numerous plays to really get to grips with its one-part <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/787-leonard-cohen/"">Leonard Cohen</a>-esque lament, one-part lawless-border-town feel. These songs are cloaked in darkness on initial plays, with Elliott building an impenetrable wall around them, only to remove it brick by brick over time.</p>
<p>It's a combination of his meticulous attention to detail and a knack for knowing how to let song structures softly contract into new shapes that makes it work. The joins don't show when ""This Is For"" turns from a quietly picked acoustic folk number into a stridently thumbed Spanish guitar piece. Elliott takes that initiative and picks it up again in the following song, ""The Pain That's Yet to Come"", matching the same guitar style to a backdrop of Caligulan cries and moans and great rushes of noise, providing a neat conceptual loop back to similar work earlier in the album. At times there's a mixture of the pit-of-despair weight of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4456-townes-van-zandt/"">Townes van Zandt</a>'s best tracks and the light/dark dynamic the most recent incarnation of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4008-swans/"">Swans</a> is so immersed in. The close of ""Oh How We Fell"", where filmy acoustic work falls into a deep well of gravely sighs and operatic trills, feels like the world turning upside-down following a swift kick to the feet of Elliott's barstool.</p>
<p><i>The Broken Man </i>is a brawny, robust album, the type of record that carries an uncommon weight and honesty. When Elliott darkly intones, ""this is how it feels to be alone,"" on ""Dust, Flesh and Bones"", there's complete conviction in his dead-eyed delivery, conveying an unwavering faith in his emotional regression. In lesser hands it's a line that could read as trite; with Elliott it feels well-worn, as though it's been churning around his head for years, gathering emotional baggage with the passing of time. But this isn't just a highly crafted plummet to the depths. There's an eerie, unearthly sense of displacement to much of the material, such as the spindly cries of bowed saw (or something simulating the sound of one) on ""How to Kill a Rose"". Those atmospheric touches make this feel like Elliott's most complete work to date, forming a vital link between his sunless balladry and the shattered electronica of Third Eye Foundation.</p></div>"|16294.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16294-the-broken-man/|7.1|Nick Neyland

But the aspiring rockers of the post-file-sharing era may want to consult <a href=""http://www.howlinrain.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Howlin' Rain</a>'s <i>The Russian Wilds</i>, and then reassess whether or not courting the nation's leading rock'n'roll yogi is worth the time and effort.</p>
<p>Crafted over a period of four years with extensive guidance from Rubin, the San Francisco quintet's latest full-length has all the tropes of a record-as-game-changer-- it's moody and duende-soaked, meticulously crafted, and sprawling in its ambition. But <i>The Russian Wilds</i> is not the neo-jam-band classic it might have been. A conscious stab at classic album-making-- with all of the madness, obsession, and studio overtime that allegedly entails-- <i>The Russian Wilds </i>strives for timelessness, but sounds temporally adrift.</p>
<p>In 2006, Howlin' Rain were little more than singer/guitarist Ethan Miller's side project-- a groovy aside to his main gig with psych-rock kamikazes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/805-comets-on-fire/"" target=""_blank"">Comets on Fire</a>. But it had a niche. Where Comets skewed toward scuzzy chaos, Howlin' Rain made a conscious effort to splice the mellow sounds of 1970s radio past with New Weird America present. ""I was trying to make it represent the nature and vibe of California, musically,"" Miller told <i>Arthur</i> magazine in an interview that trailed the group's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9125-howlin-rain/"" target=""_blank"">self-titled release</a>. ""I wanted to sonically represent the history of California bands."" That article brought the band to the attention of Rubin, who, after being suitably impressed with the band's live show, released Howlin' Rain's sophomore LP, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11304-magnificent-fiend/"" target=""_blank"">Magnificent Fiend</a></i>, on his imprint, American Recordings, and offered to produce its next album.</p>
<p>Nearly half a decade later, the work is done. In the years that it took to make <i>The Russian Wilds</i>, entire bands have gone from 7"" to LP to bargain bin. Most of Howlin' Rain's new-weird peers-- like Comets on Fire or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4815-brightblack-morning-light/"" target=""_blank"">Brightblack Morning Light</a>-- have either broken up or receded from the spotlight. Times have changed.</p>
<p>Howlin' Rain have, too. During the intervening years, the group has been almost entirely re-staffed, with only Miller and keyboardist/guitarist Joel Robinow sticking around from the <i>Magnificent Fiend </i>lineup. But there's been a distinct sonic shift as well. At Rubin's urging, the band has moved its classic-rock reference points southward-- away from Bay Area favorites like the Grateful Dead and toward Los Angeles groups such as Little Feat and the Eagles. The riffs are softer and funkier, not that far adrift from the shores of yacht rock. Miller has refined his singing style, too. Where he used to bleat and holler like Ted Nugent's punk-rock grandson, here he dials back the wailing in favor of clarity.</p>
<p>The band's ear for epic prog-rock pageantry remains intact. Many of the songs on <i>The Russian Wilds </i>muscle past the six-minute mark, letting Miller and lead guitarist Isaiah Mitchell (on loan from San Diego stoner titans Earthless) exercise their shreddiest instincts. On album opener ""Self Made Man"", three-part harmonies and gentle strumming give way to dueling dive-bomb solos. The band's new-weird chops are more visible here than in the past if only because they stand in sharper juxtaposition to Miller's soft-rock songwriting.</p>
<p>As a producer, Rubin pushes hard for songwriters to reach into deep, dark places and wring out the bleak bile of their soul in song. Miller meets that challenge with lyrics about suicide (""Strange Thunder""), self-doubt (""Self Made Man""), and regret (""Can't Satisfy Me Now""). But gloom and doom aren't a natural fit for Howlin' Rain.</p>
<p><i>The Russian Wilds</i>' main failing, though, is that, in comparison to the band's concerts, it feels flat.  According to Miller, Rubin put him through his paces during the demo process-- pushing the band to write and discard an extra album's worth of material and to set aside its notions of genre. But genre writing is central to Howlin' Rain's appeal. On <i>Magnificent Fiend </i>the band was blissfully aware that it was a punked-up cartoon of 1970s rock. On <i>The Russian Wilds</i>, their sense of purpose sounds clouded, and the performances ultimately suffer. The force of self-examination sands down the band's ecstatic energy.</p>
<p>In interviews, Miller is honest that the making of <i>The Russian Wilds</i> was, for the most part, a drag. Never in a rush to get anything done, Rubin would disappear for long periods of time, leaving the band high and dry. That's one thing when a band is financially independent, but another when you're recording a group of California psych-rock lifers who are struggling to pay rent. Had all of the self-help and record-studio psychodrama been set aside, there's every reason to believe that Howlin' Rain could have simply bashed out <i>The Russian Wilds </i>in a weekend and moved on.</p></div>"|16302.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16302-howlin-rain-the-russian-wilds/|6.4|Aaron Leitko

He handles everything on Liberteer's debut, <i>Better to Die on Your Feet Than Live on Your Knees</i>, a compact but exceedingly expansive grind record packed with major-key riffs, digitized horns, real-life banjos, mandolin, martial drumming, blast beats, and the lyrics you'd expect from the setup and the CrimethInc.-like vibe of the album title.</p>
<p>His words are unrelenting. Widener isn't one for metaphor or couching things in poetry. You can delve into the lyric sheet (""T<span style='font-size: 12pt; font-family: ""Times New Roman"";'>o birth a world, the first must die,"" </span>""K<span style='font-size: 12pt; font-family: ""Times New Roman"";'>illing never justified itself/ But sometimes you must fight/ When peaceful protests choke in tear gas/ Blitz in black bloc squads</span><span style='font-size: 12pt; font-family: ""Times New Roman"";'>,"" ""To be happy, god damn it, kill those who own property"")</span> or focus on songs with titles such as ""We Are Not Afraid of Ruins"" and ""Class War Never Meant More Than It Does Now"". (Then there's the booklet that comes with the album and gives instructions on how to use the case, the CD, and said booklet as a weapon, as a way to hop barbed wire fences, as a stencil for graffitti, as a bomb, etc.)</p>
<p><i>Better to Die</i> opens with ""The Falcon Cannot Hear the Falconer"", a short instrumental that takes its name from W.B. Yeats' much-quoted poem ""The Second Coming"". Despite its context, anarchy, in the descriptive sense, doesn't come across in the music itself: Widener, who also records classical music, carefully composed these 27 minutes. Repeated motifs echo throughout the collection; specific guitar parts resurface. The 17 songs bleed and blend. There's an overall arc as well as the in-song drama. It's a tightly contained outburst.</p>
<p>The first proper track, ""Build No System"", incorporates triumphant horns and flutes into its final section, and it comes over like Napalm Death clobbering John Philip Sousa. Another track, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13102-usurious-epitaph"">""Usurious Epitaph""</a> basically breaks into ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"" at the 42-second mark. ""99 to 1"" works in some electronics that would sound dance-y even without transforming into the weirdo ""Chariots of Fire"" grind of instrumental ""Sweat for Blood"". If not for the crunchy distorted guitars, the banjo and horn-lined ""Rise Like Lions After Slumber"" would make sense at a Stare Fair hoedown. Thing is, even when he's not incorporating these oddball flourishes, <i>Better to Die</i> is a memorable, staggeringly detailed, shout-along collection. (Grindcore doesn't often sound this <i>big</i>.)</p>
<p>Widener's decision to place his very real call for action in this anthemic, angry, surprisingly catchy (and just plain surprising) grindcore was a smart one. More than any album I've heard in recent years, <i>Better to Die on Your Feet Than Live on Your Knees</i> reminds me of the more idealistic, early-20s version of myself who moved West with a sleeping bag and some books, to basically dumpster dive, write, and read anarchist theory and Beckett, who I thought could teach me something very real with his expansive use of minimalism. I got older and more cynical, and rejected anarchism for various reasons, but <i>Better to Die</i> is the kind of record that draws that line in the sand again. It reminded me how good it feels to want to tear things down; more importantly, Widener has the intelligence and ambition to create something new in the process.</p></div>"|16299.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16299-better-to-die-on-your-feet-than-live-on-your-knees/|7.8|Brandon Stosuy

Sarah Rara and Luke Fischbeck clearly favor museums and galleries over concert halls and nightclubs. They pay more attention to context than content, and spontaneous audience interaction (in the <a href=""http://paulineoliveros.us/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pauline Oliveros</a> mold) is at the heart of their project. Their albums tend to feel like annexes of what they call ""<a href=""http://www.hawksandsparrows.org/bio.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interactive performances and installations</a>,"" rather than self-contained works measurable by conventional standards. But as disjointed as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10091-widows/""><i>Widows</i></a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12573-dream-island-laughing-language/?utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=related-content&amp;utm_name=albumreviews""><i>Dream Island Laughing Language</i></a> could be, they were redeemed by their energy and zippy ideas, which had cumulative force even when they were individually slight. If one electro-acoustic doodad didn't interest you, another was always right on its heels. It's hard to make the same concession to the new <a href=""http://luckydragons.bandcamp.com/album/existers"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Existers</i></a>, where the ideas are almost insultingly thin.</p>
<p>After recording uncharacteristic drones ""inside of an egg, a pyramid, and on top of a mountain"" for <a href=""http://luckydragons.bandcamp.com/album/shape-tape"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">2011's <i>Shape Tape</i></a>, Lucky Dragons return to the techno-tribal primitivism of their earlier albums on this limited-edition collaboration with visual artist Jesse Hlebo of <a href=""http://swillchildren.org/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Swill Children</a>. Dominated by tuned and textured percussion, the marbled tones of modular synthesizers, and electronically dismembered voices, it's full of sounds that get stuck and repeat, inert elements clashing with constantly changing ones, and harmonic patterns that spectrally multiply. Sometimes, it strikes a decent balance between the grimy attack of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1411-excepter/"">Excepter </a>and the dreamy flow of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8800-hans-joachim-roedelius/"">Hans-Joachim Roedelius</a>. Often, it sounds like scraps <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1831-gang-gang-dance/"">Gang Gang Dance</a> would have left on the figurative cutting-room floor. The album is startlingly profligate with its 21-minute lifespan, casting about for inspiration as if it's got all day.</p>
<p>Indifferent sequencing shines a harsh light on <i>Existers</i>' dearth of content. Only three of its seven songs are developed enough to earn the designation, and they occupy track positions one, two, and six. Brief interstitials can work great between substantial compositions-- that's why they're called interstitials!-- but three of them in a row is not a good look. After the lightweight but adequately wrought arcs of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12979-existers/"" target=""_blank"">the title track</a> and ""What You See is What You Get"", we're left to stare down the barrel of a couple of happy accidents with a looping pedal and a reprise of an already worn-out motif, until the purposefully driving ""Mirror Makers"" seems to capture Lucky Dragons remembering that this is supposed to be an album for other humans to enjoy, not a private jam session. That all flies out the window on ""No Weapons"", where Fischbeck just sings the title over some kalimba-sounding tones for a couple of minutes, and we're done. <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;""> </span></p>
<p>Lucky Dragons are in the habit of sandbagging their music with outrageously elevated rhetoric, and <i>Existers</i> is no exception. ""EXISTERS,"" <a href=""http://store.swillchildren.org/product/lucky-dragons-existers-lp-12"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">we're told</a>, ""resist without intervening, subsist without consuming."" It's a meretricious piety that becomes flat-out absurd when attached to a physical, commercial artifact that creates imaginary value through artificial scarcity. At best, it's disingenuously flattering; at worst, it reveals a fatal blind spot between what Lucky Dragons are doing and what they think they're doing. The very real dilemma for artists who are wary of the marketplace-- to make products or not to make products?-- is not satisfactorily resolved by making half-assed products under the guise of some vague brand of resistance. All praises due to those who break the mold, but if you're going to make (and sell) a record? Make a fucking <i>record</i>.</p></div>"|16303.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16303-existers/|4.8|Brian Howe

Though their handsomely recorded albums and Jonathan Meiburg's former membership in <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/3141-okkervil-river/"" target=""_blank"">Okkervil River</a> put them in the context of NPR darlings and amphitheater headliners, they're still a tough sell: Often compared to Talk Talk at their most commercially forbidding, they're not populist like Okkervil or the National, their theatricality doesn't appeal to a <i>specific</i> brand of geekdom like the Decemberists or Andrew Bird, and their artiness is too pretty and studied to be edgy. Even when trying to describe what makes something like <i><a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11560-rook/"" target=""_blank"">Rook</a></i>'s ""The Snow Leopard"" a staggering listen, you're left with chin-stroking explanations, like how a trumpet's fanfare finally breaks the tension of John Congleton's immaculate production, but it lasts three seconds and takes four minutes to get there.</p>
<p>On <i>Animal Joy</i> too many changes are afoot to think Meiburg isn't chafed by the situation: They've peripherally moved from one indie titan (Matador) to another (Sub Pop) and from one revered indie producer (John Congleton) to another (Danny Reisch). But more notably, take a look at the unusually plainspoken title: <i>Animal Joy </i>proves they are still a naturalistically minded band, but in dropping the more arcane conceptual gambits of their self-described ""trilogy"" of <i><a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10073-palo-santo-expanded-edition/"" target=""_blank"">Palo Santo</a>, Rook</i>, and <i><a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13934-the-golden-archipelago/"" target=""_blank"">The Golden Archipelago</a> </i>and speaking in layman's terms both emotionally and sonically, they're taking their best shot at meeting new listeners halfway.</p>
<p>They come racing out of the gate to do so on ""Animal Life""-- Meiburg's amped-up choirboy vocals have always been suited for grand, sweeping gestures and yet he's never delivered something so overtly pop. To put it in his preferred orinthological terms, it's a peacock moment for sure, pure 1980s corporate rock because it somehow <i>sounds </i>expensive, striving to honor ambition itself as intrinsically good-- it could be a Florence and the Machine song, NBC could use it to soundtrack their commercials for the Summer Olympics, but they throw in enough fussy chord changes and dissonant fringe to keep things from getting too cozy.  There's a similar release-the-hounds rush to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qhpOI2f_mY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""You As You Were""</a>, a sonic and poetic ramble culminating in Meiburg's desire to ""Go back to the East/ Where it's all so civilized/ Where I was born to the life/ But I am leaving the life."" Whether it's meant as a candid admission from a touring musician or a nod to the desk jockey that longs to mount a wild steed, it feels like a mission statement; <i>Animal Joy </i>doesn't so much stand for carnality but for the thrill in upsetting the equilibrium between domesticated repression and desire for primitive abandon.</p>
<p>While <i>Animal Joy </i>doesn't totally do away with Shearwater's exploratory tendencies,<i> </i>Ek's production is radio-friendly in the sense that there's a constant presence to this music-- even the comparatively quieter moments make themselves heard fairly easily. In the past, Shearwater songs occasionally <i>got </i>loud, but lead single <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12857-breaking-the-yearlings/"" target=""_blank"">""Breaking the Yearlings""</a> <i>is </i>loud throughout, big churning guitars and busy, inventive percussion from the truly underappreciated Thor Harris. That said, it's still a Shearwater song in that you'll get more out of it if you happen to know that yearlings are essentially pubescent horses, energetic and unpredictable. Indeed, though considerably dialed-back, Meiburg hasn't lost his preference for poetic devices-- whether equine or otherwise-- to keep any attempts to present Shearwater as a red-blooded, blue-collar rock band short lived. Amidst the trudging orchestral strains of ""Insolence"", he announces rapture as a time ""when my thoughts become undisciplined... it is effortless,"" a wish-fulfillment fantasy for a band whose power is often the result of fairly obvious effort. And though Shearwater typically allow themselves one song per album to rock out of character, ""Century Eyes"" or ""Corridors"" wouldn't prepare you for how ""Immaculate"" gets all Eddie &amp; the Cruisers with it, complete with tweaked 12-bar blues riffs, and a reckless loner named Johnny as a narrative device.</p>
<p>Yet while being Shearwater's most accessible record by some margin, it isn't quite the best, and toward the record's back half, it begins to become clear why. Meiburg's inimitable vocals aside, this is the first batch of Shearwater songs that could conceivably be the work of another band, confirming what made <i>Rook </i>unique while hinting at their shortcomings previously unexpressed. While the streamlined ""Open Your Houses"" and ""Dread Sovereign"" ably replicate the rhythmically stoic but emotionally jittery mien of fellow Austinites Spoon, Meiburg's imperious vocals cut against a musical backdrop that calls for more strut or swagger. Likewise, the startlingly ordinary iPhone-waver ""Star of the Age"" closes <i>Animal Joy </i>by bringing Shearwater perilously towards to the sort of adult-contemporary indie wallpaper they've never been.</p>
<p>These are minor quibbles, as even Meiburg admits that <i>Animal Joy </i>is something transitional for the band. And it's a welcome move-- <i>The Golden Archipelago </i>fell victim to the sort of indulgence and inscrutability that's to be expected from a concept album titled <i>The Golden Archipelago</i>, and the worry then was that Shearwater would be content to drift even further into their rococo fantasies without realizing they'd left the rest of us behind. Even if <i>Animal Joy </i>brings them closer to the mainland of pop and rock, it'll still take a lot to place these guys in the middle of the road, and after all, what's a more basic animal joy than to be appreciated?</p></div>"|16277.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16277-animal-joy/|6.9|Ian Cohen

His career trajectory felt grease-slicked and frightening, like he was in a car fish-tailing across a major highway, and Gucci did his best, in his music, to reinforce this sensation: Two of his most-repeated ad-libs (""nyyyyyaooooowwww"", ""SKRRT! SKRRT!"") are the sounds of high-speed vehicles spinning out of control. Everything that has happened to him since then-- arrests, jail time, abuse cases-- illustrates the sad difference between the artist who courts chaos and the artist who succumbs to it. Everyone loves a live wire when they're sparking, but the flip side of ""live wire"" is, of course, ""perpetual fuck-up."" Gucci fans and rubberneckers alike have had more than enough of both sides to last them a few years.</p>
<p>To have fallen in love with Gucci's drunken-carnival rendering of gangsta rap, then, is to have learned to take what you can get from him, when and where you can get it. I may be alone on the internet in admitting it, but I enjoyed <i><a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16133-baytl/"" target=""_blank"">BAYTL</a></i>, his inexplicable, internet-baiting team-up with Kreayshawn associate and deeply lamentable human being V-Nasty, simply because it provided several solid-to-great Gucci verses alongside production by frequent collaborator Zaytoven, whose best beats sound like they're built entirely from Dippin' Dots. Gucci never conquered the rap world-- sales figures for <i><a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13793-the-burrprint-the-movie-3-d-the-state-vs-radric-davis/"" target=""_blank"">The State vs. Radric Davis</a></i>, his best shot, roughly equalled that of the Game's last studio album. But nothing has been able to quite stop him and, every once in a while, he still surprises us with something great.</p>
<p><i>Trap Back</i>, his latest release with noted mixtape curator and professional loud person DJ Holiday, is just that: great. It isn't as great as <i>The Movie 3-D</i> or the first <i>Writing on the Wall</i> mixtape. Or <i>Gucci Sosa</i> or even the 10-track <i>Gucciamerica</i> throwaway or <i>The Gooch Man</i> or any number of his past classics. But like all his best music, it is colorful and interesting and flagrantly dumb and sneakily clever, all at once. His mush-mouth buries the details of his writing so deep that you'd have to spend ages picking them out, but on a good Gucci verse, you can feel them flying by on first pass, content in the knowledge that you will be able to revisit and explore them later. In the dope-sales reminiscence of ""Back in 95"",  details like ""Smokers didn't know my name, so they used to call me Black"" and ""Dope-fiend Willie used to finger-fuck my rims"" leap out and instantly signify a great rapper firing on all cylinders.</p>
<p>Gucci's best verses are also insanely memorable; it's very hard to walk away from his music without at least two or three phrases doing the dryer-cycle tumble through your mind. His voice is a difficult instrument to describe: Pitched somewhere between  whine and blare, he sometimes sounds like a huge, overgrown baby who's bumped his head on a table corner. But the way he uses it to take apart words and put them back together with strange new emphases-- ""Ghett-O, a-LASK-a, ghett-O, neBRASKa""; ""I'm in the trap house, with SHOES on""-- is a brain-teasing pleasure. The phrasing in his best raps feels sticky, like a filthy movie theater floor under sneakers: ""I drop the top like 'fuck it'/ I'm not in no lil' Cutlass/ I pull up in the 'What the?'/ Fuck, I don't know was it"" he teases on ""Plain Jane"". On ""Thank You"", he unleashes this thick, transcription-worthy run: ""Count a hundred in Syria/ Peanut-butter interior/ My jewelry game on Frigidaire, my watch game cold as Siberia/ Gucci Mane, is you serious? Hell yeah, I'm serious/ Red watch with a red chain, my diamonds on they period.""</p>
<p>The other reason <i>Trap Back</i> is great is the increasingly prominent Atlanta producer Mike Will Made It, who continues to demonstrate that he has an ear for the smallest details that make a simple rap song a great rap song. His sound is like a Flubberized blending of Zaytoven's 8-bit pings and Drumma Boy's funeral marches: it's menacing and playful all at once, which means its a perfect match for Gucci's style. In a development that really shouldn't have taken this long, he flips the <i>Tetris</i> theme into trap music for Gucci to rap on for ""Get It Back"". The instrumental could serve as a neatly boiled-down synopsis of Gucci's style: simple, deceptively absorbing, maddeningly addictive,  frantically paced. Drumma Boy also swings by, and Zaytoven contributes some of his gangsta tinker-toy productions.

Despite a long career based on short songs, Evan Dando is neither a promising young artist anymore nor a reliably established alt act, but he still keeps chugging, unwilling to follow Buffalo Tom or Belly into that dark night. And yet, he hasn't reinvented himself as a bold businesswoman like old friend/muse Julianna Hatfield, nor has he graduated to <i>éminence</i> <i>grise</i> like fellow Bostonian J Mascis. Instead, Dando remains plain ol' Dando, occupying just enough of the public consciousness to qualify for a career but not enough to suggest a revival any time soon. Despite the recent reissue of <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11324-its-a-shame-about-ray-collectors-edition/"">It's a Shame About Ray</a></i>, which showed just how sturdy his seemingly slight songs could be, his music is well served by his way-left-of-the-dial place in pop culture, as two new reissues reveal.</p>
<p>For most bands, <i>The Hotel Sessions</i> might seem like a curious release-- or at least curiously timed. Maybe 10 years late. It's a collection of demos recorded to a friend's Walkman at a hotel in Bondi Beach, Australia. Dando says he can't remember if he recorded it at the tail end of 1992 or in the early days of 1993, but that amnesia only adds to the record's stoner charm. It's just him and an acoustic guitar, although the tape hiss and pot smoke should get songwriting credits. You can almost hear the rumpled sheets and bad painting on the wall.</p>
<p>Most of these songs would eventually appear in polished studio form on<i> Come on Feel the Lemonheads</i>, which was their best-selling album but not their best and which has been dollar-bin fodder for the vast majority of its shelf life. Yet these tunes might actually have more charm in this woozy setting, as hits such as ""Into Your Arms"" sound sweeter and the line, ""If I was a booger, would you blow your nose?"" sounds bittersweeter (somehow). On the other hand, certain aspects of Dando's songwriting still sound mired in the period, as if preserved in alt amber: ""Paid to Smile"", he explains, was inspired by doing a string of radio performances with a hard-working and enthusiastic publicist. ""Please don't hold the door, I can work the handle on any door,"" he sings before dismissing her efforts summarily: ""You get paid to smile."" How 90s is that?</p>
<p>Still, I'd much rather hear Dando's outtakes than, say, Rivers Cuomo's, if only because these pre-emo demos walk the line between introverted and extroverted rather than embrace self-absorption like a business plan. Somehow, Dando's nonchalance here-- his stoned cadences, fleeting hooks, loose-limbed guitar playing, and generally rumpled demeanor-- comes across as a weird but sincere gregariousness. That makes <i>The Hotel Sessions </i>an ideal Lemonheads retrospective, summing up the band's appeal more authoritatively than a conventional collection of hits ever could.</p>
<p><i>Laughing All the Way</i> <i>to the Cleaners</i> is a conventional collection of hits. Named after the group's first release, when Dando was the drummer, this 2xCD, UK-only comp might be too generous at nearly 50 tracks. The familiar songs are all here: ""It's a Shame About Ray"" and ""Mrs. Robinson"" serve as disc openers, and ""Into Your Arms"" and ""Frank Mills"" aren't too deep in the tracklist. But so are never-charted singles, fan faves, and deep-album cuts such as ""If I Could Talk I'd Tell You"" and ""Confetti"", which testify to Dando's deceptively tight craftsmanship. On the other hand, what does it say about your catalog when goofy, one-off, one-listen experiments like ""Rick James Style"" and your unbearably ironic New Kids on the Block cover make your greatest hits?</p>
<p>Speaking of covers, <i>Laughing</i> is full of them. Dando has always cast a wide net, but the 90s being the 90s, there seems to be a cheeky ""Step by Step"" (NKOTB) for every sincere ""Frank Mills"" (<i>Hair</i>). Their take on Simon &amp; Garfunkel's ""Mrs. Robinson"" still sounds fairly redundant 20 years later, although the bong solo is a nice way to undercut the generational solemnity, and Randy Alvey &amp; the Green Fuz's ""Green Fuz"" is certainly not the obvious choice from <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13117-varshons/"">Varshons</a></i>. On the other hand, Dando's version of Michael Nesmith's ""Different Drum"" exudes all the youthful self-determination that has given the song such a long life, and ""Brass Buttons"" and ""Just Can't Take It Anymore"" suggest he might have a full-length Gram Parsons covers album in him someday.</p>
<p>These covers are pleasant diversions, never definitive but not without a sense of self-critical commentary either. Dando is telling us how to listen to his music and how to triangulate his sound, which is more than <i>Laughing </i>does. By forgoing a chronological tracklist in favor of a jumble of tunes, the comp downplays any sense of transformation and growth, suggesting a flatness to Dando's craft. Rambunctious early tracks ""Mallo Cup"" and ""Hate Your Friends"" jostle against cleaner, more streamlined tunes ""The Turnpike Down"" and ""Pittsburgh"", but <i>Laughing</i> doesn't note the discrepancy, much less explain it. It's not that the Lemonheads demand a strict history, but there's no animating thesis here, no sense of the shape of Dando's improbable career. In short, there's no reason why we're listening to these particular songs in this particular order. All this comp tells us is that Dando wrote some great songs over the last 25 years, but we knew that already.</p></div>"|16298.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16298-the-hotel-sessions-laughing-all-the-way-to-the-cleaners/|7.3|Stephen M.

While Meluch's music often resembles an amnesiac crooner making up karaoke lyrics for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/410-boards-of-canada/"">Boards of Canada</a> instrumentals, and Irisarri splits the difference between <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8602-harold-budd/"">Harold Budd</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1686-gas/"">Gas</a> (trending post-minimal under his own name and electronic as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26580-the-sight-below/"">the Sight Below</a>), both of them freely muddle up ambient, classical, electronic, and pop idioms in search of the ideal blend of melodic immediacy and formal opacity. And they've been moving in the same interlocked circles for years, recording for most of the bigger labels that steward this furtive electro-acoustic stuff: <a href=""http://kranky.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kranky</a> and <a href=""http://typerecords.com/artists"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Type</a> (Pioulard), <a href=""http://room40.org/site/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Room40</a> and <a href=""http://www.miasmah.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Miasmah</a> (Irisarri), and <a href=""http://ghostly.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ghostly International</a> (both). Ticking another one off the list, they join forces as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29408-orcas/"">Orcas</a> for this modest, entrancing <a href=""http://www.morrmusic.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Morr Music</a> debut, which sounds in reality exactly how it sounds on paper: nocturnal ambient pop in the manner of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13927-similes/"">Eluvium's <i>Similes</i></a>, if <i>Similes</i> had benefited from the same rugged grandeur as <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9926-copia/?utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=related-content&amp;utm_name=albumreviews"">Copia</a></i>.</p>
<p>The most distinctive and consistent feature of Meluch's music is his sedate yet expressive voice, which moves like something heavy underwater, complacently drowning (""Like coming up for air,"" he intones repeatedly on the hesitantly skipping ""Pallor Cedes""). Irisarri, meanwhile, builds elegantly decaying, chiaroscuro mosaics that seethe with electronic processing. These modes integrate naturally-- in fact, they seem to fill each other's absences. Meluch and Irisarri encase sad, twinkling pop songs for piano or guitar in slow, shuddering masses of electronic sound, striking a fine balance between lyric-driven emotional appeals and aloof abstractions. In either case, Meluch's voice is rightly the focal point, whether atomized into a hissing glow or lucidly double-tracked into streaked harmony, recalling <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1843-grizzly-bear/"">Grizzly Bear</a> at their duskiest-- especially on standout ""Arrow Drawn"", whose cunning melodic pleasures insinuate themselves slowly, which makes them last.</p>
<p>There are more immediate highs as well, such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/41315-benoit-pioulard-and-sight-below-cover-broadcast/"">""Until Then""</a>, a frugal <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/41200-rip-broadcasts-trish-keenan/"">Broadcast</a> cover for close-miked piano and dirty stylus, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12734-carrion/"">""Carrion""</a>, a grainy, blossoming hymn. Whether menaced by growling distortion, enshrined in gusty reverb, or draped over an unadorned guitar, Meluch's tender, isolated singing is a stable fulcrum for the music's pendulous swing between extreme, gentle inertia and sudden, violent flux. This type of collaboration between experimental pop musicians can too often devolve into aimless fancywork and tech shenanigans, but Meluch and Irisarri have crafted a genuine, coherent album that conjures immense shadows and immense depths worthy of its namesake.</p></div>"|16293.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16293-orcas/|7.7|Brian Howe

One of his two recent projects continues along this path but introduces another technological twist. With <i>Living Room Songs</i>, Arnalds again released a week's worth of songs one at a time, but this time he taped the recordings and put them on YouTube. Made in his Reykjavik apartment, <a href=""http://livingroomsongs.olafurarnalds.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the videos</a> are spare and straightforward, with slow-pan shots of his kitchen and bookshelf.

<p>There's a voyeuristic kick you get watching these clips, not only from seeing Arnalds' creative process but his actual home-- his couches and friends and personal belongings. The question is whether this music transcends the concept, if the songs function on their own apart from the YouTube format. Arnalds has released them as an album, so presumably he thinks so, but I'm not as certain. From opener ""Fyrsta"" to the plaintive ""Tomorrow's Song"", the tracks feel more like sketches than fully formed compositions. Most begin as slow, deliberate piano arrangements, sometimes incorporating strings or synths along the way, but rarely amount to more than a gentle hum.

<p>Arnalds' other new project, a film score for Sam Levinson's <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1719071/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Another Happy Day</i></a>, provides an interesting contrast. The soundtrack builds on some of the ideas from <i>Living Room Songs </i>and has a similar melancholy vibe (the movie is pretty bleak), but is more realized. There's the same patient minimalism (Arnalds seems to like drawing as much out of one note before moving on to the next) but where that made for inert compositions before, here they sound polished, almost regal. The best cuts find Arnalds unafraid to blend genres and mix in the electronic flourishes we heard on his earlier records. A good example is closer ""Everything Must Change"", which creates a menacing atmosphere from violin plucks, synth stabs, and a heavy hip-hop drum break. You don't need the story or the visual to feel the tension in it.</p>
<p><i>Another Happy Day</i> doesn't always work as well as a standalone object. Film scores are admittedly tough, because people expect them to act like regular albums when they're usually designed to play a supporting role. The best soundtracks can and do build compelling sonic worlds apart from movies, though, and recent examples include Trent Reznor's work on <i>The Social Network</i> or Cliff Martinez's on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15908-various-artists-drive/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank""><i>Drive</i></a>.

Even as the producer experimented with house music on the title track (which he had done previously on ""Raver"" and ""Versus""), it felt as if he were re-using the same sounds and effects. A year later, and with still no sign of a third album, we're treated to another three-track EP. But unlike <i>Street Halo,</i> <i>Kindred</i>, currently <a href=""http://www.hyperdub.net/releases/view/149/HDB059"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">available</a> digitally only, breaks nearly every Burial precedent there is, from the 12-minute-long tracks to an new sound design that feels consummately richer than the genius of his earlier work.</p>
<p>Of the three, ""Kindred"" (12-minute symphony No. 1) will be the most recognizable to Burial die-hards, featuring that same clanking metal-on-metal garage skip-and-swing. But this time something just feels heavier, harder, more devastating. Burial's been credited since the beginning as a prophet tying together UK genres old and new, but there's never been a better argument than ""Kindred"", which hints at the agility of jungle with the lead-footed heft of dubstep as seen through elliptical garage beats. They tumble and timestretch like vintage Metalheadz underneath smouldering Reese basslines, and the vocals lack Burial's usual phrases, instead choking out syllables smothered by the aural ash and soot that seems to soak the recording in a humongous, unearthly rumbling. As a whole ""Kindred"" sounds <i>bigger</i> than anything he's done before, an infinitely detailed behemoth that lumbers and shakes the ground beneath it with every little stroke of movement.</p>
<p>""Kindred"" is basically a suite in itself, a new kind of tumult that only heightens Burial's usual wrenching sorrow, an ambitious new venture repeated in <i>Kindred</i>'s other two tracks. ""Loner"" outdoes the sad-sack ecstacy of <i>Untrue</i>'s similarly housey ""Raver""-- for one thing, it's a lot faster-- but it's coated in MDMA residue, its chugging kick-and-snare pattern and almost prog-house pumping chord progression drowning in gloss. That chemical energy lends its fatalism an almost heroic sense of momentum, moving and moving and never quite getting anywhere but into the same empty, desperate silence that swallowed ""Kindred"". It's a well-timed track, navigating the same obsession with house and techno that's gripping the entire bass music world and turning it into something distinctly Burial, perverting house's speedy metronome (and prog house's politics of bliss) into profound, otherworldly sadness.</p>
<p>But as impressive as those two tracks are, there's no real way to prepare for ""Ashtray Wasp"", also built on a broken house lope. This time it's overloaded with funereal synths and arpeggios that twirl frantically in anguish as if they had nowhere else to go, saturating the cloudy soundscape with particulate matter so intricate it's a wonder all this sound data can be contained in a single mp3, nevermind a groove in wax. The fluttering effects are only further confused by the bleary smudge of it all, cinematic and grand but stuck in Burial's world of canned frequencies: The locust-swarm effect of the filters is impossibly stirring, far more visceral than perfect clarity ever could have been. It falls apart about seven minutes in before reconstructing into an even more decayed beat, violently wedged apart by static-- recalling the most challenging work of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29716-the-caretaker/"" target=""_blank"">the Caretaker</a> and his vinyl experiments. ""Ashtray Wasp"" suggests a structural intricacy and awe-inspiring execution from one of electronic music's mopiest producers, and the result might be his definitive track.</p>
<p>It's hard to talk about <i>Kindred</i>-- whether in the context of electronic dance music or just in the Burial discography itself-- without resorting to superlative terms, because it really is just <i>that</i> impressive. It's easy enough to take a talent such as Burial for granted, but <i>Kindred</i> is like a convenient slap in the face, a wake up call. Never before has his music possessed this much majesty, this much command, this much power: The pathos here has moved from sympathetic to completely domineering. The amount of dialog around Burial can be a little hard to swallow sometimes, especially when the guy himself seems so resistant-- or at least indifferent-- to the ongoing intellectualization of his music. But what we get on <i>Kindred</i> isn't some loner unknowingly making genius out of samples from <i>Metal Gear Solid</i> on his Playstation. You might not think of refinement when you think of Burial's productions, but just try to imagine it, and you'll get an idea of the kind of glory that <i>Kindred</i> carries. It still might not be the follow-up to <i>Untrue</i> that everyone's been waiting for, but format feels completely irrelevant. When those beats fall into place on the title track, nothing else matters for the next 30 minutes, until the crackle and fizz of ""Ashtray Wasps"" finally fades away. Then you put it on again. And again. And again.</p></div>"|16292.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16292-kindred/|8.7|Andrew Ryce

Up to this point, it's been hard to tell. As figurehead for the six-years-strong <a href=""http://islandsareforever.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Islands</a>, he's been an artistic vagrant, switching from strummy, beached <i>Graceland</i>-isms, to avant-rap experiments, to overblown indie pomp, to squishy, Auto-Tuned synth-pop-- sometimes, within the same record. Side projects like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8657-human-highway/"" target=""_blank"">Human Highway</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29216-mister-heavenly/"" target=""_blank"">Mister Heavenly</a> have gone great lengths to mine his appreciation for the garage pop of the 1950s and 60s, but have revealed relatively little; last year's pay-what-you-want solo album under his Nick Diamonds alias, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15752-i-am-an-attic/"" target=""_blank"">I Am an Attic</a></i>, was a cleaning-house collection that didn't provide much help either. Even the album that was responsible for Thorburn's rise to mid-level recognition, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4436-the-unicorns/"" target=""_blank"">the Unicorns</a>' 2003 effort <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8380-who-will-cut-our-hair-when-were-gone/"" target=""_blank"">Who Will Cut Our Hair When We're Gone?</a></i>, provides few clues (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27790-clues/"" target=""_blank"">no pun intended</a>)-- both because he hasn't produced that brand of ecstatically demented indie rock since, and because the band imploded a year after the album's release.</p>
<p>Thorburn's relative artistic facelessness is made more complicated by the fact that Islands is, essentially, a solo project itself; since the 2006 debut, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4170-return-to-the-sea/"" target=""_blank"">Return to the Sea</a></i>, no Islands record has featured the same personnel, with former Unicorns member Jaime Thompson leaving the band previous to 2008's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11420-arms-way/"" target=""_blank"">Arm's Way</a></i> and returning for the following year's pop-fixated <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13485-vapours/"" target=""_blank"">Vapours</a></i>. For Islands' latest, <i>A Sleep &amp; a Forgetting</i>, the lineup's changed again, with Thompson departing shortly after the last record was released. Claiming that this record is different from its predecessor is something of a folly in itself-- <i>every</i> Islands record is a change-up from the one previous, almost to a fault-- but regardless, it feels like a curtain's been pulled back for the first time. It's the most cohesive-- and, possibly, the out-and-out strongest-- Islands record yet, one that retains a singular focus while zooming in on an artist who's preferred to remain at a distance, obscured by so many stylistic gambits, for so long.</p>
<p>Ironically, the renewed passion existent in <i>A Sleep &amp; a Forgetting</i> can be credited to a loss of passion in Thorburn's personal life. In a <a href=""http://www.vulture.com/2012/02/islands-nick-thorburn-on-his-new-album-living-with-a-patron-of-the-arts-and-michael-ceras-future-in-music.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">recent interview with <i>Vulture</i></a>, he revealed that the album's creation was spurred on by a bad breakup and subsequent self-exile to ""a friend of a friend's"" place in Los Angeles, where he largely wrote the record's songs on piano. Thorburn's described <i>A Sleep &amp; a Forgetting</i> as ""confessional,"" and it indeed finds him at his most lyrically direct and naked, whether it be the open-ended questions asked to no one on the album's beautifully burnt-out penultimate track, ""Don't I Love You"", or the opening couplet on ""Can't Feel My Face"", which pretty much spells it out for you: ""I miss my wife/ I miss my best friend.""</p>
<p>Confessional intimacy needs an intimate setting to match, so the behind-the-boards inclusion of Rob Schnapf, who co-produced a large amount of Elliott Smith's discography, was an inspired choice. Schnapf keeps things as unfussy as possible, which is fitting since <i>A Sleep &amp; a Forgetting</i> is a particularly unfussy album of capital-S ""songs."" As with Human Highway and Mister Heavenly, Thorburn's still drawing from garage-pop and singer/songwriter sounds of yester-yesteryear, but save for a few minor flourishes here and there-- the chilled-veins AOR pop of ""This Is Not a Song"", a ""96 Tears""-worthy lick of dirty organ that writhes through ""Can't Feel My Face""-- there's nothing that distracts from the songwriting, which is unarguably as strong as it's been since the Nick Diamonds' days as a Unicorn.</p>
<p><i>A Sleep &amp; a Forgetting</i> is a small album, both by design and in its impact; there are no grand statements made, musical or otherwise, and since this is, really, 37 minutes of no-frills, room-temperature indie pop proper, it's incredibly easy to let this record get lost in the breeze. This isn't a bad thing, though-- in fact, it's something of a triumph for Thorburn, to match his most emotionally devastating material yet with music that's so close-sounding and unassumingly, unabashedly pretty. There's <i>humanity</i> in these songs, a quality that was muddled in the noise of <i>Arm's Way</i> and <i>Return to the Sea</i>, and sidelined during Human Highway and Mister Heavenly's genre excursions (however pleasurable they might have been). When Jaime Thompson left Islands for the first time, Thorburn memorably and amicably proclaimed, ""Islands are forever."" Maybe <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicorns_Are_People_Too"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a repurposed album title from his old band</a> would work better this time around: Islands are people too.</p></div>"|16287.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16287-a-sleep-a-forgetting/|7.9|Larry Fitzmaurice

Her work effortlessly bridges the realms of the commercial and the avant garde, barely recognizing the distinction between the two. Ciani is a classically trained composer who studied with computer music trailblazer <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Mathews"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Max Mathews</a> and worked with <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Buchla"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Don Buchla</a>, the latter being the inventor of a frequently used tool in her musical armory, the Buchla 200 synthesizer. In the early 1970s she formed Ciani Musica, Inc. in New York, through which she produced soundtrack work for commercials by Merrill-Lynch, Clairol, Skittles, and GE among others (go <a href=""http://web.mac.com/klugpro/iWeb/ciani-musica/Welcome.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a> for some examples). Ciani's sound-effects work on <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meco"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Meco</a>'s platinum-selling disco version of the <i>Star Wars</i> soundtrack brought her unannounced to a wider audience, while her own career has positioned her as a proto-synth guru, a doyen of the new age musical movement, and, in more recent times, a noted classical musician.</p>
<p>Anyone looking for an entry point into Ciani's elastic career will be well served by <i>Lixiviation</i>, a compilation spanning 1968-85 from the always intriguing <a href=""http://www.b-music.us/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">B-Music</a> label. Here, the vaults of Ciani Musica have been plundered, with her peppy compositions for companies including PBS, Atari, and Coca-Cola documented, alongside ahead-of-their-time electronic pieces that hint at her later drift into new age. It's a perfect introduction to the far-reaching nature of her talents, but it's also useful for illustrating how music notionally thought to be ""underground"" often happily floats into family homes every evening. Through her commercial work, Ciani was prying open a door that led to unlikely collaborations further down the line, including <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/110-aphex-twin/"">Aphex Twin</a>'s work with <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP45TruKSVM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pirelli</a> and music lent to a <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxjGPRPODyc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">jeans ad</a> by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3984-sunn-o/"">Sunn O)))</a>. In the sleeve notes, she indicates how her commercial work helped fund her creative pursuits-- another harbinger of how the music industry would ultimately evolve.</p>
<p>What binds Ciani's eclectic pieces on this album is the lucidity of her vision, which is emphasized further in those comprehensive sleeve notes. She talks of never using the word synthesizer (""it had strange and inappropriate connotations""), of spending ""weeks just living with the machine, always on,"" when using her Buchla. It's not hard to romanticize her existence back then, buried under a deluge of wires and circuitry. This is a whole world she created, where brightly blinking synth noise flowed into fracturing swells of bass (""Lixiviation""), where a piece created as a choreography (""Princess with Orange Feet"") sounded like great bursts of light collapsing into one another. The closing ""Second Breath"", recorded during Ciani's time at UC Berkeley circa 1968-70, is a precursor to the harsher, ever-repeating drones krautrock legends <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1348-cluster/"">Cluster</a> would appropriate as their central stylistic thrust a few years later.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">It's easy to hear the hallmarks of that darker sound in some of Ciani's commercial work-- the ""Clean Room"" ITT TV spot has the same kind of density as John Carpenter's <i>Assault on Precinct 13</i> score, with sturdy prods of bass synth and a sparse, ricocheting beat providing the grounding for her to layer sunnier parts over the top. But Ciani was also enamored with the playful side of the instruments at her disposal. On the dainty clicks and whirrs of ""Sound of a Dream Kissing"", there are traces of the frivolous zing of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22658-pierre-henry/"">Pierre Henry</a>'s classic <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOqfWj0HqNE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Psyché Rock""</a>. Her work for Atari and Coca-Cola are similarly buoyant, with the four seconds of bubbles, pop, and fizz she created for Coke forming a delightful piece of fluffy, synthesized mimicry.</p>
<p>It's telling that Ciani's music was deemed suitable for commercials and TV spots all over the world just as the public was getting to grips with a possible forthcoming computer age. Not just because of the obvious sci-fi components, but also because it bears a perfect blend of urgency, anxiety, and technological utopianism, straddling contrasting feelings of slack-jawed optimism about the future and all the Cold War-era jitters prevalent at the time. Her work for the PBS show ""Inside Story"" sounds like a dramatic precursor to receiving an impossibly bleak news update on our impending armageddon, while her corporate tag for Atari rushes assuredly into the future, embracing all the innovation around it. That ability to flit back and forth between styles and feelings no doubt made Ciani an attractive client to her corporate employers. But <i>Lixiviation</i> also goes some way to forming links between her disparate worlds, showing off more reflective work through what she describes as her ""very feminine"" synthesized waveforms, and demonstrating how such material bled through to the mainstream in unexpected ways.</p></div>"|16284.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16284-lixiviation/|7.4|Nick Neyland
