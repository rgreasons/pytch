Jimmy Tamborello's solo electronic project wouldn't make much noise until his third record, <i>Life Is Full of Possibilities</i>, released in 2001 when hiring indie singers to vocalize over electronic compositions was a novel idea. Still, it wasn't just the vocal tracks that held Tamborello's breakthrough album together. <i>Early Works For Me If It Works For You II</i> compiles his first two albums on the Phthalo label with some heretofore unreleased material from around the time of his third. Much of the setstands in the long shadow cast by Warp Records' 90s roster, and Tamborello isn't shy about admitting that. But it also contains early experiments with the chilly but affecting instrumentals that filled in the cracks between Tamborello's more infamous collaborations, and it holds up better than you might think.</p>
<p>The material goes all the way back to 1994 and up through the early 00s, covering a fertile time for amateur electronic composers. Recorded in 1994, but released by Phthalo in 2001, <i>Something Always Goes Wrong </i>finds Tamborello just beginnging to flex his limbs. The distorted, non-repeating drum work throughout showed a love for Aphex Twin and u-ziq, but is never quite as intricate or sophisticated as either of those producer's work. ""In Which Our Hero Finds a Faithful Sidekick"" rides its breakbeats and yawning bass towards a vague and familiar spy-movie feeling, and while the 8-bit-sounding effects are a lot more conspicuous here than on Dntel's later records, the stretch from ""In Which Our Hero Is Put Under a Spell"" to ""...Frees the Damsel in Distress"" develops the slow and swooning vibe Tamborello explored much more fully in the near future. In contrast to his heroes, Tamborello's style was more cautious and uncluttered, making the most from his nascent ability.</p>
<p>While <i>Something</i> was Dntel's earliest material, <i>Early Works For Me If It Works For You</i> was his first release. From the first track on, <i>Early Works...</i> displayed bolder, faster, and more intricate drum patterns. Tamborello was getting better at emulating his influences, but something else was happening, too-- he often dips his toes into textures he'd later grow more comfortable with, like a hurdy-gurdy-like tone that sounds more like live instrumentation and a brief vocal sample on ""Fort Instructions"". You can also hear much of the melancholy keys and surging, almost soothing white noise that made his breakthrough, <i>Life Is Full of Possibilities</i>, so distinct. ""Casuals"" blends all these elements together equally: A vocal sample is even almost audible over an insistent, repetitious drum pattern and a melancholy melody, but all of it is washed-out and obscured by crackling distortion. It felt a little more slippery in terms of genre, but it also tapped a desolate, yet romantic emotional core.</p>
<p>The third disc is the one being touted as <i>Early Works For Me If It Works For You II</i>, even though much of it supplements <i>Life Is Full of Possibilities</i>, and would make more sense alongside that record.With titles like ""New Name"" and ""Incomplete 1"" (or its three counterparts), you can tell some of these are sketches, but they already feel like there's a more developed artist is behind them as they quickly establish a mood and tone. There's more R&amp;B influence between the coughs and hiccups of percussion in ""Incomplete 4"" or ""Mini"", and there's more live instrumentation, like the acoustic guitar that takes the foreground on ""Paul Guitar"". Were Dntel's third album ever to receive the typically lavish and usually necessary reissue treatment so many albums do these days, this material would have made for a worthy bonus disc, showing peeks at his process, featuring castaways worth revisiting, and offering hints towards his future.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that <i>Early Works for Me II</i> is a pretty lavish physical package in its own right, and remains plenty memorable for having little to no vocal guests.Tamborello's pretty clearly indebted to the standard bearers of IDM, but along the way he made sense of his past and his current passions to come up with something that is, if not totally unique, distinctly his own. This compilation can be uneven, and the journey is maybe more interesting than it is enjoyable at times. But <i>Early Works for Me II</i> is assembled to be a journey, from end to end, and it plays like one.</p></div>"|12925.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12925-early-works-for-me-if-it-works-for-you-ii/|7.2|Jason Crock

The three-song slab of raw, noisy grooves was so  bursting with ideas, it suggested a lifetime of musical possibilities.  Follow-up singles took steps toward that promise, but the San Francisco  quartet's first, self-titled full-length was a bit of a retreat. Vital  elements-- repetitive bass, wiry guitars, droning keyboards, and ghostly  vocals-- remained intact, but there was a weariness to it all, the primitive  thrill of previous releases replaced by workman-like resignation.</p>
<p><i>Dos</i> goes a long way towards  re-igniting Wooden Shjips' fire. Sonically, its five songs aren't  as exploding or abrasive as earlier work-- in fact, this is the smoothest-sounding  Shjips record so far. But taut energy courses through most of the album's  38 minutes. Bassist Dusty Jermier sticks to variations on the bouncing  line he used to fuel the band's first insta-classic, ""Shrinking  Moon For You"". His chugging loops are like a whip-crack, revving the  band through their 1960s-licking garage tunes with the momentum of  a hurtling 18-wheeler.</p>
<p>The twin engines powering that  velocity are the Stooges and Suicide. Imagine the machine-like grooves  of <i>Fun House </i>simplified even further, with Iggy's yawp replaced  by the chilly moan of Alan Vega. (For a more recent reference point,  try Yo La Tengo's ""Pass the Hatchet, I Think I'm Goodkind"" recorded  in a pool of ice water.) Sure, there are other touchstones here: krautrock,  the Doors, Spacemen 3, and pretty much any music reliant on repetition,  from Terry Riley to the Fall to Fuck Buttons. But just try listening  to <i>Dos</i>' first two tracks-- the mesmerizing ""Motorbike""  and the shimmering ""For So Long"", featuring fuzz spirals from guitarist  Ripley Johnson-- without visions of Detroit garage and New York punk  coating your eyelids.</p>
<p>The rest of <i>Dos </i> can't quite keep the pulse of those initial salvos. Staying inventive  within the confines of repetition is sometimes too much for the band  to muster. But Johnson's fiery playing is impressive throughout--  on ""Down By the Sea"", his guitar catches so many flames, it's  a wonder there's any music left when he's done torching. And Wooden  Shjips make up for mid-album sags on the closer, ""Fallin'"". Like  Devo's ""Gates of Steel"" filtered through the 1969 live version  of the Velvet Underground's ""What Goes On"" (recorded, coincidentally,  in San Francisco), it's a 12-minute rock mantra, full of the kind  of possibility with which this band began. <i>Dos </i> may not be the Wooden Shjips' masterwork, but by the end of ""Fallin'"",  you can once again imagine one in their future.</p></div>"|12914.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12914-dos/|7.2|Marc Masters

On the strength of singles ""I Can't Stand It"" and ""Chrome's on It"", which display the two distinct sides of their increasingly synth-heavy avant-pop approach, the Brooklyn duo comprising Telepathe has generated a good amount of buzz. Pick up a copy of any self-respecting culture rag and there's likely to be a front-of-book profile featuring the girls looking ultra cool in chunky sunglasses and designer hoodies. It stands to reason that their first proper LP, the David Sitek-produced <i>Dance Mother</i>, could certainly capitalize on such attention.</p>
<p>But not everyone's convinced. Ask a friend who's caught Telepathe live and he'll tell you what an aggravating experience it is, that the band's lackadaisical stage performance borders on disinterest not only for their audience but also their own material. And there are questions of musicianship: Ganges and Livaudais share an unschooled, tinny vocal presence and don't appear to be masters of, y'know, instruments and stuff. While those aren't clear reasons to discount a group (good ideas should certainly trump chops), they do raise issues about whether or not Telepathe are skating by on style, geographical allure (Brooklyn, Bushwick, whatever), or musical associations.</p>
<p>Bobbling an opportunity to prove the band's merit once and for all, <i>Dance Mother</i> leaves many of these questions unanswered. The album's most obvious problem is that its two best cuts-- the above-mentioned singles-- are those fans are already familiar with. All rapid-fire bass and squiggly synths, ""Chrome's On It"" is an accomplished indie-electro reimagining of the standard hip-hop radio banger, but if you picked up the 2008 EP of the same name chances are you've worn it out already. ""Can't Stand It"", meanwhile, gets a spit-shine courtesy of Sitek here, adding depth and polish to the scratchier version that appeared on Rare Book Room's <i>Living Bridge</i> compilation. No less gorgeous than before, it doesn't quite take the place of a brand-new track of equal quality.</p>
<p>Take the repeats out of the equation and you're left with a decidedly mixed bag; just a few of <i>Dance Mother</i>'s newbies manage to rival their older siblings' success. The futuristic love-lost ballad ""In Your Line"" is one such standout. Over TV on the Radio member Sitek's arrangement (which brings to mind the lovely, underappreciated ""Family Tree"" from his fulltime band's most recent LP) of tribal hand-drums, swirling guitars, and crashing cymbals, Livaudais and Ganges examine past relationships, realizing they miss their exes (perhaps each other-- the band was once a couple) more than they'd care to admit. <span>""It never meant that much to me... So where did it go? I think I lost it in my heart,"" they sing in tandem. </span></p>
<p>With its skittering beats and lunar synths, ""Michael"" is another track that sounds great pouring out of your headphones. One can't help but wonder, though, if the credit for a song like this, where the appeal lies mostly in the production, should go to Sitek instead of Telepathe. Since the record was a collaborative affair, it's hard to say for sure. But part of what makes me dubious is the lyrical missteps that appear elsewhere on the album. Head-scratchingly opaque and sometimes just plain bad, the girls' lyrics often do serious damage to a few otherwise decent songs. Sometimes they sound like stoners swapping <i>Lost</i> theories: ""Hand-painted the orchid, because we have a second-rate sun,"" they chant out of nowhere in ""Devil's Trident"". Other times it's like <i>Def Poetry Jam: Bushwick</i> up in here: ""Only givers give a hint of the hunt! Fill it up with a pound of gold!"" they exclaim, spoken-word style in ""Lights Go Down"".</p>
<p>Moments like these make <i>Dance Mother</i> an uneven, sometimes puzzling listen. In many ways the record contradicts itself: It features a song I could enjoy for years to come (""Can't Stand It"") and others I'd be fine with never hearing again. Flashes of real beauty and sonic adventurousness split time with stuff that seems outright dumb. So it's hard to say what happens to Telepathe from here besides, surely, a few more glossy photo spreads. Are they a flash-in-the-pan case of style over substance or electro-indie savants working towards finding their footing on a mind-blowing sophomore LP? I certainly hope it's the latter, but this album offers no real clues in either direction, so I honestly couldn't tell you.</p></div>"|12928.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12928-dance-mother/|6.7|Joe Colly

Because if it really  were all about the music, Jez and Andy Williams would be the most famous  brothers to come out of Manchester, Jimi Goodwin would be the go-to  Britpop duet partner for Jay-Z and Kanye, and all those ""Viva La Vida""  ringtones you hear going off at Urban Outfitters would be replaced by  a digitized symphony of Doves' ""Black and White Town"".</p>
<p>But as their back-story includes no tabloid-baiting  tales of fraternal fisticuffs or marriages to Hollywood starlets, Doves  could be the most unassuming, unsung band to have scored back-to-back  UK No. 1 album debuts; on North American shores, their ascent has been somewhat  hampered by the fact that their opening bands (the Strokes in 2001, the Rapture in 2002) have blown up bigger than the headliner. And unless  one of the Doves starts dating Jennifer Aniston anytime soon, it's  unlikely that <i>Kingdom of Rust</i> will radically change their stature. Rather,  Doves' fourth album is another sterling example of why the Doves should  be household names and why they probably won't ever be: their unwavering  flair for producing mountainous, Wembley-worthy pop anthems that are  nonetheless invested with a palpable degree of grace and humility.</p>
<p>While the past decade has seen the indie  kids go dance and the dance kids go indie, Doves' 1998 formation was  ironically predicated on an abrupt, 180-degree break from their former  house-production guise as Sub Sub, absconding rhythmic propulsion for  a space-rock sway. But more than any previous Doves album, <i>Kingdom of  Rust</i> is built for motion and acceleration, leading its songs to unexpected  and often exhilarating highs: Slow-percolating opener ""Jetstream""  counts down to lift-off with a hi-hat-triggered techno bed track that  gradually intensifies into a tremorous, tribal clatter; ""The Outsiders""  blasts potholes into the Autobahn with a brawny Krautrock beat. Even  when the band seemingly reverts to its familiar astral balladry on ""10:03"",  the reprieve is short-lived-- Goodwin's sweet, moonlit serenade is  eventually upended by a creepy chorus of ghostly voices, launching a  psych-rock eruption that suddenly transforms the song from <i>Kingdom of  Rust</i>'s most elegiac moment into its most unsettling one.</p>
<p>Perhaps this restlessness is indicative  of certain frustration on Doves' part in seeing their efforts eclipsed  by less imaginative, more mawkish Britpop bands, and in turn, a desire  to distance themselves from the sad-sack pack; it's hard to imagine  the likes of Elbow turning in something quite as fierce and paranoid  as ""House of Mirrors"", a fuzz-soaked stomper punctuated by jarring,  bump-in-the-night sound effects. For a band whose Allmusic.com descriptor  list includes the terms ""earnest,"" ""reflective,"" and ""lush,""  Doves are just as effective at being aggressive, to the point where  <i>Kingdom of Rust</i>'s serene turns feel more listless than usual: the dark, orchestral manoeuvre ""Birds Flew Backwards"" exposes the limitations of Goodwin's haggard voice, while ""Spellbound"" feels like an echo of previous capsized lullabies like ""Sea Song""..</p>
<p>But then some tricks are worth repeating:  Doves' most enduring and admirable quality-- from 2000's ""The  Cedar Room"" to 2002's ""There Goes the Fear"" to 2005's ""Black  and White Town""-- has been their ability to render everyday urbanity  in joyful, fantastical form, and to this canon we can add <i>Kingdom of  Rust</i>'s ""Winter Hill"", a paean to innocent, hand-held romance sent  skyward on a pillow of Spiritualized swirls. It's just the sort of song  that should earn Doves a return appearance to the UK top 10, but such  an accomplishment is ultimately a moot point for these guys: They don't  need high chart placements to make them feel like they're on top of  the world.</p></div>"|12904.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12904-kingdom-of-rust/|7.2|Stuart Berman

But what Mica Levi is playing isn't a chord anyone's heard before-- it's  a dry, gnashingly dissonant cluster, and she's hammering away at it  very intentionally. A few seconds into ""Vulture"", she's joined  by the other two members of the band, drummer Marc Pell and keyboardist  Raisa Khan, who act as if Levi's actually just playing some kind of  giddy surf riff. By the time the song skids to a halt, less than three  minutes later, it's made a few hairpin turns into and back out of grime/carousel-music  fusion while Levi's been chanting and whooping lyrics about her inedibility  in a proud, largely indecipherable LDN accent. On a first listening,  it's maddening noise; by the fourth or so, it's as catchy as a jingle.</p>
<p><i>Jewellery</i> is a chaotic  record, and an enormous mess. It's also, pretty much, the freshest thing  to come along so far in 2009. Levi belongs to the generation that's  grown up with the total availability of every kind of music ever, and  she wants to play it all at the same time as she's text-messaging, so  it's a good thing that pop plus anything equals pop. She's got highbrow  compositional bonafides (""influences"" listed on the band's  MySpace page: ""harry partch, and all those other guys""); she's  got some U.K. hip-hop cred (her mixtape <i>Filthy Friends</i> is even  more of a pileup); she's a little bit rock'n'roll (the fuse that ignites  the album's best song, ""Calculator"", is the guitar riff from  ""Tequila""). ""Sweetheart"" is a high-tech, neon-butterfly  take on the hardcore punk two-step. At least one song prominently features  a vacuum cleaner. Nothing stays in place for more than a few seconds,  but very often her avant-gardist and party-time impulses snap together,  as when the scrape-and-tweak that opens ""Lips"" abruptly congeals  into a wiry bhangra groove. It's not clear, though, how much the insanely  clever arrangements are the band's and how much they're producer Matthew  Herbert's.</p>
<p>At the center of this cyclone  of jujubes and sandpaper is Levi's tart, snaggy voice, which occasionally  recalls Lora Logic's dizzy trill but more often ducks down into the  mix and clings to no more than a couple of notes. (It's probably perverse  to wonder how awesome it would be if the group collaborated with a really  good R&amp;B singer.) Levi is one of the most androgynous-sounding woman  vocalists I've heard in years-- pitch her down a percent or two and she  could pass for Mike Skinner-- but her persona isn't quite post-sex: while  most of her rare intelligible lyrics concern the romantic conundrum,  they're generally brushing it off metaphorically (""I could <i>eat</i> your heart"", she yodels) or literally (""I won't have sex 'cause  of S.T.D.s"").</p>
<p>Mostly, though, <i>Jewellery</i> is a vehicle to show off the band's hoard of shiny new sounds-- although  they haven't yet figured out how to sort out the gemstones they've got  in abundance from their ice chips and broken glass. It's not a record  built for staying power, despite the thrilling moments in almost every  song. But its failures mostly have to do with idea-overload and short  attention span, which are very promising problems to have on one's first  album. Levi and her band sound more like the future than the past, at  a moment when we desperately need some more future, and as much as I've  come to dig this album's awkward, brash cacophony, I want to hear what  they do next even more.</p></div>"|12922.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12922-jewellery/|7.9|Douglas Wolk

I suppose we found out with  Lady Sovereign's <i>Public Warning</i>, which was given every chance  to succeed-- cosigned by Missy Elliott, Jay-Z, and Def Jam itself and extensively profiled  in laudatory but ultimately patronizing puff pieces, Lady Sovereign  eventually got to #1 at TRL with the Feminem video for ""Love Me or Hate Me"". A bunch of hard-working street teamers got a totally sweet pizza party for that one.</p>
<p>And yet none of this prevented  Sov from becoming a questionable signing-- the Jerome James to Jay-Z's Isiah Thomas-- and the  blame game began: Listeners caught in the blog-hype cycle abandoned her quickly after <i>Run the Road </i>once <i>Public Warning </i> was found lacking a new single like ""Ch-Ching"" or ""Random"".   More nefariously, it was suggested that listeners still weren't willing  to accept a white British girl in a milieu that is still predominantly  black, American, and male.  But then, something funny happened:  Lily Allen got really popular.  And Santigold.  M.I.A., too--  not just in the sub-urban pop realm that Sov was laser-marketed towards,  but also among the rap heads her skills were supposed to knock out (if  Bun B ever spits flame over ""Love Me or Hate Me"" you know where  to find me).  What really happened is something that the abominable <i>Jigsaw</i> could not make more blindingly obvious: Since 2006, Lady  Sovereign has been pretty much incapable of making music people might  actually want to listen to.</p>
<p>It's not that <i>Jigsaw </i> doesn't try hard enough-- despite being free of Def Jam's expectations,  the stench of desperation is so strong that these don't feel  like songs so much as contingency plans.  As you might have heard,  ""So Human"" is a straight rip of  the Cure's ""Close to Me"", but pales compared to sample-source cousins Ce'Cile's ""Rude Bwoy Thug Life"" or Robyn's ""Konichiwa Bitches"".  Whatever  sense of mental anguish she's looking to convey here gets cancelled out by the piercingly chipper backing track and her laughable  rhymes (""runnin' out the studio like Forrest Gump!"").  And  yet, even if it's Track 2 on <i>Jigsaw</i>, ""So Human"" is only its second-most annoying song to that point: Remember the Streets' ""War of the Sexes""?  Trade blow for  herb and you've got opener ""Let's Be Mates"".</p>
<p>On that note, past comparisons to the Streets' Mike Skinner were borne from cultural cliché, but on <i>Jigsaw</i> the prophecy becomes true-- like Skinner's recent work, instead of woodshedding on  the mixtape circuit like smarter and hungrier rappers, we're  treated to lightweight albums that are three years in the making and  still feel like a rushed jumble of bad ideas that just get worse as  they go along.  I'll spare quoting from the quite literal breakfast-in-bed dare ""Food Play"" and just say that Paris Hilton didn't  make it a hot Carl's Jr. commercial, and Sov doesn't make it a hot  song.</p>
<p>We've heard a lot about the  dark times Sov went through after <i>Public Warning</i>, but other than vague references to how interview  junkets are a pain in the ass, <i>Jigsaw </i> quite literally admits how she's left with nothing but ""bullshit""  to say about it. So sadly <i>Jigsaw </i> isn't a confident grasp of a lived-in image: Realizing in 2009  that it's more beneficial to one's chances to spit like Maya instead  of Marshall, more traditional hip-hop tracks like ""Bang Bang"" brazenly  lift the shanty-town cheerleader cadences of <i>Arular</i>--  ""I've  got that bang bang sound/ So won't you crank it loud,"" goes the chorus,  an odd request of a record that has roughly zero low end.  Similarly,  on the Gwen Stefani-scented ""I Got You Dancing"", Sov promises  she'll have you ""do it in time to my metaphors.""  <i>Jigsaw </i> is a record with roughly zero metaphors. However, you do get a healthy  selection of failed similes, the most blatant coming on the title track--  ""I've got you on my mind/ I've got shit on my mind/ I've got plenty  of time to just sit and rewind/ And just sip on my wine.""  This  is why her heart is like a jigsaw puzzle.</p>
<p>I'm not willing to hold out  the possibility that nationality is causing Sov's career to stall,  not when I heard both ""Fix Up, Look Sharp"" and ""Wearin' My Rolex""  at an LA Fitness that rarely plays stuff more leftfield than, say, Bowling  For Soup. And I'm not willing to hold out the possibility that as a male critic,  I'm unable to relate to the sort of personality she's looking to  embody on <i>Jigsaw</i>-- more than ever, there's a vacuum of strong  female personalities in hip-hop, and instead of the piss-taking joker  we heard years ago that turned <i>Vertically Challenged </i> into a teaser of potential, there's a depressing and shrill neediness  that could get Sovereign a bit part in <i>He's Just Not That Into You. </i> The sad part is that might have been Sov's intention all along.</p></div>"|12899.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12899-jigsaw/|3.1|Ian Cohen

This is the melancholy truth that emerges from Jadakiss' third tepid and unfocused solo record in eight years. As a rapper, Jada's bona fides are firmly in place-- both Eminem and Q-Tip have named him to their top 10 of all time-- but when it comes to releasing albums, his batting average is only slightly higher than Saigon's. If his long, tortuous, and uneventful solo career is any indication, the ability to spit a hot sixteen-- or even hundreds upon hundreds of them– is nothing compared to the grit and determination it takes to face down a roomful of record execs, because The Last Kiss, even more than his previous two records, is exactly the sort of nothing-for-everyone platter that results from too many greedy, insecure hands in the pot.</p>
<p>To be fair, Jada is just as likely complicit the anonymous mess that is <i>The Last Kiss</i> as anyone. He's painfully ill-suited for the spotlight, but he can't seem to shake his confused thirst for superstardom and the big royalty checks it is supposed to bring, which is probably part of the reason why <i>The Last Kiss</i> comes equipped with two versions of ""the Pharrell song,"" (""Stress Ya""and ""Rockin With the Best"") the first sounding like a bleepy retread of ""Can I Have It Like That?"" and the second sporting the kind of lounge-R&amp;B cheese Pharrell was peddling to Snoop in 2006 (think ""Let's Get Blown."") It's why DJ Khaled's screaming neon synthesizers strafe across a song called ""Grind Hard"", which is saddled with perhaps the most limp, unmemorable hook Mary J. Blige has ever been paid to sing. And it's the reason he's droning ""Go baby, you're so wavy/ I ain't never felt this way about no lady"" over Eric Hudson's poor-man's-Rodney-Jerkins back beat on ""By My Side"" alongside Ne-Yo.</p>
<p>The problem is, and has always been, that Jadakiss just has no commercial instincts; he has only the vaguest idea of what a ""hit""sounds like, and reliably associates ""slick and expensive-sounding"" with ""a sure thing."" Even worse, his bars on the street cuts, his traditional area of strength, have turned slack and rote. ""Guns gon' clap, packs gon' move/blood get drawn, skin gon'bruise/the real gon' win, the fake gon' lose,"" he raps on ""Who's Real"", over a tinny Swizz Beatz beat. And after 10 years or so of not making it big, his boasts are starting to sound oddly deflated: ""I'm one of the best in the world, ma, that's what they say on the blogs"" is apparently what passes for a Jadakiss pick-up line these days.</p>
<p>Jada's too talented to produce a completely worthless album, of course, and there are the usual one or two frustrating glimmers of the promise that keep getting him record deals. ""One More Step"" is a reliably satisfying back-and-forth with Styles P; ""Cartel Gathering"" features Ghostface and Raekwon, which is categorically never a bad thing. On ""Death Wish"", the Lil Wayne collaboration that leaked about a month ago, Jadakiss finally narrows his eyes and focuses, and his verse leaves a smoking crater that not even a relatively on-fire Wayne can fill. ""What If?"", meanwhile, coasts along on a nice 80s-R&amp;B sample, even though it is a bald retread of ""Why?"", his only hit and still the best song of his solo career, and even though guest rapper Nas takes the ""provocative question"" formula straight into tinfoil-hat territory: ""What if Hillary and them was reptilian?/ And 2012 was the end of men and all world civilians?"" Yeah-- think about that.</p>
<p>The best song by far, though, is ""Things I Been Through"", a bite of Luther Vandross's ""Promise"" that reflects with startling honesty on Jada's endless struggles to maintain a toehold in the rap industry. With genuine affection in his voice, he reminisces about traveling with Puffy on the No Way Out tour: ""Videotaped it all, I still watch it now/traveled around the world, learned how to rock a crowd."" He sums up his career ups and downs with a judgment as poignant as it is succinct: ""It ain't much, but it beats poor."" Maybe he should take this advice and run with it: KOCH might not be Def Jam, and Jadakiss will probably never be the next big thing, but at least that label would let him put out records, and he probably wouldn't even have to include a Ne-Yo collaboration.</p></div>"|12917.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12917-the-last-kiss/|5.2|Jayson Greene

And I noticed something interesting: Whether it was due to the  sound setup at the band's venue or some limitations of the video or  cell phone camera filming their show, many of them sounded almost violently distorted and loud. Even the ones that weren't still seemed like bracing  experiences, body-tossing waves of lead-footed riffs and drumming that  could dislodge rivets. Considering the forceful if limber heaviness  of their previous two albums, their self-titled 2005 debut and 2007's <i> Ekranoplan</i>, that shouldn't be a big surprise. A noisy space-rock  band? You don't say.</p>
<p>But <i>When Sweet Sleep Returned </i> might be the album that changes that whole dynamic. Despite their stoner-rock  bonafides, Assemble Head have frequently found themselves on the edge  of mellow, and this new album-- while still fairly powerful with the volume up-- seems to be reining in their more chaotic tendencies, with fewer blown-out serrated edges and more clean, open  space. Tim Green, who engineered <i>Ekranoplan </i> (as well as albums by nu-acid rock vanguards Earthless and Comets on  Fire), might have something to do with that, though the differences  between the albums from a pure production standpoint are subtle-- the most noticeable effect being a somewhat less prominent bass  rumble.</p>
<p>Yet for a group that immerses  itself in much of the late 1960s/early 70s cusp-of-metal sound,  Assemble Head never quite went far enough into the abyss of Sabbathoid  doom that other stoner bands planted their flags in. You can imagine  them cranking up Blue Cheer or Hawkwind every now and then, but they've  also owed a fair amount to Neil Young and Crazy Horse, Creedence Clearwater  Revival, and even early Grateful Dead, more old-school hippie than proto-hesher  burnout with each successive album. The lessened emphasis on early metal  on <i>When Sweet Sleep Returned</i> is a mixed blessing-- previous  records benefited from the caustic sonics <i>Sweet Sleep </i> lacks, but the cleaner, more bucolic sound reveals a band that, comparatively  traditional-minded as they are, at least has a good handle on getting  past clichés to burrow to the root of what made California psych and  post-psychedelic rock work.</p>
<p>And that relies on the guitar  tones of Charlie Saufley and Jefferson Marshall. Their strength isn't  necessarily in fuzzed-out amplification, but in unpredictable versatility;  all at once they can sound menacing and pastoral, leaden and ethereal,  even if they seem to be cribbing from a wide array of 40 year-old blueprints. ""By the Rippling Green"" is the most immediate standout--  a two-layered melodic theoretical summit of John Fogerty rhythms and some  of Neil Young's more low-key moments-- but it's not the most typical  one. You might actually have a hard time pinning anything on this album  as especially typical of anything else, actually: The riffs in ""Two  Stage Rocket"" smoothly transition from 1966 to 69 Pink Floyd, ""The Slumbering Ones"" crossbreeds sprawling desert blues-rock with  hints of a mutant strain of shoegaze, and the gentle hippiefied boogie  rock of ""Two Birds"" slowly but surely expands and explodes into  a solo-drenched peak that re-envisions Spiritualized as a jam band.</p>
<p>The funny thing is, even though  the guitars are just as prone to twang as they are to growl, and even  though the rhythms are often more floaty than heavy, there's no lack  of power here. You just have to find it in unexpected places: While there's not a lot of squall and noise, there's still plenty of velocity,  and the album thrives on uptempo tracks like the borderline alt-country ""Kolob Canyon"" and the fuzzed-out ""Clive and the Lyre""; the latter  song comes closest to showing some actual snarl, and exhibits Assemble  Head's affection for fellow Nor Cal psychmongers Comets on Fire. The  only real bummer with <i>When Sweet Sleep Returned</i>-- aside from the subjective fault of being ""uninnovative""--  is the lyrical element; when the vocals aren't getting swept away  along with the momentum, they're buried a bit low in an otherwise  clean mix or distorted just enough to make every third word unclear.  That's a shame, since what one can glean of them hints at a fascinating  blend of post-apocalyptic dread and blissed-out reverie. But the music  doesn't need to hint at that vibe-- it lays it out in Cinemascope  panorama, fuzz or no fuzz.</p></div>"|12903.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12903-when-sweet-sleep-returned/|7.1|Nate Patrin

It was their return  to the Top 10 of Billboard's album chart, it reinvented them as  a new mutation of the West Coast punk rocker via NYC, and it paved the way  for their 1990s-hipster <i>Grand Royal </i> empire. Most of all, it reintroduced the Beastie Boys to a demographic  that, three years after their previous album, was now said to listen  to ""alternative rock""-- and at a time when being deep into hip-hop was still considered a sort of weird trait for a white teenager  to have, that proved to be a canny lateral move.</p>
<p>Nobody really knew at the time  that numerous other, stupider, more aggro bands would take the punk-rap  structure of <i>Check Your Head </i> and warp it into the testosterone-poisoned mookery of the Woodstock-torching  late 90s. Nobody could predict that its meat-and-potatoes approach  to live-band rap would soon be shown up spectacularly by the far tighter  Roots. And nobody foresaw that the appeal of its loose, garage-funk  instrumentals would begin to fade once Bosco Mann started Daptone rolling  and showed people what the pros sounded like. So looking at <i>Check  Your Head </i>in hindsight and saying it's aged poorly is largely  an issue of unfortunate circumstance; I certainly remember it being  fairly invigorating at the time (the time, in this case, being high  school). So how's it hold up as its own thing, without the weight  of 17 years of inferior imitations and superior refinements upon it?</p>
<p>Well, if you look at it in  terms of what they lost from their previous two albums, the biggest  thing going against <i>Check Your Head </i> is its strange lack of the smart-assed, literate, quick-witted playfulness  that had previously informed their lyrics. Never mind its most infamously-quotable  lyric, from ""Pass the Mic""-- ""Everybody's rappin' like it's  a commercial/ Actin' like life is a big commercial,"" which was supposed  to rhyme ""rehearsal"" instead and got left in as a joke at Mike D's  expense. Aside from the nimble ""Finger Lickin' Good"", the real  issue is that most of the lyrics focus on sledgehammer impact at the  expense of the high concepts and slippery wordplay they'd exhibited  on <i>Paul's Boutique</i>. ""Jimmy James"" is still the jam, but  it's surprising just how sketched-out and simple those otherwise vibrant-seeming  lyrics are, and while the Rollins-grunt platitudes in ""Gratitude""  might sound energizing with those heavy-stomping Sabbath-funk riffs  underneath, it's missing that spark of trickster glee that first made  them great.</p>
<p>If you didn't know better,  you might think the lyrics on <i>Check Your Head</i> were an afterthought-- and, well, they kind of were. The album originally started out as  a jam-heavy instrumental work, where the Beasties refamiliarized themselves  with their instruments-- MCA on bass, Ad-Rock on guitar and Mike D  on drums, with an odd assortment of session hands including carpenter/keyboardist  ""Money Mark"" Nishita and percussionist Juanito  Vazquez. Most of the album was built with an then-unconventional self-sampling  approach, where live instruments were cut-up and reassembled from numerous  takes, arising from ideas that spontaneously transmogrified and shot  into different directions. In combining that approach with the overdriven,  semi-lo-fi, blown-out production, it proved that the Beasties could  find a new tack on their sonic workmanship without needing a Rick Rubin  or some Dust Brothers to guide them (though co-producer Mario Caldato,  Jr. proved a good partner). Still, it's a bit of a mishmash: sublime moments like the hallucinogenic peace-and-love dub of ""Something's  Got to Give"" and the inspired weirdness of Sly &amp; the Family Stone's  ""Time for Livin'"" gone near-unrecognizable as hardcore punk have  to share room with tracks that either sound a little too sloppily anything-goes  (the rattletrap fuzz-rock ""Stand Together"") or come across like  half-formed funk jams with great percussion, slinky Hammonds, not much else (""Funky  Boss"" and ""Pow"").</p>
<p>Lest you think the score's  a bit uncharitable towards what many fans think is the Beasties' second-best  album, it's factoring in this deluxe edition's bonus disc and warning you off buying this particular package.  Yes, you get ""The Skills to Pay the Bills"", a shoulda-made-the-album B-side if there ever was one, but it also includes some of the least  essential B-sides ever-- dick-around jokes like Mike D's yowling  lounge act ""Netty's Girl"", the RZA-sniffing-paint kung-fu-funk goof  ""Drunken Praying Mantis Style"", the unremitting horror of ""Boomin'  Granny""-- as well as some completists-only live tracks and more  versions of ""So What Cha Want"" than you will likely ever need (feel  free to draw the line after the classic Soul Assassin remix). Plus you  get ""Drinkin' Wine"", in case you ever wanted evidence that the  Beasties had a Side 6 of <i>Sandinista! </i> moment.</p>
<p>Maybe <i>Check Your Head</i> doesn't hit the same rap-geek nerves that <i>Licensed to Ill</i> or <i>Paul's Boutique</i> did, but let's look at it this way: It was a worthwhile experiment that resulted in some vital music. The Beastie Boys knew that <i>Paul's </i>was finding appreciation as a cult album, but they couldn't recapture its feeling, not after its commercial failure left them practically forced to take a new tack. Making that approach a smaller-budget, DIY/punk mutation of everything they'd  tried along the way and starting from the ground up as a band rather than a crew of MCs was an inspired idea. Going back to the studio to polish that approach up resulted in their second #1 album, 1994's <i>Ill Communication</i>, which does most of what <i>Check Your Head</i> does just a little better and funnier. But if time has diluted the impact of <i>Check Your Head</i>, clamping on some ear goggles and turning the EQ to its most bass-expanding level is compensation enough.</p></div>"|12923.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12923-check-your-head-deluxe-edition/|6.7|Nate Patrin

I can't remember the last time an established genre felt this dynamic, this much in flux. Fans are spoiled for choice, with every week bringing a panoply of new releases and, just as crucially, new names.  Artists with whom we've only recently become familiar are maturing at a prodigious rate, while a new crop of labels and artists from outside the genre's London birthplace-- Bristol, Glasgow, Berlin, the Netherlands-- keep coming out of the woodwork. If the scene's mainstream is defined by its ubiquitous, industrial-strength ""wobble,"" the margins are host to mutation after mutation, as the music absorbs and synthesizes elements of soca, funky, IDM, industrial, hip-hop, downtempo, ambient, classic 2-step garage, and, especially, Detroit techno and dub techno.</p>
<p>The eagerly hypothesized techno/dubstep crossover is no longer a critic's fantasy: it's a given. Artists from both sides of the divide-- Shed, Scuba, 2562, Ramadanman, Kode9, Ben Klock, Andy Stott, MLZ-- are increasingly meeting in the middle, crafting tracks that blend the tempos, hallmarks and quirks of both genres. The Dutch producer Martyn is one of that lot's most versatile talents, and his debut album, <i>Great Lengths</i> shows an appropriately varied and evidently personal set of interpretations of dubstep's present possibilities.</p>
<p>Like many dubstep artists, Martyn came to the genre from drum'n'bass, but he crossed over only comparatively recently. His first records, released in 2005 and 2006 for Marcus Intalex's Revolve:r label, clearly drew from the same spring that a decade before had fed the lush atmospherics of Alex Reece and LTJ Bukem. (It's not all so tranquil; ""Nxt 2 U"", for Play:musik, sounded like a tech-step rework of Konono No. 1, and hinted at a growing interest in unconventional rhythms and textures.) By 2007's ""Broken"" (Revolve:r), Martyn had slowed to dubstep's tempo, but he left many of his usual elements-- drifting pads, rapidfire percussive patterns-- intact. The effect was like watching as the spokes of a moving car's wheels seem to flicker backwards and forwards, buoyant, weightless and hovering in place. This, clearly, was Martyn's groove.</p>
<p>With the foundation of his own label, 3024, in 2007, Martyn confirmed his arrival as one of dubstep's distinctive new voices, a reputation he has reinforced across further singles and remixes of Scuba, TRG, Shut Up and Dance, among others. He has simultaneously resisted settling too comfortably into any one sound or scene; he and gauzy hip-hopper Flying Lotus have traded remixes, and he even delved into unadulterated house music on a remix for Detroit's Ican.</p>
<p><i>Great Lengths</i> is accordingly diverse, but it's also remarkably coherent. Most of its tracks fall within dubstep's stomping ground, clocking somewhere between 130 and 140 BPM and heaving with swing; it's underscored by a powerful bass presence that seems to stretch to infinity. But Martyn also pauses to explore other tempos and cadences: the churning ""Seventy Four"" is a plodding, dub-techno dirge, while ""Elden St."" marries 2-step syncopations to techno's steady 4/4 under cover of misty keys and fragmented soul vocals. The ambient interludes ""Bridge"" and ""Brilliant Orange"", meanwhile, suggest an affinity for moody soundtrack music. Neither is particularly memorable on its own, but they serve a useful purpose as a kind of mood glue, helping give the album its sense of flow. And Detroit techno's plangent chords carry across almost everything here, including the most broken, driving rhythms.</p>
<p>This isn't Burial: Martyn is much more obviously a student of the dance floor. His rhythms are more cleanly drawn than Burial's, his sounds more pronounced. But a similar moodiness prevails, making this an album that ought to appeal to a wide swathe of listeners, including plenty who might not care about dubstep in the abstract. Even comparatively sprightly cuts like ""Little Things"" are awash in melancholic strings, and almost every track is driven by fat, stacked chords moving in formation. He's fond of chords voiced like the sampled rave stabs of yore-- blocky, fixed-interval things that lend an odd modal shiver as they go crab-walking up and down the scales. He makes even more out of dub's glancing tone clusters, which mark syncopated time while nervous counterpoints and nimble bass lines fill in the rest of the spectrum. And Martyn's bass is itself a thing to behold: it envelops without ever overpowering, suggesting at once the anchor and the play in the line leading from it.</p>
<p>Even at his most uptempo, Martyn tends to sound guarded, even a little sullen. His rhythms hurtle and slice; there's a flailing desperation lurking behind the funk. At his best, as on tracks like ""Vancouver"" and ""Elden St."", his sounds seem to dissolve into themselves, the groove coiled like a hunched shoulder. It's here, I think, that Martyn sounds most like Martyn. He doesn't always hit his mark; the Spaceape-fronted ""Is This Insanity?"" sounds like he's merely stapled his trademark shirred chords to a structure modeled on Shackleton's percussive ethno-dubstep. And ""krdl-t-grv"", to my ears anyway, is too insistent in its two-bar repetitions and strident, detuned harmonies.  But every selection on the album points to a particular vision, one expertly carried out in the marriage of force and tenderness, and of passion and craft.</p></div>"|12883.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12883-great-lengths/|7.5|Philip Sherburne

The same holds true for alt-legend Mould's level of self-awareness, which, too, has grown more and more pronounced as his influence continues to seep through every level of the indie strata.</p>
<p>""There's sort of a traditional sound I have,"" he admitted to me a year ago. ""It's singer/songwriter playing mostly electric guitar, writing linear songs that are fairly catchy, and fairly emotionally introspective. Anything that goes too far off of that is a challenge for some fans. Then there are the fans that unconditionally listen to what I do. Having said that, one of the things I've been curious about is that there seems to be this other group of people for whom I'm damned if I do anything, that if I'm not doing free jazz, I'm not progressing.""</p>
<p>Needless to say, <i>Life and Times</i>, Mould's ninth solo album, does not mark a free jazz transformation, nor does the disc represent much musical progress at all, per se. Maybe that's for the best, since the closest Mould has come to anything close to ""progress,"" as such, is his divisive foray into dance/rock fusion, <i>Modulate</i>. Yet time marches on, and no matter what the songs themselves may sound like, Mould in 2009 is a much different person from the Mould who helped merge hardcore intensity with pop.</p>
<p>That's a different sort of progress, but one worth acknowledging all the same, as never before has Mould seemed this comfortable with his status as one of the progenitors of a sound adopted and adapted by everyone from Pixies and the Foo Fighters to the Hold Steady and No Age. While it would be unfair to saddle Mould with the same ol' ""best album since..."" cross, <i>Life and Times</i> does manage to reflect each facet of Mould's career, from his punk roots through his current electronic leanings. In fact, from its melodies to its sheen, the album represent Mould at his most Sugar-y, the disc's easily digestible power-pop fueled by overdriven guitars and break-up regrets yet tempered by Mould's ruminative vocals.</p>
<p>Most importantly, <i>Life and Times</i> offers hook after giant hook.  Not that Mould seems particularly settled on the opener and title track-- in the song, the conflict isn't just romantic rejection but the more complex challenge of embracing love at the risk of inviting future hurt. Uncertainty similarly simmers beneath the surface of ""The Breach"" or the illustratively titled ballad ""I'm Sorry, Baby, But You Can't Stand in My Light Any More"", but even with the latter, there's an implied light at the end of the tunnel.</p>
<p>""I always find the broken ones/what does this say about me?"" Mould sings, the realization offering the possibility of rehabilitation and, ultimately, reconciliation in the midst of an album scented with love gone sour. You root for Mould to pull through, too. Earlier in his life, Mould often responded to inner conflict by lashing out, but here he instead reaches out, with the inviting jangle of ""City Lights (Days Go By)"" and even on the bitter ""Bad Blood Better"", pulling us closer than ever into his subconscious. The guy still needs a hug, but more than ever before he sounds like a guy open to giving one back in return.</p>
<p>Yet accessibility never overshadows Mould's innate qualities. Indeed, dozens of acts could pull off a pop-punk squall like ""Argos"", ""Spiraling Down"", or ""MM 17"", but only Bob Mould sounds like Bob Mould when he contemplates ""the taste of last night's sex in my mouth."" Later, when he peels off a blitzkrieg solo on ""Wasted World"" it's like hearing decades of punk history come washing out of the speakers like a wave. In the past that racket would have pushed you away. The Mould of <i>Life and Times</i>, on the other hand, has arms outstretched. It's a contemplative work setting the stage for Mould's upcoming memoir, whose hooks will for once have to connect without the almost comforting bark of his vocals or buzz of his guitar behind them.</p></div>"|12913.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12913-life-and-times/|7.0|Joshua Klein

Chromatics and Junior Boys make a sort of dance  music suitable for transit-- steeped in typical club-friendly sonics,  their records are the soundtrack to the drive home from the club rather than the night out itself. Taken to its logical extreme, is it possible  to make a sort of dance music as a completely disembodied  observer?  Los Angeles' Ramona Gonzalez,  under the name Nite Jewel, seems set on finding the answer.</p>
<p>Like the phrase ""Nite Jewel""  itself, <i>Good Evening </i>is minuscule and precious, both of  which are charming descriptors, but its fragility is taken to an almost palpable extent.  Once the record gets past a certain  volume in headphones (it doesn't take much), you can faintly hear  recording buzz splitting it apart at the seams.  Take ""Suburbia"": Underneath Gonzalez's incorporeal wail, nothing feels concrete, despite the insistent  and simple repetition.  The leading synth blurt falls in and out  of tune while the four-on-the-floor kick drum threatens to go into slack  triplets.  Any quantizing feature could ""solve"" this problem,  but is seeing the stitching part of the appeal?  The whole appeal?   On ""What Did He Say"", the most immediately striking track  on <i>Good Evening</i>, there's a nifty bassline but the moment it modulates up a couple of steps,  the mix turns to mush.  If you've ever played a preset  song on a Casio and switched up between incompatible major scales, you  might get the idea.</p>
<p>There are positives, but even they raise questions: Bubbling single ""Artificial Intelligence"", which is probably  the first track on <i>Good Evening </i> with a discernible lyric (even if it's just the title), has a clear-eyed purpose.  Meanwhile,  ""Let's Go (The Two of Us Together)"" and ""Chimera"" follow in  the path of ""Weak For Me"", an earlier highlight that cops its sound  from the Jets' ""Crush on You"".  It's debatable  whether this DIY take on lite and funky Reagan-era R&amp;B is refreshing  or akin to munching on a piece of bubblegum that's been stuck in a  pack of Donruss since the mid-80s-- why dull the hooks when the sort  of fidelity that could bring them to a focus is more readily available  than ever, even to artists at their most entry-level?</p>
<p>But then again, maybe it's  not a remix <i>Good Evening </i>needs so much as a fair yardstick to  measure it by.  Though it's arguable that each has different  goals, the same sort of disembodied vocals and languorous textures you  hear in acts like Grouper, Beach House, and A Sunny Day In Glasgow are proof there's more to this sort of thing than  sounding like a Cocteau Twins record playing two parties over. Alas, Nite Jewel isn't at the level of the aforementioned; with her devotion  to a sound<i> </i>at the relative cost of songs, she's more  like a shuttle-mate of Salem in the blog-hype space race to find an  act that can merge tapes-out-of-the-trunk hip-hop recording methods  with 4AD gossamer.  Now let's see if they're willing to outsource  the engineering.</p></div>"|12888.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12888-good-evening/|6.3|Ian Cohen

I finally acquiesced, knowing this review was due, and suddenly realized how much my relationship with Prince has changed over the past 20 years. His rise to success, beginning with 1979's <i>Prince</i>, pretty much mirrored my pre-adolescent development as a music fan. By 1987's <i>Sign O' the Times</i>, I was ripping the cellophane off the cassingles when barely out of the store, hoping to soak up a little of that Princely aura even if it would be hours before I'd be near my tape deck.</p>
<p>Like many who came of age when each new Prince album expanded our conception of pop, I've already struggled through plenty of self-cannibalized sketches and ever-more-mawkish ballads and unsuccessful experiments to locate the canon-worthy songs lurking in his decade-plus of hubristic over-production. I know a jumble of decent tunes, lackluster jams, and outright dreck invariably awaits on any Tuesday morning bearing a new Prince album. This time around, and in several key ways, we get a partial throwback to the Prince records I greedily inhaled as a tween. (For one thing I bought a physical copy at a chain department store, something I haven't regularly done since I could drive.) That added a little twist to my distress when I realized that, at age 31, I was actually kind of <i>dreading</i> my first play of a new Prince album. It's a future the 12-year-old me would not have wanted to reach.</p>
<p>Assessing a new Prince album all but demands forced objectivity and willfully ignoring his first decade as a recording artist. Want to look like an idiot? Write a screed lamenting the fact that an artist has failed to consistently entertain, let alone surprise or enlighten, for over 30 years. But what's left, once you choose the road of sane detachment, other than a review that can be summed up as ""predictably imperfect, your mileage may vary""? Hence my low-level dread. So here's my hardly original thesis, which many could have guessed even before clicking: Don't buy this album unless you're willing to do the work of winnowing it down to the tracks you find enjoyable/passable. Two new Prince albums (plus a third disc we'll get to in a minute) for the price of one might as well come with a giant sparkly sticker that reads ""For Obsessive Amateur Editors Only."" Filler on a 21st century Prince album? Do purple pontiffs leave paisley piles in the Minnesota woods?</p>
<p><i>Lotusflow3r</i> is mostly neutral funk-rock. When I say ""funk-rock,"" I don't mean the taut, digitally enhanced amalgam Prince invented/perfected in the 1980s. I mean the looser variety, amenable to extended onstage takes, that friend and foe alike would describe as ""organic,"" albeit with very different inflections. It's a sound that works best when he observes three important guidelines: 1) He restrains the stock guitar heroics (has anyone's instrumental creativity been more effectively hampered by being repeatedly declared the last great virtuoso?), 2) He keeps the tempos club-friendly (or at least friendly in the context of old-school weekend at the 40-and-over spot), and 3) He remembers his faux rivalry with fellow funkateer Morris Day was more productive than his imagined rivalry with musically ignorant young folks.</p>
<p>But when I say ""neutral,"" unfortunately I mean pretty much exactly what you probably think I mean. The only track with an immediately memorable hook is his cover of ""Crimson and Clover"", which would be sadder if he hadn't been obscuring his preternatural catchiness for some time now. On <i>Lotusflow3r</i>, as on all of his albums since he became a classicist by intent and a live workhorse out of necessity, Prince mistakenly assumes instrumental prowess to be of primary importance to anyone other than online guitar-tab traders, while also displaying an unflattering and near-constant need to prove he can hang with the multi-cultural heroes who shaped his worldview. There's no need to genuflect when you've long since been admitted to the pantheon.</p>
<p>If <i>Lotusflow3r</i> is generic and too-reverential modern day muso Prince, then <i>MPLSound</i> is either crass or delusional. It's crass if it's a conceptual cash-grab, Prince bald-facedly pastiching his own 80s sound as a profitable parlor game. Times being vice-tight, presumably even for those with the renewable resource of a deep catalog of hall-of-fame hits, dusting off the drum machine makes a certain sad sense, and a by-numbers ballad like ""Here"" sounds undeniably better backed by its twee little keyboard hook than, like, a flute. It's delusional if he's serious, because it means he thinks these flimsy self-homages wouldn't sound anemic next to tunes from <i>Purple Rain</i> or <i>Parade</i>, which you can at least write off as the kind of perception-free baloney we expect from geniuses of his stripe.</p>
<p>Either way, <i>MPLSound</i> is (surprise) momentarily enjoyable and completely inessential, happy to provoke Palovian responses since the hard work of honestly juicing your head, heart, or hips is antithetical to the whole idea. Sure, you can still sieve off a few decent tracks for your ""Prince in the Aughts"" playlist; the Camille redux of ""Dance 4 Me"" is my personal choice, if only because he tries to shoehorn in <i>all</i> of the sex/religion/androgyne clichés. But while I'd pick electro-funk Prince over jazz-funk Prince every day of the week, the proximity of <i>Lotusflow3r </i>makes the pleasures of <i>MPLSound</i> feel even more hollow, like it's merely a spoonful of synth-driven sugar designed to sell naysayers on the non-electronic new stuff Prince wants you to cherish as much as the old faves.</p>
<p><i>Elixer</i>, the aforemetioned third disc, is actually by newcomer Bria Valente, who should at least be happy she's been able to piggyback her way to bad reviews in national publications, rather than languishing in the promo bin purgatory to which she'd be consigned if her producer was a cousin with a copy of Pro Tools. <i>Elixer</i> runs the gamut of bland-but-classy R&amp;B, from antiseptic slow jams to rote dance-pop, slick as you'd expect and completely failing to suggest what bunched Prince's panties when he initially discovered Valente. Many of Prince's pet projects have been little more than ventriloquist's dummies-- excepting skilled musicians like Sheila E. or irrepressible lunatics like Morris Day, the master hasn't had much patience for personality-driven showboats-- but any trace of weirdness or wit or actual eroticism has seemingly been purged from Valente's performance at Jehovah's request, which reflects worse on egomaniacal producer than nominal artiste in this case. Like some depressing footnote to the whole <i>Lotusflow3r/MPLSound</i> experience, <i>Elixer</i> sparked my final sad realization about my current relationship with Prince and his product: Who knew I'd one day get wistful for the vacuous but honestly carnal fluff of ""Sex Shooter""?</p></div>"|12911.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12911-lotusflow3r-mplsound-elixer/|4.9|Jess Harvell

The First 20 Hits</i> in 1992, it was a greatest-hits that was practically  a boast: 20 consecutive singles, almost every one of them a significant  UK hit. After darting from project to project for the first half of  the 1980s, songwriter/synth dude Vince Clarke had finally formed a lasting  partnership (with Andy Bell, whose voice still sounds uncannily like  Clarke's old Yaz partner Alison Moyet). If they didn't have the range  and wit of Pet Shop Boys, the other major homophilic synth-pop duo of  their era, they had all the hooks anyone could ask for, and they damn  sure had a flashier singer-- even minor singles like ""You Surround  Me"" let Bell show off his post-Boy George soul chops and stratospheric  falsetto. Clarke's treble-range synthesizers sound chintzy and fakey  now; that's how they sounded at the time, too, but that was their purpose-- to  be the sound of the prefabricated future. <i>Pop!</i>'s final song (not  counting a remix of ""Who Needs Love [Like That]"") was a cover  of ABBA's ""Take a Chance on Me"" that gave the game away: Clarke's  dream was to be Benny and Björn rolled into one, a technician of irresistible,  precision-tooled camp. (The earlier Erasure single ""Stop!""  had basically been a diagonal cross-section of ""Take a Chance on  Me"", too.)</p>
<p><i>Total Pop!</i> is an expansion  of <i>Pop!</i>, beginning with the original album <i>in toto</i>. That collection  represented Erasure's first seven years; it's taken another 17  to generate enough material for a second disc's worth of singles. The  strict chronology means that disc two leads with its one bona fide jewel:  1994's ""Always"", blessed with an upward-spiraling melody that  justifies the ""Like a Prayer"" choir behind Bell. But that  year was also when they started following the trends of electronic music  (""Run to the Sun"") rather than cheerfully ignoring them, and  since then they've trudged through all the requisite career-extenders:  the flaccid hope-you-like-our-new-direction experiment (1995's <i>Erasure</i>),  the guess-you-preferred-our-old-direction backtrack (1997's <i>Cowboy</i>),   the album of obvious covers (2003's <i>Other People's Songs</i>-- seriously,  ""Solsbury Hill""?), the acoustic-versions-of-old-stuff album  (2006's <i>Union Street</i>). The later singles are superficially very  much like the early ones; the difference is that Clarke's electronics  have come to mostly just underscore Bell's singing, rather than engage  it with countermelodies and cross-rhythms.</p>
<p>And then there's the third  disc, ""Live 1987-2007"", which adds little besides room tone,  slightly different arrangements and the occasional bit of crowd noise  to Erasure's studio recordings-- their live performances are long on  spectacle (hence the DVD also included with the set) but short on revelation.  There's yet another installment in their string of ABBA covers, ""Voulez  Vous"" (preceded by an a cappella verse of ""Mamma Mia"");  there's yet another version of ""Who Needs Love"", this time  from 1996, accompanied by wildly inapposite live drums and chugging  guitars. (Oh, the 90s.)</p>
<p>Clarke's gift as a songwriter  is his sense of melody, which hasn't entirely deserted him-- 2007's ""Sunday  Girl"" (not a Blondie cover) delivers the goods almost as much as  anything on the original <i>Pop!</i> But Erasure has never quite pulled  off the vulnerable universality and radiant ache that gave their Swedish  idols depth and staying power. An hour's worth of their hits is about  all it's possible to take before sugar-crash sets in. A second best-of-- disc  two, in other words-- would've been a useful if lesser companion to the  first; confining it to this bloated box makes it considerably less fun.</p></div>"|12884.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12884-total-pop-deluxe-box/|6.0|Douglas Wolk

Caught between hippie repose and punk venom, the band's political vision lends their music its ""so anti-American, it's American"" attitude. Loyal fans already know, from their records and their shamanic artwork, that their unforgiving posture toward history lines up best with <i>Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee</i>, the early chapters of Howard Zinn's <i>People's History</i>, Jim Jarmusch's <i>Dead Man</i>, and those ""Original Homeland Security"" T-shirts with the rifle-toting Indians. On <i>Space Programs</i>, their fourth album, they take another glance at our republic's origin myths through a glass darkly.<br/> <br/> Blown out with antic energy, the record peels forward with ""Cocaine Wedding"". Celebrity mavens may link the title to the chemically enhanced matrimony of Eddie Van Halen and Valerie Bertinelli; certainly the song's sound and structure, abruptly upshifting and downshifting out of its muscle-car rhythms, trace the manic arc of doomed love. But, in the end, the USA is always the subject with the USA Is a Monster, so maybe moral rot and the cult of celebrity are the true issues, and all the song's hints of a circus atmosphere, thanks to Johnny Mateo's fiery trombone, are jabs at the era of Britney.<br/> <br/> ""Ice Bridge"" immediately flings us back into the usual TUSAIAM territory, telling a searing tale about man's lust for the unknown, beginning calmly, then taking their trademark singsong vocals about Norsemen and Cheyenne medicine men over a rocky landscape of monumental riffs and rhythms. Out of drifting time signatures and drawn-out harmonies, they carve a sense of aimless, star-crossed wandering. Whether Americans, Europeans, or the so-called natives are the wanderers, it isn't always easy to tell. While that virginal past occupies much of their time, ominous signs of the future are everywhere. On the laser-synthed ""Frozen Rainbows"" and the frenzied early bars of ""Above All It's the Songs"", the band sounds like it is siphoning beats from proggy Nintendo soundtracks. (Think ""Contra"".) The clean tones and blistering velocity call to mind the nerdy precision of both the Advantage and their Load Records compatriots Lightning Bolt.<br/> <br/> Then add to that technocratic flavor a little dash of the Teutonic. Arguably, the loops here (especially on ""Tulsa"", ""Above All It's the Songs"") have that icy Krautrock ease that would fit nicely in a Neu! record: it's the tangled, Magma-style noodling, the childlike and chanting delivery, and the spacebound solos (""Florida"") that set it apart, giving the record not only a mystical texture but astronomical scale. Compared to past releases, the new keeps just the right amount of the pastoral: not much. The record is called <i>Space Programs</i>, after all. Where their last outing, <i>Wohaw</i>, strayed too far into the protest-folk forests of Woodstock, <i>Space Programs</i> finds a better balance of campfire intimacy and the slashing intricacy of <i>Sunset at the End of the Industrial Age</i>. More a lyrical evocation, rather than a merciless deconstruction, of the white man's burden, the Trail of Tears, manifest destiny, empire, and James Kirk's final frontier, the record fits neatly into the USA Is a Monster's furious discography.</p></div>"|12890.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12890-space-programs/|7.2|Roque Strew

Call it growing up, refining the message, or whatever you want to, but it's easy to see why a guy might eventually want to leave the playground insult behind for something more all-embracing. Now based in Seattle, Elbogen is still making music for pocket-sized arenas, cramming big gestures into a small sound.</p>
<p><i>Oohs &amp; Aahs</i> fits  into his usual semi-hi-fi aesthetic, at least in terms of the way the  arrangements are presented, but there's something off about the way  the vocals are recorded on almost the whole record. They get almost  completely lost when listening on headphones because the echo applied to them makes them so indistinct-- they  flutter around and the melody blurs off the beat. On speakers, his voice sounds  better, but it's still not pleasing. Elbogen also adopts a most  mush-mouthed approach, requiring the listener to crane an awful lot to hear  the lyrics that are so central to his music. This isn't another quasi-concept  record about vampires like 2006's <i>Impeccable Blahs</i>, but still,  comprehensibility is nice.</p>
<p>It's too bad, because many  of these songs have quite a bit going for them otherwise. Opener ""Elouise"" is as good an example as any, opening with a good fuzz bass part and  some tolling piano chords before the big guitar texture kicks in. And  then, well, there's some tuneful mumbling from a guy who sounds like he has marbles in his mouth, something about the high 90s FM station or something. As  big a hang-up as that is, Elbogen sings more clearly through the echo  on much on the rest of the album, and he has some good stuff going on  here, like the pointillist horn theme that opens the propulsive ""Oh  Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh"", the little piano eruption on ""Hallie and  Henry"", and the big, almost majestic keyboard theme that underpins  the floaty almost-anthem ""Maurine"". These songs are concise and to  the point, sometimes to their own detriment: ""Dramatic Irony"" feels  like it's just getting going when it suddenly ends.</p>
<p>The album's highlight is ""One, Two... One"", if only for the brilliant chorus that comes tumbling out of nowhere over the vaguely 1980s instrumental bed. Elbogen harmonizes with himself, and the excess reverb hurts the precision a bit, but it still injects an exciting little whiff of jazz into the song. Fans of mid-fi one-man indie bands and anyone who loved Elbogen's when he was still Say Hi To Your Mom will undoubtedly find things to like about it, but <i>Oohs &amp; Ahs</i> is ultimately a decent record that's weighed down a bit by some puzzling sonics.</p></div>"|12863.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12863-oohs-aahs/|5.9|Joe Tangari

Since she began recording and performing as Bat For Lashes a few years back, the Brighton native has loosely assembled those things around her person like so many thrift store trinkets. Were it not for ""What's a Girl to Do?"", the lone song from her otherwise-too-precious 2006 debut to suggest that she might have the chilly songwriting charisma to match her outward appearance, it could have been easy to write Khan off as nothing more than an over-reaching asthete.</p>
<p>Actually, to be honest, that temptation remains. Khan's aesthetic is such a perfectly struck balancing act between earth mother hippie mystic and post-modern Gen Y art student (see: the cover for her latest single ""Daniel"", which depicts her on a beach, shivery and windswept, with a painting of <i>The Karate Kid</i>'s Daniel LaRusso adorning her entire naked back) that it's difficult to forget about the sheer workaday craft that must go into constantly seeming so effortlessly, artfully rumpled. Nonetheless, as of <i>Two Suns</i>, her second full-length album, all of that takes a backseat. A significant step forward from her debut, <i>Two Suns</i> is home to some of the year's most thrilling music so far.</p>
<p>Khan's real breakthrough might simply be her willingness to wear her influences more brazenly. One needn't have any more than a basic working knowledge of female innovators from the past few decades to be able to spot the ghosts lurking around this stage. The strident piano chords and lone snare of ""Traveling Woman"" echoes PJ Harvey's desolate roadsongs, while ""Moon and Moon""'s delicate piano playing and cabinet-reverbed backing vocals evoke early Tori Amos. Elsewhere, with its pummeling rhythms, double-timed handclaps, glass harmonica trills and vocal histrionics, the moonstruck rave-up ""Two Planets"" owes its entire existence to Björk. But even in the moments where those influences risk running on the wrong side of overt, they never feel stolen or unearned. Just as Khan seems most comfortable when she's adorned in a patchwork of styles, eras, and ideologies, this record feels more satisfying and fully formed for its overt cutting and pasting of those different sensibilities.</p>
<p>What's more heartening, though, is that during <i>Two Suns</i>' highlights, Khan has few peers. I could probably fill this entire space just writing about ""Glass"", the album's aggressively propulsive opener, and about how its strange mix of elements (chamber pop, prog metal, new age-- what?) magically coalesced into some entirely new genre that I wish existed and yet still can't quite wrap my brain around. Then there's the booming ""Sleep Alone"", which, with its rusty guitar licks, Knife-inspired synths, buzzing basslines and floorboard percussions, feels kind of like a sea shanty circa 2074. Or the aforementioned ""Daniel"", the album's first single, which marries brittle, 80s-influenced electro and an inspired viola arrangement with what has to be, hands down, one of the most insidious choruses of the year.</p>
<p>For all that, though, the album's most vindicating moment comes at the end. Clocking in at just under three minutes long, closer ""The Big Sleep"" consists of a swoonsome duet between Khan and a suitably broody Scott Walker. Accompanied by nothing more than a stormy piano coda, the pair dip and dive around each other, stringing out syllables, dancing around each others' voices and generally soaking in the drama. Not only does Khan hold her own, there are moments when she holds his, too. That she's capable of doing so is evidence enough that we should be paying attention.</p></div>"|12910.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12910-two-suns/|8.5|Mark Pytlik

They didn't  shut up or break up; they just went into near-hibernation, playing  the occasional show, releasing some live albums, and not doing much else.  In the meantime, Mac McCaughan and Laura Ballance's label, Merge Records,  has become a significantly bigger deal, and Portastatic has become McCaughan's  main musical project, releasing four full-length studio albums (as well  as a pile of EPs and demo collections and a soundtrack).</p>
<p>And now Superchunk are apparently  in the early stages of preparing a new full-length record, so their  new five-track, four-song EP basically exists to clear out the material  they've worked up for their intermittent live sets over the last eight  years. (""Misfits and Mistakes"", written for the <i>Aqua Teen  Hunger Force</i> movie, turned up on a single in 2007.) It sounds <i>exactly</i> like what Superchunk were doing 15 years ago: McCaughan yell-singing  those strained high notes of his, dual-guitar solos, fast, heavy unambiguous  rock. ""Learned to Surf"", which gets reprised in a casual acoustic  version at the end, hints at perspective on the band's longevity and  its dropping out of the indie-rock rat race--""I can't hold my breath  anymore/ I stopped swimming and learned to surf,"" the chorus goes-- but  you wouldn't know it by its meat-and-potatoes arrangement.</p>
<p>As always, McCaughan's songs  are impeccably constructed, with clever bits of craftsmanship everywhere,  from the gyroscopic riff that opens the disc to the way ""Knock  Knock Knock"" builds up to its jump-shot of a chorus. The band's  chemistry is untouched by time: They're still speedy, locked-in, and  spring-chickeny. But even Superchunk once moved past what they were  doing 15 years ago-- their last couple of albums preserved their instrumental  voices but stretched them beyond headlong heaviness. This is a perfectly  solid throwback by a band that's smart enough to know better.</p>
<p>Before there was Superchunk,  there was Wwax, a trio of McCaughan with Brian Walsby and Wayne Taylor,  whose complete studio recordings, plus a live Saccharine Trust cover,  are collected on the digital-only <i>Like It or Not</i>. 1987 and 1988,  when all of these songs were recorded, was a transitional moment in  American independent rock, as young bands across the country were trying  to figure out how to get past the formulae of punk and into something  grimy enough that nobody could mistake it for mainstream pop.</p>
<p>Wwax's sole for-the-ages song  was the A-side of their first single, ""Pumpkin"", which is  just about Superchunk straight out of the gate-- the hyper lead guitar,  the steady flow of riffs that don't congeal into anything as straightforward  as verse-chorus-bridge, McCaughan pushing his voice as high as it will  go without actually breaking. The songs his bandmates sing are less  impressive. They've got a solid stomp to them, and they mess around  with tempos and time signatures entertainingly, but a lot of them come  off as slightly desperate stabs toward independence. ""Like It or  Not"" and ""Straw Man"", in particular, keep toppling over  into x-on-the-hands 4/4 riffery, then crawling out again. It's a historically  interesting album, rather than a good one; you can hear snatches of  what would be coming out of North Carolina a few years later, but you  can also hear Wwax falling into the potholes on the road toward it.</p></div>"|12897.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12897-leaves-in-the-gutter-like-it-or-not/|6.5|Douglas Wolk

In fact, lo-fi almost always accentuates it, which is why even the most financially solvent of bands have been known to purposefully muddy or smear their sound, sacrificing clarity for intensity and choosing mystery over transparency. If you read much music criticism you'll know (and I'm as guilty as anyone) that some of the gravest pejoratives are ""tasteful,"" ""mannered,"" and ""polite."" And of course, it's damn near impossible to sound tasteful or polite when your songs are coming through layers of hiss, distortion, and fuzz.</p>
<p>Embracing a lo-fi aesthetic is certainly an acceptable and useful tool for communicating your music, but ideally the tunes themselves should be strong enough to stand on their own. It would be unfair to say an album like the Love Language's self-titled debut is a failure unless you can imagine the songs would've sounded just as good had they been recorded squeakily clean. Still, it's almost invariably the case that hooks and melodies (which <i>The Love Language</i> luckily has in spades), and not technique, are what keeps a listener returning over and over again.</p>
<p>As a touring entity, the Love Language are a seven-piece band currently based in Raleigh, N.C., yet their eponymous first LP was written and recorded solely by frontman Stuart McLamb. Like recent indie breakthroughs Wavves and Times New Viking, McLamb uses lo-fi as a filter for his keen pop sensibilities, though his approach is far friendlier and less abrasive than either of those acts. Over the brief 29-minute course of the album, McLamb cycles through a wide range of indie-rock, country, and early-pop styles, all delivered with shouty charm and in-the-red verve, roughly approximating a sock-hop-era Arcade Fire. Particularly effervescent are ""Lalita"", which rides a bold fuzzed-out guitar line and equally demonstrative drums to somehow convey shambling joy in spite of its embittered lyrics, and ""Sparxxx"", which sounds like a great lost <i>Nugget</i> from a band of forgotten garage moptops, making endearing use of a xylophone. Suffice to say, instruments bleed into each other pretty liberally here, creating a boisterous racket McLamb only emphasizes with his heavy reliance on tambourine, most generously deployed on the punch-drunk, waltzing ""Nocturne"" (which is also outfitted with a neat little surf guitar lick) and the closing ""Graycourt"".</p>
<p>Lyrically this is a record undeniably tinged with romantic strife, yet, unlike lovelorn former Raleigh denizen Justin Vernon of Bon Iver, McLamb's songs are largely energetic and sprightly. Even the spare and clearly aggrieved opener, ""Two Rabbits"" exudes McCartney-ish charms, while the country-tinged moper ""Stars"" musically exudes such a bygone innocence that it's hard to evince any real emotional peril. Of course, a cringe-worthy line like ""little girls tell the biggest lies"" certainly doesn't help, but blessedly it's soon subsumed, like everything else, beneath sweetly obfuscating blankets.</p></div>"|12850.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12850-the-love-language/|7.3|Joshua Love

Thieves Like Us singer Andy Grier, an American, met keyboardist Björn Berglund and drummer Pontus Berghe, both Swedes, when they all lived in Berlin. The <i>Tron</i>-loving filter-house electro-poppers now call Paris home, and French label Kitsuné picked up their big single, the euphoric but also melancholic downtown-metro ride ""Drugs in My Body"". Debut album <i>Play Music</i> was variously conceived and created in Berlin, Vienna, New York, London, Rio de Janeiro, and Stockholm.</p>
<p>Finally getting a belated U.S. release, the disc justifies some but not all of its carbon footprint. New Order's 1984 hit ""Thieves Like Us"" exemplified how those UK synth-pop icons could take something ""so uncool""-- like love of tech gadgetry-- and give it a certain expensively wasted glamor. ""Drugs in My Body"" adapts this strategy for our post-Daft Punk ears. It's hyper-urban strobe-pop, with aching vocals and a tightly coiled Durutti Column sample that could appeal not only to don't-call-it-blog-house LastNightsPartyers, but also to Factory-worshiping indie bedwetters like me. The full album should be an okay soundtrack for a hoverbus tour of some retrofuturistic metropolis, but it's somewhere just outside of track 3 when the Dramamine starts to kick in.</p>
<p><i>Play Music</i> slows down more often than your Justice Mobile Digitalisms, and when it does it tends to lose some focus. Unfortunately, the horn-haunted nighttime cityscape of ""An Easy Tonight"" sounds less like the City of Lights than the City That Makes Me Kinda Sleepy; the solid but unremarkable<i> kosmische</i> of ""Lady"" needs something a little more distinctive alongside its tasteful woundedness. Most of the singing was recorded at home, which helps it sound sincere, but also helps it sound like a specific, time-fixed notion of sinceirty (won't anyone just let Ian Curtis rest in peace?). Shoulda-been instrumental ""Program of the Second Part"" suggests, ""Sing along to Suicide.""</p>
<p>Of course, smuggling open-hearted vocal frailness into ecstatic electronic dance-pop can still have thrilling results, as New Order showed, and the likes of the Tough Alliance continue to demonstrate. Thieves Like Us are usually best when they're giving us a spoonful of sugar to help the miserabilia go down-- feeling low at a higher tempo on ""Your Heart Feels"", for example, or daydreaming about David and Angela Bowie on the similarly faster-paced ""Miss You"". ""Drugs in My Body"" B-side ""Fass"" also does all right despite meh meta lyrics about crossing ""scene lines."" But the second-best thing here actually has to be finale ""Sugar and Song"", a sure-enough slow breakup ballad that's as depressive as so much good Spiritualized. Although <i>Play Music</i> drags more than I would've hoped, it's still a reasonably lustrous place to be sad now and then-- without drugs in my body, but not without ""Drugs in My Body"".</p></div>"|12865.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12865-play-music/|5.6|Marc Hogan

The label's current overhauled lineup stumps a lot of casual fans, its stylistic (and geographic) makeup undergoing a marked change since Conor Oberst started devoting more time to his Team Love imprint. Singer-songwriter Orenda Fink, with Azure Ray and her left-of-center solo pursuits, has always had one foot in Bright Eyes/Rilo Kiley-style signature Creek folk while the other wades into murkier waters. She's been both part of the label's traditional bedrock and an augury of its (still ongoing) makeover. Teamed with Scalpelist (new random moniker of Cedric LeMoyne, formerly of Remy Zero) as O+S (get it?), Fink once again strives for an artistic obliqueness that staves off obligatory Saddle Creek teen TV drama soundtrack jokes while still sounding undeniably like an Orenda Fink record.</p>
<p>While her brooding solo album <i>Invisible Ones</i> introduced us to a more spiritual Orenda Fink, the new wrinkle this time lies more within the instrumental arrangements. Sharing an interest in field recordings, shoegaze, and David Lynch soundtracks, Fink and LeMoyne's mission is to couch her folksy pop in vast, surreal sonic environs. When they keep this goal in mind, they get results. Fink's lethargic melodies lend themselves to the dream-pop of Julee Cruise or even Ladytron, and the café conversations, street clamor, and other field recordings peppered throughout the album provide an ethereal feel that <i>Invisible Ones</i> sorely lacked.</p>
<p>On the Lynchian end of the spectrum, heady standouts ""New Life"", ""Survive Love"", and ""Knowing Animals"" make good on the collaboration's phantasmal promise. ""New Life"" opens the album with sluggish drum loops and an eerie Dopplering ambience that casts Fink as a kind of schizophrenic Enya. ""It's not a new life/ It's the same old one,"" she sings, while the track, along with synth-laden 1980s hymn ""Survive Love"" and the Portishead-inspired ""Knowing Animals"", suggests otherwise. Yet vestiges of Fink's more staid material crop up on the album despite the duo's best attempts to hedge them with their new quirks. ""The Fox"" and ""My Friend"" sound like Fink leftovers, bare-boned coffeehouse fixtures that have little use for LeMoyne's contributions. While the songwriting on ""Lonely Ghosts"" stays in cruise control, they spruce up the unspectacular piano ballad with a screeching UFO-like sound effect and off-kilter harmonies, though the track doesn't feel like the most effective appropriation of these new tools.</p>
<p>Those blander tracks not only disrupt the album's ethereal tone, they basically contradict O+S's <i>raison d'être</i>. Whether it's the newfound rhythm on ""Permanent Scar"" and ""What Do We Want To"" or the unsettling moodiness of the aforementioned highlights, there are moments here that rank as Fink's most dynamic to date. After all, a few years ago it'd be unfathomable to see the Notwist, Portishead, and M83 mentioned in the same review as either of these artists, but the similarities are here and they're the best product of the collaboration. Always the intrepid mind, Fink has found a promising partner in LeMoyne to bring out her weirder side, and once they do away with a few lingering old habits, the duo could prove an artistic pinnacle for both parties.</p></div>"|12861.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12861-os/|6.4|Adam Moerder

Twenty Years of Merge Records: The Covers|0.0|Various Artists|[]|0.0|0.0|0.0|['Merge']|2009-04-09 00:00:00|2009|2016-06-11 19:06:04.631570|"<div class=""contents dropcap"" data-reactid="".5o5fyz00zk.1.6:0.1.0.$12908/=1$12908.0.3.2.0.1.0.1""><p>Merge Records doesn't look its age.  Originally formed as an outlet for Superchunk material, the Durham, N.C.-based  label has grown into an indie institution, but only gradually-- year  by year, release by release. It never allied itself with a scene or  a sound, so the mind doesn't automatically tether it to a specific  place or time, the way Sub Pop, despite its strong roster this decade, will  be most closely associated with Seattle in the late 1980s and early 90s. So it's  hard to believe Merge is already 20 years old, an occasion the label  is marking with a big birthday bash-- the five-day XX Merge fest in  July-- and a subscription-only series of commemorative retrospectives  and remixes. Perhaps the most intriguing party favor is <i>Score! Twenty  Years of Merge Records: The Covers</i>, a choppy but oddly endearing  compilation that enlists 20 non-Merge acts to cover Merge songs.</p>
<p><i>Score!</i> doesn't resemble a  traditional label sampler as much as one of those carefully curated  compilations like this year's <i>Dark Was the Night</i>. Both releases  benefit charities, both feature the National at their most subdued,  and both serve as a useful state-of-indie report. But where <i>Dark</i> emphasized ""primarily folkie tunefulness, baroque lines in which the  guitar is subservient to other instruments"" (as Scott Plagenhoef wrote  in his review), <i>Score! </i>allows and even encourages these artists  to indulge every idiosyncrasy, no matter how potentially off-putting  or digressive. The result is a weirder, less polite album, one that  showcases a diversity of musical styles and seems much more representative  of 2000s indie.</p>
<p>More representative, however, doesn't  mean better. This comp's inclusive cross-section comes with a downside:  If there's something for everyone, there's also something for everyone  to skip over. Ted Leo and the Pharmacists' workmanlike cover of  Robert Pollard's ""The Numbered Head"" will likely get played often  (at least those opening chords), as listeners move past the Hive Dwellers'  discursive take on Superchunk's ""My Noise"", which pares the song  down to scattered drum hits, a meandering melodica, stair-stepping bass,  and floating vocals. It's interesting to hear the Merge founders stretched  out like taffy, but it's interesting only once. Conor Oberst's earnestness  gets the better of him on Bright Eyes' version of the Magnetic Fields'  ""Papa Was a Rodeo"", which takes the song at face value and misses  its meta-country-song ironies. Stephin Merritt demands a more complex  approach with shades of feeling rather than primary colors, and unfortunately  Jens Lekman and Tracey Thorn also learn that the hard way on ""Yeah!  Oh, Yeah!"" communicating only sincere resignation to the neglect of  lust, mischief, and desperation.</p>
<p>Who'd have thought Merritt would  prove so difficult to cover? And who'd have thought Chris Lopez would  be so easy? He gets two testimonials here, one from the much-misses  Rock*a*teens and another from Tenement Halls. The New Pornographers  streamline the Teens' ""Don't Destroy This Night"" and reinforce  that central snaky riff, while the Shins put floaties on the Halls'  ""Plenty Is Never Enough"", making its shuffle all the more buoyant.  Similarly, East River Pipe gets a pair of songs: Okkervil River chop  and screw ""All You Little Suckers"" to little effect, but the Mountain  Goats make the otherwise humdrum ""Drug Life"" into a rotting-flesh  acoustic lament, emphasizing the melody's similarities to Frankie Valli's  ""Let's Hang On"" as a darkly ironic gesture. Of course Superchunk  get the most covers-- four in total, all with varying degrees of success.  After the Hive Dwellers, Death Cab for Cutie find new kicks in ""Kicked  In"" thanks to a murkier, more emphatic sound that suits them well,  and Ryan Adams preserves the drama of ""Like a Fool"", although it  sounds like he could be covering Echo &amp; the Bunnymen here. Best  is Les Savy Fav's no-frills re-creation of ""Precision Auto"", which  they rev into a frantic driving song.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there's little reverence  here for two songs that might be considered sacred cows. The Apples  in Stereo turn Neutral Milk Hotel's ""King of Carrot Flowers, Pt.  3"" into a power-puff pop song, complete with yo-gabba melodies and  adorable synths that inject a little light whimsy into Mangum's dark  lyrics. And Times New Viking remake the Arcade Fire's ""Neighborhood  #1 (Tunnels)"" as a lo-fi dirge that's equal parts pisstake and affectionate  reimagining. It's an ideal closer for a comp that, rather than simply  showcasing the signees' songcraft, effectively settles Merge and its  roster into the larger context of 20 years of indie rock, emphasizing  the give-and-take between the label and the rest of the world. Just  think what Merge will do when it reaches drinking age.</p></div>"|12908.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12908-score-twenty-years-of-merge-records-the-covers/|6.4|Stephen M. Deusner

In the beginning, around the turn of 2000, Black Dice became notorious  for playing antagonistic post-hardcore punk shows in dramatically darkened  rooms. It was a badge of honor to have gotten hurt, or at least  certifiably scared, during one of their lashing affairs, which rated as physical ordeals as much as aural experiences.</p>
<p>Then, starting with their 2002 DFA album <i>Beaches and Canyons</i>, Black  Dice repositioned themselves as an unusually gritty kind of ambient  band. They took to standing stock-still behind tables of sequencers  and effects, with occasional drumming the only thing to count as even  remotely gestural. The change to stand-around gear happened around the  same time as that of their compatriots in Animal Collective, but Black  Dice's shift signified something different: hermetic, internal systems-like ideas, as opposed to Animal Collective's more  external, ecstatic musings.</p>
<p>Four albums and lots of heady grinding later, <i>Repo</i> draws on that same analytical zeal while  also expanding a sound that's increasingly more realized and  strategic. With its steady forward movement and messy pointillist pillars  thrown up where concise beats might be, the opening ""Nite Crème""  marks Black Dice's slow, lurching move towards something like techno.  It wouldn't tear up any Berlin warehouse, to be sure, but thinking  about techno proves useful to <i>Repo</i>: Where lots of techno artists  have moved away from austere formalism toward more liberated outbursts  of noise (see Ricardo Villalobos, Audion, any producer who treats where  beats fall as a means more than an end), Black Dice, as a band, have  effectively moved in the opposite direction, toward a richly murky meeting  ground somewhere in the middle.</p>
<p>Much of <i>Repo</i> makes good on that  same sort of bottom-up drift toward cohesion, whether rhythmic or not.  ""Glazin"" plays similar sleight-of-hand with the calm pulse of reggae:  As a sampled guitar clip gets infested with all kinds of anxiously granulated  textures and whirs, a warm bass-line starts to roll contentedly beneath  it. In ""Earnings Plus Interest"", a sampled drum break that could  be sourced from 1980s hip-hop or 90s big-beat starts out splashy  but then turns stoic, as clutches of noise crash all around it.</p>
<p>Those patented Black Dice clutches of  noise sound more specifically placed on <i>Repo</i> than they did on  2007's <i>Load Blown</i>, an album that seemed to prioritize textural  smear more than simple rhythm or spacing. <i>Repo</i> is still abstract  in a similar and smeary way, but it sounds like Black Dice have gotten  a better handle on their gear-- as if, having learned how to make more  and more different noises on more and more different machines, part  of their project has turned more toward what exactly to do with those  noises. In those terms, highlights like ""La Cucaracha"" and  ""Lazy TV""-- with coolly stuttering use of a delay-glitch as  quasi-African guitar and lots of warped DJ Screw drama, respectively-- qualify  as compositions, however decomposed they prove.</p></div>"|12907.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12907-repo/|7.1|Andy Battaglia

""To Some It Comes Easy"" might even trigger some to reach for the liners to check if they're hearing Kevin Drew on guitar and Emily Haines on vocals.</p>
<p>Yet despite the fact that Vermue's  a walking Six-Degrees-of-Canadian-Indie, he more than distinguishes himself on <i>Jet Black</i>.   The first thing you'll notice is the tranquil, whispery vocal style  that threads throughout the record, scarcely shifting from the crunchy  T. Rexisms of ""Coastline"" to the wistful ""Rewind"", paired  with only acoustic guitar.  <i>Black</i>'s axes are another of its  distinguishing traits: There's plenty of color and variation, highlighted  by production with an immaculate sense of space. The album's production and Vermue's economical, buttoned-down songwriting offer plenty of tonal and genre variation,  but everything still feels like it's hitting the same mark.</p>
<p>Vermue's paid his dues to get to  this point-- he labored for a couple of albums and moved from tiny Guelph,  Ontario, to much wider recognition in a Toronto's overcrowded indie  network-- and <i>Black</i>'s overriding sentiment reflects his creative  drive, filtered through the shifting dictates of life within a scene.   He constantly resists the urge to second-guess himself, as on ""To  Some It Comes Easy"" (""Try to believe/ That I hit the right track/ And don't  look back"") and ""You Can't Get It Back"" (But I don't waste  time/ You can't get it back/ And there's no ownership line"").  On the album's best song, the minimalist power-pop groover ""How  We Exit"", he begins by admitting his capricious decision-making skills  might be a bit off, but rectifies that problem quickly, trusting his  gut and splitting. When he decides to stick around, as on  the disco-tinged ""We're In a Thunderstorm"", Vermue  makes the best use of his time, extolling the virtues of simply dressing  yourself up and running around.</p>
<p>Though his earnestness might come off  as humorless, a quick glance at the contradictory messages contained  within <i>Jet Black</i>'s album cover alone suggest otherwise.   The title pokes fun at Vermue's unique appearance and the preternatural  smoothness of his voice, both of which were enough to land him a brief  spot in <i>Shortbus</i> (he's not a Canadian, but add John Cameron  Mitchell to that list in the first paragraph). In a recent interview, Vermue said of the title that he ""wanted something tough, muscular, and  rock'n'roll. People think that's funny, knowing me."" That's the  key to why <i>Black</i> is such an effective introduction to a wider  audience: what looks, in a certain light, to be a top hat and tails,  in another is a tuxedo t-shirt.</p></div>"|12877.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12877-jet-black/|7.3|Eric Harvey

Dancing and drugs are indeed mentioned in nearly every track, but, as subject matter for pop songs, they're well-trod territory. What makes the record interesting is the way Circlesquare mastermind Jeremy Shaw uses dancing and drugs as a starting point for exploring his larger themes, i.e., the constant mutation and evolution of subcultures, and the rapid acceleration of science and technology. In Shaw's work, which extends from his music to his parallel career in fine art, dancing and drugs are salvations in and of themselves, and desperately needed coping mechanisms in a fast-moving culture that can leave us feeling disconnected and disoriented. If one can assume a consistent narrative voice on the album, the protagonist of  <i> Songs About Dancing and Drugs </i> is a man who feels as though culture and time itself is out of synch with his reality, and that celebration and narcotics have become his way of either finding his footing within the moment, or slipping outside of it.</p>
<p>The sound of the record reflects its lyrics' sense of temporal dislocation. Even the most danceable numbers have a sluggish pace and somnolent tone, and lighter compositions, such as the drifting, semi-acoustic ""Timely"", suggest a state of permanent jet lag. Shaw's most effective tracks present epic, sweeping songs on a miniature scale, expressing the grandiose sentimentality of U2 or Arcade Fire without either's bombast, and with a far greater sense of implied intimacy. ""Stop Taking (So Many)"" is essentially an arena-rock ballad turned inside-out. The beat is rendered as a simple pulse, a handful of plaintive piano notes carry most of the piece's emotional weight, and the strum and noise of guitars are replaced with abstracted electronic hums, whirs, and beeps. ""Hey You Guys"", the opening track, is slightly more traditional in its gradual build towards catharsis, but even its most dramatic moments are underplayed, and its words are sung in a cool, aloof voice that recalls Depeche Mode's Dave Gahan at his most sedate. In these songs, Circlesquare achieve a rare, truly successful synthesis of rock dynamics and the aesthetics of minimalist electronica. Whereas most attempts to bridge the gap between these styles yield garden-variety rock songs in bleep-beep drag or vice versa, Shaw demonstrates a fluency in both genres that leaves his hybrid music feeling organic instead of dilletantish. He is somewhat less successful when he moves away from that stylistic intersection, resulting in the interminable, drowsy space folk of ""Music For Satellites"", or the appealing yet slightly too familiar slow-motion disco groove of ""Dancers"".</p>
<p>Despite the fact that  <i> Songs About Dancing and Drugs </i> is an exceptionally slow and languorous set of songs, Shaw's arrangements are consistently dynamic, albeit in rather subtle ways. Even the most ambient compositions on the record continuously add new rhythmic hooks and textures, and just when a song seems to drift out into deep space, he will toss in a surprising new element, as with the lonely trumpet solo that turns up at the end of ""Bombs Away, Away"". This approach is especially apparent in 13-minute finale ""All Live But the Ending"", which cycles through all of the album's primary moods and textures while essentially summarizing its lyrical content.</p>
<p>Though everything that precedes ""All Live But the Ending"" is more or less an expression of elliptical ambivalence, Shaw lets the song build to a genuine emotional climax, complete with a digitally warped horn fanfare that shifts into a quiet, sober resolution in which he offers the album's one moment of total certainty in the form of a simple motto: ""In the end, after all, all that anybody really needs is art and music."" That line can be taken as the moral of the album, but even more to the point is that in its final seconds, after repeating his maxim a few times as if to emphatically underline it, Shaw invites the listener one last time to ""come along."" Ultimately, the album is about the value of participating in culture through the communal aspects of art and music, which is sort of ironic given that this is a record best suited to being heard alone, with a good set of headphones.</p></div>"|12767.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12767-songs-about-dancing-and-drugs/|7.1|Matthew Perpetua

While the Social Registry is still the label that pays him, and he's reaching out to the same group of New Yorkers that helped him out the first time around, <i>A Fool For Everyone</i> is an effort that's decidedly more ""rock"" and less ""indie."" Where <i>The Sky Behind the Sea</i> emphasized the textures and spaces in his songs, the new album is more interested in giving a platform to show off his hot licks and bluesy grooves. Coupled with a cover that recalls the hirsute pose jazz flautist Herbie Mann struck for his 1971 album, <i>Push Push</i>, <i>A Fool For Everyone</i> affects the airs of a not-unpleasant 1970s-era singer-songwriter LP-- had this been released 10 years ago, Bones might've found himself with a Drag City label deal and on tour trading solos with Jim O'Rourke during the latter's <i>Eureka</i>/<i>Insignificance</i> phase. Unfortunately, as with his first album, the pleasing airs last only as long as Bones chooses to ignore the ""singer"" portion of the equation.</p>
<p>I don't mean this as a slight against Bones' singing voice, though its flatness-- coupled with an aw-shucksy tic-- pushes it into acquired-taste territory. That said, the album's bluesy tenor does wonders to mitigate its shortcomings, something that the debut's spacious environs couldn't do. With <i>Fool</i>, the problems mostly reside in the words that Bones sings. Throughout the album, Bones aims to offer poetic yet plain-spoken <i>bon mots</i> about the hard knocks of the human condition. What he ends up with is obvious images and unsurprising rhyming couplets.</p>
<p>If Lou Reed, as Lester Bangs once surmised, was a student of the ""I walked to the chair/ Then I sat in it"" school of lyrics, then Bones can consider himself a certified graduate of the ""I walked to the chair/ It had four legs and was made of wood"" community college. In other words, when he sings ""show the vampire my biggest vein,"" it's no surprise that he follows up with ""make two holes for the blood to drain."" It starts with the despondent verses of ""Today the World Is Worthy of My Loathing"", and continues all the way through ""Everybody's Coming Down on Me"". In case it's not obvious by those lugubrious song titles, Bones presents himself as a hard-luck, sad sack. ""Hate and shame fill me,"" he muses on ""Much More Than Love"", which might be why, as he notes in ""Like a Politician"", that ""the meanness of the world [has] prematurely lined my face."" But what can you do? ""The heart's a vicious master,"" he warbles on ""Give Up on Guitars"", ""but we've given him our word."" And so on, <i>ad nauseum</i>.</p>
<p>Hopefully Bones knows enough never to heed the advice of that aforementioned song title. When he keeps quiet and lets the music (and especially his guitar playing) do the talking, the album shines. The gradual crescendo of ""What I Have Left"", where Bones' harried strums are slowly matched up with a rush of piano and strings and rolling drums, is by far the disc's musical highlight. It's followed by the woozy violin-led torpor of ""Much More Than Love"", the one song that comes closest to fitting Bones' lyrical and vocal bent. But as I mentioned previously, the music's not the problem here-- hit ""Mute"" on Bones the Singer, and the tracks on <i>A Fool For Everyone</i> would be more than capable of serving another vocalist's needs. If there are more Mike Bones records planned for the future, it might behoove him to focus solely on his six-string.</p></div>"|12876.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12876-a-fool-for-everyone/|5.0|David Raposa

The record made electronically attuned critics gush, but unlike a lot of supposed crossovers, you could also imagine the Boys reaching a wider indie audience: Frontman/mastermind Jeremy Greenspan and then-partner Johnny Dark learned well from their white-label heroes, while Greenspan's voice oozed a familiar strain of bedridden heartbreak.</p>
<p>Yet Greenspan hesitantly distanced himself from comparisons to indie heartthrobs-- perhaps that's one reason why <i>Last Exit</i> failed to find the mass collegiate audience that turned the Postal Service into the 21st-century's indie-pop/electronic hybrid of choice. Junior Boys' sophomore LP, <i>So This Is Goodbye</i>, dropped two years later with a more traditional sound rooted in classy 1980s electro-funk, trading <i>Last Exit</i>'s pinprick jolts of joy for the languid sadness of guys in sharp suits. Commercially, it seems to have been a canny move; a Carl Craig remix of ""Like a Child"" even brought an improbable Grammy nod. While <i>So This Is Goodbye</i> hardly troubled the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100, it (deservedly) received some of the attention denied the acclaimed but under-heard <i>Last Exit</i>.</p>
<p>Listening to the new <i>Begone Dull Care</i>, it seems the more straightforward synthetic soul of <i>So This Is Goodbye</i> will remain the Boys' template for the foreseeable future. Lush, sometimes to the point of textural overload, <i>Begone</i> is audibly the work of band that's now been honing its chops for a decade. Whatever its budget, the album definitely <i>sounds</i> like the product of million-dollar multi-tracking. That's helpful when you're referencing an era where even cheap keyboards could put a dent in the fattest bankroll. And listeners might also need to cash-in their pocket change for some swank studio gear if they want to fully enjoy Greenspan and partner Matt Didemus' delicately fussed-over handclaps and scissored vox and lugubrious call-and-response synths.</p>
<p>That's not to totally discount the duo's talent as tunesmiths-- even if ""Hazel"" is the only thing here that might survive being thrown to the wolves of pop radio-- but sometimes Greenspan and Didemus' attention to detail is the only thing that redeems the album's occasionally sketchy songwriting. At <i>Begone</i>'s weakest, the tracks could be easily dismissed as slickly assembled bouts of pre- and post-rave deja vu. The Tangerine-ian arpeggiated bass-synth pattern on ""Work"" is played-out, almost shtick-y, though the bell-like melody adds an eerie touch. But this slightly unexpected nod to old-school bleep techno bleakness, and Greenspan's latest turn as breathy dude-diva, isn't quite enough to sell a six-minute song to anyone but über-fans or audiophiles. Since I'm not much of an audiophile, but did consider myself an über-fan, I kept waiting for ""Work"" (and several other songs) to punch something other than my nostalgia switch. In vain, as it turned out.</p>
<p>So what's <i>Begone</i>'s draw, especially for those of us who fell in love with the affecting future-funk experiments of the Boys' early work? Well as mentioned above, it <i>is</i> hard not to marvel at how assured the Boys have grown as producers. The album's best tunes, like ""Bits and Pieces"", retain the mix of ennui and ebullience that marked early singles like ""Birthday"", but with minimalist restraint traded for so many perfectly placed period touches that you may have trouble picking out your favorite bit: Maybe it's the little glitch-hiccup breakdown? Or the saxophone that slides in mid-track from soft-rock central casting? If <i>Begone</i> is repeat-play worthy, and I'd argue it is, it might be down to the Boys' ever-growing skill as arrangers. (""Bits and Pieces"" combines maybe a dozen compositional elements without coming off like a claustrophobic cut-and-paste exercise.) And they're not averse to the occasional sonic curveball. (Is that a banjo on the whimsical ""Dull To Pause""?) Plus for all my grousing, it's hard to deny that the album's high-gloss shine can occasionally be seductive in its own right, at least if you've got love for a certain brand of glitz.</p>
<p>Which leads to my nagging worry about the trajectory the Boys seem to be following. The weaker tunes on <i>Last Exit</i> were carried by the incongruity of their component parts; you overlooked an undercooked melody, say, because the band had come up with such a compelling and unexpected hybrid. As Greenspan and Didemus have settled into a classicist groove, they're running a risk well-known to their mid-80s influences. It was a short trip from well-produced woe into camp sterility, and well-regarded uptown aesthetes like the Blue Nile were always only a mixing board misstep from guys peddling digitized woodwinds for cocktail loungers. So when I call <i>Begone Dull Care</i> a ""mature"" album, know it skirts both the positive and negative connotations of one of the most divisive adjectives in pop's lexicon.</p></div>"|12896.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12896-begone-dull-care/|7.5|Jess Harvell

In 2003, London-born, Greek-descended folkie  Helena Costas struck up a transatlantic correspondence with New York-based  beat-sculptor Danger Mouse-- well before <i>The Grey Album</i> made him internet-famous  and ""Crazy"" cemented his reputation as a producer with a deep knowledge  of pop's usable past. They planned to collaborate eventually, and  six years later, they finally have: <i>The Last Laugh</i>, another hyped  project for him but a debut for her-- is their first album under the  Joker's Daughter moniker, which is based on one of Costas' many  revolving stage names.</p>
<p>Costas and Danger Mouse are, to say  the least, an unlikely pair. They inhabit vastly different realms, the  rift between which gapes wider than the Atlantic. Danger Mouse is a  studio musician, his music created indoors, while Costas' music  sounds so bucolic as to be almost pagan. A few years ago, we might have  labeled her freak folk, but that designation seems meaningless these  days and misleading in her case. Comparisons to Joanna Newsom and Marissa  Nadler will be inevitable, but Costas places herself squarely in the  British folk tradition, harking back to Fotheringay, Pentangle, Vashti  Bunyan, and Fairport Convention at their most folk and least rock. It's  no small wonder that she would write about talking owls or King Arthur  appearing to her during a walk in the country. Her world appears too  caught up in the past to make room for contemporary beats and techniques,  while Mouse doesn't seem the type to truck with odes to smiling dragonflies.  And yet, the unlikelihood of their collaboration makes <i>The Last Laugh</i> at the very least a curio: Don't you want to know how these two sound  together?</p>
<p>They sound like a spacey pastoral,  a shroom trip along Hadrian's Wall. With contributions ranging from  subliminal to unmistakable, Danger Mouse makes Costas' beatific folk  sound even more beatific, more folksy-- kaleidoscopic, storybookish-- while  she gives him a whimsical framework on which to hang his samples, beats,  and synths. For Costas, this is a walk along familiar glens; for Danger  Mouse, it's a sojourn to the exotic countryside. Rather than infuse  her songs with his own signature sounds, he approaches the project less  like a producer and more like a backing band. Nevertheless, he gets  to cut loose a little more here than he did on higher-profile collaborations  with the Black Keys and Beck.</p>
<p>His playful production defines the  instrumental ""Chasing Ticking Crocodile"" and the bouncy ""The Bull  Bites Back"" almost completely, but to ""JD Folk Blues"" he adds  only a subtle thudding bass and a rambling keys solo to make it sound  both <i>Bryter</i>-er and <i>Layter</i>-er. The title track burbles  with ominous synth cascades and racing sitar riffs, while squelchy beats  drive stand-out ""Lucid"", reinforcing Costas' lilting melody and  excitable chorus. Opener ""Worm's Head"" gets what sounds like a  live band (including Neutral Milk Hotel bass player Scott Spillane),  ""Jelly Belly"" is fitted with a jaunty carnival-reggae beat that  almost OD's on Ren Fest, and ""The Running Goblin"" treads on an  oompah bass line and a nervously whistled theme.</p>
<p>In general, there's more Costas on <i> The Last Laugh</i> than Danger Mouse, and she proves a charming guide  along these crags and gullies. Her voice, airy and textured, ranges  from whispery intimations to impish collusions, although her lyrics,  which are capable of impressive wordplay, too often threaten to oversell  the fantastical imagery. ""Where has July gone?"" she asks on ""Cake  and July"". ""Is it under my pillow?"" And yet, such fancies, though  perhaps too tweedily twee on their own, make Danger Mouse's contributions  all the more fitting-- not only demanding the animation of his production,  but providing a whimsical contrast to his exacting techniques. As the  Joker's Daughter, Costas and Mouse are interested in marrying organic  and synthetic sounds, not in contrasting them. The resulting album may  be steeped in British folk history, yet the pair still finds room to  play around with those sounds and traditions. The result is a sparkling  debut for her and one of his most interesting collaborations.</p></div>"|12868.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12868-the-last-laugh/|7.3|Stephen M. Deusner

The hazy thickness of the record feels like a fever dream of blaxploitation funk, the kind of sound your reptilian memory bank automatically associates with Quentin Tarantino soundtracks. There is nothing academic about any of this, however. Where many live funk groups see their best efforts wilted by a certain ""earnest conservatory student"" vibe, Baby Charles effortlessly summon the sort of unholy, sweat-in-uncomfortable-places funkiness you probably thought hadn't survived past 1978.</p>
<p>A big part of this is due to their looseness. Baby Charles have an intuitive feel for the sweet spot of funk, pitched between the broad and the obsessively narrowed-down, and once they hit this magic pocket, they never stray far. Each groove is a monstrous, dopamine-flooding marvel, with peals of Hammond organ firing behind low, hard blues-guitar licks and a horn section unafraid to let things get a little messy. Dionne Charles' full-throated soul howl is what puts everything over the top-- her wail fits perfectly into the generous space the band clears out for it but never takes center stage. Nobody stands out too much or gets in anyone else's way, which means every single groove surges forward with pulverizing force.</p>
<p>Indeed, sometimes things get so monolithic that  <i> Baby Charles </i> starts to resemble a different kind of 70s record. ""Life's Begun"" is powered by a guitar riff that could be sent directly to  <i> Black Sabbath, Vol. 4</i>, while the drummer works a circling battering ram of percussion that recalls ""Manic Depression"" as much as the Meters. Charles dispenses generic soul-mama wisdom-- ""Don't be keeping up with those Joneses,"" she warns-- but her growl is so hair-raising that words are rendered irrelevant. ""Coming From a Higher Place"" dispenses with lyrics entirely, opening a blasting, horn-and-flutes fanfare before segueing into a manic organ chug. This album begs to be sampled by enterprising hip-hop producers-- there are dozens of potential Just Blaze tracks here, for example-- and a big part of the fun is closing your eyes and imagining which rappers could flatten which beats. Wale high-stepping over ""Step On""! Bun B punishing the huge empty spaces on ""Life's Begun""! Nas brooding over the smoky ""This Time""!</p>
<p>Baby Charles also cover the Arctic Monkeys' ""I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor"", and they find an easy slinkiness in the groove that feels right for Alex Turner's sidelong, cutting observations. The fact that they also find room for a funky trombone solo and make it back to the chorus without getting lost is testament to their discipline and control, and is more proof that off of the strength of their first album, Baby Charles belong with Sharon Jones and the Dap-Kings and precious few others in a discussion of modern funk bands that feel like something other than a pallid imitation.</p></div>"|12740.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12740-baby-charles/|7.3|Jayson Greene

It's like buying a new pair of sneakers  and getting the urge to go for a run, even if you're not normally inclined  to do such a thing-- the music creates a demand for its own use, and  you start anticipating your first opportunity to hear it under perfect  conditions.</p>
<p>There is nothing original or novel  about Telekinesis' music, but somewhat counterintuitively, its by-the-books  professionalism is what makes it so effective. Every song  on the record feels instantly familiar, with easygoing power-pop hooks casually  triggering positive responses. The 31-minute album feels like a sustained moment of déjà vu, with music that  echoes feelings and sounds by the Shins, Fountains of Wayne,  Sloan, Death Cab For Cutie, Superchunk, Matthew Sweet, and Teenage Fanclub  without directly lifting from anyone in particular. Well, that is, with  the exception of a guitar part on the mid-album highlight ""Imaginary  Friend"" that clearly recalls Joey Santiago's shimmery lead on the  Pixies classic ""Here Comes Your Man"", but that is hardly a  complaint.</p>
<p>As much as its songs can fit comfortably  in the background, several tracks on <i>Telekinesis!</i> reward closer  attention. ""Tokyo"", a perky rocker about having dreams so  vivid they feel like actual memories, stands out as a prime example of songwriter  Michael Benjamin Lerner's gift for conveying a feeling of relaxed urgency.  ""Look to the East"" and ""All of a Sudden"" have a  similar kind of carefree velocity, careening headlong in the direction  of nowhere in particular. When he's not trading on momentum, Lerner  is successful in writing cutesy nostalgic tunes like ""Awkward Kisser"", but stumbles slightly when he attempts acoustic balladry in the vein  of Elliott Smith, as on the anticlimactic finale ""I Saw Lightning""  and the limp album-opener ""Rust"", neither of which flatter  his strengths as a writer, and only serve to highlight his thin, nondescript  singing voice. The softer bits are more powerful when they lead up to  a power-chord catharsis, particularly in ""Coast of Carolina"", which seamlessly shifts from a lo-fi intro to a crisp radio-ready chorus.</p>
<p>Even though their music is charming  and enjoyable, <i>Telekinesis!</i> is ultimately a generic album, though  that's not a slam. Think of  it this way: If power-pop groups were pizza joints, bands like Weezer,  Big Star, and the New Pornographers would be the world-famous, critically  beloved restaurants with impeccable craft and unmistakable style, sorta  like Frank Pepe's in New Haven, or Di Fara in the outer reaches of Brooklyn.  Telekinesis, like many other good-but-not-great indie bands, are more  like unpretentious neighborhood parlors that provide predictable but  perfectly tasty slices with a minimum of fuss. They're certainly much,  much better than what's on offer from the big corporate chains, and  are often capable of delivering a product that is just as satisfying  as their more upscale competitors.</p></div>"|12882.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12882-telekinesis/|6.3|Matthew Perpetua

Too bad. They've been exploring head-scratching, creatively fucked-up time signatures and sideways guitar shenanigans for 20 years now, leaving a pronounced influence on the Windy City's art-rock scene. Their playful musical approach is a ripe aesthetic of absurdist humor: Live shows are infamously strange and sometimes audience-provoking, featuring an assortment of Fluxus mind-fuckery.</p>
<p>Over the years, band leader/multi-instrumentalist Thymme (pronounced ""Tim"") Jones  has grown his band's adventurous sound from schizoid metallic post-rock (in the vein of scene brethren Rapeman, Shorty, or Don Caballero) to a higher-brow variety of avant-rock that covers ground as diverse as falsetto vocal vignettes, orchestral dissonant horn lines, Van Dyke Parks-ian rainy-day pop, cubist piano compositions, ambient cinematic excursions, noise collages, free-form freakouts, and every kind of noodle-y and angular guitar manifestation possible. Fittingly Jones has been involved with several side projects with Jim O'Rourke (Brice-Glase, Yona Kit).</p>
<p>If 1997's  <i> Enduring the American Dream </i> served as Cheer's first ambitious (and quite successful) synthesis of post-rock, krautrock, orchestral pop, and minimalist classical influences, their new  <i> Fear Draws Misfortune </i> is the fuller realization of those initial experiments. Except that  <i> Fear </i> is their unequivocal prog with a capital ""P"" record. Perhaps Thymme himself could better introduce the album: ""I'm talking time signatures, classical music references, I'm talking lots of  keyboards... I'm talking five keyboards at once, I make Rick Wakeman look humble."" That encapsulation is a quote from a skit several year's back from Jones' long-running cable access show  <i> ""</i>Cool Clown Ground""<i> </i> where he's been known to spend an entire 30-minute episode playing Scrabble with his friends, shaking maracas, or sitting around looking into the camera making sure that nothing much ever happens. Thankfully, Cheer-Accident's music is the antithesis, being in constant melodic and dynamic motion.</p>
<p>I'm not sure how the writing process goes down. But considering how integral the fluid polyrhythmic krautrock-fawning drums are, as well as the meandering horn-lines and the crystalline, almost Jon Anderson-like lead vocals-- all handled by mathlete multi-instrumentalist Jones-- a comparison to French drummer/prog god, Christian Vander's Magma, is fitting. Much like Magma,  <i> Fear</i>'s cornucopia of interweaving keyboard lines and Fripp-ian six-string squiggles frequently ascend into cosmic-choral singing. When you mix the juiciest sounding bits from abacus-rockers like This Heat, Henry Cow, Magma, King Crimson, and Yes-- which this CD most definitely does-- you get a prog-rock geek's wet dream. A key influence is the guest appearance of Carla Kihlstedt of Sleepytime Gorilla Museum that adds a nice feminine flourish, frequently evoking her band's ever-shifting operatic creepiness.</p></div>"|12784.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12784-fear-draws-misfortune/|6.8|D.

He's been saying this for years, but it took the band a while before that joy was being communicated to large audience and being reciprocated. Despite two wordy and whip-smart records, the band didn't fully hit its stride as performers until recent years. Around the time Finn started writing more choruses and singing more often than speaking his way through his songs, the rest of the Hold Steady became a live force as well, and the boozy, redemptive joy Finn was always going on about became not only believable but downright infectious.</p>
<p>Weirdly, however, that infectiousness is a hard thing to document-- recorded on Halloween night 2007 at Chicago's Metro, live album <i>A Positive Rage</i> feels like a blurry Polaroid, a flat reminder of what was probably a pretty good time. Granted, very few live records even get <i>that</i> far. The record captures the band on both a victory lap for 2006's <i>Boys and Girls in America</i> and as it takes an opportunity to road-test material from an album that wouldn't be out until the following summer-- an exciting night for hardcore fans, who'd managed to fill the place two nights in a row. But the linchpins of a typical Hold Steady set, the fist-pumpers and drink-lifters, won't be converting anyone on this recording. Guitar-heavy highlights like ""Stuck Between Stations"", ""The Swish"", or ""Chips Ahoy"" rush past the ears in a Doppler-like whoosh.</p>
<p>The setlist for this Halloween night show is a saving grace for the record. It's good to hear rarities like ""You Gotta Dance (With Who You Came With)"" or ""Girls Like Status"", as well as ""Ask Her For Adderall"", a hidden <i>Stay Positive</i> track that eclipses most of the rest of that record. It's even better to hear deep cuts like ""Same Kooks"" or ""Barfruit Blues"". It's here that the band can stretch out, the rhythm section can assert themselves a bit more, and some of the spontaneity of a live show is more evident. When Finn gets around to the second verse of ""Barfruit Blues"", he's alternating between hoarse shouting and a girly falsetto before the barroom piano riff barrels in. He even injects some excitement into the somber ""Citrus"": When he sings about citrus and liquor ""coming together"" for the second time, he slips into an almost uncomfortably lusty roar. There's at least a few moments here where you can hear how much the band was enjoying themselves.</p>
<p><span>Even as a fan-targeted release, there are opportunities missed in making this a more considerate package. The liner notes consist of contact sheet-style photos and a journal-like tour summary from Finn, while the accompanying DVD seems more like a video résumé than a supplement to the record. While there are a few full-song performances (including ""Chips Ahoy"" from an earlier performance at Metro), it's mostly cobbled together from crowd testimonials, interview clips, and the band offering weak platitudes in between talking sold-out shows and digital sales. Guitarist Tad Kubler gets interviewed about the band's live presence, saying, ""If we can get someone in front of us, it's a done deal."" The Hold Steady are taking the success they chart here and asserting themselves a must-see live act, for any audience. More power to them-- but <i>A Positive Rage</i> isn't much of an opening gambit. It's a memento for the fans, for better or for worse. But if you were too loaded on Halloween 2007 to remember much from this show, maybe this is the album for you.</span></p></div>"|12895.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12895-a-positive-rage/|6.0|Jason Crock

The title she ended up with, she remarked  in a 1996 interview, ended up working just as well: ""<i>Trailer Park</i> conjures up the same kind of filmic American images, images of transience  and dislocation... and funnily enough, when we shot the video for the  first single (in an <i>actual</i> trailer park)... I had all these odd,  rather desperate people coming up and giving me their entire life-stories  in a second. Even though I didn't want them to.""  That image of Orton-- pitched  as a new brand of British folkie-- shooing away actual ""folk"" while  frou-frouing up their surroundings to sell to upmarket downtempo audiences, is a good one to accompany <i>Trailer Park</i>.  Certainly  much more appropriate than the cover image they decided on: Orton in  Chucks, for some reason plopped down in a parking lot.</p>
<p>The disconnect between how Beth Orton  was pitched to us and the way her music actually <i>sounded</i> was  as vast as the barren landscape she fetishized.  Instead of a lonesome  troubadour traversing the desolate American West from carpark to carpark,  Orton was a Norwich-born theatre chick who found herself in the midst  of a rapidly-changing mid-90s UK pop scene.  William Orbit spotted  her in a theatre production and tabbed her to lend her plush, lonesome vocals  to the opening track of the third iteration of his <i>Strange Cargo</i> series in 1993 (he'd also produce the since-disowned Japanese-only <i> Superpinkymandy</i>, technically her solo debut).  From there,  Orton fell in with an even higher-profile crowd: After closing out the  Chemical Brothers' game-changing 1995 debut on ""Alive Alone"", she was scooped up by Tom and Ed's buddy Jeff Barrett, and his Heavenly  imprint (at the time, most known for Saint Etienne and Manic Street Preachers)  set about casting Orton in her first starring role.</p>
<p>While so many of the supporting cast  has faded from immediate memory, <i>Trailer Park</i> holds up surprisingly  well, and the remastered tracks still reward headphone scrutiny.   Even more than a decade later, ""She Cries Your Name"" still sounds  great, with Orbit's luxuriously gloomy string arrangement-- especially  the way the cello's low-end signals the entrance of the chorus like  stage curtains parting-- and the deft production hands of UK electronic  scenester Andrew Weatherall and Bad Seeds' Victor Van Vugt providing  the perfect context for Orton's cozy, impressionistic Americana sketches. Twelve or so years after I dismissed it as resolutely Lilithy I'm struck  at how Orton's vocals on several of these tracks are much less Sarah McLachlan  than Zombies' Colin Blunstone, and how the best moments  of <i>Trailer Park</i> find a similar middle-ground between spooky and  reassuring.</p>
<p>Another surprise: the trip-hop rip-offs  hold up the best here, and reward the remaster the most.  Granted,  ""Tangent"" and ""Touch Me With Your Love"" wouldn't exist without  Massive Attack and Portishead, and Orton's vocals are nowhere near  the level of Shara Nelson or Beth Gibbons, but that wasn't the point,  either.  Those basslines and atmospherics (and ""Touch Me""s  spoken-word) are jazz club and coffee-shop, not Jamaican dub or hip-hop,  and Orton wasn't only safe from harm, harm isn't even a consideration  here-- she's on her way home, she's having short and happy dreams. <i> </i> ""Galaxy of Emptiness"" is still over 10 minutes long, and still hopelessly  romantic, and it still sounds as good in the background during dinner  as it does on headphones after a few glasses of wine.  Save the  spliffs for <i>Dummy </i>and <i>Blue Lines</i>.</p>
<p>But how great would it have been if  ""I Wish I Never Saw the Sunshine"", Orton's cover of the Ronettes'  wonderful, Spector-produced original, would have seen the same sort  of space-jazz reimagining, instead of the folky evisceration it got  on <i>Trailer Park</i>?  As much as the promotional campaign wanted  to pitch Orton as a hollow-box singer-songwriter, ""Sunshine"", ""Don't  Need a Reason"", and the James Taylor-esque ""Whenever"" remain the  most generic and skippable tracks.  Her Natalie Merchant side,  however, retains its rewards in ""Sugar Boy"", ""Live as You Dream"", and the adorable ""Someone's Daughter"".</p>
<p>Putting nostalgia aside,  the main question to ask of the ""Legacy Edition"" of <i>Trailer  Park</i>, as with any re-release, is why?  Aside from the obvious  ""the CD industry is dying quickly, let's squeeze every last drop  out of it,"" do you need the original, nine B-sides  and a three-song 1997 EP (all for around $22)? If my instincts are correct, anyone who's read this far has still  got the first version-- maybe it's packed away somewhere, maybe  it's hidden on purpose-- or at least selected tracks compiled on random  mixtapes.  At least for an afternoon, especially while the spring  is springing, save your cash and spend some time with the original artifacts. It just might surprise you, too.</p></div>"|12898.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12898-trailer-park-legacy-edition/|6.0|Eric Harvey

They fed the sharp-shock Rapture dance-punk of the day through about 50 layers of organically grimy Dischord history, ending up with a whirling sort of catharsis that was as fun as it was heavy. The band's personnel went like this: two drummers, two bassists, and one dude who made dying-pterodactyl squawks while thrashing out tinny, spidery almost-funk guitar riffs and doing everything he could to disrupt the thundering groove exploding all around him. Black Eyes' live shows were dank basement dance parties for the ages: furious, immediate, jarring, sweaty as all hell. And then the band recorded <i>Cough</i>, their half-assed dub experiment of a second album, and suddenly ended. They were, after all, a D.C. band, and that's what D.C. bands do.</p>
<p>Black Eyes bassist Jacob Long and squawker/guitarist Daniel Martin-McCormick make up two thirds of the San Francisco trio Mi Ami, whose existence makes me not miss Black Eyes so badly anymore. Their debut album, <i>Watersports</i>, takes the skritchety tumble of Black Eyes and stretches it out into something psychedelic, near-infinite. <i>Watersports</i> is seven songs long, and it lasts 47 minutes. Their beats don't rattle; they push and flicker and fade. <i>Watersports</i> is like the self-titled Black Eyes album calmed down and zoned out, the attempted dub of <i>Cough</i> fully developed and realized. The songs don't have verses or choruses; they're endless, mesmeric builds that flare up and then cool out again. Even at their noisiest, they maintain their mantra-like repetition.</p>
<p>Part of the secret is in the recording itself. <i>Watersports</i> sounds terrific. A couple of pre-album 12"" singles captured a similar sound, but the bass was too thin, the drums too muffled. Here, the bass is thick and supple, echoing and ringing and never losing its footing. Long's bass makes the real rhythmic bed here; Damon Palermo's drums color spaces around that metronomic bubble as often as they keep time. Martin-McCormick's voice, which could be downright annoying even when Black Eyes were at their best, still works as an agent of rupture. But even he has cooled out a bit, muttering deep in the mix rather than yowling overtop of it. His lyrics, on the rare occasions when I can understand them, seem to turn <i>Watersports</i> into a disco album about being trapped inside your own skull; other people are ""only the echo of my mind."" On his guitar, he plays Morse-code pings, letting them fall over the tracks like rain as often as it slashes through them.</p>
<p>The album comes sequenced almost like a DJ set; grooves maintain across tracks, and sometimes you don't notice immediately when one song dissolves into another. That reverb-y stretched-out quality is Mi Ami's greatest strength, one I hope they keep pushing on whatever records they do next. But you've probably already noticed that I can't help comparing this band to Black Eyes. This isn't really Mi Ami's fault, but Black Eyes were just too good, and wishing Mi Ami sounded just like them is as inevitable as wishing ""30 Rock"" was even more like ""Arrested Development"". The two ex-Black Eyes dudes in Mi Ami have some powerful magic working here, but they had even more when they just couldn't contain themselves.</p></div>"|12840.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12840-watersports/|7.9|Tom Breihan

It's taut, sensitively sequenced, and priced cheap-- about $7.50--as a download-only release; perfect for newcomers, dabblers, and people too cheap to order records from the UK.</p>
<p>Ghost Box's music is psychedelic because it takes musical forms only monks have escaped-- ad jingles, health-class film soundtracks-- and makes them sound imbalanced, smeared, disjointed. Vocal samples fried by vinyl popping drift across backdrops of 1970s-sounding synthesizers; rhythms stutter in and out of patterns; perfectly nice moments are always ruined.</p>
<p><i> Ritual and Education</i>'s rightest moments, then, are quietly wrong. The soft-focus soul of the Advisory Circle's ""Sundial"" or ""Mogadon Coffee Morning"" bypasses sex for nausea; the sample-based confetti of the Focus Group's ""Hey Let Loose Your Love"" sounds like the work of full-bore studio hacks who can't hear each other; and Belbury Poly makes muzak, an inherently anonymous style, sound eerily personal.

It's taut, sensitively sequenced, and priced cheap-- about $7.50--as a download-only release; perfect for newcomers, dabblers, and people too cheap to order records from the UK.</p>
<p>Ghost Box's music is psychedelic because it takes musical forms only monks have escaped-- ad jingles, health-class film soundtracks-- and makes them sound imbalanced, smeared, disjointed. Vocal samples fried by vinyl popping drift across backdrops of 1970s-sounding synthesizers; rhythms stutter in and out of patterns; perfectly nice moments are always ruined.</p>
<p><i> Ritual and Education</i>'s rightest moments, then, are quietly wrong.

It's probably because the  time and place might have been just about right for a shamelessly boneheaded  fusion of vaguely punkish metallic-type rock and something that you  could probably call drum'n'bass without looking entirely misguided.  I may have also been drunk, if that helps. In any case, it was a little  get-stupid diversion that seemed fun enough to file away for future  reference, to be occasionally exhumed by the odd off-road racing  video game. If it's a little dumb, eh, what's the harm?</p>
<p>But oh man, <i>Join the Q </i> is so, <i>so </i>dumb. I don't mean dumb as snob shorthand for ""catchy,  simple, and arena-sized,"" which the Qemists are sort of shooting for  and graze enough to draw blood. No, I mean the kind of dumb that results  in a bunch of musicians striking on an idea with bright but limited  shelf life, overextending that idea, and forgetting to practice a second  one. The Qemists follow the hallowed decade-plus-long tradition of post-""Firestarter""  bandwagoneers coming up with a lowest-common-denominator notion of,  to use one of the 1990s' goofiest subgenre names, ""rocktronica."" In this case, it's a flailing, smothering mutation of jungle that  doesn't trust the drums enough to haul all the momentum and feels  obliged to drown it in layers of guitars and guitar-substitute distortion.  And they only have one setting on their dial-- the one that makes  the boorish, bellowing mook jungle of Pendulum sound as nuanced and  reserved as Photek.</p>
<p>The Qemists are, at their roots,  a rock band-- at least, that's how they started. And while they  spent time moonlighting as drum'n'bass DJs after discovering the  genre sometime in its waning post-<i>Saturnz Return </i> years, they seem to have missed something in translation: they heard  140 BPM but apparently focused more on the PM than the B. The great thing  about classic jungle is that it took the dense elasticity of breaks  like ""Amen My Brother"" and ""Funky Drummer"" and found countless  ways to play around with their structures. The Qemists are more in love  with the idea of the riff, so the rhythms on <i>Join the Q </i> have the blunt-force, blind-charging momentum of a drumbeat that's  more interested in getting people to mosh instead of dance. And they're  short on variety: ""S.W.A.G."" uses a near-identical drum pattern  as ""Stompbox"". So does ""Drop Audio""; so does ""When Ur Lonely"";  so does ""On the Run""; so does ""The Perfect High"". There--  that's more than half the album. Take away the ""tense moment""  cue from a bad CGI-riddled action film that serves as the intro to ""S.W.A.G.""  and an irritating 95-second beatbox routine (""Soundface"", featuring  someone named Beardyman), and that's just about two-thirds.</p>
<p>The fact that they switch things  up a little for the other third would be a bit more encouraging if it  wasn't so clear the Qemists are out of their comfort zone. They do  manage to plow through a dippy mock-up of some of Nine Inch Nails'  more recent stuff on the Mike Patton-featuring ""Lost Weekend"", at  least for the minute and a half until they give up and go back to that  one security blanket rhythm of theirs (so I guess we're up to 3/4  now). But what they put Wiley through on the cod-dancehall ""Dem Na  Like Me"" is a damn shame-- he sounds awkward and stilted when he's  not being drowned out, the exact opposite of his comfortably-flowing  club-friendly advancement in ""Wearing My Rolex"". ""Got One Life""  is at least somewhat tolerable, thanks largely to a nice ragga-pop vocal  from MC Navigator and  a rhythm that doesn't come at you all  full-throttle in your face Xtreem Cool Ranch Doritos and shit-- mostly  because it sounds kind of like electro-house. (Funny that the one full-length  track on <i>Join the Q </i>that isn't irredeemable resembles a less-adventurous  version of a Justice outtake.) The rest is hyperactive brah-jungle that  runs on Red Bull instead of Red Stripe, a headache conduit that sees  rhythm as just a cheap, rudimentary delivery vector for joyless guitar  bludgeonings. Familiar with ""buttrock""? Here's butt'n'bass.</p></div>"|12885.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12885-join-the-q/|2.9|Nate Patrin

Antlers are a heavy and especially  loud psych-punk band, but they lack the outsider  cachet of metal or noise; their psychedelia is more shaggy than dreamy and they're not stone-rock enough to sidle up next  to, say, Black Mountain or Comets on Fire.  Then again, if there really is a crossover  album in these guys, what would it even sound like?</p>
<p>It probably wouldn't sound  like <i>Tentacles</i>.  Though far from a disappointment (and actually  something of a grower), Crystal Antlers' proper debut is, more than their EP, the sound of a band still with more potential than goods. Essentially, the band is fine-tuning and trouble-shooting its approach,  a risky move considering how many bands that didn't immediately and  immensely top their <i>EP </i>have been jettisoned, wrongfully  or rightfully.  <i>EP </i> drew its strengths from dynamics and artfully missing marks-- high point ""A Thousand Eyes"" treated genre like a park wizard hopping  between five different simultaneous chess games; now the band's sounds seem tidily compartmentalized.</p>
<p>It turns <i>Tentacles </i> into a surprisingly focused affair-- even though it contains twice as  many tracks as <i>EP, </i>it's about 15 minutes longer.  Opener  ""Painless Sleep"" features Victor  Rodriguez's skidding organ peals skipping over themselves, showing  a sense of playfulness that's unique in Crystal Antlers' line of  work.  But immediately following, ""Dust"" and ""Time Erased"",  despite their forceful rhythms, display a worrying compositional consistency  that at times feels like a crutch.  Truth be told, melody isn't  exactly the most impressive strength of singer/bassist Jonny Bell.   His strangulated wail barks out clipped fragments before slamming on  the breaks. In the context of their  whiplash live show, these sort of dynamics are thrilling and necessary; yet the sound here feels more treble-heavy and brittle, ranging  from loud to slightly louder.</p>
<p>""Andrew"" is the first break  in this template and unquestionably the most promising moment of the  record's first half.  It's not too far off the path of <i>EP's </i> bong-loaded slower numbers, but there's a surprisingly vulnerability  in Bell's wail-- ""don't let me  die all alone"" becomes one of the few intelligible lyrics on <i>Tentacles</i>. ""Until The Sun Dies, Pt.  1"" bisects <i>Tentacles </i>and augurs a surprisingly mellow side B that often relegates guitar into texture and turns organ as a lead  instrument.  It's a promising development that gives Crystal  Antlers a sound that sets them apart from their contemporaries.</p>
<p>Whether or not <i>Tentacles </i> is considered the jumping off point for a promising career or a jumping  off point for bandwagoneers, there's a weight on it that goes beyond  mere expectation: It will likely be the last new release on Touch and  Go Records.  It felt like such a great fit-- what better home for  loud, yet accessible bands that fell just shy of Sub Pop or Matador  or Merge middlebrow?  But even Crystal Antlers have a substantially  brighter outlook than that of Touch and Go, both are still in the same  place as of now, plotting the course for a future that just got muddy  more quickly than expected.</p></div>"|12847.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12847-tentacles/|6.7|Ian Cohen

People used to think MF DOOM was slacking if he only released  one album a year, but sometime after <i>The Mouse and the Mask</i>, the  dude just up and vanished. That led to about three years' worth of  fanbase-angering concerts featuring alleged impostors, theoretically planned  albums promising Ghostface collaborations or a KMD revival that never  arrived, scattered production work heavy on already-familiar <i>Special  Herbs </i>leftovers, and a remixed <i>Madvillainy </i> faux-sequel with enough good-to-great Madlib beats to make you wish  DOOM actually recorded new lyrics over them. The  last time he went this far underground, his brother had just been killed  and Elektra had booted KMD off the roster because <i>Black Bastards </i> was too controversial and uncommercial. So what could have provoked  him to lay low in the latter half of this decade right when he seemed  to be hitting critical pop-culture mass, limiting himself in recent  years to sparse guest verses and the occasional official dispatch that  he wasn't, in fact, dead?</p>
<p>I don't have the answer to  that question, but judging from the grimy, sinister lyricism displayed  on <i>Born Like This</i>, at least this much is apparent: DOOM is not  coming back just to dick around. It takes a little while to realize  this, since the album feels strangely underformed on initial listens:  A lot of tracks are one-verse quickies if they even feature DOOM at  all, there's the occasional whiff of the overfamiliar (the 500th repurposing of Dilla's ""Lightworks""; an appearance of the three-year-old  Ghostface/DOOM track ""Angelz""; a beat that samples ESG's ""UFO""),  and the whole thing's just barely over 40 minutes. But there's something  in DOOM's voice-- a focused rasp that's subtly grown slightly  more ragged and intense-- that reveals something darker and deeper  than the cartoon world in which he made himself a jocular adversary. Brak,  Japanese space monsters, and the Fantastic Four have given way here to  Charles Bukowski, whose apocalyptic ""Dinosauria, We"" gives the album  its title and acts as the intro to the pivotal cut ""Cellz"". In that  track, DOOM punctuates one of the most tightly knotted verses of his  career by making note of those who miss the deeper meaning: ""Metalface  Finster, playin' with the dirty money/ Sinister, don't know what  he sayin' but the words be funny.""</p>
<p>Yeah, <i>Born Like This </i> is still pretty funny; anyone who's amused by the kinds of strange  linguistic and lyrical parallels and internal rhymes nobody else would  think of has a good repertoire of quotable lines to draw from. But there's a stronger undercurrent of  bitterness and a downturn in comedy, some of which feels tied in to  a renewed malevolence in his villainous guise and some of which speaks  towards something more personal. ""Once sold an inbred skinhead a n----r  joke/ Plus a brand-new chrome smoker with the triggers broke,"" he spits  in ""Gazzillion Ear"", an admission that partially echoes the same  concerns that led Dave Chappelle to take himself off TV and is followed  up on fleetingly in ""Ballskin"": ""Chrome grown men doin' business  with Anglo Sax'n'em/ Lackin' swing but that banjo's so relaxin'.""</p>
<p>And the overall subject matter  can get grimier than <i>Madvillainy</i> converts are used to. ""Absolutely"" envisions a widely organized  revenge plot against the entire legal system-- from snitches to police  to judges-- where offending parties get their lattes poisoned and their  tongues ripped out. ""Rap Ambush"" compares his M.O. to an insurgent  attacking troops with guerilla tactics. And ""Batty Boyz"" features more concentrated homophobia  than damn near any hip-hop track I've heard this decade, even if it's  a little too goofy to be excessively hateful-- it's all aimed at  Superman, Batman, and Robin on some hybrid ""Rapper's Delight""/<i>Seduction  of the Innocent </i>business, though it could also be a metaphor clowning  on the ripped, shirtless-posing ""homo thug"" MCs DOOM considers adversaries.  (""Batty Boyz"" also samples a Jeff Dunham routine; between this and  the Larry the Cable Guy clips in last year's Jake One collab ""Get 'Er Done"" it's possible that DOOM has tried to tone down his comedic  streak by invoking comedians that aren't actually funny.)</p>
<p>The more time you spend with <i> Born Like This</i>, the less the flaws actually feel like flaws and  more like interesting diversions. ""Yessir"" is the track with the  ""UFO"" sample and features Raekwon going solo, but the Chef sounds  focused and fierce even if it feels like he's been beamed in from  a completely different album. ""Angelz"" isn't necessarily improved  with an added boom-clap kick to bolster its <i>Charlie's Angels </i> soundtrack loop, but hearing Ghostface and DOOM pull off abstract storytelling  raps on the same track never gets old. And on an album filled with great  production-- including four superb contributions from Jake One, Madlib  assembling some top-notch gritty, noir-caliber soul jazz ambience on  ""Absolutely"" and some of DOOM's most wide-ranging and bugged-out  production yet (dude even fucks with warped Auto-Tune and Run-DMC drum machines on ""Supervillainz"")-- the out-of-the-vaults Dilla beat turns out  to be the best. Not ""Lightworks"" (which DOOM rocks anyways), but  ""Gazzillion Ear"", which makes inspired jumps between haunted-house  soul and <i>Midnight Express </i>Moroder like it's no big deal.</p>
<p>It's  funny that <i>Born Like This </i>starts off feeling unfinished and,  a couple listens later, starts to resonate as strongly as anything he's  done since <i>Madvillainy. </i>I don't know if <i>Born Like This </i> arose from disillusionment or fatigue or something else, but whatever  caused DOOM to scale back his output and go off the grid, he's only  come back from it sharper, stronger, and more powerful than before. Villains  don't really die, they just emerge from the rubble even more determined  to make the world see their way.</p></div>"|12869.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12869-born-like-this/|8.0|Nate Patrin

Along with the warm patina of age emanating from re-mastered recordings and the cracked, yellowing photographs, these narratives are prime examples of music anthropology, thick with details that amplify each song's impact. The label exceeds its own storytelling standards with <i>Local Customs: Downriver Revival</i>, a collection of music recorded at Double U Sound, a rec room turned recording studio in suburban Detroit. The 24-track guided tour through Double U's history is paired with a detailed multimedia DVD that includes a 30-minute documentary and an interactive sound vault with over 200 extra tracks, arranged by individual boxes of tape. It not only makes most bonus DVDs look like cheap wastes of plastic and time, it lets listeners virtually walk into the lost basement studio in Ecorse, Mich., and view some of the people and places that seeped into Double U's reels of tape.</p>
<p>Proprietor Felton Williams, an unassuming Ford Motor Company electrician and member of the Church of the Living God, managed to piece together a truly DIY studio operation. While the self-taught electrical whiz's longed-for hit factory never materialized, his dedication and open-door policy unwittingly turned Double U and its small stable of labels, mostly active from 1967 to 1981, into a local music time capsule.</p>
<p>Williams' church connections and devotion to gospel weren't uncommon, but the variety of sacred music he recorded stands out. Toledo, Ohio, singer and fellow congregant Shirley Ann Lee's sweet, somber voice graces ""There's a Light"", which tests the fidelity of Felton's setup, and ""Please Accept My Prayer"", a bluesy end-of-service ode to the Lord. Mother-daughter duo the Coleman Family drop some rambling, back porch Appalachia-infected tunes and the Apostles of Music deliver a showy, funked-up version of ""Wade in the Water"". Some of the most peculiar songs, including Calvin Cooke's ""What Happens to People"", incorporate Church of the Living God's unique infatuation with the sitar and pedal steel guitar, producing an odd, wobbly twang.</p>
<p>Equally intriguing secular sounds, ranging from sunny vocal harmonies to funk workouts, also blasted out of Williams' basement, like the Organics' Hammond-flavored instrumental ""Foot Stumpin'"". The true outlier of the bunch is ""Running Mod""-- with the <i>Quadrophenia</i>-appropriate chorus ""You can't catch a running mod""-- by Young Generation, a cut-rate local garage band fronted by black singer Alan Crowell.</p>
<p>But the album is just a warm-up for the DVD's wealth of music from artists on the CD and those that didn't make the cut. After hearing jam sessions and alternate takes, a Shirley Ann Lee radio show, Felton Williams' pedal steel lessons, the Mergers' oddball organ rocker ""Unworthy Americans"", and even the disorienting sounds of deteriorating tapes, it's hard to imagine uncovering more layers to the story. The documentary includes interviews with and performances by Williams, Lee, and Cooke, who rocks the pedal steel. Footage of sunlight striking a white cross and shots of weeds cracking through the asphalt of crumbling houses make the setting almost palpable. It's one thing to hear a tape of the young Shirley Ann Lee, but to watch her older self gently sing along to a recording of ""Please Accept My Prayer"" in the front seat of a parked car, and then whisper ""thank you"" as the shot fades to black, isn't easily captured in words. <i>Downriver Revival</i> not only adds a chapter to Numero's legacy of spotlighting the art and ambitions of forgotten artists, but it lets listeners share some of that rush of discovery.</p></div>"|12812.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12812-local-customs-downriver-revival/|8.0|Patrick Sisson

Like Athens' Pylon before them, all-grrl Atlanta quartet the Coathangers are making sure the revolution will not be such a drag. On a rough 'n' rowdy self-titled 2007 debut via local label Rob's House Records, they swapped ""Suck My Left One"" for ""Nestle in My Boobies"", ""Oh Bondage, Up Yours!"" for ""Shut the Fuck Up"", hating Margaret Thatcher for sympathizing with ""Tonya Harding"". Word is their ramshackle live shows-- alongside the likes of Deerhunter, Black Lips, Jay Reatard, and, next month, Calvin Johnson-- have included loogies and My Little Pony.  Cue the premature backlash.</p>
<p>The Coathangers keep the back-alley post-punk party going strong on a scratchy, shrieky, foul-mouthed sophomore album, <i>Scramble</i>, their first for Seattle-based Suicide Squeeze. The call-and-response vocals-- split between guitarist Julia Kugel, drummer Stephanie Luke, keyboard player Candice Jones, and Meredith Franco on bass-- are shrill. The politics aren't, even though technically everything-- from their beyond Fucked Up name to their overall fuck-you we're-not-the-Donnas stance-- is kind of political. Nope, the Coathangers aren't ones to let good intentions stand in for a good time.</p>
<p>As with fellow Georgians the B-52s, their best songs play like should-be novelty hits. The Coathanger with the chirpy Snow White voice sings lead on a couple of the catchiest, including upstairs-neighbor rant ""Stop Stomp Stompin'"" and unrequited-love-at-first-sight song ""143"", both of which have enough quotidian sloganeering and goofy-but-true detail for UK shouters Art Brut. Pretty sure it's the same band member who threatens to break our ""fucking face"" on caterwauling garage-rocker ""Gettin' Mad and Pumpin' Iron"", too. But the Coathangers can also drop the tempo-- slow dancing with a dude who ""ain't no sissy"" on ""Dreamboat"", or missing a boy from outer space on keyboard-driven ""Sonic You"". There's even one for the olds: ""Arthritis Sux"". There's <i>even</i> one for tUne-YarDs: sloppy sound-effect collage ""Bobby Knows Best"".</p>
<p>Put together enough novelty hits, and you have a pretty solid album. If off-kilter percussion can't quite overcome the whispery false ending on ""Pussywillow"", or ""Time Passing"" gets a little lost up its own indecipherable sci-fi squall, there's always the scuzzy pink frost of ""Toomerhead"" (he ain't an asshole, he's just sick), or the get-off-my-back hoarseness of ""Bury Me"". Particularly given the neanderthal sexual politics of much of the current indie music scene-- looking at you, Brooklyn Vegan comments section-- it's good politics when a girl group can declare, as a deeper-voiced Coathanger does on ""Cheap Cheap"", ""You can just go fuck yourself."" It's good <i>entertainment</i> when they can make us pretend they're not talking to us-- and that's probably smarter politics, too.

The group specialize in warm, gentle songs that return a listener's affection, but do not go much further-- their music is like a reassuring embrace, but it never feels like an equivalent to kissing, or anything remotely sexual. Cuddling is out of the question too, as the record's overwhelmingly melancholy tone suggests consolation rather than romantic bliss.</p>
<p><i>Inside Your Guitar </i>runs a gamut of shoegazer and dream pop styles. The group add nothing new to pre-existing genres, but are successful in customizing familiar sounds to suit their taste for clean tones and an abundance of negative space. For example, the relatively upbeat ""Work Day"" comes across like a My Bloody Valentine song remodeled as a crisp, immaculate Phoenix track, and the lovely ""Forgotten Song"" sounds like an exaggeratedly ethereal version of Iron &amp; Wine. In other cases, the quartet hew closer to their most obvious influences. The organ-centric songs borrow the muted buzz of Electrelane and early Stereolab, and about half of the album in some way recalls the particular balance of drone, delicate melody, and catharsis found on Yo La Tengo's mid-90s albums <i>Painful</i> and <i>Electr-o-pura</i>.</p>
<p>It Hugs Back may be lacking in terms of originality, but their craft and skill is hard to deny. Even when it seems as though they are just writing Designer Imposters versions of Yo La Tengo and Electrelane songs, the results tend to measure up favorably in comparison to many actual Yo La Tengo and Electrelane recordings. Guitarist Matthew Simms is particularly gifted, most especially when he steps away from standard indie rock strumming and focuses on simple, elegantly constructed lead melodies that ring out in the near-silence of slow, ambient tracks such as ""Q"" and ""Soon"". The up-tempo numbers keep the album from feeling flat and monochromatic, but Simms' murmured vocals keep them from lifting off, dragging assertive rhythms down into a self-conscious passivity.</p>
<p>That sort of tension has the potential to be very evocative and moving, but Simms' persona is too nondescript to make it work. Whereas Yo La Tengo's Ira Kaplan and Georgia Hubley both possess distinct voices that lend character, subtext, and concrete detail to their low key vocal performances, Simms just sounds blank and faceless, and this makes it much more difficult to connect with his music on a personal level. When Hubley quietly sings a song like ""Nowhere Near"", it feels as though we are being drawn into the mysterious inner world of a specific human being. There is nothing so powerful on <i>Inside Your Guitar</i>. Even when It Hugs Back seem to hold us close, the intimacy in their music seems hollow, impersonal, and anonymous.</p></div>"|12892.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12892-inside-your-guitar/|5.2|Matthew Perpetua

After several long years of hair  metal dominance, here was a band that could jam stadium-large, texture  their sound darkly and densely, and explode the blues-rock template.  Here was a frontman with an entirely new stage presence, whose voice  strained hard for sincerity and whose songwriting expressed grave self-reckoning  without resorting to easy sentiments or self-glorifying choruses. Against  the odds-- as well as against the band's wishes, apparently-- their  debut became a phenomenon, an alt-rock figurehead as crucial as <i>Nevermind</i> in ushering in and defining the parameters for mainstream rock.  Vedder's self-doubts ran as deep as Cobain's, but he expressed them  bluntly and directly rather than poetically and obscurely. Oh and also,  he's still alive.</p>
<p>Deeply invested in the cathartic possibilities  of punk and classic rock, Pearl Jam seemingly made music as a form of  self-therapy, an idea that took hold with nearly a decade of alt-rock acts  to come. The band is routinely blamed for the self-gratifying Stone  Temple Pilots, Creeds, and Nicklebacks that followed <i>Ten</i>, but the band naturally never set out to remake rock music in its own image. Suspicious of the hedonism of  the arena rock that preceded them, Pearl Jam were a solemn band, and <i> Ten</i> sounds nothing if not entirely serious about animating Vedder's  self-doubts. At times, it's a bit overwrought (""I don't question  our existence/ I just question our modern needs""), but the earnestness  with which Vedder sang and the band played these songs belies the decade's  reputation as a period of pervasive irony. Ultimately, the 1990s wouldn't  have been so bad if Pearl Jam's followers hadn't aped their self-seriousness  so relentlessly.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, <i>Ten</i> remains impressive  and occasionally moving 18 years later, even gentrified  with a shiny reissue. The public perception of the album is watered  down thanks mainly to the excision of ""Alive"", ""Jeremy"", and  ""Even Flow"" as singles. The latter two may be the album's least  remarkable tracks: ""Jeremy"" is the most pat Freudian psychodrama  on an album full of them, and ""Evenflow"" romanticizes homelessness  as spiritually transcendent. But ""Alive"" remains potent not only  because Vedder touches on some seriously transgressive shit here (dead  fathers, hints at incest, survivor guilt), but mostly because the band  rock the hell out of that coda.</p>
<p>Today, <i>Ten</i> lives and dies by  its album tracks, and while there are a few clunkers, most are pretty  ballsy in their disdain for expectations. Granted, as a new band with  few realistic prospects for the kind of success they quickly achieved,  Pearl Jam were working with a very different set of expectations than the ones retroactively assigned to them. On songs like  ""Once"", with its insistent breakdowns, and ""Black"", with strangely  dramatic vocalizations, there's a hardscrabble dynamic that  the band would be unable to capture on subsequent releases. ""Why Go""  is ferocious in its outrage, with Vedder delivering his most pained  vocals, and Stone Gossard and Mike McCready match him on every song,  translating Vedder's howls into messy, edge-of-the-precipice solos  and paint-peeling riffs like the one that anchors ""Deep"".</p>
<p>In addition to the original album as  produced by Rick Parashar and mixed by Tim Palmer, the new reissue includes  a second disc, titled <i>Ten Redux</i>, that includes a new mix by Brendan  O'Brien. A few of these new versions appeared on 2004's best-of <i> Rearviewmirror</i>, and O'Brien, who has worked with Pearl Jam on  most of their subsequent albums, brings Vedder's ad libs to the forefront,  sharpens some of the guitar riffs, and generally cleans up the murkiness.  Sounding like 2005 rather than 1991, <i>Ten Redux</i> misses the point:  The album's murkiness was one of its chief attractions, its flawed  spontaneity feeding the songs' of-the-moment intensity. Ultimately,  these new versions have less to do with Pearl Jam's music than with  O'Brien's superfandom.</p>
<p><i>Ten Redux</i> closes with a paltry  six bonus tracks.  ""2,000 Mile Blues"" is atrocious Jimi worship,  ""Evil Little Goat"" is Vedder's best Jim Morrison impersonation,  and neither ""Breath"" (here retitled ""Breath and a Scream"") nor  ""State of Love and Trust"" sound as vital here as they did on the <i> Singles</i> soundtrack. These tracks are obviously intended not to overlap  with 2003's <i>Lost Dogs: Rarities and B-Sides</i>, but flipsides like  ""Dirty Frank"" and ""Yellow Ledbetter"" were surprisingly popular  satellites orbiting <i>Ten</i>, played often on radio stations that  didn't typically delve that deep into any artist's catalog and shouted  at concerts by fans who weren't <i>that</i> fanatic. Their absence  limits the reissue, creating an incomplete portrait of the band in its  earliest days.</p>
<p><i>Ten</i> deserved better than <i>Ten Redux</i> and the paltry bonus  tracks. Fortunately, the reissue also includes a DVD of Pearl Jam's  1992 performance on ""MTV Unplugged"". The fashions are of course dated  (nice fuzzy hat, Jeff Ament) and Vedder's stool-bound intensity can  be fairly ridiculous, but the DVD is a useful and entertaining document  of their intense live sets. Thanks to the tight rhythms of drummer Dave  Abbruzzese and bass player Ament, the songs lose little of their momentum  in this setting, which handily showcases the guitar interplay between  Gossard and McCready. But this is Vedder's show-- a live, public debut  for his idiosyncrasies. Taking the stage in a tight jacket and backwards  baseball cap, he gradually unleashes himself during the show, first  letting his hair down and then eventually losing the jacket. By show's  end, he's balancing precariously on his stool and scrawling PRO CHOICE!!!  on his arms with a Sharpie. Pearl Jam may have shunned the spotlight,  but they were born showmen.</p></div>"|12873.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12873-ten-deluxe-edition/|6.7|Stephen M. Deusner

There  was Soundway's (so far) three-part <i>Nigeria Special</i> series,  which gathered a bountiful collection of highlife, Afrobeat, funk, rock, and disco, and they followed it up with the eye-opening Sir Victor Uwaifo  compilation <i>Guitar Boy Superstar</i>. Germany's freshly-minted  Analog Africa label assembled a number of incredible highlife/funk/psych  songs from Togo and Benin under the title <i>African Scream Contest</i>,  then put together the staggering Orchestre Poly-Rhythmo de Cotonou highlight  reel <i>The Vodoun Effect: Funk and Sato from Benin's Obscure Label</i>.  And amidst all of this, Fela Kuti's son Seun reunited with his father's  band Egypt 80 to record his debut full-length <i>Many Things</i>, taking  the Afrobeat revival one step further by creating one of the genre's  best new records of the last 25 years. All that, and Strut's ceaselessly  entertaining <i>Nigeria 70: Lagos Jump</i>, too-- that's a ridiculously  bountiful collection of music.</p>
<p>But even amidst all those releases, <i> Nigeria 70: Lagos Jump </i>isn't an afterthought-- it is, after  all, the followup to one of the most crucial Afrobeat comps, 2001's <i> Nigeria 70: The Definitive Story of 1970's Funky Lagos</i>. The original <i> Nigeria 70 </i>was released four years after Fela Kuti's death and  in the midst of a renewed interest in Afrobeat-- Femi Kuti's <i>Fight  to Win </i>enlisted Mos Def and Common in a hip hop crossover bid, and  Antibalas was really starting to pick up steam-- so it served as one  of the most contextually important collections of the genre as it stood  in its original heyday. With this reissue, it still holds that status: <i> Nigeria 70 </i>assembles a potent collection of names that were already  famous among aficionados of African music (Fela; Tony Allen; King Sunny  Ade), augments them with lesser-known musicians that those aficionados  would also likely enjoy, and subsequently captures a cross-section of  Nigerian culture that covers that country's adaptations of nearly  everything that was going on in black music at the time.</p>
<p><i>Nigeria 70</i> starts with Monomono's ""Loma Da Nigbehin"", where the  groove is stepped up, the rhythm guitar emphasized, the percussion denser  yet livelier, the horn and organ solos heavier-- all developments  created in the wake of Fela's revolution in militant funk. Afrobeat  in that familiar vein is widely covered here, both inside and outside  of the Kalakuta Republic. Two of Fela's greatest Africa '70-era recordings  appear in ""Upside Down"" and ""Jeun Ko Ku (Chop 'n' Quench)"",  while Afrobeat's rhythmic architect and Africa '70 alumnus Tony Allen  is represented by his glimmering 1980 recording ""No Discrimination"".  And many of the highlights from less-famous musicians-- Peter King's  ""Shango""; Orlando Julius Ekemode's ""Alo Mi Alo""; Afro Cult  Foundation's ""The Quest""-- take Kuti's sounds and tweak them  playfully until they become a bit more concise or abstract.</p>
<p>But what makes <i>Nigeria 70 </i> particularly compelling is its sonic diversity. Anyone expecting two  and a half hours of music that sounds directly informed by Fela might  be surprised to find out just how many musicians saw his music as a  starting point than the sum of their sound. There's nods to psychedelic  rock, both heavily fuzzed-out (Ofo &amp; the Black Company's stomping,  wailing ""Allah Wakbarr"") and Deadhead-friendly mellow (BLO's eerily  beautiful reverie ""Chant to Mother Earth""). A few forays into the  late 1970s and early 80s note a disco influence that informs cuts  like Joni Haastrup's 1977 song ""Greetings"" and Shina Williams  &amp; His African Percussionists' 1984 electro-funk workout ""Agboju  Logun"" without removing their Afrobeat backbone. And if you're wondering  how Parliament-Funkadelic was received in Nigeria, William Onyeabor's  1978 anti-imperialist synthesizer opus ""Better Change Your Mind""  is an intriguing hint. You could while away some time trying to figure  out just how much or how little of it came from black music in America,  and how much of black music in America actually owed to these sounds  in the first place-- as cross-cultural development of pop music goes,  the Nigerian sound is fascinatingly tangled. And now, even after the  West African reissue glut of 2008, <i>Nigeria 70</i> still sounds illuminating.</p></div>"|12881.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12881-nigeria-70-the-definitive-story-of-1970s-funky-lagos/|8.8|Nate Patrin

Rumbling bass kicks, distressed divas, and short, snapping arpeggios characterize an album that sounds constantly under threat, usually from within. A resident DJ at Berlin's famed Berghain club, Klock has been dropping singles and remixes-- many of them on BPitch Control and the Berghain-affiliated Ostgut Ton-- since the turn of the century. <i> One</i> follows January's aptly titled<i> Before One EP</i>, a stamp of four metallic cuts that ramped up anticipation for the full-length and ensured that Ostgut Ton would remain relevant after last year's overlooked (here we sit, red-faced) Shed album and the continuation of their excellent Berghain mix series (<i>Berghain 03</i>, coming later this year, will be mixed by Len Faki).</p>
<p><i>One</i> lives up to the reputation of both Klock and Ostgut. ""Coney Island"" opens the album blasting chewy, serrated clusters of sound, quickly climbing and descending in pitch. ""OK"" sounds like a micro-house of bricks, if you'll permit a pun, an insistent bass thud and industrial claps competing with a diva's looped refrain, ""Ain't no happiness/ Ain't no sadness.""  It'd sound a little silly were it not for One's pervasive distress. ""Goodly Sin"" propels itself forward with a brisk, knee-knocking club thump, its mostly wordless vocal samples swaying like seaweed in an undercurrent. ""Grip"" pans grated hunks of space-synth between your speakers as what sounds like a miniature string section adds plasticized decadence.</p>
<p><i>One</i> alternates between quick, ornery floor-fillers and more ominous, clawing downbeat tracks. It's an old trick that's masked somewhat by Klock's deceptive use of tempo: slow numbers often begin with a quick burst of melody, while faster tracks linger before gaining momentum. ""Underneath"" quivers nervously, a few drippy synth notes the only thing that rises from its quiet midnight groove.  ""Init One"" palpitates and quivers before releasing into ""Cargo""'s aluminum-walled library.</p>
<p>Klock abandons some of his haste and propulsion during  <i> One</i>'s second half, seemingly intent on breaking his ringing tech sound against the roof of his mouth. ""Init Two"" beefs up its sibling's whispers into saturated pulses. ""Gold Rush"" moves in fits and starts, its clingy industrial jangle acting like a lure. ""Thirteen Rounds"" ekes out one last hushed kick at the end of the album after a series of bangers. The record's second half, blurry at the edges, might've benefited from one of the flush wall-rattlers left on  <i> Before One</i>. But Klock never allows one to entrench in one groove or sound. Even as the tempos slow and the textures (slightly) soften, Klock knows that his noises need not be sparse or infrequent to keep you glancing over your shoulder.</p></div>"|12803.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12803-one/|7.5|Andrew Gaerig

Cheap and tinny acoustic music should feel like something you stumbled upon, like maybe you dug it out of an old drawer or rescued it from the freebee bin in the thrift store. And then the force of the music should sparkle through the grit and hiss and distortion and make you think you understand something about the person making it. It's a romantic notion, one not necessarily based in reality. But the best music in this vein manages to convey a sense of intimacy, as if it's a one-to-one conversation between the artist and the listener.</p>
<p>That's how <i>BiRd-BrAiNs</i> feels. It's the debut album by Merrill Garbus' tUnE-yArDs (she's the lone member of the band) and it was recorded on a digital voice recorder and assembled using shareware mixing software. Garbus' primary instrument is ukulele, the tone of which is thin and trebly and lonesome, the sound you usually get from a barrel-scraping demos collection issued long after someone is dead. To this she adds her own field recordings-- the sound outside her window, a child being asked about blueberries, indistinct creaks and clatter-- along with occasional percussion that seems to consist of whatever nearby could be smacked or shaken. Some songs loop these elements into mini-epics that bring to mind an early, crude version of Juana Molina's one-woman-band aesthetic; others sound like they're being whispered around a late-night campfire burning a few tents over. The ""production"" is rough, and not always in an appealing way. The sub-demo quality's most annoying attribute is the blocky digital clipping that happens whenever the voice recorder is overloaded, which is often. So if you don't have a tolerance for cut-rate sonics-- and this isn't even the warm analog stuff-- forget about it. But if you do, the best songs on <i>BiRd-BrAiNs</i> can sneak up on you.</p>
<p>The ultimate draw is Garbus' voice, which can be husky and serious or else pitched up to make her sound like a kid humming to herself to pass the time. She's got a respectable amount of power and range, but more importantly, she sings with abandon. Take ""Sunlight"", a track that made its way around as a pre-release mp3. On it she begins low and sensual, purring the verses like a 1970s folkie about to lay down something heavy as a for-real drum kit bangs out a half-funk loop and an electric guitar scratches along. And then the song pivots and Garbus explodes into the chorus. Each successive ""I could be the sunlight in your eyes, couldn't I?"" is more desperate than the last, the frantic plea of someone who has never been seen. It's cathartic even as it leaves you hanging, the sort of song that begs for repeat plays.</p>
<p>Only one other song matches ""Sunlight"", and I'll get to it in a moment, but several others come close. ""Lions"" is both charming and creepy, halfway between a singsong schoolyard rhyme and a graveyard blues. The wordless vocalizations in the folk-hop ""Hatari"" could fairly be described as yodeling, but Garbus sells the warble with her fearlessness (here's someone who never bothered to wonder if she might be annoying people, and her boldness gives her an edge.) ""There is a natural sound that wild things make when they're bound"" is ""Hatari""'s closing line, which is a perfect description of Garbus' unhinged mode. In between the best moments are some formless stretches populated with a few decent songs that never quite fulfill their promise. Still, the time spent collecting and assembling (<i>BiRd-BrAiNs</i> was put together over two years) turned up a few things worth holding onto.</p>
<p>Like ""Fiya"", the second-to-last song, which manages to grab the best elements of everything that came before. We get a simple and pretty melody on the verses, the ""seems like it's always been around"" kind of tune Devendra Banhart wrote so effortlessly on <i>Rejoicing in the Hands</i> and <i>Niño Rojo</i>. And then there's a subtle build, where additional instruments are folded in and the clutter increases the track's intensity. The structure is a perfect match for ""Fiya""'s theme, which is about transforming extreme self-loathing into something else. ""What if my own skin makes my skin crawl?"", Garbus wonders. She concludes that a relationship's failure only makes sense if she is, in fact, ""nothing at all."" And then she moves on to singing ""You are always on my mind"" four times, toying with the canonical phrase (it almost sounds like ""<i>were</i> always on my mind"") and making it her own before finally letting loose with that ""wild thing"" sound.</p>
<p>Her amazing wail answers her earlier question: What if your own skin makes your skin crawl? Well, maybe you try and turn those feelings into something. Like, say, write and record a terrifically moving song called ""Fiya"" in your living room. You'll feel a little better. And then those of us who understand those shitty feelings can sit around and listen to ""Fiya"", and we'll feel better too. That's what the intimacy of home-recorded music is all about.</p></div>"|12851.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12851-bird-brains/|6.8|Mark Richardson

Outside of Soulja Boy, it hasn't invented a new way to create a bonafide hip-hop sensation-- though the precocious, 21-year old Charles Hamilton is among a clutch of rappers (Wale, Bishop Lamont, Kid Cudi also among them) who've parlayed their buzz into label deals, but each has found themselves in a hinterland of the most vague release strategies possible. Tellingly, it's Asher Roth's career-stoking and hopefully career-ending ""I Love College"" that stands as pretty much the only song the tangible world has heard from any of these guys.</p>
<p>But if Charles Hamilton's Interscope debut (with rumored production from Pharrell) ever does drop,  <i> The Best of the Hamiltonization Process </i> suggests that, well, it's hard to say. ""Future of rap"" accolades aside, he's more like the present-- Lil Wayne's prolificacy meets Kanye West's extroverted self-consciousness (""Please don't call me a hipster/ I'm from the heart not from the hip"") meets Lupe Fiasco's  <i> Complex</i>-jocking fashion sense.</p>
<p><i>The Best </i> is about as old-fashioned, hit pause/record as mixtapes get these days, and as a collection, you get to hear Hamilton learn on the job. He's surprisingly laconic for someone whose work ethic is his calling card, but the results are likely to resonate with anyone who's felt the urge to write on a daily basis-- at points, Hamilton is particularly inspired, more often than not when alluding to his past drug abuse or familial dischord. He doesn't get particularly specific, often coming at his subjects from asides, but ""Waterworks"" and ""Mr. Perfect"" (featuring a surprisingly effective disembody of Hoobastank's ""The Reason"") are all the more affecting for steering clear of overly maudlin closet clearing.</p>
<p>Other times, it's just production for production's sake, as with the terribly annoying (however heartfelt) porno love letter ""Lacey Duvalle"" and the single ""Brooklyn Girls"", which saddles his potential hit with the same grating ""Good Life"" flow throughout. But as chameleonic as he proves to be on the mic, he's still got a ways to go in terms of picking beats that don't overpower his rhymes and with writing hooks, i.e., the things that help listeners get through 22-track tapes. If you're wondering why a self-contained entity like Hamilton is looking to work with a dude like Skateboard P, consider how the stickiest chorus turns up on ""Windows Media Player"", where Hamilton lists his various web-based hustles like Mike Jones gone pop-up ad. And the last thing we need are rappers who think dropping Matrix raps are automatically deep and rappers who think dropping video game references are automatically clever, but on the trebly, overbearing ""Happy Ending"", Hamilton asks you either call him ""Neo"" or ""Neo Geo"" for no real good reason.</p>
<p>It's tough to say exactly what you're evaluating here:  <i> The Best </i> is somewhat defined as much by what it isn't (Hamilton's proper debut) by what it is (a somewhat haphazard sampling from nearly a dozen mixtapes and hundreds of tracks). Fair or unfair, it can be compared to Wale's fantastic  <i> Mixtape About Nothing--</i> unfair because the latter was a mixtape in name only (featuring hi-fi production, a legitimate concept, guest stars), while the former is intentionally a patchwork. But ultimately, the bigger problem revolves around a lack of scope typical of people who spend most of their days on rap message boards-- for now,  <i> The Best </i> stands up better as a primer on a formative talent than an exhibit of it.</p></div>"|12761.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12761-dj-skee-presents-the-best-of-the-hamiltonization-process/|5.9|Ian Cohen

As Chris Twomey's XTC biography <i>Chalkhills  and Children</i> recounts, Leckie wanted to get something back for the  time he'd lost waiting for the O'Hara gig.

<p>The first EP, <i>25 O'Clock</i>,  shipped on April Fools' Day 1985, and it was rumored at the time  (and official not long after) that the Dukes of Stratosphear were really  XTC-- with Partridge and Moulding as Sir John Johns and the Red Curtain,  third member David Gregory taking the <i>nom de hoax </i> Lord Cornelius Plum, and David's brother Ian-- E.I.E.I. Owen--  on drums.  But some people believed the band was real, and  that the records really had been dredged out of a warehouse after decades  of neglect.  Why not?  Not only did the Dukes stick to period  instruments and effects, not only did they wear paisley shirts and floppy felt hats to the studio,  and not only were all the silly lyrics and psychedelic excesses forgivable,  but the band is fantastically, blindly in love with its material.   And the songwriting kills.  The Dukes began as a joke, but this  joke band's two albums rank with XTC's best.</p>
<p>Quoting Partridge from definitive  source Chalkhills.org: ""The Dukes were the band we all wanted to be  in when we were at school: Purple, giggling, fuzztone, liquid, and arriving.  If you want to know where those cheap charlatans 'The Beatles',  'Pink Floyd', 'The Byrds', 'The Hollies', and 'The Beach  Boys' stole their ideas from, well just listen to this and weep.""   But even though the homages are front and center, picking out influences  is one of the dullest ways to dig these records; hearing these guys  bathe in their boyhood record collections is the chief hook, followed  by way they let their eyes bug out a little farther than on their ""proper""  albums of the time.  XTC's <i>Big Express </i> and <i>Skylarking </i>came from a working band with adult problems and  a grown-up's nostalgia; the Dukes have been like <i>way</i> out of it since  high school.</p>
<p>Still, picking out the influences on  the two Dukes of Stratosphear records is a good music nut's game.   Some are obvious: compared to Pink Floyd's subtler ""Arnold Layne"", Partridge's ""Have You Seen Jackie?"" throws a victory parade with acid-laced confetti for its crossdressing hero(ine); ""Pale and  Precious"" apes Beach Boys harmonies years before everyone in Brooklyn  was doing it.  Other references are subtler or better mashed-up,  but rarely is the source of the song the point.    You don't  have to know the Hollies to adore how perfectly Moulding crafted the  melody of ""Vanishing Girl"", or the way he bites off the high notes  on the chorus.</p>
<p>And don't let the bits of gibberish  and fluff-- like young Lily Fraser ""narrating"" <i>Psionic Sunspot</i><i>-- </i>distract from the inspired arrangements on each song, like the  backwards autoharp on ""Have You Seen Jackie?""  Or the ""banana  fingers piano"" on ""Braniac's Daughter"",  or the didg's  and fuzz pedals and sick guitars and harpsichords and drawkcab loops  and sped-up singing, and at the end of ""Mole from the Ministry""  a backward voice actually says, ""you can fuck your atom bomb."" Hey,  it was the times.</p>
<p>Although I've been mixing up both  of the albums in this review, there are marked differences between the  debut EP  and the career-ending LP.  <i>25 O'Clock </i> is more fun and more loyal to its sources; <i>Psonic Psunspot </i> has stronger songs, especially on the front half, but they're also  not far removed from proper XTC material.  (On Partridge's late-80s  demo cassette, <i>Jules Verne's Sketchbook</i>, the demo for ""Little  Lighthouse"" ain't the weirdest thing to come out of his home studio.)  <i> 25 O'Clock </i>is quick and sneaky; <i>Psonic </i> is wilder, but ""The Affiliated"" wanders , with the Latin section  arguably the weirdest thing on the whole set.</p>
<p>The new reissues of each album add  several demo recordings for value.  Partridge's 80s demos  are often essential; they mark the final resting place of some of the  best material of his career.  But these cuts aren't examples.   ""Nicely Nicely Jane"" is barely a sketch of a song about a murderous  girl, and ""Susan Revolving"" has a solid melody but falls in the  ""too early to tell"" category.  The discs also include the demos  for most of the album tracks, and some of them are a surprise, like  Partridge's ramshackle jam through ""Bike Ride to the Moon"" or  the sewer nightmare guitar solo that leads us out of ""Little Lighthouse""-- not to mention Moulding's space-funk first draft of ""What in  the World??""</p>
<p>The Dukes never gave a big, dramatic  reason for breaking up.  (Neither did XTC.)  They just hung  up their axes after <i>Psonic </i>Psunspot, shelving a concept for a  rock opera called <i>The Great Royal Jelly Scandal</i>.  But they  did get in one reunion: the reissue of <i>25 O'Clock </i> includes their 2003 charity recording ""Open a Can (of Human Beans)"",  which pays tribute to nothing more obviously than 90s-era XTC.   And it sounds oh so unfortunately grown-up.</p>

In the case of Britain's late-1980s/early-90s shoegazer scene, Swervedriver had the unfortunate distinction of being one of those bands. Forged in the same Oxford milieu that produced Ride and Radiohead, they were positioned under the shoegaze umbrella because of their sound, not their attitude. While many bands operating in similar territory earned the title by literally standing on stage staring at the floor (which was covered in guitar pedals) and letting their lyrics get swept away in the texture of the music, Swervedriver projected a tougher image, drawing their name and much of their lyrical imagery from American car culture and films. If their counterparts were about capturing the look of a vapor trail in their guitar tones, Swervedriver's Adam Franklin and Jimmy Hartridge were more about simulating the rocket ride that produced the trail in the first place. They sounded great on a car stereo.</p>
<p>Because of this, they were much better equipped to make it big in the U.S. than peers like Ride, Slowdive, Chapterhouse, and even My Bloody Valentine; for all the usual boring reasons (label trouble, lineup instability), it didn't pan out that way. They released four albums, only three of which came out stateside, and filled in the space around them with a shelf's worth of EPs and 7""s before hanging it up-- temporarily, as it turned out-- in 1999. Their first two albums, <i>Raise</i> and <i>Mezcal Head</i>, languished out of print for years before BMG resurrected them last year, and Hi-Speed Soul is giving them a second run in America with a slightly expanded tracklist.</p>
<p>1991's <i>Raise</i> was a quality debut, and it's dated surprisingly well. The muscular, scorching guitars are the heart of the album, and they still bring the noise like nobody's business. The big distortion and interlocking riffs give most of the album a dense, bright sound with a lot of punch. ""Son of Mustang Ford"" rumbles like the car it's named for, ""Rave Down"" launches into hyperspace after three minutes of tense, grungy crunching, and ""Sunset"" pulls back a bit, layering cleaner guitars than usual over a bubbling bassline and unison vocals. While the band had already perfected its sonic punch, the songwriting was a bit of a work in progress. Outside of ""Sunset"", <i>Raise</i> is somewhat wanting for sharp vocal melodies, with Franklin and Hartridge trading off deadpan intonations.</p>
<p>Two years later, on <i>Mezcal Head</i>, the songs caught up to the guitars. ""For Seeking Heat"", ""Girl on a Motorbike"", ""You Find It Everywhere"", and ""Blowin' Cool"" weave laser-guided melodies through tangles of distortion-drenched guitar. The band lost its original rhythm section between albums, but new drummer Jez Hindmarsh absolutely crushes his kit, matching the intensity of the guitar maelstrom. ""Last Train to Satansville"" is the height of alt-rock badassery, opening with the brilliant couplet ""'You look like you've been losing sleep,' said the stranger on a train/ I fixed him with an ice-cold stare and said, 'I've been having those dreams again.'"" The sentiment is backed up with a monster guitar riff and chunky rhythm, and if I had to pick just one Swervedriver song to introduce the band, that'd be it. Just as every movement has overlooked artists, every movement has lost classics, and <i>Mezcal Head</i> really is the lost classic of the shoegaze movement, visceral but tuneful, and perhaps the nearest simulation of a rocket launch recorded in the 90s.</p>
<p>The reissues each add four period bonus tracks, which seem more or less to be a random selection from over a dozen available EP and 7"" offerings. <i>Mezcal Head</i> drops the 12-minute ""Never Lose That Feeling/Never Learn"" meltdown that closed the original U.S. version of the album, replacing it with the shorter EP version of ""Never Lose That Feeling"". Overall, it's high-quality stuff-- especially <i>Raise</i> bonus ""Andalucia""-- but it won't give a collector any closure, especially given that one of the passed-over tracks is the wicked, steel guitar-soaked headrush ""Scrawl &amp; Scream"", from 1991's <i>Reel to Real</i> EP. Castle Music's <i>Juggernaut Rides </i>compilation remains the best source for Swervedriver's rarities. For an introduction to the band, though, <i>Mezcal Head</i> can't be beat, and it's great to have it and <i>Raise</i> available again. If you missed them the first time or simply weren't around to hear them, Swervedriver is worth the trip back in time.</p></div>"|12846.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12846-raise-mezcal-head/|7.3|Joe Tangari

Their one and only album, the extraordinary  <i> Desert Doughnuts</i>, featured layer upon layer of heady, rich landscapes and cryptic imagery, while maintaining an intangible, almost magical presence that ultimately set the record apart as something special and original.</p>
<p>Now that Metallic Falcons are on hiatus, Baim is concentrating on her own solo material. For her second album,  <i> Laughing Boy</i>, New York-based Baim gathered a cast of Chicago indie all-stars, including 90 Day Men's Rob Lowe, artist Rose Lazar, and members of Pit er Pat. It's a smart move-- although Baim has a strong, haunting presence as a songwriter, it is her collaboration with these other distinctive musical personalities that keeps the album moving. One suspects this group interplay leads these songs in their most surprising directions, through the constant introduction of different ideas, styles, and approaches to composition.</p>
<p>You get the feeling that while the basic blueprint of the songs may have been in place from the start, <i>Laughing Boy</i> is predominantly created out of Baim and co.'s spontaneous jams. There's a charming clumsiness about this album-- its intentionally playful, spur-of-the-moment melodies create an expressive, mysterious atmosphere that always comes to a close at just the right moment. Fuego's drumming, usually in a creative wrestle against the downbeat, and Lowe's sinewy bass lines give backbone to her adventurous vocal patterns, congas, handclaps, and string arrangements, which peek in and out of the songs with natural fluidity and provide a wonderful vessel for her abstract lyrics.</p>
<p>Even without that help, Baim has a mesmerizing, velvety voice that dips and soars in accordance to her atypical phrasing, and at times it sounds as though she's singing a lullaby straight into your ear. On <i> Laughing Boy</i>, her vocals almost have a 1960s lounge vibe-- though inevitably much darker, riddled with ambiguous spookiness. She pairs up with other vocalists on the a cappella cover of Jim Morrisson's ""Bird of Prey"" and ""He Turned My Mind Around"", experimenting further with the loose song structures that make up the bulk of the album. From the brief rush of bells on ""Maths on Fire"" to the echo of breathy resonance on ""The Whistler"", it's both clear that Baim isn't afraid to slip unusual interludes between her psychedelic improvisations, and that her mix of the familiar and the unexpected is a winning combination.</p></div>"|12800.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12800-laughing-boy/|7.2|Mia Clarke

So reliable, so consistent, you could almost set your watch  to the darn thing. Every year, it shows up around the same time with  those same Photoshopped flowers. It features the same loose collection  of artists (Klimek's back!) who share the same central aim: to rub  some ointment on your post-winter blues with the gentle drifts and glides  fans of the series have come to expect. The comp is rarely astounding  and at the same time, never really disappointing. With a few minor tweaks  to their time-tested formula and a couple fresh faces onboard, Kompakt's  2009 installment of its annual ambient-techno roundup is no different.</p>
<p>As he's done in the past,  label head Wolfgang Voigt serves as the set's curator. Perhaps encouraged  by the warm reception to his (excellent) <i>Nah Und Fern</i> boxset  from last year, the Gas mastermind also contributes a handful of new  songs to <i>PA09</i>. Sadly they're not his finest. Under his Mint  moniker, Voigt presents ""Hindemith"", a relatively ho-hum concoction  of spare piano, horns, and his signature vapor-like hiss. He teams up  with longtime pal Jörg Burger for a pair of tracks: a pleasant but  mostly forgettable remix of Jürgen Paape's ""Ausklang"" and  ""Frieden"", a Burger/Voigt original that's easily the best of his  three offerings. With deep basslines and active, echoing synths, it's  equally soothing and dynamic, just what you want out of a <i>Pop Ambient</i> cut.</p>
<p>In addition to <i>PA</i> mainstays  such as Andrew Thomas, Voigt and co. invite some new collaborators into  the mix this year, and the album's prime cuts are split between its  veterans and rookies. Popnoname (real name Jens Uwe Beyer), a producer  who honed his skills on these compilations before venturing into solo  material, offers once such standout in ""Nightliner"". He dunks a  mild bass-guitar thump into a warm noise bath to coax an astral, floating  quality from the track; the result is a delicious dose of auditory Percocet.  Newcomers the Fun Years-- an intriguing inclusion as a guitar-based  outfit-- also manage a winner with ""I Am Speaking Through Barbara"".  A sort of post-rock/shoegaze hybrid, the song's organic textures offer  satisfying contrast to the digital sounds elsewhere.</p>
<p>Other stretches of <i>PA09</i> illustrate the series' gradual shift towards the orchestral, a trend  that has characterized the past several entries and frustrated some  longtime listeners. Such gripes are easy to understand, since a degree  of propulsion (some beats here and there) is what sets ambient techno  apart from, say, modern classical. That distinction is largely ignored  on the disc's front half, though, where Klimek opens with ""True  Enemies &amp; False Friends (Yesteryears Suite)"", a regal-sounding  brasswind piece before French composer Sylvain Chauveau drops two avant-classical  numbers-- odd additions, since Chauveau's songs are a few years old  (dating back to his 2007 <i>Nuage</i> soundtrack) and in a way represent  a style that some simply aren't looking for from <i>Pop Ambient</i>.</p>
<p>Anyone bummed by these inclusions  could claim that the abundance of non-Kompakt artists included here  points to a lack of fresh ideas from the label, and that may be the  case. Purists might even argue the venerated imprint's best days are  behind it, and, indeed, one listen to any of the four Gas LPs makes  many of <i>PA09</i>'s tracks feel minor-league by comparison. But  Voigt's interest in adjacent styles and willingness to draw from outside  his own roster suggests to me that he's still engaged in the form  and curious about what his past creations have wrought. And with a few  minor exceptions (most notably the Field in 2007), <i>Pop Ambient</i> historically hasn't been the launching pad for Kompakt's hot new  acts-- that's what the <i>Total</i> compilations are for. Instead,  the series is more of a perennial thank-you note sent to a niche fanbase.  If you've made it this far into my review, chances are you're one  of the folks who received (and appreciated) the last missive, as you  will this one and the next.</p></div>"|12864.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12864-pop-ambient-2009/|6.4|Joe Colly

Alex Lilly, backup singer for Blue Note pop-traditionalists the Bird and the Bee, has been playing her brand of supper-club chamber-pop around L.A. for the past few years, much of which is gathered here on  <i> Capades,</i> her formal LP debut. It's mannered but not quite meticulous, sometimes hammy and occasionally subversively catchy, but always precious: the name Obi Best did emerge from her shorthand for ""oh, be your best.""</p>
<p>While  <i> Capades </i> doesn't rise to the level of the RIYLs that opened this review, Lilly's update of starry-eyed-and-lovelorn-- little songs, mostly written around simple piano figures-- never get too weighty, but still manage a bit of rewarding variation. She works in two registers, mainly: first is the airy, synth-based romantic rumination. ""Blooms Like Flowers"" is a feather-light meditation on time-- the object of the song seems to have endless gardens of it. Earlier, when trying to explain another ineffable feeling in the same style, she can only say it's ""like green and white stripes."" ""Who Loves You Now"" isn't as forceful as its title might indicate (the lyric ""I'll say anything to be close to you"" underscores that). It's just an honest question asked politely amidst tinkling piano, drum machine, miniature firework sfx, and overdubbed ""doo-doo"" vocables, all of which expands into a shimmering refrain.</p>
<p>Lilly's voice is the main attraction on these songs, shifting slightly but effectively between coy low-profile and mannered theatricality. Her more direct and proactive second mode-- more in tune with an early-1990s ""Buzz Bin"" mode of punchy femininity (Letters to Cleo, anyone?)-- emphasizes these shifts well. ""What It's Not"" is buoyed by a Spoon-like left-handed piano and off-kilter rhythm before collapsing into a chorus packed with desperation and anxiety. Swinging opener ""Nothing Can Come Between Us"" sounds like the work of a teenager who's gotten really good at her piano lessons, and makes a compelling case for sticking it out in a relationship, only this time without panicking. ""It's Because of People Like You"" offsets its frustrating origin-- a mean note pinched in Lilly's wiper blade-- with a positively geeky organ and a refrain that's not necessarily going to instigate a fistfight: ""One more person tries to show me their faulty logic, god help me/ I will lend them brains to borrow.""</p>
<p>More than anything, Lilly's long-in-the-works debut shows that she's able to express adult hopes and fears with a sense of little-girl wonder and, for the most part, resist the urge to get too darling on us. The songs that don't work as well, then, are those that tend too much toward the cheek-clenchingly girly: ""Swedish Boy"" skips along like a 10-year-old with a crush on Jens Lekman, scribbling with crayons on staff paper, ""It seems to me you live in a made-up country."" ""Origami""-- with naïve lyrics like ""Paper cranes and daisies say I love you,"" and a sluggish groove in lieu of a sunny melody-- feels out of place. But coming to terms with one's childhood and learning from it is all part of growing up, right? Let's hope that a natural part of Lilly's artistic maturation involves shedding these residual bits of her youth and expanding on her far more engaging approach to adult matters.</p></div>"|12806.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12806-capades/|6.4|Eric Harvey

It's one thing to base an entire album on Herman Melville's <i>Moby Dick</i>, as the Atlanta band did on 2004's amazing <i>Leviathan</i>. But when you're making a record about a kid who experiments with astral travel and then goes through a wormhole and meets Rasputin and Rasputin enters his body to escape assassination, or <i>something</i>, you've pushed this whole thing way, way further than it needed to be pushed. I interviewed guitarist Bill Kelliher a couple of weeks back, and he sighed deeply before delving into the story, and it took him a good five minutes or so just to get through the thing. That's a bit much.</p>
<p>But it doesn't particularly matter how wound-up and excruciating the band's album concepts might be as long as their music kicks as hard as it does. Mastodon's music never really settles into a locked-in groove. Instead, it skips and dives and wanders. When the band switches up time-signatures, something it does often, it's not to show off math-rock chops; it's to rip the rug out from under you, to keep you uncomfortable. <i>Crack the Skye</i>, the band's fourth album, stays in weirdly soft midtempo churn mode more than their previous albums do, but it never lingers. Instead, it delays the gratification of the band's gigantic sunward-screaming choruses just long enough to make you wonder if they're ever coming, which makes the release that much more overwhelming when it finally arrives. ""The Czar"", a four-part, 11-minute epic that's still only the <i>second</i>-longest song on the album, gargles and fumes and lurches for nearly three minutes before launching into its first glorious steamroller riffs. This band is playing with you.</p>
<p>The seven songs on <i>Crack the Skye</i> stretch over about 50 minutes, an indulgent track-length average for any band not named Opeth. But Mastodon's odysseys never feel forced or pretentious. Even on 13-minute closer ""The Last Baron"", I never really notice the track length. Every riff and roar flows organically into the next until I'm totally lost in it; hard to imagine checking the time remaining on your iPod when things get like that. In a way, Mastodon operates something like prime-era Metallica, unleashing these huge, blistering tracks that journey over peaks and valleys and ditches and oceans before leaving you spinning. It's just that Mastodon's arsenal of weapons is different; instead of demi-classical guitar interludes and blazing twin-guitar leads and thuggish hey-hey-heys, they've got soupy quasi-jazz trundles and pigfuck distortion-explosions and quick bursts of time-honored Southern-rock melody.</p>
<p>First single ""Divinations"" ranks among the best things the band's ever done, a quick banjo intro into a juddering riff that whips and soars through a serious full-speed attack of a song with one of the biggest, most cathartic choruses in the band's career, then dissolves into a space-surf solo before ending in a deeply satisfying thud.  I just wish the band could've maintained that level of breathless intensity over the course of the full album, the way they did on <i>Leviathan</i>, still probably their best. On this one, they've broken with <i>Leviathan</i>/<i>Blood Mountain</i> producer Matt Bayles for Springsteen/Pearl Jam collaborator Brendan O'Brien. O'Brien doesn't drag them kicking and screaming onto active-rock radio or anything; this is still very much a Mastodon album, with all the blistering roar that phrase has come to imply. But this one doesn't have the expansive, suffusing grime of the previous two, and the band's churn can feel a bit stretched-thin for minutes at a time. Also, Troy Sanders and Brent Hinds are <i>singing</i> more than ever before, rather than delivering their mythologies in vein-popped grunts the way they once did. That's not a problem in itself, but Sanders and Hinds both sing in gurgly, nauseous whines that shoot for Ozzy territory but never quite get there. When they're harmonizing eerily deep in the mix, it works. When they get closer to the top, it sometimes doesn't.</p>
<p>And so the most powerful moments on <i>Crack the Skye</i> are almost always the most direct. On the title track, Neurosis' Scott Kelly shows up for a lung-busting guest-vocal, bellowing over the din of the band's complex thunder-crunch while a demonic vocodered thing screeches out a counterpoint. And near the end, Kelly growls out the most serious lyric on the whole record: ""Momma, don't let them drag her down/ Please tell Lucifer he can't have this one."" And you remember something else the band has been saying in interviews. This isn't really the band's opus about astral travel or Rasputin or whatever; it's drummer and primary lyricist Brann Dailor's attempt to wrestle with his sister Skye's way-too-early death. If he has to conjure alternate universes to get there, it's easy to see why. And even at its most prog-tastic heights of absurdity, this band's wriggling thunder never falls apart. It just punches deeper when Mastodon drop their defenses.</p></div>"|12872.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12872-crack-the-skye/|8.0|Tom Breihan

Yet despite the way Falke's remix brought out the best qualities  of his syrupy, lonesome voice, Whitest Boy (and Kings of Convenience) head Erlend Øye is most comfortable when  he's a bit subdued and quiet. And as much as massive house beats complement  his vocals, he seems most at home when his musical surroundings undergo  the same state of half-withdrawn restraint that he's in. Even in shifting  from Kings of Convenience's acoustic pastoralism to the plugged-in,  dance-friendly pop of the Whitest Boy Alive, Øye seemed like he was  aiming not for bars or nightclubs, but the headphones of people walking  down empty streets.</p>
<p>The abandoned-dancefloor atmosphere  of 2006's <i>Dreams </i>made TWBA a surprising side-project debut, but  sophomore album <i>Rules</i> expands the mood just a little-- and, in the process, the sound gets  a little more crowded. Where its predecessor let the rhythm breathe  and gave most of the attention to Øye's sleepy murmur and his loudly  echoing, desolate-sounding guitar, <i>Rules</i> pushes the beats just a bit more forward and has Øye's riffs sharing  a tighter space with Daniel Nentwig's expanded, more prominent palette  of synths and keyboards. It doesn't improve things any: With that  much more emphasis placed on the backbeat and away from that bell-like  guitar sound that made the original ""Golden Cage"" (or ""Figures""  or ""Borders"" from the debut) so haunting, the relatively upbeat moments sound a  bit more like the brusque, arch Krautfunk of recent Fujiya &amp; Miyagi.  And while it seems like it'd be a good trade-off to have a version  of <i>Lightbulbs</i> with a warmer-sounding vocalist and some actual  human emotion, emphasizing the groove only reveals that bassist Marcin  Oz and drummer Sebastian Maschat seem strangely hesitant about going  full disco.</p>
<p>As catchy as much of <i> Rules</i> is, that hesitancy brings about an imbalance  of mood; tracks like ""Keep a Secret"", ""Courage"", and ""1517"" (the latter of which sounds oddly like a cocktail-funk tweak of Daft  Punk's ""Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger"") ride on grooves that  feel like they should be livelier than the subtly muffled bass and drumbeats  that propel them, leaving the guitar to pick up the rhythmic slack.  The songs frequently fall into an odd, twitchy no-man's land between  unhurried minimalism and actual funk that the previous album was too  relaxed to stumble into, though TWBA do pull themselves together enough  for the more motorik ""Dead End"" and the slow-build faux-house crescendo  of ""Island"" to step lively for real. It's more of a problem if  you're expecting a straight-up dance album than an unassuming indie pop  album, and if all you need's a warm pulse and a taut rhythm section-- and that chiming guitar, which still rings out often  enough-- those moments are more than adequate. The points where <i> Rules</i> gets a little too mellow are where it goes from the vaguely  compelling to the preciously cloying, i.e., the tropical torpor of ""Intentions""  and the Ambien-fueled headswim of ""Rollercoaster Ride"", which does  less to evoke its lyrical conceit than it does a leisurely paddle-boat  excursion.</p>
<p>At least Øye still plays to  his strengths. To be honest, a more vigorous backbeat might undermine  much of the sentiment in <i>Rules</i> with his plaintive presence still running things, especially since whatever  loneliness that was lost with the busier production has been compensated  for lyrically. Sure, the subject matter's familiar-- infidelity  between friends in ""Gravity"", the feeling of uncommunicative isolation  in ""Island"", the difficulty of committing (""Courage"") and of  ending that commitment (""Dead End""), but Øye sings them with  a distinctly sugary melancholy that can't be mistaken for anyone else's  voice. All that worn-down, flagging energy behind it is something that  can at least be endured-- though at least the potential remixes could  be interesting.</p></div>"|12830.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12830-rules/|6.3|Nate Patrin

The pseudonym may initially evoke images of cardigan-clad musicians strumming playground-set songs, but Ålberg's music is anything but twee and naïve. Rather, the name Sissy Wish implies a combination of playfulness and wistfulness-- two qualities in good supply on Ålberg's third full-length. Originally released in Norway in 2007 and finally getting a U.S. release this spring, <i> Beauties Never Die</i> balances maturity and wonder as it takes a hard left turn away from the guitar-driven rock of the first two Sissy Wish albums. Instead, Ålberg and producer Jørgen Træn toy with computers, synths, and a few live instruments to animate these 10 inventive, diverse tracks. As such, the album shares some similarities with recent efforts by fellow Scandinavian dancing queens Annie and Sally Shapiro, but it sounds as though Ålberg has arrived at this new sound not through a well-stocked record collection or a thorough knowledge of pop history (although one expects she has both), but by giving full rein to all her personality quirks and musical curiosities.</p>
<p>Ålberg has plenty of both. Her voice is high and pinched like Karen O's or Cyndi Lauper's, and she writes wordy songs full of unexpected hooks and lengthy melodic phrases, mixing exuberant shout-outs (""Do a rockabilly dance, baby take my hand!"") with quotable insights (""It takes a lifetime to find out if someone's happy to see you every day""). Ålberg even tapdances a solo on ""Ya Ya Ya"". Bolstering her charming eccentricities is an eclecticism that makes <i>Beauties</i> wide-ranging yet surprisingly cohesive, as if its emphasis on electronics has allowed her simultaneously to indulge and to give shape to her every whim. Each song has its own distinguishing sonic gesture: DIY girl-group drums add drama to that declaration-of-dedication title, ""Milk"" breaks for a steel drum solo, and ""Do What They Say"" revolves around the shouted dancefloor decree ""Do what they say!"" Doo-wop vocals and castanets lift the jumpy chorus of closer ""Book"", which may feature the album's most infectious hook. The wide range of styles evident on <i>Beauties</i> speaks less of someone trying to re-create the music of the past than re-imagining it in her own image.</p>
<p><i>Beauties</i>, however, proves most powerful when it's most quiet. The acoustic ""Music on the Radio"" may get lost among the synth starbursts during the first few listens, but its halting, tender chorus is the album's best showcase for her vocals and the call-and-response between piano and guitar on the bridge is its most fragile moment. It's ostensibly about the intimate connection between performer and listener, but as hushed as the song sounds, Ålberg promises to dance: ""I'd rather be dead than behave after what you'll be playing today,"" she sings teasingly. What comes through most on this and every song is a strong, multifaceted personality: Ålberg may have borrowed her stage name, but on <i>Beauties</i> she comes across as wholly her own person.</p></div>"|12841.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12841-beauties-never-die/|8.0|Stephen M.

Turn on the TV in the UAE and you can watch MTV Arabia, but turn on the radio in North America and the closest you get to Cairo is ""Big Pimpin'"".</p>
<p>I don't bring this up as outcry, just context. I like ""Big Pimpin'"". Plenty. But in an idealized, all-inclusive, post-internet world, a record as diverse as Filastine's  <i> Dirty Bomb </i> would feel central, and it doesn't-- it plays deep in the margins.</p>
<p>Part of the problem-- if that's what you want to call it-- is that Filastine, a DJ and activist who spent most of his life in Seattle before relocating to Barcelona, is a self-conscious radical. Sampled voices heralding the destruction of bourgeois society and music as the weapon of the future don't sound revolutionary, they sound quaint-- the same  <b> <a href=""http://frillr.com/files/images/COMME%20DES%20GARCONS.preview.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> images of punk rock </a> </b> co-opted for H&amp;M or preserved on wall at the John Varvatos boutique on the Bowery, formerly CBGB's. Culture is a nuanced thing, and for Filastine to treat it like it isn't-- a clumsiness he avoids on  <b> <a href=""http://filastine.com/log/%20"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> his blog</a></b>-- is a little disappointing.</p>
<p>Diversity isn't Filastine's strength, it's his cross to bear. He works over contemporary dance genres-- hip-hop, spiced-up rai, funk carioca, dubstep, dancehall-- like he's running down a checklist. What he might hear as global harmony I hear as forced multiculturalism. Some of his MC choices are great-- Rabah's low-pitched Arabic, for example, fits so snugly into the rumbling ""B'talla"" that I don't have to know the language to understand the flow. Other guests feel like obligations-- Wire MC and the Japanese ECD swing for the beat on ""Hungry Ghosts"" like blindfolded kids worlds away from their piñata, and it's hard to fight the feeling that Filastine didn't edit them out because then there'd be nobody to represent Japan and the bush.</p>
<p>But Filastine's rhythmic instinct is awesome and delicate, and when he doesn't seem to be thinking too hard, he turns out hybrids so fluent they defy classification. ""Singularities"", for example, draws its beat from American hip-hop and its strings from Romani and gypsy records, but its hi-hats twist through a whole series of syncopations that don't call out any genre in particular. ""Hungry Ghosts"", which can be found unburdened by rappers on DJ /rupture's  <i> Uproot</i>, borrows from crunk and dubstep but doesn't sound like either or, thank heavens, both. The beats on ""Fitnah"" morph and contort-- it's like an object whose shape changes depending on the angle you see it from.</p>
<p>It embarrasses me to think that someone might hear  <i> Dirty Bomb </i> as an ambassador for the genres it borrows from. If you like dancehall, buy a dancehall record. If you like rap, buy a rap record. While it's nice to envision Western acceptance of non-Western music, it's nicer to imagine the universe's collective ass jiggling sympathetically to the best moments on  <i> Dirty Bomb-- </i>music so thoroughly uprooted that its traditions exist only as pivot points; fragments of sounds we know mashed together so intuitively that we barely recognize them.</p></div>"|12796.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12796-dirty-bomb/|7.0|Mike Powell

All throughout <i>Baby</i>, her second full-length release under the name Bosque Brown, she comes across like Texas' answer to Portishead vocalist Beth Gibbons, with her cold, ghostly timbre wrapped up in a strong country twang that is as intriguingly incongruent as it is limited. Though her narrow, expressive range can yield some very moving moments in individual songs, it effectively paints her into an aesthetic corner, particularly as she insists upon singing over some extremely stark arrangements. Without the sort of textural and rhythmic options available to Gibbons' collaborators in Portishead, Miller's thin, tinny vocals are forced to the center of every cut on her album, resulting in an exhaustingly uniform style and tone.</p>
<p>With only a few exceptions, Miller's songs are far better at suiting a pre-existing mood than evoking one, but that mood is somewhat hard to pin down. The record is most obviously influenced by the darker side of old-school country music, acoustic gospel, and traditional southern folk, but in its modern context, her work fits nicely alongside Cat Power, Scout Niblett, and Beth Orton. Even still, it's not easy to figure out the most ideal conditions to hear these songs. Whereas Chan Marshall's output can be divided into two basic categories-- the listen-intently-and-feel-her-pain recordings, and the music that can sit comfortably in the background during brunch-- Bosque Brown occupies the awkward no-man's land between those extremes, which has a way of making the record feel purposeless even when it communicates sincere, relatable emotions.</p>
<p>While the songs on <i>Baby</i> essentially sound the same, they are not all of equal quality. Several of the selections feel somewhat directionless and insubstantial, though the majestic march ""Oh River"" and the heartbreaking album opener ""White Dove"" have immediately ingratiating melodies that emphasize the strengths of Miller's voice. ""This Town"", a relatively upbeat tune led by simple, jaunty piano chords is another highlight, and it mercifully adds a touch of levity in the midst of an otherwise dour and bleak set of tunes.</p>
<p>It's not exactly a coincidence that the best songs on <i>Baby</i> happen to be the numbers that boast memorable instrumentation. Just over half the tracks on the album open with Miller's unaccompanied vocals, and most seem like compositions that were written<i> a cappella</i>, with guitars, pianos, and percussion added later on to fill out the sound. Left to her own devices, Miller's melodies tend to meander, but the fuller arrangements give them shape and power. ""Oh River"", the album's most successful piece, benefits greatly from dynamic drumming that gives Miller's voice a nice lift up into its chorus, allowing the entire song to crest dramatically along with her vocal part. This is a marked contrast with ""Texas Sun"", which conveys an appropriate sense of desolation but also sounds very much like a band lagging behind its singer as she goes off and does her own thing. It's difficult to listen to <i>Baby</i> without wondering if an undue amount of emphasis has been placed on the vocal performance. Too often Miller seems like a talented character actress who has somehow been cast in a lead role against type, and the very qualities that would make her charming and memorable in a smaller role become unflattering when exposed to too much spotlight.</p></div>"|12867.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12867-baby/|4.6|Matthew Perpetua

You heard Peter Bjorn and John's breakthrough single ""Young Folks""  on ""Grey's Anatomy"". You heard it on the in-house muzak system while  waiting in line to order at McDonald's. You heard it every time your  co-worker in a neighboring cubicle deigned to whistle while they worked.  But while making their unwitting entry into the North American mainstream  with 2006's <i>Writer's Block</i>, the Swedish trio of Peter Morén, Björn  Yttling, and John Eriksson used their busy interview schedule to talk up far  less populist inspirations: the minimalist post-punk of Young Marble  Giants, the rhythmic jazz of the <i>Ethiopiques</i> series, and other Other  Music-recommended curios.</p>
<p>That this follow-up album bears more  pronounced nods to PB&amp;J's left-field and international influences  could easily be interpreted as a reactionary riposte to their sudden  pop success (also known as ""pulling an <i>In Utero</i>""). But it also constitutes  a perfectly logical next step in a career that's seen the band quickly  evolve from a traditional Beatlesque retro-rock trio to adventurous  producers of cosmopolitan pop music on <i>Writer's Block</i>. The deconstructionist  ethic of <i>Living Thing</i> comes as even less of a surprise when you consider  how the band's interim activities have played to the extremities of  their sound: There was a digital-only album of texturally rich instrumentals  (last year's <i>Seaside Rock</i>) and a stripped-down acoustic solo album  from<i> de facto</i> frontman Morén, while Yttling became the go-to producer  for veteran acts looking for some extra pop polish (Primal Scream).  However, the fact that an album like <i>Living Thing</i> was to be expected  from Peter Bjorn and John doesn't make it feel like any less of a  letdown.</p>
<p>You could call <i>Living Thing</i> PB&amp;J's  companion to super-fan Kanye West's <i>808 and Heartbreaks</i>, where a deliberate  over-reliance on drum-machine beats and bleats is exploited to illustrate  the emotional unrest and stagnation conveyed in the lyrics. The tension  peaks early on with Morén's ""It Don't Move Me"", a diatribe against  sentimentalism ostensibly directed at an ex-lover (""forget photos  and letters... you don't move me no more""), but which could easily  be about his band's own ubiquity-- it can't be a coincidence that  the song plays like a virtual rewrite of ""Young Folks"" (ascending  chorus and all) but with the bongos and whistles relinquished in favor  of a hand-clapped electro-funk backing track and deep piano tones. However,  if PB&amp;J are committed to keep moving forward, they're doing so at a snail's pace-- whether it's the oversold optimism of Eriksson's twee-pop opener ""The Feeling"" or Yttling's half-baked  stoner-rock dirge ""I'm Losing My Mind"", the sense of ennui and  longing they're trying to express is all too accurately reflected  by sputtering rhythms that rarely gain any traction or momentum.</p>
<p>The skeletal production is in turn matched  by nursery-rhyme hooks that tenuously toe the line between endearingly  naïve and amateurishly underdeveloped: The shantytown chant of ""Nothing  to Worry About"" finds PB&amp;J ably adapting to a post-""Paper Planes""  pop landscape, but its clunky chorus line (""Do this thing/ This type  of thing/ Put a little money in this type of thing"") feels too self-consciously  vague to make you want to join the song's kiddie choir. Likewise, the  garish provocations of ""Lay It Down"" (""Hey, shut the  fuck up, boy/ You are starting to piss me off"") clash awkwardly with  the song's congenial snap-along sway. And when the band settles nicely  into the relaxed juju groove of the title track, it forgets to write  a proper chorus-- so it just crams in a hurried rewrite of the one  featured in the superior ELO song of the same name.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, <i>Living Thing</i> fares  best when the songs don't draw too much attention to their simplicity  and lay off the gimmickry: the late-1980s U2/Gabriel slow burn of ""Just  the Past"" (complete with lighter-waving fade-out); the tropical doo  wop of ""Stay This Way""; the Kraftwerkian post-coital glow of closer  ""Last Night"". But there's a noticeable deficit of swoon-worthy  climaxes to complement these meditative turns. Compared to the widescreen splendor  of <i>Writer's Block</i>, <i>Living Thing</i> sounds like a noble but flawed attempt  by Peter Bjorn and John to test the fortitude of their songwriting using  the most barren and broken of arrangements. But more often that not,  it sounds like they settled on the drum-machine presets first, with  the lyrics and melodies thrown on top as afterthoughts. After hearing  Yttling repeatedly declare, ""I'm losing my mind/ That's why I ain't  fine"" for the umpteenth time, it's hard to shake the nagging feeling  that Peter Bjorn and John applied the <i>Writer's Block</i> title to the  wrong album.</p></div>"|12874.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12874-living-thing/|5.5|Stuart Berman

It helps that his  words are always set against such sublimely sloppy pop riffs. But on <i> Now We Can See</i>, his band's fourth full-length, he takes advantage  of a newfound musical maturity, buffing his fuzzy riffs into polished  power-pop, which finally casts a much-deserved spotlight  on his lyrics.</p>
<p>When last we head from the Portland trio,  they were down a member-- newbie drummer Westin Glass has since stepped  behind the kit, though it is not his time-keeping that you hear on <i> Now We Can See</i>-- and hot off the acclaim of <i>The Body, The Blood,  The Machine</i>, their scathing indictment of life in Christian theocracy, one of the more time capsule-worthy records of the Bush administration. So how does a poppy punk band follow up  such a feat in the cautiously optimistic early days of the Obama administration?  After proving they could take on ""topics that matter"" while maintaining  their thrilling musical simplicity, it would have been a disappointment  to see them revert to the gleefully grimy garage-punk of their early  albums, on which Harris simply used his lyrical prowess to breathlessly  catalog sexual power struggles. But not only does our new president  mean that we have (hopefully) outgrown the need for an album like <i> TBTBTM</i>, but the band is also too joyously silly and powerfully spazzy  to get stuck solely in the often dowdy realm of ""important"" political  songwriting. The compromise, then, is <i>Now We Can See</i>, a concept  album of sorts from the perspective of the dead that acts as a denouement  to the last Thermals' record. It's an album that looks at life not  as something to urgently struggle through, but as something that has  already passed, something that our narrator finally has some perspective  on.</p>
<p>And this is why Harris is such an admirable  songwriting talent: He writes about universal subjects with a sharply  specific eye, and he has the imagination to transcend his own point of view  to write from a character's perspective that there's no way he could  share. Cramming in as many syllables as his thrifty, tightly coiled  melodies will allow, Harris announces the collection's themes and  tone with album opener ""When I Died"", singing, ""Busted and wrecked/ Justly  infected/ My body beyond repair/ Had no objection, sir/ My only questions  were/ 'Where do I go and will I know when I'm there?'/ But I really  couldn't say that I cared.""</p>
<p><i>Now We Can See</i> is full of the  regret you would expect from the recently deceased, but it's also rife  with acceptance and relief. For every track like ""We Were Sick"",  the incendiary, three-chord rant against the selfishness of the living  and our indifference and contribution to the ecological crisis, there's  a track like ""I Let It Go"", which is practically giddy in its liberation,  celebrating the release of death. <i>Now We Can See</i> is bursting  with clear-headed explorations of the ways that fear and neuroses hold  us back from truly living (as on ""When I Was Afraid""), winkingly  clinical examinations of the rote machinations that consume our lives  (like ""Liquid In, Liquid Out""), and tales of the savagery at  the basis of modern existence (like the title track or ""When We Were  Alive""). Maybe these are pretty heady topics after all.</p></div>"|12875.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12875-now-we-can-see/|7.8|Rebecca Raber

And few artists took the genre's alienating torpor further than the Skull Disco crew. Shackleton, Appleblim, and their associates made ""dance"" music for the lost-looking souls poured into ratty couches at the back of the club, hypnotized by the speaker cones bulging in and out. Tense and clammy, the minimalist hand percussion and bloodcurdling drones on Skull Disco releases could give you the cold sweats on a sunny day.</p>
<p>But by the time Ricardo Villalobos stretched Shackleton's ""Blood on My Hands"" into the spookiest dance single of the decade in 2007, just two years after the label formed, Skull Disco could offer little in the way of surprise. Repetition was diluting the sound's effectiveness: <i>Another</i> tribal drum pattern topped with a lunatic spoken word sample? Perhaps that's why, late last year, Skull Disco shuttered. Listening to <i>Soundboy's Gravestone Gets Desecrated By Vandals</i>, the second and final Skull Disco CD compilation following 2007's <i>Soundboy Punishments</i>, closing up shop was a wise decision on Shackleton and Appleblim's part. Only self-parody could result from another half-dozen singles in a similar vein.</p>
<p>Split into one CD of original tunes and one CD of remixes from international contemporaries like Pole and Bass Clef, <i>Soundboy's Gravestone</i> offers more of the same, arriving in stores just before fanboy boredom turns to irritation. Disc One remains an excellent soundtrack for a slush-choked, bitter winter where economic conditions have turned the most outgoing club rats into hermits out of necessity. For those who've sampled Skull Disco's wares before and worry another nine tracks might be superfluous, one new development is that the kinship with non-dubsteppers feels more pronounced. Appleblim and Peverelist's ""Circling"" softens dubstep's bass wobble and clunky drums with synth sweeps from the early days of Euro dub-techno, while the micro-edited drums on Shackleton's ""You Bring Me Down"" owe more to post-gitch German wizards than they do to any UK sampler hero rearranging breakbeats.</p>
<p>As for Disc Two, it may seem perverse given my earlier kvetching about the label's diminishing returns, but the remixes that abandon the label's gloom-sodden mood are usually the least effective, like Brendon Møller's attempt to turn Appleblim and Peverelist's ""Over Here"" into full-on Force Tracks-style Euro-house, complete with an undistinguished 4/4 beat. Meanwhile the <i>best</i> remixes offer welcome tweaks from those outside the dubstep scene without completely smothering the S.D. vibe. Pole's take on Shackleton's ""Shortwave"" retains the original's hypnotic quality while the always dub-friendly Stefan Betke strips the groove to the faintest skitter-pulse and splices the background hum into his usual chunks of reverb-heavy grit. While you can admire Skull Disco's integrity in deciding to mothball the whole operation rather than dilute their vision, tracks like the ""Shortwave"" remix make you wonder if the label couldn't have productively mutated in perpetuity.</p></div>"|12811.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12811-soundboys-gravestone-gets-desecrated-by-vandals/|6.9|Jess Harvell

Their debut,  <i> Bring It On</i>, which beat out Pulp's<i> This Is Hardcore </i> and Cornershop's<i> When I Was Born for the 7th Time </i> for the 1998 Mercury Prize, seemingly set a blueprint for future experimentation with a shaggy-haired combination that sounded raw yet ambitious, unforced yet focused. On their too-quick follow-up, 1999's  <i> Liquid Skin</i>, Gomez buffed away most of the rough edges and derived a glossier, showier sound. They had lost the plot: The band was supposed to take over the world, not continue tinkering in the lab. In the meantime, that sophomore album has become Gomez's default setting: Even when they pushed reset on 2004's  <i> Split the Difference</i>, their first collaboration with an outside producer, they couldn't escape the slick elements that were beginning to appear intrinsic to the project all along.  <i> </i></p>
<p><i> A New Tide</i>, their sixth studio album, promises yet another reinvigorated approach, but that title is about as far as they get. For a band with more than a decade under its belt, Gomez still seem to be working with a simple formula that applies studio sheen to rustic music-- or maybe it's rustic elements to studio rock. ""Little Pieces"" threads blues guitar riffs throughout an otherwise anonymous rocker, and ""Other Plans"" devolves into a vague raga jam with Beatlesque backward loops. ""Boned Tired"" mixes acoustic guitar and mouth harp with electronic hums and beats. It's actually a pretty neat trick that reveals the sonic similarities between the new and the traditional, the organic and the synthetic, but it still sounds like a trick. The electronic elements here pop up so surreptitiously that that they come off like shorthand for innovative rather than innovation itself.</p>
<p>There are, especially toward the end of  <i> A New Tide, </i> some nice moments that show a potentially compelling band behind the transatlantic formula. A buoyant organ theme mingles with an upright bass on the whirling dervish ""If I Ask You Nicely"", and ""Natural Reaction"" catches a breeze with its windblown hook, chiming marimba, and clattering outro. ""Airstream Driver"" rockets along on a catchy hook and a quick tempo that makes it ideal for a road-trip mixtape, but it eventually devolves, as most Gomez songs do, into a coda jam that's heavy on rumbling bass but low on gas. The band has always taken liberties with conventional song structures, and that's one of the reasons their 2005 double-live  <i> Out West </i> holds up surprisingly well. They take no small joy in defying expectations, in baiting and switching, in playing around with genres and instruments, if not necessarily with formulas. But on  <i> A New Tide</i>, the abrupt tempo changes and style shifts no longer sound subversive or even very much fun, but overthought and perhaps even obligatory. It's a showy album with very little to show.</p></div>"|12797.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12797-a-new-tide/|5.4|Stephen M. Deusner

His voice is a raw-throated, gravelly gargle, but it's all too easy to tell when he's smiling. And when he's comparing his cars to fruits or candies or Papa Smurf, he's absolutely in his element. On last year's  <i> I Am Legend </i> mixtape, he bragged of a ""Benz coupe same color Ric Flair hair,"" probably the most ridiculously great car-color description I've ever heard. Dro's now nearly three years removed from ""Shoulder Lean"", his sole big hit, and he's not getting calls to jump on big-hit posse-cut remixes, the way he was when he wrecked the ""Top Back"" and ""We Fly High"" remixes a little while back. But last year, he scored something of a fluke regional hit when he spazzed out on the remix of his labelmate Yung L.A.'s ""Ain't I"", one of those effortlessly likable Southern synth-bangers where everyone involved miraculously seems to be operating at peak capacity. Over that twinkling beat, Dro's word-drunk exuberance beautifully offset L.A.'s hesitant chirpiness and label boss T.I.'s slick regality: ""Rims so big I'm at the tip-top, ain't I/ Choppers in the trunk'll make you do the macarena.""</p>
<p>In a just world, that ""Ain't I"" remix would lead to big things starting to happen for Dro again. Instead, he's sharing equal mixtape billing with L.A., the worst rapper on his label by orders of magnitude, and delivering some of the most limp, unimpressive work of his young career. L.A. is this weird little creep with a squeaky baby-voice and a barely serviceable sense of meter who loves bragging about his shitty half-mohawk and his Urkel glasses. He barely drops one quotable line on this endless 76-minute tape, unless we're counting calling himself ""haircut boy"" like that's a good thing. Sharing space with this guy does Dro no favors.</p>
<p>That's especially true because L.A. and Dro love doing these white-people voices that basically begin and end with Sean Penn in  <i> Fast Times at Ridgemont High</i>, crowing ""Dude!"" and ""Rock!"" and ""Party time!"" over and over and  <i> over</i>. They stay in character for entire songs here, and it completely drives me nuts. It's meant to be funny, of course, but beyond that goofy-ass cover, there's barely a chuckle in any of it. And even when he's not stooping to lame-ass comedy, Dro really indulges all his worst impulses here. On ""Shower"", he raps for the ladies with all the cool seductiveness of a lunch table full of eighth-grade dudes: ""We could do it in the shower, get it wet then/ After that, we could go and have sex then."" On ""Still Selling Drugs"", he flips Akon's cheesed-out Euro-dance hit ""Right Now (Na Na Na)"" so it's about cocaine, and the three minutes he devotes to it feel endless. Over and over, he sings his own choruses, which is really something he shouldn't do.</p>
<p>Even on autopilot, Dro's delivery still has serious charm. And here and there, he shows flashes of his old inventiveness: ""Young shooter, in the Chevy with Punky Brewster."" But it's tough to calculate how much urgency and joy has gone out of Dro since he made <i>I Am Legend</i> just a year ago. It's not the worst thing in the world that he's teamed up with a terrible rapper here. But every time we hear a genuine star's voice on <i>B</i><i>lack Boy White Boy</i> (T.I., say, or Lil Boosie), Dro just sounds almost as lost as L.A. I really, really hope this guy finds it in himself to pull it together. The world needs more rappers willing to compare their Ferraris to the nose on Rudolph.</p></div>"|12785.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12785-black-boy-white-boy/|4.1|Tom Breihan

Nevertheless, she's been changing things up from the very beginning, starting with the shift from her near-perfect debut <i>Dry</i> to the bone-rattling game-changer <i>Rid of Me</i> and on through any other number of career zigs and zags, some more successful than others. Since disbanding her original trio, but especially since her breakout <i>To Bring You My Love</i>, Harvey has lost some of her intense focus, leading her to branch out to a tandem-billed collaboration in 1996 with John Parish, <i>Dance Hall at Louse Point</i>, and continuing up through her harrowing hey-why-not-piano? album <i>White Chalk</i>. Given all the ups and downs, perhaps it makes sense that Harvey should return to favored catalyst Parish for another collaborative go-round. Granted, Parish has been collaborating with Harvey as a producer and musician for years, even before <i>Dry</i>, but his co-billed discs with her offer him much more input, particularly considering that he's working with one of the music world's more imposing auteurs.</p>
<p>As with their previous shared project, Parish wrote all of the music and played most of the instruments on <i>A Woman a Man Walked By</i>, leaving Harvey to the lyrics and singing. Harvey has said that her collaborations with Parish give her the freedom to push into new places, and there is a sense of exploration here as she fits her words to the shapes of his songs. You can detect Harvey taking the chance to stretch, if not necessarily as a lyricist, then certainly as a singer. On the conventional opener ""Black Hearted Love"", she sounds like she's singing from a different sonic plane than Parish's backing track, but she takes advantage of that distance by working the reverb-draped space for maximum drama. ""Sixteen, Fifteen, Fourteen"" is weirder, a locked-in-the-basement freak cousin to Zeppelin's folkier offerings, with Harvey's wails, pants, and whispers instilling the track with the right degree of crazy. On ""Leaving California"", she pushes her soprano to awkward heights, coming close to the unsettling falsetto drummer Rob Ellis used to provide.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, in ""April"", Harvey twists her voice into a contorted croak, and punctuating the title track's breathless narrative is Harvey's snarled threat ""Stick it up your fucking ass."" It's the must unhinged we've heard her since she demanded ""Who the fuck?"" on <i>Uh Huh Her</i>, even if here she sounds like she's having some twisted fun (Albini would be proud). Later Harvey relishes the chance to howl some more on ""Pig Will Not""; if these aren't particularly pleasant listening experiences, they do make the lovely closer ""Cracks in the Canvas"" that much prettier in comparison.</p>
<p>With all these divergent sides of Harvey on display, the disc in a sense amounts to an audition reel full of character studies, each delivered with method brio. Yet Harvey's always played the line between the personal and the persona close to her vest, much to the frustration of armchair psychologists everywhere. So how much of a stretch <i>A Woman</i> actually is, only she knows for sure (""The Soldier"", for example, would have been a boon to <i>White Chalk</i>). What's more, by this point in her career Harvey, has wandered so far from her roots that if she released a solo billed disc that sounded just like this, no one would likely even bat an eye.</p>
<p>Whether it'd be considered a particularly good album is another matter. The disc succeeds as a public testing ground, but as an album it's ultimately unfocused. One problem is that Parish simply isn't the songwriter that Harvey is. That's okay-- few are-- but the result is that the material itself isn't terribly compelling musically or melodically, and at times it sounds like it could have been rushed together in a couple of days, lark-like. Surely pals Parish and Harvey had a good time making it, but there's not a lot to enjoy beyond Harvey's ever-inimitable presence. For some, that may be enough.</p></div>"|12870.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12870-a-woman-a-man-walked-by/|6.2|Joshua Klein

When the alternative nation was in full swing, they toured with mega-popular grunge bands and they were acquainted with flannel shirts and threadbare jeans. They were on the cusp of a breakthrough, but it never quite worked out. Instead, Red Red Meat got weirder as they went, experimenting with production and structure until they became more or less a cult act, and then they disintegrated. They're remembered now for being a predecessor to Califone, the rootsier outfit started by frontman Tim Rutili, which would eventually include contributions from everyone in the final incarnation of RRM. But maybe that'll change. Sub Pop has reissued the 1995 album <i>Bunny Gets Paid</i>, arguably the band's high-water mark, in a deluxe edition with a bonus disc, and 14 years on, it's aged beautifully.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Like many of their contemporaries, Red Red Meat took the foundations of 60s and 70s rock-- blues, heavy guitars, an unapologetic focus on riffs-- and re-shaped them for a more self-aware post-punk context. Their self-titled 1992 debut was speedy and abrasive blues-punk, the kind of stuff that was slotted with the art-damaged classic rockisms of Royal Trux and Pussy Galore. 1994's <i>Jimmywine Majestic</i>, their first full-length for Sub Pop, was more refined; its songs were slowed enough to let the groove seep through and recorded clearly enough to allow the melodies to catch some light. It was around the time of <i>Jimmywine</i> that RRM became an emerging figure on the grunge landscape, when they hit the road with hometown pals Smashing Pumpkins during the latter's <i>Siamese Dream</i> tour. But <i>Bunny Gets Paid</i> took them in a direction that left the possibility of mainstream recognition behind.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">With <i>Bunny</i>, all of a sudden Red Red Meat seemed artier, more hidden and inscrutable. Rutili has always spoken in riddles, content to braid together phrases or even single words that sound pleasing to the ear, but here the fragmentation became more extreme. Somehow, when the syllables pile up and the flow of vowels and consonants rides the arc of the music, the effect could be sublime. ""Mink-eyed, marble-eyed/ In the gauze, in the weeds/ By the drain, red on pale/ There's a nail by the vent,"" goes the chorus of ""Gauze"", <i>Bunny Gets Paid</i>'s stone classic and a contender for the best song Rutili has written. Who knows what it means. But if you can picture a scrubby patch of weeds and in it a clump of gauze, possibly soiled, twitching in the breeze, and the disconnected image of decay stirs something in you, you're on your way to falling in love with Red Red Meat.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">But make no mistake: You don't need to know what Rutili is singing about to enjoy <i>Bunny Gets Paid</i>, an album you feel as much as listen to. The vocals are buried and the lyrics enigmatic, but the songs still communicate in a direct and visceral way. Much of the record swings between two poles that seem different on the surface but are closely related the more you listen. On one side is weary resignation, the sense of feeling beaten down and bombed-out and hollow while still managing to take in the surreal stream of images happening around you. Here there's lots of space, acoustic instruments, thudding drums beaten slowly with mallets. The opening ""Carpet of Horses"" is perhaps the most Califone-like song here, with its buzzing acoustic guitar being stabbed with a slide, someone coughing in the background, and a gurgle of electronic noises suggesting a wounded machine on its last legs. And then the mood changes.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">""Carpet of Horses"" is like a heavy door creaking open and you can't quite make out what's behind it, but ""Chain Chain Chain"" follows and reveals <i>Bunny</i>'s other extreme. It's the explosion of energy after a week in bed, a rocker with a chunky riff and the kind of elegantly simple blues-inflected hook that the Stones would have been thrilled to write at any point between 1968 and 1972. It swaggers, even dances a bit, confident in the leveling power of its heavy stomp, but even here everything is delivered with a slight twist. Rutili still hangs back, his voice obscured as he sings quietly and close to the mic, unaware or unwilling to acknowledge that this should by all rights by the band's breakout single. And then ""Rosewood, Wax, Voltz + Glitter"" is just as catchy, but louder, meaner, more chaotic, with shrieking, trebly guitars and the sound of glass being smashed in the background. Another swing, and wasted ballad ""Buttered"" drops us back to where we started, alone in a dark room somewhere.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">That smashing glass on ""Rosewood"" reinforces how much the odd little production touches throughout contribute to the album's feel. Most of <i>Bunny</i> was recorded and mixed by Brad Wood, with Casey Rice, Keith Cleversly, and band member Brian Deck contributing. Deck would go on to join Rutili in Califone and would also become a producer of note in this decade, and <i>Bunny Gets Paid </i>is the album at the root of his organic, rusted-out junk-shop orchestra aesthetic. It's a busy mix of sounds that can be dense and loud or open and airy, depending on the needs of the song. The throb of electronics mixes easily with the slackly-tuned acoustic guitars, managing to sound both old and futuristic and the same time, while the constant use of distortion and feedback as coloring drapes the whole album in a hazy, narcotic light.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The bonus disc is useful mostly for seeing how songs developed and production techniques evolved. We get Rutili's 4-track acoustic demo of ""Chain Chain Chain"", which is dark and spare with only hints at the cathartic song it would become. A few songs are heard in different configurations, like ""Idiot Son"", in a mellower earlier take that was released as a 7"", and ""Carpet of Horses"", given a grittier rock arrangement. ""Mouse-ish (Dub Mix)"" is notable for making explicit what had always seemed obvious-- the influence of dub production techniques on Red Red Meat's sound (which would continue in earnest on the first couple of Califone EPs). It's interesting stuff for people who have the original record memorized-- the bonus disc as study guide-- but less than essential for everyone else.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">For all its mystery and ambiguity, the long strings of cracked images and dream-like sonic mist that linger in the air, <i>Bunny Gets Paid </i>ends with the most direct statement of Red Red Meat's existence. The closing song is a downcast but still hopeful cover of ""There's Always Tomorrow"", the love theme from the stop-motion animated ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"" TV special, and after what's come before, the folksy rainbow-chasing sentiment feels earned. It eases you back into the real world and drives home something essential about the record you just heard, which you realized on some level but hadn't quite put a finger on: It's got a huge heart.</p></div>"|12871.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12871-bunny-gets-paid-deluxe-edition/|8.9|Mark Richardson

He intones elusive lyrics in a smeared voice, artfully skirting the subject. We see windows and phones, highways and fields, charged with potency like crime scene photos. Mercurial, emotional abstractions stand in for stories, rendered with the telegraphic flicker of dreams, and flat, unmoored syntax in search of some missing referent. The music is translucent and pervasive, gathering like twilight.</p>
<p>Buckner's pointedly elliptical style is so refined that it suggests disembodiment, as if he'd simply atomized himself into song. With these reissues of three earlier, out-of-print albums, Merge reintroduces to us a more Earth-bound Buckner-- not to mention some of his most beloved tunes. All three are seeded with the idiosyncrasies that would increase in his music over time, and they clarify his developmental through-line from <i>Bloomed</i> to <i>Meadow</i>: His songwriting skewed toward sturdy or ephemeral extremes; his lyrics floated into the ether; his music thickened up, leveled out, and rolled over him like a wave.</p>
<p>In 1994, Buckner made his solo debut as a mysteriously bent country musician. At the time, he was living in San Francisco and getting nowhere with his band, the Doubters. He decamped for Lubbock, Tex., to record <i>Bloomed</i> with Lloyd Maines. A sense of urgency simply to get the songs out attends the album's loose, impassioned performances and pithy arrangements-- most highlight vocals and acoustic guitar, sometimes with minimal percussion, electric guitar, or strings. In some ways, it's a traditional outsider-country record in the lineage of Townes Van Zandt. Buckner's voice is all honey and oak, his guitar style elaborately twanging, his constant subject matter heartache. The past tense of the title is not rhetorical: He spins webs of memories, confessions, and creeds around the moment the bloom came off.</p>
<p>But already, there are signs that Buckner is not your average country singer. His phrasing is distinctly off-kilter, speeding up and slowing down, getting louder and softer, pinching and soaring according to the cadence of inspiration. The narrative lines frequently white out, go hazy. This is a world where phones ""pour blue,"" where ""never"" has a sound and ""lust"" a taste. And the songs are difficult to frame with pat emotions-- they're alloyed and moody, like weather. On the indelible ""Rainsquall"" he equivocates, ""And when the blue breaks through/ Honey, I'll still want you/ And when the storm moves on/ Dear, I might be gone."" On choruses his broad croon often slips into compact melisma, stacking stridencies and sonorities in tight, beveled packets. Spanish guitar runs spurt out of nowhere. Overall, the music seems modeled upon campfires, guttering and glowing according to vagaries of the wind.</p>
<p>Tucked near the end of <i>Bloomed</i> is ""Emma"", a rare story-song amid all the painterly abstraction. It shows off Buckner's gift for sharp, mythologizing characterization straight out of Cormac McCarthy: A young bride runs from a ""black-hatted man with a weed in his mouth"" unleashed by her spurned husband, a ""Cherokee City man with cold, cruel hands and jealous eyes."" This sort of character-driven song comes to the fore on <i>The Hill</i>, which is based on Edgar Lee Masters' <i>Spoon River Anthology</i>, a series of soliloquies delivered by the dead citizens of a semi-fictional town. In 1996, Buckner recorded <i>The Hill</i> while taking a break from recording <i>Devotion + Doubt</i>, but didn't do anything with it until the tape surfaced in his truck four years later. With a guitar, an E-bow, and a keyboard, he entered the studio with Calexico's Joey Burns and John Convertino, but forbade them any traditional percussion. Burns played cello, and Convertino improvised percussion from things around the studio.</p>
<p>The resultant music is raucous and immediate, with many chorus-less songs abruptly slamming into one another, yet the songs feel more rigorously interpreted than on the meandering <i>Bloomed</i>. The sound is thicker, more assertive. Chiming, well-built pop-rock arrangements, coasting keyboards, and hard-bitten blues unknot Buckner's writing, and the vocal melodies are expressed less erratically. It works best as a formal exercise, as he winds up subjugating some of his tics to the form-- in this context, his lyrics are naturally less impressionistic-- and the numerous, interstitial instrumentals mean we get fewer actual songs.

His debut, <i>Fi</i>, was full of fragments and wisps; it displayed his signature blend of quaint English folk and Boards of Canada-style electronics at its most elemental and transient.  <i> Hand Cranked </i> featured the first appearance of his timorous voice and more consistent track lengths; music that seemed  <i> about </i> folk moved a notch closer to  <i> being </i> folk. And  <i> Vignetting the Compost </i> features more singing, more orderly structure, and more unvarnished melody than ever before. On some of these songs, Bibio would only have to break up the rigidity of his loops and lose a few sound effects to actually turn into Bert Jansch.</p>
<p>But this is just evidence of a gradual slide to the right on the electro-acoustic spectrum. The constants of Bibio's music remain intact. There is his characteristic naturalism: Birdsong and a stream serve an overture for ""Weekend Wildfire""; birds nest in the staticky thickets that close out ""Thatched"". There is his twanging acoustic guitar, which is the fundamental element of many of his sun-streaked idylls-- sometimes, now, appearing almost unadorned, as on ""Mr. &amp; Mrs. Compost"". And there is the frequent sense of hearing everything through a wobbly old phonograph. This effect is particularly pronounced now that Bibio's guitar parts have grown so robust, giving it more surface to cling to. It's a technique he uses to various ends-- it renders ""Flesh Rots, Pip Sown"" warm and nostalgic, like aged film; elsewhere, as on ""Torn Under the Window Light"", it sounds ethereal, even sinister.</p>
<p>It's no stretch to say that  <i> Vignetting the Compost </i> features some of Bibio's finest music to date; the vocals, however, are more of a mixed bag. Wilkinson has a thin, modest voice that verges on anonymity. This can actually be a plus when he uses it as a sound element among others, as it slips unassumingly into the compositions while evoking the workmanlike singing of non-commoditized folk music. It works well as a reverb-drenched postscript to ""Flesh Rots"", but it's less interesting as a focal point on ""Mr. &amp; Mrs. Compost"" and ""Great are the Piths"". All of this risks overstating the case: The vocals don't show up that frequently, and are seldom worse than distracting when they do. Bibio spends the bulk of the album fiddling with gleaming, ghosting sounds that evade such easy characterization.</p>
<p>It's just a slightly unsettling tendency-- you get the impression that maybe Wilkinson secretly pines to be an unreconstructed folkie, and has been using electronics as sort of smoke screen that he's clearing away as he gains confidence. The problem here is that while he's a quite interesting electro-folk musician, there is evidence that he's merely capable as a straight-up folk singer. One worries that this is a distraction from what he does well, like hanging reversed trills on the tranquil arpeggios of ""Dopplerton"" or making guitar strings chirp like birds on ""Everglad Everglade""-- this is where his unique musical personality shines through. If he does wind up going all Fairport Convention on us, it'll be like Joaquin Phoenix deciding to be a rapper-- more power to him, but what a waste!</p></div>"|12793.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12793-vignetting-the-compost/|6.8|Brian Howe

It came out in 1969, a year after Wendy (nee Walter) Carlos'  <i> Switched-On Bach </i> sold half a million copies and turned the Moog into a must-have instrument for musicians everywhere. Listening to Hyman's reinterpretation of one of Brown's heaviest funk tracks is a weird experience: The first time or two, it almost--  <i> almost-- </i> sounds like an accidental precursor to the late-1990s Timbaland/Neptunes approach to digital hip-hop production, at least in the same way a '32 Ford could be considered a precursor to the Lamborghini Countach. Then the novelty wears off to the point where the rinky-dink bassline and the exasperated robot mosquito substituting for James Brown's vocals sound astonishingly cheap and frivolous. Once the 70s came, with their ""Flash Light"" and their ""I Feel Love"" and their ""Trans-Europe Express"", dance music had finally found out how to play to the synthesizer's strengths, and those old cover albums from the Moog's growing-pain years sounded like relics.</p>
<p>But apparently the shift away from the tinny flimsiness of early synthesizers wasn't a point of no return: someone up and made himself a  <i> Switched-On Dilla</i>. That someone is Mark Pritchard, who split off his gig in retro-minded exotica-breaks peddlers Harmonic 33, dropped a ""1"" in the middle of that number in a nod to Detroit's area code, and put together a body of work that passes the modern Motor City hip-hop sound through an orange plastic filter that smells kind of like burning diodes. There's a slight cheapness hidden beneath all the bass he likes to smother his beats under: The rhythms usually feel like they click all right, sometimes an intriguing half-melodic drone will seep up through the murk, and you can almost grasp the weighty, body-moving funk that rolls along the basslines-- but the further the track goes on, the more you can feel it start to decay under the strain of a limited sonic palette.</p>
<p>That limitation comes from the self-consciously vintage-sounding Moog bleeps and blurps Pritchard toys with over the course of Harmonic 313's  <i> Dirtbox </i> EP and the follow-up full-length,  <i> When Machines Exceed Human Intelligence</i>. That style has a certain whimsical charm to it, but imagine if you had to put together a handful of instrumental hip-hop tracks relying mostly on the same equipment that Hot Butter used for ""Popcorn"". ""Dirtbox"", which kicks off both the EP and the album, is a subwoofer-eviscerating monster of a track, and the second track on the EP, ""Arc Light"", succeeds with its glowing bass and hypnotically locomotive drum breaks where lesser Jay Dee-alikes have failed. But the other two tracks on the EP sound either half-finished (stripped-down, trudging bleep breaks on ""The Returners"") or shaky-footed (""Wobbz"", which sounds like a comedy dubstep military march through a swamp made of Nerf).</p>
<p><i> When Machines Exceed Human Intelligence </i> maintains that approach, for better or for otherwise, and crashes into a bridge abutment when it tries to go beyond it. There's still a surplus of tracks that pit towering, seismic basslines against needling, crumbling old turn-of-the-70s synths-- waxing vaguely sinister and modestly head-nod-worthy in the stagger-step ""Cyclotron"", galumphing along to the accompaniment of a mid-seizure Speak &amp; Spell on ""Word Problems"", and stomping brusquely towards interstellar dub oblivion on ""Call to Arms"". And even if some of that movement feels like jogging in place, better those than the woozy, somewhat nauseated-sounding Aphex Twin/Boards of Canada manqué moments like ""Galag-A"" and ""Köln""-- not to mention the acid casualty ""Flaash"", which feels like getting stabbed and/or bludgeoned to death with a rusty 303.</p>
<p>But no amount of boulder-sized low-end can disguise the fact that, even when these tracks work, they usually feel like they're missing something major. And that something is a vocalist. The beat to ""Battlestar""-- which consists of some sturdy neo-boom-bap drums and not a whole lot else-- might not be the most audacious on the album, but with top-notch Detroiters Phat Kat and Elzhi dropping lyrical gems over it, it's one of the most alive-sounding. ""Falling Away"", the other vocal showcase, features an ethereally raspy and robotic-sounding turn from Steve Spacek... and damn, this  <i> is </i> a good production style, ain't it? The fact that Pritchard tried to let his Harmonic 313 beats stand alone is a shame, since their greatest drawbacks-- their repetitive entropy and their unsubtle bombast-- could be easily offset by a good, strong cast of MCs and singers. We're gonna run out of Dilla beats eventually, so the first mixtape guru to drop some unheard Pharoahe Monch or Erykah Badu a cappellas over ""Cyclotron"" instead of ""Geek Down"" for the hundredth time will really have something.</p></div>"|12752.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12752-dirtbox-ep-when-machines-exceed-human-intelligence/|6.2|Nate Patrin

Once the 70s came, with their ""Flash Light"" and their ""I Feel Love"" and their ""Trans-Europe Express"", dance music had finally found out how to play to the synthesizer's strengths, and those old cover albums from the Moog's growing-pain years sounded like relics.</p>
<p>But apparently the shift away from the tinny flimsiness of early synthesizers wasn't a point of no return: someone up and made himself a  <i> Switched-On Dilla</i>. That someone is Mark Pritchard, who split off his gig in retro-minded exotica-breaks peddlers Harmonic 33, dropped a ""1"" in the middle of that number in a nod to Detroit's area code, and put together a body of work that passes the modern Motor City hip-hop sound through an orange plastic filter that smells kind of like burning diodes. There's a slight cheapness hidden beneath all the bass he likes to smother his beats under: The rhythms usually feel like they click all right, sometimes an intriguing half-melodic drone will seep up through the murk, and you can almost grasp the weighty, body-moving funk that rolls along the basslines-- but the further the track goes on, the more you can feel it start to decay under the strain of a limited sonic palette.</p>
<p>That limitation comes from the self-consciously vintage-sounding Moog bleeps and blurps Pritchard toys with over the course of Harmonic 313's  <i> Dirtbox </i> EP and the follow-up full-length,  <i> When Machines Exceed Human Intelligence</i>. That style has a certain whimsical charm to it, but imagine if you had to put together a handful of instrumental hip-hop tracks relying mostly on the same equipment that Hot Butter used for ""Popcorn"". ""Dirtbox"", which kicks off both the EP and the album, is a subwoofer-eviscerating monster of a track, and the second track on the EP, ""Arc Light"", succeeds with its glowing bass and hypnotically locomotive drum breaks where lesser Jay Dee-alikes have failed. But the other two tracks on the EP sound either half-finished (stripped-down, trudging bleep breaks on ""The Returners"") or shaky-footed (""Wobbz"", which sounds like a comedy dubstep military march through a swamp made of Nerf).</p>
<p><i> When Machines Exceed Human Intelligence </i> maintains that approach, for better or for otherwise, and crashes into a bridge abutment when it tries to go beyond it. There's still a surplus of tracks that pit towering, seismic basslines against needling, crumbling old turn-of-the-70s synths-- waxing vaguely sinister and modestly head-nod-worthy in the stagger-step ""Cyclotron"", galumphing along to the accompaniment of a mid-seizure Speak &amp; Spell on ""Word Problems"", and stomping brusquely towards interstellar dub oblivion on ""Call to Arms"". And even if some of that movement feels like jogging in place, better those than the woozy, somewhat nauseated-sounding Aphex Twin/Boards of Canada manqué moments like ""Galag-A"" and ""Köln""-- not to mention the acid casualty ""Flaash"", which feels like getting stabbed and/or bludgeoned to death with a rusty 303.</p>
<p>But no amount of boulder-sized low-end can disguise the fact that, even when these tracks work, they usually feel like they're missing something major. And that something is a vocalist. The beat to ""Battlestar""-- which consists of some sturdy neo-boom-bap drums and not a whole lot else-- might not be the most audacious on the album, but with top-notch Detroiters Phat Kat and Elzhi dropping lyrical gems over it, it's one of the most alive-sounding. ""Falling Away"", the other vocal showcase, features an ethereally raspy and robotic-sounding turn from Steve Spacek... and damn, this  <i> is </i> a good production style, ain't it? The fact that Pritchard tried to let his Harmonic 313 beats stand alone is a shame, since their greatest drawbacks-- their repetitive entropy and their unsubtle bombast-- could be easily offset by a good, strong cast of MCs and singers. We're gonna run out of Dilla beats eventually, so the first mixtape guru to drop some unheard Pharoahe Monch or Erykah Badu a cappellas over ""Cyclotron"" instead of ""Geek Down"" for the hundredth time will really have something.</p></div>"|12752.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12752-dirtbox-ep-when-machines-exceed-human-intelligence/|5.7|Nate Patrin

But there's a yin to that yang, that being Oldham has amassed such an army of friends and co-conspirators that he can create an album of <i>Lie Down</i>'s quality without excessive pressure or to-do. For the second year in a row, Oldham drops a fully-formed, gorgeously wrapped disc with little buildup, though <i>Beware</i> will receive a promotional bump (a small tour and, in some markets, local-cable commercials) that Oldham begged off of <i>Lie Down</i>. <i>Beware</i> moves Oldham closer still to proper country music, uprooting some of <i>Lie Down</i>'s balmy Appalachian posts for robust, quivering compositions recorded with an almost entirely new group of musicians.</p>
<p>So <i>Beware</i> is Oldham's ""big"" record (touring, promotion, etc.), but musically the album seems in many ways smaller-- or at least more level-- than <i>Lie Down</i>. <i>Beware</i> contains no sentiment as scintillating as ""So Everyone""'s ode to public intimacy, no melody quite as curvaceous as ""For Every Field There's a Mole"", and its considerably more ominous artwork and lyrical content feel more in line with Oldham's norms. From its imperative title to ""Afraid Ain't Me""'s final instructions to ""Work, baby,"" Oldham seems more inclined than ever to instruct and guide, a move befitting his age, experience, and the role he plays in the indie-rock community.</p>
<p>It's a role that, predictably, Oldham turns upside down within moments of the album's first lines, circling the title's sure-handed warning around himself: ""Beware of me.""  Oldham acolytes already know this, as Oldham often fibs-- or ""sings in character,"" to be judicious-- but <i>Beware</i> still stands as Oldham's sagest album yet, with many of its poignant moments arriving as knowing declarations. It's strange to suggest that Oldham is suddenly somehow wiser, but <i>Beware</i> doesn't lack for perspective.  He talks lovingly of children, pokes fun at his physique, and receives an ""unfinal call""-- a warning-- from an angel. When on the lover's hymn ""My Life's Work"" Oldham says, ""I take this load on/ It is my life's work,"" he could just as easily be talking about the burdens of cult artistry.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the familial comforts of <i>Lie Down</i> have been replaced with ribald, cowboy promiscuity. Oldham's characters' relationships with women have developed into a loving, frustrating dependence: ""It's kind of easy to have some fun/ When you don't belong to anyone."" He occasionally aims for the type of woebegone romanticism Jack White's been hamming at for years, singing during the goofy horn-led rocker ""You Don't Love Me"", ""You say my kissing rates a six on a scale of one to 10/ And you wouldn't pass the time with me 'cept you're tired of all your friends.""  When he commits, divulging that he wants to be your ""only friend,"" he's immediately on the defensive: ""Is that scary?""</p>
<p><i>Beware</i>'s backing cast might lean a bit hard on conventional arrangements, but even when Oldham's not turning American musics on their heads, he paws at them playfully. Songs spire heartily upwards (""You Are Lost"") or move in fits (""Heart's Arms""); buzzing slide guitars and plucked banjos don't sound laconic, they sound nervy. Sometimes the convention-chucking is more explicit, like the flutes and flanged guitars of the ropey ""I Am Goodbye"" or the twiddling marimba on ""You Can't Hurt Me Now"". The resultant songs have a familiarity that aims them toward the back of your brain but an internal energy that prods them into prominence with repeated listens.</p>
<p>Oldham has once again surrounded himself with voices, lending credence to the characters and modes he slips in and out of. Unlike <i>Lie Down</i>'s Ashley Webber or <i>The Letting Go</i>'s Dawn McCarthy, Jennifer Hutt and Emmett Kelly (among others) serve less as foils than as gatherers, doubling and tripling Oldham's creak like some gospel-not-gospel choir. It is warm and well-felt music, to the point where the message of a song like ""I Don't Belong to Anyone"" might differ substantially had a younger Oldham performed it sans accompaniment (""Don't Belong"" is followed, incidentally, by ""There Is Something I Have to Say"", the lone, croaky <i>Beware</i> track that might've fit on <i>Master and Everyone</i>).</p>
<p>The sheer number of roles that Oldham inhabits, however, should prevent anyone from drawing hard conclusions about his state of mind. <i>Beware</i> feels more severe and less physical than <i>Lie Down</i>, but Oldham still talks about his tummy on two separate occasions. It feels wise, but there's Oldham, hooting and whooping during ""I Am Goodbye"". It feels content in its place, but there's the <a href=""http://www.dragcity.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">commercial</a> during ""Ellen"" in the New Orleans market. When Oldham sings, ""I know everyone knows the trouble I have seen/ That's the thing about trouble you can love,"" he might well be jiggling his belly at artist-audience relationships.  Impossible to say whether Oldham's being candid or goofing on despair, but either way, he's earned the right.</p></div>"|12859.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12859-beware/|7.9|Andrew Gaerig

The Juan MacLean's ""Happy House"" might have been comparatively overlooked in the wake of their labelmates' widespread critical success, but it's hard not to hear it as the weight on the other side of the scale. It jumps a decade or so past H&amp;LA's Larry Levan-minded disco into a style alluded to in the song's double-meaning title, Nancy Whang's voice dripping with a cool, almost aloof exuberance that seemed content to ride along with that pulse-raising piano. It figures that its biggest refrain and most memorable line hints at an arch sort of romanticism: ""you are so... <i>excellent</i>."" Yet ""Happy House"" is a stylistic fluke in a discography that got rolling with the jagged yet warm electro-house of the 2002 single ""By the Time I Get to Venus"" and aimed upwards with 2005's <i>Less Than Human.</i> With more than a year to build on the goodwill accumulated by a potential career-changer, the Juan MacLean have already gone in a completely different direction on their new album.</p>
<p><i>The Future Will Come </i> does at least aim to join ""Happy House"" in its lean towards pop-music structure, even if it gets there through an era-spanning synth-pop pastiche rather than the euphoria of late-80s (and early 00s revival) house. That shouldn't be too out-of-nowhere, especially if you've already been primed by ""The Simple Life"", which followed ""Happy House"" in single form late last summer and points towards the Human League-gone-disco sound John MacLean hinted at during interviews in the run-up to this album. But that song, a gradually-building, subtly-mutating piece of Moroder-meets-Yaz(oo) that spans over eight and a half minutes in opening the album, is a red herring in its own way. That's because with the exception of the 10-minute ""Tonight"", which blends dubby T.K. Disco rhythm with Derrick May bass in the service of a song filled with strangely mournful-sounding anticipation, every track on <i>The Future Will Come </i>that hasn't already appeared as a single last year is a relatively short and succinct piece of work; think a bunch of radio edits instead of the 12"" mixes.</p>
<p>The good news is that brevity keeps some of these tracks from getting stretched thin: The rubbery bongo-driven percussion and mutating, unraveling synths in the title track sound like they reach peak powers just before the song ends a few seconds shy of the five-minute mark, the midtempo electro-funk of ""Accusations"" fits in enough ebb-and-flow atmosphere to explore its Balearic-tweaking turf thoroughly, and cuts like ""A New Bot"" and ""The Station"" bypass gradual-build club dynamics entirely to focus on straightforward post-new-wave hookiness, whether it's frenetically anxious or brooding respectively. Yet a couple of other songs feel rudely truncated before they can build to the bigger, arm-waving moments that seem just over the horizon. The seething acid-house of ""No Time"", which sounds like the Human League's ""Being Boiled"" on heavy stimulants, ends too quickly, but it stings particularly hard when the 81-meets-89 rave-pop of ""One Day"" simply drops off a cliff after just more than four minutes when it sounds like it should go on for another six. Like most quality DFA full-lengths, this album has post-disco dance-pop aesthetics intersecting and merging in ways that transcend cheap retro; too much of it leaves you wondering if it could've gone even further with a bit more breathing room.</p>
<p>Still, what could another four minutes here and there really do about the dour mood? That's the other gag <i>The Future Will Come </i>springs on the unsuspecting listener hoping for an hour's worth of ""Happy House"" giddiness, with Whang and MacLean sniping at each other in character like the Oakey/Sulley dynamic in ""Don't You Want Me"" pushed to a barely repressed loathing. It makes sense, since their vocals are incompatible with each other in the most basic respect. Whang is all coquettish detachment and reserved emotion, singing as though she just <i>happens </i> to be pretty good at expressing these feelings (but, y'know, not showing off or anything), while MacLean stretches his flat voice into attempted overenunciations and hiccupy quirkiness that are beyond the ability of his ideally-monotone voice.</p>
<p>As they sing with clashing voices about how hard it is to get along with anyone, this is ebullient, frequently exciting music that trades on the concept of love as irritating farce. The first verse on ""The Simple Life"" opens with the Whang-sung couplet ""Promises you gave but never kept/ Apologies to save for last regrets""; ""One Day"" sees both singers trading embittered breakup barbs with the promise that ""I'll tell you what you wanna hear if you try"" the closest it gets to reconciliation; ""No Time"" drains all the empathy out of post-one-night stand ennui and brings out the casual cruelty in the typically-innocuous pop-lyric standby ""shut your mouth."" It's all a bit exhausting, but it does lead to a knockout bit of sequencing: from the sourly regretful back-and-forth relationship burden complaints of ""The Station"" to the sparse, false-ending-filled, self-pitying solo-piano dirge of ""Human Disaster""-- and then, to finish the album, ""Happy House"" in its complete 12-and-a-half minutes of ecstasy. That single hardly represents how the rest of the album turned out sounding, but you couldn't pick a better flash of light at the end of the tunnel.</p></div>"|12853.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12853-the-future-will-come/|7.4|Nate Patrin

Forming in 1995 as Vena Cava, the band eventually changed its name upon discovering another group using that same aortic moniker. Their new identity as the Theater Fire worked pretty well until a certain Canadian group came along. This time, though, they stuck to their guns, secure in the knowledge that despite the shared Fire, there's not much musical overlap between them and the  <i> Neon Bible </i> thumpers. Instead of anthemic, extroverted indie, the Theater Fire make more subdued orchestral folk-rock that has more in common with Calexico and Will Oldham than with U2 or Springsteen.</p>
<p>Maybe it's just because they're Texans, but something about the band's third album,  <i> Matter and Light</i>, seems to view introversion as a form of secession. Perhaps because they've been forced to circle the wagons and rechristen themselves, they've cultivated a strong separatist streak in their music: With their clever orchestrations and cleverer lyrics (best: ""I'm not bitter but I hope she dies""), they inhabit their little corner of the Lone Star state, and while you're invited to listen in, they're not asking twice or saving you a seat.</p>
<p>As a result, you get some indulgent songs that seem to satisfy only the band members themselves. They include three versions of ""Beatrice"" when one was certainly adequate: In particular, ""Beatrice (Ode)"", with its laughing strings and deep vocals, is a grating, Weillian number that seems much longer than its two-and-a-half minutes. On the other hand, you also get ""The Testicle Song"", which ought to be insufferable given that it sounds like Oldham doing voice work for  <i> </i>""Robot Chicken"". Delivered in a detached vocal over a drowsy arrangement, the lyrics spin a dick joke into what could be a mission statement: ""One is for shame, one is for glory, give 'em a name, make up a story."" More to the point, like Oldham with his interiorized folk and Seth Green with his deep pop culture arcana, the Theater Fire figure you either get it or you don't and quickly move on.</p>
<p><i>Matter and Light</i>, however, is far from inaccessible. The Fire have a knack for curious, slightly off arrangements that reveal their layers through repeated listens. Horns take their separate corners and come out fighting on ""Dahl Parts"", and ""Coyote"" grafts mournful horns to a candied riff that lands just this side of annoying. Their cover of Elliott Smith's ""Say Yes"" says yes to music box bells, plunking banjo, mariachi horns, and singing saw, but says no to lyrics. All they care about is Smith's mournful up-and-down melody, which makes a lovely album intermission. ""Uncle Wayne"" marries a skipping rhythm to Don Feagin's Smoggy vocals, lyrics about particularly gruesome car-crash fatalities, and trumpets playing one of the wryest fanfares ever. (It should be noted that the <a href=""http://www.mo-freek.com/Media/UW_video.mov"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">video</a> features actress Angela Bettis of <i>May</i> fame, which means it is one of the best videos ever made). That fanfare only echoes Feagin's performance, which gravitates toward unannounced punchlines and constant self-deprecation. ""I'd like to help stop the war, but I just stayed home and watched it on TV,"" he sings on ""Swashbuckler Blues"". ""I'd like to rob from the rich and give to the poor, but I'm too lazy."" They may be territorial, but the Theater Fire are more engaged with the world than even they realize.</p></div>"|12738.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12738-matter-and-light/|7.4|Stephen M.

<p class=""MsoNormal""><span>Think back to your first loves-- the first <i>records </i></span><span>you loved, that is (this is Pitchfork after all). Maybe you were fortunate enough to have a savvy older sibling turn you on to things. Or maybe you were just born with preternatural good taste, and as such all your old faves remain unimpeachable. But chances are you're more like the rest of us: The older you get, and the more you expand your so-called musical horizons, the more some of those records that initially rocked your socks off start to reveal themselves as a little less than essential. Perhaps even-- like the phrase ""rock your socks off""-- a little embarrassing.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span>This is why the Mars Volta move so much product, but it also helps illustrate why, for the right listener at the right time, Australian duo An Horse's debut album <i>Rearrange Beds </i></span><span>could be a revelation. Seasoned listeners will have encountered plenty of this brand of tight, dynamic indie rock before. And indeed the setup here is bracingly simple-- guitar/vocal and drums/tambourine/backing vocals-- and doesn't vary by much more than a melodica cameo and an effects pedal or two over the course of the record's 10 tracks. It's not so much what Kate Cooper (the guitarist/vocalist) and Damon Cox (the drummer/backing vocalist) do with these elements, however, as <i>how </i></span><span>they do it that sets <i>Rearrange Beds </i></span><span>apart.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span>Cooper and Cox's project was born out of some impromptu jam sessions at a record shop they both worked at, and the record is rife with the sort of urgent energies one might expect from a moment of creative genesis. Whether it's the sexual frustration conveyed in ""Camp Out"" (""You wanna camp out,"" Cooper sings, ""and I want to screw around in the dark."") or the precarious perch alluded to in ""Shoes Watch"" (those shoes, it turns out, are watching from a rooftop), there's always a sense of something at stake.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span>Which, hey, kinda sounds like emo. And indeed, in another band's hands, this could very well be an emo record. The lyrics read like excerpts from diary entries, and most find Cooper addressing an unnamed ""you"" with a tone of concern bordering on desperation. There are also plenty of collegiate-level cleverisms. Some work: the eighth track, which finds Cooper and Cox repeating ""I'm not really scared,"" is titled ""Scared as Fuck"". And then a central line in the title track-- ""Rearrange beds to make sure thoughts/ Flow straight from my house to yours""-- conjures the same sort of youthful escapism as the Arcade Fire's ""Neighborhood #1"" bit about digging a tunnel between two dwellings, shot through with a touch of the desperation that keeps An Horse's music riveting. Other attempts at cleverness leave a bad taste in the mouth, such as Cooper's closing track claim ""I've had a little too much to think"" or a line about ""bones that ache with things that you can't spell"" (also from the title track), which both sound a little too much like they could be Minus the Bear song titles.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span>More often, though, lyrics fall somewhere in the middle, neither particularly offensive to one's sensibilities nor particularly inspiring. But again, it's how An Horse use their chosen tools that makes the difference. A chorus like ""It's okay to fall down/ It's okay to crumble"" won't elicit any epiphanies on paper, but the conviction with which Cooper sings it just might. And when she follows that by declaring ""I've seen this before,"" you believe her. Indeed, most of the tracks on <i>Rearrange Beds </i></span><span>build to anthemic choruses that practically beg for sing-alongs-- and the scores of disaffected teens and twentysomethings required to sing them. And when you can turn your own moment of catharsis into somebody else's, hey, you must be doing something right.</span></p>

Clearly this isn't a band that shies away from its essential nature or refuses to admit its antecedents. Singer and principal songwriter Django Haskins has even acknowledged in interviews the seeming inevitability of his choosing to play guitar after having been named for the legendary Django Reinhardt. That attitude of acceptance and comfortableness in one's skin permeates the Old Ceremony's newest album,  <i> Walk on Thin Air</i>, a mature, assured effort that finds the group confronting some of life's most grim and intractable realities with honest humility and patient deliberation.</p>
<p>Such attributes aren't typical ingredients for high-octane rock'n'roll, and sure enough the Old Ceremony's music matches the confident care of the band's internal dynamic. An act that can swell to a dozen players in concert and has built a sartorial reputation by wearing suits onstage, the dapper Carolinians take a standard rock ensemble and dress it up with moody, stately things like violins and vibraphones. It's a tactic that adds dignity to the title track and the quietly devastating ""Murmur"", yet it can just as easily make the album feel like an overly buttoned-down affair, as when the group lets strings awkwardly riff on ""Same Difference"" or evokes the more grievous banalities of various 70s piano men on ""Stubborn Man"". For the most part, however, the orchestral elements in songs like ""Plate Tectonics"", ""The Disappear"", and ""Ready to Go"" simply serve as subtle yet distinguished reminders that these are grown-ass men playing these songs, working through life's problems with highball glasses in hand.</p>
<p>The Old Ceremony's music can feel unsettled and even slightly disorienting (check the organs on ""By Any Other Name""), but it's only because the band is pushing up so closely against some pretty frightening truths. Somewhat paradoxically, it takes real self-possession to even meet these uncertainties head-on, accounting for the steady grace of songs like ""Plate Tectonics"", which correlates the inevitable disasters of love with the shifting of the earth, and ""By Any Other Name"", which ponders the futility and uncontrollableness of language. Haskins does play up brooding noir a bit too broadly on ""Ready to Go"" and ""Don't Parade Your Scars"" and particularly goes overboard on ""The Disappear"", a plodding, punch-drunk song about escaping the workaday world that makes me start to worry I was wrong about the National all along (though I still think the Brooklynites are more clever than this). Then again, such overly stylized transgressions are rendered easily forgivable by the humbly affecting bewilderment of ""Someone I Used to Know"", which marvels at the inevitable but no less baffling changes that time effects on past lovers whom we once thought we understood completely. The fact that change is one of the most fundamental of all constants is just another of the ironies that the members of the Old Ceremony wisely perceive, and even more wisely refuse to pretend they've mastered.</p></div>"|12771.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12771-walk-on-thin-air/|6.2|Joshua Love

The music was also confrontational, with lead singer Karen O following in the footsteps of countless riot grrls and righteous rock queens in crafting a persona of raw defiance and sexual menace.</p>
<p>Fast-forward six years, and a glance at the instantly iconic cover of the band's third full-length,<i> It's Blitz!</i>, tells you all you need to know about how far the Yeah Yeah Yeahs have come, from <i>Fever to Tell </i>through the middle-ground growing pains of 2006's <i>Show Your Bones </i>and up to today. A clean, simple image of a woman's hand bursting an egg-- it's no less powerful an indication of feminine strength and defiance than <i>Fever</i>'s abrasive scrawl, yet it's miles and miles more subversive.

<p><i>It's Blitz!</i> is constructed from parts that by themselves aren't extraordinary-- in fact, many of them are quite banal, like the generic Franz-Bloc-Killers modern rock riff that propels ""Dull Life"" or the doomy one that drives ""Shame and Fortune"", sounding ripped straight off a late-period Smashing Pumpkins record. Much has been made of the album's heavy reliance on rock's eternal bugaboo, the synth, but often the synths are doing rock things rather than dance things, like on the buzzing, road-burning opener ""Zero"". Only two songs, ""Heads Will Roll"" and ""Dragon Queen"", deliver real disco backbeats.</p>
<p>With these unremarkable tools, however, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs still create great, compelling pop-rock, largely because of the way the songs themselves are organized, with conventional verse-chorus structures repeatedly eschewed in favor of detours, miniature grooves, and lengthy asides that produce the sensation of a band and a singer impulsively following their own emotional whims. Take the lovely, insinuating ""Soft Shock"", for instance-- it starts with tinkly keyboards and an Far East-sounding melody that builds to a refrain utilizing the words in the song's title, but it isn't the song's emotional climax, which is hidden until later, when Karen worriedly intones ""what's the time, what's the day, gonna leave me?"" Even more compositionally jarring are the slow, stretched-out set showcases ""Skeletons"" and ""Runaway"", the former taking a blippy little electro-ballad and then plopping martial drums and a melody that sounds taken from some Scottish battle hymn smack dab in the middle. In keeping with the arty tendencies that have blossomed within the band from the beginning, these songs often feel portioned out into passages or movements as opposed to flowing organically throughout.</p>
<p>With such an absence of easy signposts, we're especially apt to follow Karen wherever she goes, since she's our only hope for a guide. Yet she refuses to be a locus of explanation or control, keeping her lyrics generally vague and frequently losing herself in bursts of incomprehensible excitement or fervor. These fits and embellishments account for most of the best moments on the album-- the way she breathlessly pants ""crying, crying, crying"" on ""Zero"", or giddily draws out the last syllable of the line ""a hundred years old"" on ""Dull Life"", or how ""Heads Will Roll"" and ""Dragon Queen"" periodically dissipate into an inchoate softness.</p>
<p>The ninth song on <i>Fever to Tell </i>was ""Maps"", a fleeting glimpse of vulnerability on an album of gleeful scorn. On <i>It's Blitz! </i>that slot is occupied by ""Hysteric"", a song every bit as emotionally naked and immediately indelible as ""Maps"". Here though, it represents an island of piercing clarity and happy convention in a sea of bewilderment, impulse, and ecstasy.</p></div>"|12855.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12855-its-blitz/|8.1|Joshua Love

By the time he came to rock music, in his early 40s, the French star had traced his oblique, provocative course through <i>chanson </i>(French vocal music), jazz, and light pop. He'd made percussive café jams about suicide and given Eurovision popstrels France Gall and Françoise Hardy songs full of blowjob puns. Later on he'd make a rock'n'roll album about the Nazis and a reggae take on the French national anthem. A pattern emerges: Gainsbourg hops from style to style, but with a terrific instinct for finding the most startling content for any given form.</p>
<p>So it's no surprise his rock work-- the early 1970s albums, of which <i>Histoire de Melody Nelson</i> is the first and finest-- was so original. <i>Melody Nelson</i> is a collaboration with composer and arranger Jean-Claude Vannier, who assembled a bunch of top sessionmen for the album. But Gainsbourg and Vannier had little interest in the conventions that had accreted around early 70s rock. Like a lot of 1971 records, <i>Histoire de Melody Nelson</i> is a concept album: Unlike most, it's only 28 minutes long. The songs are lavishly orchestrated, yet the dominant instrument isn't guitar or organ but rather Herbie Flowers' lascivious, treacly bass, playing a seedy, rambling take on funk.</p>
<p>That bass is the first sound you hear on <i>Melody Nelson</i>, quietly tracking up and down in a windscreen-wiper rhythm: Gainsbourg starts talking in French 30 seconds later, describing a night drive in a Rolls Royce Silver Ghost. The album is routinely described as ""cinematic,"" but the music is more of a mindtrack than a soundtrack-- a tar pit of introspection when Gainsbourg's brooding narrator is alone at the record's beginning and end, then giddy and savage by turns as he conducts his affair with the 15-year-old Melody across the short tracks in the album's middle. One of these-- ""Ballade de Melody Nelson""-- is, even at two minutes, one of Gainsbourg's most assured and alluring pop songs.</p>
<p>A lot of Gainsbourg's records are hard sells for Anglophone ears-- the music is there to illuminate and pace the man's riotous, sensual wordplay. But Gainsbourg's alliance with Vannier produced a true collaboration: The arrangements seem to respond almost intuitively to the twists in Gainsbourg's language and narrative, to the point where they're carrying as much storytelling weight as the words. Even if your French stops at ""bonjour"", the music lets you know that this is a record about a dark, obsessional love. On ""L'hôtel Particulier"", for instance-- describing the sleazy grandeur of the rented rooms where the narrator and Melody make love-- Gainsbourg's voice shudders with lust and dread, and the music responds, flares of piano and string breaking into the song over an impatient bassline.</p>
<p>The actual story of <i>Histoire de Melody Nelson</i> is pretty negligible in any case-- man meets girl, man seduces girl, girl dies in freak plane crash. Melody herself (played by Jane Birkin, Gainsbourg's then-lover) is a cipher-- a breathed name, a ticklish squeal or two, and red hair. The album is all about its narrator: A natural obsessive just looking for an object; introspective before he meets Melody, more so after her death. First and final tracks ""Melody"" and ""Cargo Culte"" are musical siblings, with only the wordless chorales on ""Cargo Culte"" really distinguishing them.</p>
<p>Together these songs take up more than half the record, and when people claim <i>Melody Nelson</i> as an influence, it's almost certainly with this pair in mind. The soundworld they create is like nothing else in rock-- orchestra, bass, and voice circling one another, blending slow funk, intimate mumbling, and widescreen scope. One precedent is the epic soul Isaac Hayes had been pioneering, but where <i>Hot Buttered Soul</i> is full of warmth and engagement, the bookend tracks of <i>Melody Nelson</i> are a trip through far more hostile territories, the black spaces of a man's interior.</p>
<p>Gainsbourg realized he'd made something special-- he named his publishing company Melody Nelson after his fictional muse-- but, restless as ever, he didn't follow it up: His next album was a sequence of pretty acoustic songs, mostly about shit. Herbie Flowers, whose bass is the undertow pulling the album together, surfaced a year later playing on Lou Reed's ""Walk on the Wild Side"", whose bassline is the first ripple of <i>Melody Nelson</i>'s wider pop culture influence. Since then it's been left to others-- Jarvis Cocker, Beck, Tricky, Air, Broadcast-- to pick up this record's breadcrumb trail. But Gainsbourg's dark focus, and Vannier's responsiveness, aren't easily equalled. This reissue on luxuriously hefty vinyl is the first time the album's been released in the U.S.-- a superb opportunity to hear a record that's been occasionally imitated but never matched.</p></div>"|12852.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12852-histoire-de-melody-nelson/|10.0|Tom Ewing

After relocating to Chicago from Los Angeles,  where she studied composition at California Institute of the Arts, the  23-year-old Minnesota native has rounded up a small but dedicated fanbase  during extensive tours throughout Europe and the United States.</p>
<p>When I first saw Rossi perform live,  in Berlin during summer 2006, she was a member of Carla Bozulich's  touring band. Performing her solo set before the headline act, Rossi  stole the show with her charmingly nonchalant stage presence and distinctive  voice, which was accompanied solely by her viola and a few heated, percussive  foot stomps. Like her vocals, which often sound as though they may fall  out of tune at any moment yet never do, Rossi's unconventional viola  playing is a huge part of her appeal. Rather than bowing the strings,  she often prefers to strum and pluck, using the instrument to emphasize  and soundtrack her lyrics. On a popular live song,  for example, she emulates the sound of her ""father shoveling snow""  and ""cars on icy packed roads"" with a fricative scrape of  the strings that brings her tale of childhood winters in the Midwest  to life.</p>
<p>Anni Rossi's 4AD debut full-length,  <i> Rockwell</i>, named after her street in Chicago and keeping to a tradition  of titling recordings after places she has lived, is the conclusion  of a series of recording experiments taken over the last few years (full disclosure: I was in a band that released music on Too Pure, a label that also released music by Rossi).  Her instrumentation is so sparse that it naturally calls for the highest  standards of recording to fully translate the relationship between the  vocals and strings, so it's not surprising that she chose to record  <i> Rockwell </i> with Steve Albini, albeit in a day. The result is far closer  in sound to her splendid, confident live shows and less cluttered than  her 2007 effort  <i> Scandia</i>, which featured an abundance of orchestral  touches. New York City based composer Devin Maxwell, who provides effective  and unobtrusive drumming to all but one of the songs, and cellist Caroline  Burdette are the only other musicians featured on the album and round  the songs out nicely without convoluting their essential clarity.</p>
<p>While the majority of  <i> Rockwell </i> includes songs that Rossi has had in her repertoire for the last few  years, there are a couple of new gems. ""Las Vegas"", about  the pre-fight hopes of an ultimately defeated boxer, is lyrically one  of her most powerful songs and shows how stunning music can be when  kept stark and simple. Then there's her unlikely take on Ace of Base's  ""Living in Danger"", which is a lighthearted match for her  live cover of the Cure's ""Inbetween Days"" and serves to highlight  her considerable appetite for pop music, which is just as present on  <i> Rockwell </i> as her capacity for writing songs with classical sensibility.  Perhaps most enjoyable of all is that there's something remarkably personable  about this album, as though Anni Rossi is right there in the room with  you, singing her heart out about beekeeping in the Himalayas, her love  for freezer units, and the troubles of driving to the west coast with  no air conditioning.</p></div>"|12747.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12747-rockwell/|8.0|Mia Clarke

With the Crunchy Black defection, the unbearably degrading MTV reality show, and the Good Charlotte collabo, it's tough to reconcile today's attention-hungry goofballs with the unruly, demonic fight-music mob that emerged out of Memphis not all that long ago. But they'll always have one thing that ties them to their hard-as-bones past, and that one thing is Project Pat.</p>
<p>Project Pat is Juicy J's brother, which ties him forever to half of the Three 6 nucleus. But Pat wouldn't know how to begin turning himself approachable. In 2001, he went to prison on gun possession charges only a few months after scoring his first and only solo hit. Since he got out in 2005, he's quietly churned out three solo albums, each harder and darker than the last.  <i> Real Recognize Real </i> is his hardest and darkest album yet, and with apologies to 2002's  <i> Layin' da Smack Down</i>, it's probably his best.</p>
<p>Pat doesn't sound tough, exactly, and he doesn't need to. He sounds eerie, and that's what makes his gun-talk resonate. His voice is a sort of detuned singsong squeak. His delivery is playful, but not in a friendly way. He rolls his syllables around in his mouth before spitting them out. For a few bars at a time, he'll try on a mocking playground melody or a horror-movie stage-whisper. He pronounces stuff wrong on purpose. He says stuff that doesn't make any sense: ""I'm more North Memphis than some dog food up ya nose."" On 2007's ""Bull Frog Yay"", he interrupted a track about dealing coke to chirp ""Ribbit!"" a bunch of times on the hook. Those oddball hiccups he throws into his flow only serve to underline the absolute control he flexes over his vocal meter, and on something like his masterful guest verse on 8Ball &amp; MJG's ""Relax &amp; Take Notes"", he manages to best two amazing bulldozer rappers by staying just somehow  <i> off</i>, keeping his voice flickering in the shadows.</p>
<p>After a quick skit,  <i> Real Recognize Real </i> opens with a thick, luxuriant sample of the O'Jays' ""Listen to the Clock on the Wall"", slowed down and distended on some classic Memphis soul-rap shit. Pat sounds great over those languorous horn bleats and looped-up coos, but it's a red herring. The album really starts a track later, on ""Slick Hater"", when DJ Paul and Juicy J (who produced this entire album just like they produce every Project Pat album) bury a peal of malevolent laughter under inspirational 1980s sports-movie synths, turning in one of the air-sucked-out gothic stomps they can still somehow create at will. All the track's little synth-bits interlock together into an overwhelming steamroller of a track, and Pat just tears it to pieces. His threats are so vivid and disturbing and oddly specific that they sort of become funny, the way it's funny when Jason squeezes somebody's head so his eyeball pops out at the camera: ""Snatch the panties off these lames like I would do a ho/ .44 revolver, barrel up the booty hole.""</p>
<p>From there, Pat's off. On ""Bang Smack"", he and fellow <i>sui generis</i> freaky libertine Gucci Mane trade faded verses over evocative keyboard wobbles, Pat comparing sex-noises to (seriously) a plunger. On ""Ain't Scared of Ya"", Pat makes boing-boing sound effects immediately after threatening to kick your mother in the face. On ""Choppa to Ya Dome"": ""I'm a gorilla, so I always shoot banana clips/ Torpedoes coming out my gun, tearing ya ligaments."" At some point during the recording process, Pat must've watched  <i> The Wizard of Oz</i>; he talks about foes ""dying like the Wicked Witch"" on ""Catch a Hot One"" (they're melting?), and then, two tracks later, he's getting brain like he went to see the Wizard. That weird combination of violence and hilarity is serious full-immersion stuff, and the way he bounces his voice around Paul and Juicy's hall-of-mirrors production, that immersion becomes just about irresistible. Nobody does aggro simmer like this guy, and when I'm in the right mood, I can't imagine listening to anyone else.</p></div>"|12802.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12802-real-recognize-real/|7.7|Tom Breihan

It opens with a really pretty, scratchy, warm guitar haze, but it doesn't stay there long. Pretty soon, everything flares up into a thundering groove, which pounds and pounds and pounds and then just stops. ""Merrimack"" could be three times as long as it is and nobody would blink. And even though it's become a massive cliché in underground metal to run a track like this into the ground, I can't help but wish Tombs would've spent a little more time digging in and zoning out on something like this. But no: four minutes, and then it's off to the next all-climax roar.</p>
<p>Right now, a pretty huge chunk of the American metal underground labors under the twin shadows of Neurosis and Isis, two bands that slowly build these monoliths of ire, songs that start out soft and pile on effects until they become blurry, gale-force maelstroms of fuzzed-out guitar and floor-tom thud. There's even a name for it: the Neur-Isis sound, logically enough. Even when this stuff is great (like when Neurosis does it), it can't help but smack of formula. Tombs take that formula and do something interesting with it: They start with the blistering climax, and they stay there. No windswept atmospheric intros, no drawn out outros. It's full-blast all the time. Only a couple of songs on <i>Winter Hours</i> soldier on past the five-minute mark, and most burn out way before. And only a couple of quick sculpted-feedback interludes give us a chance to catch our breaths.</p>
<p>In a way, that's sort of a brilliant approach. And it sure helps that Tombs are at home within their own sound. The grooves feel totally intuitive, even when they lurch into pseudo-black metal so-fast-they're-slow blurs. Frontman and Boston hardcore veteran Mike Hill has a great vein-bulging bellow that only really loses its impact when he stops shouting and tries to sing, which he rarely does. And he spends as much time doing these sort of vaseline-smeared Dick Dale hummingbird/bumblebee chattering guitar noises as he does playing actual riffs, knowing exactly when to snap from one to the other.</p>
<p>But the locked-in thunder of <i>Winter Hours</i> can get a bit exhausting. Staying in constant bombast mode keeps Tombs from letting much dynamic range creep into their attack, and they barely offer anything in the way of melody or structure. If you're in the right mood for that sort of cathartic, omnidirectional animosity, it's great. They have that sound down absolutely cold, and they never sound anything less than demonic. But I can't help but think that these tracks would hit so much harder if they came attached to actual <i>songs</i>, if Tombs developed their sound beyond the narrow but suffocating crunch they offer here. Theirs is a sound you can get totally lost in, when they let you.</p></div>"|12834.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12834-winter-hours/|7.1|Tom Breihan

Despite a lead single (""Only This Moment"") that foresaw trance's miniature mainstream resurgence and memorable contributions from Karin Driejer (whose ""What Else Is There"" ranks among Röyksopp's finest songs) and Chelonis R. Jones (whose syncopated ""49 Percent"" helped eke the Norwegian duo into more credible techno territory), this darker, more textured follow-up stalled at the gate. In retrospect, it was probably done under by both expectation and competition: Not only did <i>The Understanding</i> fail to deliver anything as relentlessly chirpy as early single ""Eple"" or as friendly and as instantaneous as the Geico Caveman-endorsed ""Remind Me"", but it was also up against increasingly significant competition from the emergent Scandinavian electro-pop scene.</p>
<p><i>Junior</i> is Röyksopp's third album in eight years and finds them synthesizing the highs and lows from their previous records to strike a knowing middle ground. While it might be oversimplifying matters to suggest that it splits the difference between the cute, poppy Röyksopp and the darker, techno-friendly Röyksopp, the most satisfying thing about <i>Junior</i> is how convincingly they've bridged that divide. In doing so, they've managed to solve the niggling problems inherent to <i>Melody A.M.</i> and <i>The Understanding</i>-- neither sickly sweet or unsuitably gloomy, <i>Junior</i> is arguably the pair's strongest album.</p>
<p>If you're a production duo like Röyksopp, a lot of your success is dependent upon the singers you surround yourself with, and they've chosen wisely here: In addition to a pair of encore performances from Dreijer, <i>Junior</i> also includes turns from Robyn, Lykke Li, and frequent contributor Anneli Drecker. The high points are pretty much as you'd expect; Driejer does double duty, lending an uncharacteristically creamy falsetto to the disco-inflected workout ""This Must Be It"" as well as a typically nervy vocal to the double-timed horrorshow piece ""Tricky Tricky"". Elsewhere, Robyn overdelivers, accounting not only for the best track on the album, but possibly of the year: Influenced in equal parts by Italo disco and ""Blue Monday"", ""The Girl and the Robot"" is a frigid, winding bit of electro that combines a powerhouse vocal with some slippery chord changes and one of the biggest choruses of 2009 so far.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, fans of Röyksopp's pop confectionaries needn't look farther than lead single ""Happy Up Here"", whose dumb, gloopy loop is so infectious that it manages to coast along without the aid of (or need for) any supporting song structure. The pair also hit with ""Röyksopp Forever"", a starry, string-aided instrumental that starts out sounding like a proggier, second-rate Air before saving itself with a legitimately momentous key change. Some of the other album cuts flirt with downtempo conventions to less flattering outcomes; in fact, if there are any criticisms to be made here, they probably have to do with Röyksopp's tendency to veer into over-produced tastefulness. The worst offender is probably ""Silver Cruiser"", which exposes the pair's overly finessed production skills and temporarily veers the record into Zero 7/Lemon Jelly/Groove Armada territory. Mostly, though, it's a divide they manage to stay on the right side of; if rumors are true and <i>Junior</i> is in the fact the companion to a slower, more ambient album called <i>Senior</i> due for release later this year, it'll be interesting to see just how long they can keep that up.</p></div>"|12860.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12860-junior/|7.9|Mark Pytlik

I think I'm paraphrasing fellow music critic Chuck Eddy here. Remember your first slow dances, seventh or eight grade? For me there was a lot of nervous excitement, plus whatever you call the emotion when you're a clumsy preteen dancing to ""The End of the Road"" with the girl you like, or ""I Swear"" with the girl who likes you. I seem to recall high school dances being similarly fraught. Now try to think of the last time you <i>felt </i>something that intensely.</p>
<p>Jeremy Jay, then, must live in Neverland. But is he Peter Pan-- or Michael Jackson? The question gets more interesting on the hiccupy-voiced Paris/L.A. bandleader's second K Records LP. It's the most weirdly mesmerizing in a series of promising single, EP, and full-length releases that includes last year's shadowy, cinematic heart-tugger <i>A Place Where We Could Go</i>. Jay's the type of guy who tours with Deerhunter but covers Madonna just as naturally as Brian Eno. Billed as winter-themed, <i>Slow Dance</i> uses crisp garage-rock and frigid post-punk as a backdrop for romanticized pop fantasy.</p>
<p>""Slow dance"" has has basically emerged as its own, resurgent genre these past several years: the cosmic disco of Lindstrøm, Prins Thomas, and Todd Terje; the flamenco-inflamed beach trips of Studio, Boat Club, Hatchback, and Windsurf; the after-hours glide of Glass Candy and Chromatics; the sample-based vacations of Quiet Village and Air France. That connection is probably a coincidence. But then again, maybe it isn't. On the first few listens, I noticed the record's minimal yet evocative lyrical repetitions less than its snow-globe-meticulous sound. Jay recorded the album in winter at Olympia's Dub Narcotic Studio, with bassist Derek James, drummer Nick Pahl, and additional guitarist Ilya Malinsky; the early nights and electric lighting of the season are all over the frosty synth-and-guitar surface of opener ""We Were There"" (a new version of a 2007 single), the slow strums and cold breaths of gorgeously spare ""Winter Wonder"", and the choked sobs and fingersnaps of piano waltz ""Slow Dance 2"". ""You've got the rhythm,"" Jay insists on ""In This Lonely Town"".</p>
<p>That song also captures a vivid scene, maybe the opening of a film: the narrator walking with his peacoat on, seeing fish by the pier, smelling coffee and sweets by the ""pizza club."" Part of the pleasure of repeat listens is trying to figure out whether Jay is just too innocent to be true-- like, what's he hiding, right? ""Giddyup, horsey, giddyup,"" goes ""Gallop""; ""Canter, canter, canter,"" adds the next song, ""Canter Canter"". And there Jay is, amid the ""disco lights"" (!) and Drifters-style percussion of ""Will You Dance With Me?"", resting his head on your shoulders, ""melting in your arms tonight."" Jay envisions an angelic guitar-strummer illuminated by a disco ball (!!) on ""Where Could We Go Tonight?"", again raising more questions than answers. In the final seconds of the most urgent-sounding track, ""Breaking the Ice"", he murmurs almost as an aside: ""Should've told you that I love you."" You could choose to dismiss it all as kids' stuff. But that's the idiot talking.</p></div>"|12832.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12832-slow-dance/|7.7|Marc Hogan

One has to wonder, however, if there weren't a few seasoned fans in that audience whose ""awwww""s were underscored by ""uh-oh""s. The songwriter settling down here is, after all, one of the better chroniclers of heartbreak, betrayal, and the other side of love working at the moment. And while no decent person could wish misery on another just for the sake of song, we've nevertheless seen plenty of talents derailed by rehab, children, and holy matrimony.</p>
<p>But let's not get carried away: What we do know is something-- maybe marriage, maybe a general restlessness, maybe straight-up serendipity-- woke Jurado up after 2006's stately and sometimes sleepy  <i> Now That I'm in Your Shadow</i>. The result, 2008 opus  <i> Caught in the Trees</i>, features a rock solid outing from backing bandmates Jenna Conrad and Eric Fisher supporting some of Jurado's best songwriting to date-- not to mention his most rousing musical offerings since  <i> I Break Chairs</i>, all congealing in a manner one can't help but call effortless.</p>
<p>Opener ""Gillian Was a Horse"" sets the bar high, thanks to crisp drumming and the clockwork crunch of a maraca. ""Trials"" and ""Caskets"" are similarly propulsive, carried along by confident strums and a viscous bassline, respectively. Elsewhere, ""Last Rights"" sails along a bed of strings. Gone are the pregnant silences that punctuated  <i> Shadow</i>, and with them the hesitant tempos of hopelessness.  <i> Caught in the Trees</i>, quite simply, is too busy moving along to get too caught up in anything.</p>
<p>Which isn't to say Jurado's usual complexities aren't here; if he has ever written an unequivocally contented song, I've yet to hear it. Indeed, a good half of the numbers on  <i> Caught in the Trees </i> deal directly with a favorite theme of Jurado's: the fallout from infidelity, manifest most often here in repeated references to lies, liars, lying, specters of jealous husbands, and ""bullshit talkers."" Yet there's a sense of progress too, of looming reconciliation or at the very least the intention to work things through rather than dwell on them. ""Dimes"" begins with Jurado resolving to call a lover's husband, and ends by asking ""What happens now, when it all goes down?"" Later, ""Sheets"" seems to take that husband's perspective, with the lover cast as ""a wounded bird needing a nest."" By ""Best Dress"", someone-- could be the lover, could be the husband-- sounds prepared the claim the embattled woman as his own once and for all.</p>
<p>Still, the most satisfying moments on  <i> Trees </i> are those that find Jurado and his band embracing their pop sensibilities: ""Gillian"" is a thing of wondrous songwriting efficacy, its verses all snapping snugly into place like so many Lego blocks. Album high point ""Go First"" triumphs as both the record's most dynamic and anthemic track, and like ""Gillian"", also makes the most concessions to standard verse-chorus structure.  <i> Trees</i>' latter half culminates with ""Paper Kite"", which conveys a drama and a desolation that go beyond Jurado's words thanks to atmospheric production flourishes. These three tracks in particular feel the most removed from  <i> Shadow</i>, and, we might speculate, the most indicative of what our groom may have in store post-honeymoon. If that is so, then by all means: till death do them part.</p></div>"|12773.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12773-caught-in-the-trees/|7.3|Matthew Solarski

Dubstep-- the brooding, bass-heavy offshoot of UK garage-- had been enjoying a brief burst of popularity with the international record nerd community. Early Various singles like ""Hater"" swiped dubstep's instantly recognizable low-end wobble and syncopated snares, while adding a few moderately novel touches: Perhaps only in a genre glutted with minimalist electronic instrumentals could the simple addition of acoustic instruments and trip-hop vocals lead to instant online buzz.</p>
<p>And that buzz only grew louder thanks to Various' packaging decisions. Various released its early singles on indie-friendly 7"" vinyl, dressing them up with decadent, hand-drawn covers that featured little in the way of identifying information about the men (or women) responsible for the music. This old-school media blackout was a red flag to novelty-starved critics used to access to everything from bathroom habits to the location of birthmarks. Various was all set to cement its rep as the sorta-dubstep <i>act du jour</i> when  <i> The World Is Gone </i> dropped on the well-distributed XL label.</p>
<p>The reviews for  <i> The World Is Gone </i> were mostly excellent, and rightly so. But dubstep's moment of quasi-mainstream attention turned out to be less than a blip, at least in America. (Aside from Burial, maybe, but that's another review.) Now Various, their purposeful anonymity shtick leaving them vaguely aligned with any particular scene, was well suited to weather this sudden lack of attention, as dubstep's core producers retreated to the international (but UK-centered) underground. But instead of fleeing for the safety of chill out culture or morphing into a post-rock act or some other lame-ass audience-building measure, Various issued a remix comp and a handful of singles that pledged allegiance to the digital brutalism of dubstep's new school.</p>
<p>And now comes album number two,  <i> The Invisible Lodger</i>, closer to the funereal mood of  <i> The World is Gone </i> than the 8-bit beatdowns of current dubstep hotshots like Rustie and Zomby. (A partial exception is ""Robot Dialogue"", where the corrosive bleeps come off like Various' take on recent ""wonky"" singles, but at a tempo that suggests its creators were very sad and/or very stoned.) So the rain-soaked vibe remains, but rhythmically the doggedly downcast  <i> Invisible Lodger </i> owes very little to the sinister, club-ready throb of the duo's own early work. ""The Unwritten Book"", in fact, sounds uncannily like an old Mogwai demo. The ratio of gloom-rock to garage has been sharply inverted on  <i> The Invisible Lodger</i>. Whereas Various tunes once stood out by mixing fragile fingerpicked guitar with brutish, sampler-built cyborg grooves, new tracks like ""The Pure Sun"" and ""English Estate"", with their Radiophonic Workshop synth sweeps and wheezing accordions, float along almost beat-free.</p>
<p>But not vocal-free. On  <i> The World is Gone</i>, the femme vocals added replay value to a genre that, stripped of the human voice, could get pretty repetitive. (Hey, even acknowledged techno geniuses would have a hard time coming up with an interesting 60 minutes using  <i> just </i> beats and bass.) The ladies stayed home this time out, and Various drafted a lone male vocalist: Scottish poet Gerry Mitchell. Not a brilliant move, true, but not a crippling blow. At the risk of being castigated by poetry fans and Mitchell's mom, I have to admit I didn't spend a lot of time on lyrical analysis while listening to  <i> The Invisible Lodger</i>. Those in the know may think Mitchell's work is spectacular or truly awful, but it didn't detract from my enjoyment of the album. It didn't particularly enhance it, either. The  <i> sound </i> of his voice, however, adds an extra layer of campy desolation to Various' infinite sadness. Mitchell's batter-thick brogue becomes another instrument, one deployed with an occasionally irritating regularity. Now it's Various'  <i> music </i> that demonstrates an admirable range, while the vocals get pretty repetitive.</p>
<p>A lot of people are going to hate on this record, and needlessly so. I understand the involuntary internal shudder of revulsion caused by the phrase ""spoken word"" quite well. But  <i> The Invisible Lodger </i> is hardly a drastic change to Various' basic sound. (It's not as if they ditched some idiosyncratic, irreplaceable frontman with some dude hawking chapbooks on a Glasgow streetcorner.) Yes, it's hardly as good as  <i> The World is Gone </i> , but whether they collaborate with melancholy chick crooners hymning emotional masochism, or melancholy dude poets mumbling into their lager about the collapse of western civ, Various still knows their way around bummed out background music.</p></div>"|12792.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12792-the-invisible-lodger/|5.8|Jess Harvell

Probably more than the Mt. St. Helens Vietnam Band manages in ""Who's Asking"", the first track from their self-titled debut, but that's not to denigrate the group's dubious achievement. In those three short minutes, we get dramatically massed vocals, upshifted double-time guitars, half-time breakdowns, perky synth flourishes propelling a poppy bridge, and a disjointed, herky-jerk denouement. The following track, ""Masquerade"", is no less frustrating in its cut-and-paste approach, featuring irony-free metal leads and distracting waltz-time detours, both of which derail what might have been, left alone, a perfectly servicible rave-up. By ""Cheer for Fate"", the third track, the disc has ominously displayed a notable lack of traction, the songs slipping away out of control like a speeding car hydroplaning across the surface of a highway (and not in a good way).</p>
<p>And so it goes. Arrangements that never quite gel, tempo and tonal shifts that sabotage whatever momentum the Seattle band has managed to muster, flat production (courtesy Scott Colburn, who has otherwise impressive credits with Arcade Fire and Animal Collective to his name) that muffles the group's energy-- Mt. St. Helens Vietnam Band sound like a bunch of talented, precocious kids let loose for an afternoon in a studio and given until the end of the day to devise their grand statement. It tries too hard, yet somehow, at the same time, not hard enough.</p>
<p>The fact that the band seems in such good spirits throughout does at least mitigate the record's half-baked feel. These glimmers of giddiness boost ""Going on a Hunt"" and ""Dull Reason"" out of the ghetto of the totally tedious, injecting some grinning character into songs otherwise grimly by-the-books. Indeed, no matter how many quirky, gimmicky twists and turns tunes like ""Little Red Shoes"" or ""En Fuego"" might take-- and the latter, for example, does swerve suddenly from those Iron Maiden-ready leads to moments of pensive introspection, however fleetingly-- they never take us anywhere truly surprising, let alone interesting.</p>
<p>In fact, when the record does hit a quiet patch, as it does at the start of the string-laden final track ""On the Collar"", the strategy backfires, since you wait with baited breath for some sudden change that for once never comes. Albums that leave you wanting more are one thing. Albums that leave you hanging are something else. With more experience, the group could perhaps one day drum up a more cohesive, compelling vision, something that reaches out and grabs you. For now, though, the band's grasping at straws.</p></div>"|12815.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12815-mt-st-helens-vietnam-band/|3.9|Joshua Klein

I'd certainly prefer to think of a more original way to introduce a Pete Doherty solo album, but it's not like he's left me much choice.  And besides, ""tired"" shows up twice as much as ""drugs,"" because it's really exhaustion that defines following Doherty: Either you're tired of the questionable appendage of ""genius"" to ""smack-addled,"" or you're tired of nearly everything Doherty's done since <i>Up the Bracket</i> being a vehicle for laments on how far off the grid he's gone.</p>
<p>So no surprise that Doherty's sobriety (his game is grown, prefer you call him ""Peter"") is the biggest selling point for <i>Grace/Wasteland</i> as opposed to its long-time-coming partnerships with Blur guitarist Graham Coxon and famed producer Stephen Street (the Smiths, Blur). Imagining an alternate reality where ""Radio America"" was the jumping off point for the rest of his career, <i>Grace </i>is a record that splits the difference between its collaborators: Though largely acoustic and peppered with plenty UK signifiers of string pads, light drums, horns, and shuffle/skiffle tempos, its production resembles that of any Coxon solo record, closely mic'd to the point where everything sounds smudged. As Doherty's voice continues to take on a sort of empathetic piteousness, this sort of unkempt sonic rendering adds a humanizing touch.</p>
<p>None of which excuses the main problem with <i>Grace/Wastelands--</i> an absence of memorable songs. It's a new beginning and a definitive closing as some of <i>Grace</i> is taken from songs that have aged more than five years. Either way, it's hard to tell what's been written in a week and which ones come with a ratpack stench. Though ""A Little Death Around the Eyes"" has a slinky seductiveness, it's saddled with lyrics that are pure placeholder-- ""Your boyfriend's name was Dave/ I was bold and brave/ And now you're mine."" Other times, the influence of Coxon manifests in a tendency to stuff as many chord changes into a verse regardless of whether Doherty can think up a decent melody to lay on top of it. Most of the time, he's not up to task, as on ""1939 Returning"", which details the plight of a World War II soldier turned dissident without paying much attention to writing hooks.</p>
<p>More successful is ""The Last of the English Roses"", which combines the strongest melody with the most intriguing arrangement. It's also the most far removed from anything Dohetry's tried to date, riding a distant melodica (is there any other kind?) and a Paul Simonon-style dubby bass over a Madchester beat into something that could play in the same junkyard as Simonon's Damon Albarn collaborations with the Good, the Bad &amp; the Queen.</p>
<p>But the lyrical bookends of <i>Grace/Wastelands</i> suggest that Doherty hasn't kicked his tendency to plant Easter egg lyrics to the point of distraction. Each with a wink, the record is bookended with an antiquated ideas of escape-- the pastoral escape plan ""Arcady"" bemoans when you've outgrown your teachers with a loaded, sophomoric reference to ""seraphic pipes"" and closer ""New Love Grows on Trees"" turns 25 into the new 50 with a plea for a death sentence. And then there's ""Sheepskin Tearaway"" and the flatulent music hall number ""Sweet By and By"" which prop themselves up on the assumption that you have any interest in hearing the last bit of gristle picked from his beefs with Kate Moss and the Libertines.</p>
<p>Still, best thing he's done since the debut? Well, sure-- regardless of what exactly that means, it can be <i>viewed</i> as a comeback and one that can keep his cottage industry chugging along. Problem is, the more traditionally reflective <i>Grace/Wastelands</i> just manages to make his solipsism double over on itself and your memories of listening to <i>Up the Bracket</i> are more rewarding than his memories of making it.</p></div>"|12857.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12857-gracewastelands/|5.7|Ian Cohen

Unfettered by the burgeoning expectations of their fans and, most vitally, themselves, the baby steps of a new musical project are often at their most powerful with reflection, when you locate how early records helped build a band's character-- think, for example, of Sonic Youth's <i>Confusion Is Sex</i>, Pink Floyd's <i>Outtakes From Outer Space</i>, or Touch and Go's compilation of the Jesus Lizard's early recordings, <i>Head/Pure</i>. While early material may not be the highlight of a group's discography, it's here that listeners often find their boldest, most uncompromising, and experimental work. It is the charm of a new beginning, the first marks on a blank canvas.</p>
<p>This is acknowledged by Fridge bass player turned solo artist Adem Ilhan in the evocative liner notes to <i>Early Output 1996-1998</i>: ""(We were) trying to make music that didn't sound like anything else; all of us not quite skilled enough to translate the sound in our head onto cassette, but creatively filling the gaps, using them and making them integral."" This pretty much sums up the appeal of this collection of Fridge's rare early releases on Trevor Jackson's now-disbanded Output Recordings imprint. Paired with six previously unreleased tracks, <i>Early Output 1996-1998</i> is the sound of a young band holed up in a south London basement with limited gear, finding itself through extended improvisations and trial-and-error composition. While the material doesn't match up to their finest album, <i>Happiness</i> (2001), it's interesting to hear what the English post-rock trio were up to and influenced by while bands such as Tortoise and Do Make Say Think were experimenting in a similar field on the other side of the pond.</p>
<p>Comprising Four Tet's Kieran Hebden, Ilhan, and drummer Sam Jeffers, Fridge are known for bringing color to their brilliant, rhythm focused experimental rock with heavy sampling, a predilection that really came into the foreground around the release of their third album, <i>Eph</i>. The building blocks of their initial sample dabbling are evident here though, creeping stealthily in and out of songs such as ""Helicopter"" and the thorny assault of distortion on ""Cassette"".</p>
<p>Although <i>Early Output 1996-1998</i> is more of a thoroughly enjoyable thought piece for Fridge/Four Tet/Adem fans rather than a solid introduction to the group's work, the 21 tracks on offer, which are arranged in chronological order, show an incredible musical range for a largely self-taught band whose members were barely out of their teens. On ambient, bass-anchored songs like ""Zedex Ay Ti Wan"" and the 15-minute krautrock freak-out ""Anglepoised"" the trio sound like they're channeling Can, yet a little later their sound is drenched in robotic funk on ""For Force"", and towards the end the listener is led through a sonic jungle of grunge influenced power chords on ""Swerve and Spin"", plus a spat of tracks that run just shy of a minute and consist purely of gnarly feedback.</p>
<p>The greatest pleasure of <i>Early Output 1996-1998</i> is hearing just how much Fridge are enjoying themselves as they confront their technical limitations, take the bull by the horns, and set out on the path that led to the members' impressively innovative careers both in Fridge and their respective solo projects. It's patchy at times, as one would expect, but feeds on the fire of youth and the result is passionate and elegantly playful.</p></div>"|12854.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12854-early-output-1996-1998/|6.8|Mia Clarke

The band has released consistently strong albums since its 2000 inception and garnered high praise from their countrymen-- up against Aussie faves Wolfmother and the Go-Betweens, they won the inaugural Australian Music Prize for their 2005 record <i>Wait Long by the River and the Bodies of Your Enemies Will Float By</i>-- but still are mostly unknown to European and American listeners. It's hard to say precisely what accounts for this disconnect, but I propose a name change might be in order: there's nothing drone-y about what these guys do.</p>
<p>Despite what their moniker suggests, the Drones are a high-velocity garage-blues act-- something like Gun Club with punk swapped out for capital-H hard rock. They're traditional in the way Black Lips are-- straightforward instrumentation, a healthy nod to the past-- but manage to dodge the pitfalls of revisionism with an unusual mixture of brute force, bleak lyrical content, and singer Gareth Liddiard's distinctive caterwaul. (Dude can impressively shift from a bark to a shriek to a roar in one solitary breath.) It's an intense concoction that casual indie fans will probably find abrasive, but a degree of unfriendliness seems to be part of the group's M.O.</p>
<p>Previous records emphasized the Drones' fierceness with mostly aggressive tracks, and while <i> Havilah</i> (their fifth) trades some of that for slower, dirge-like pieces, they start the album with a bang... literally. Opener ""Nail It Down"" rumbles for a few minutes before launching a violent guitar-and-drum assault. That energy carries over to ""The Minotaur"", a song that's equally wicked sounding but contains moments of well-placed melody to keep it from becoming overbearing. Oddly catchy, these songs aren't totally dissimilar from the harder-edged moments of bands such as Queens of the Stone Age, but with the Drones' oft-stated distaste for the human race and lyrics like ""People are a waste of food/ They're only ever happy when they're burying their friends"" (from ""Oh My""), it's hard to imagine them getting played on KROQ anytime soon.</p>
<p><i>Havilah</i> broadens the Drones' sonic palette and continues to carve out a sound that is uniquely theirs, and in that sense it's an accomplishment, but wrestling with the record's dark subject matter makes it a difficult listen. This is especially the case on unhurried, acoustic tracks like ""I Am the Supercargo"" where the vocals sit upfront in the mix and there's no captivating rock melody to latch onto. There's nothing to feel chipper about ""The Drifting Housewife"", for instance, where Liddiard contemplates a failed marriage over a twang-y Neil Young-inspired ballad. ""I was more worried about taxes when my lovely red-eyed bride became a hairsplitting believer that I should be vilified,"" he sings. Nope, that doesn't sound like a healthy relationship.</p>
<p>The record's back-end is where most of its slower material resides-- the very dark stretch that begins with ""Cold and Sober"" and closes with ""Penumbra"" will be the most trying for listeners. These tracks (and the lingering, amber-hued ""Luck in the Odd Numbers"" between them) show the group at their most frustrated and fatigued. Lyrically, at least, it's pretty brutal stuff. Closer ""Your Acting's Like the End of the World"" finally provides some light at the end of the tunnel, where Liddiard sings, ""All this doom and gloom has got to me/ I can't take another punch"", and we're with him there, but surely some won't make it to that point. I'd suggest trying to stick it out, though. Enduring this album is a bit like making it through a powerful-but-disturbing film. It might make you uncomfortable and you'll probably never watch it again, but you're at least glad you saw it.</p></div>"|12836.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12836-havilah/|7.7|Joe Colly

Skeletons' last album, <i>Lucas</i>, came closer to greatness than you might expect of a band devoting a career to glitch-beat-gospel. <i>Lucas</i>' long-legged crawls through free jazz and group chants provided a charmingly decrepit counterpart to other fitful, urban creators like the Dirty Projectors.</p>
<p><i>Money</i> is the band's first album for Tomlab and their fifth overall, depending on your definition of album (like fellow New Yorkers Excepter, Skeletons have mastered the art of using the internet as both obscurant and portal to their art). Lead Skeleton Matthew Mehlan seems to have trimmed his small army of contributors to three regulars-- Jonathan Leland, Tony Lowe, and Jason McMahon-- all of whom contributed to <i>Lucas</i> as well.<i> </i>And <i>Money</i> continues an ongoing march toward stability, the Skeletons' lineup seemingly solidified and its name-- Skeletons has come appended with ""and the Girl-Faced Boys"" on ""<i>Git</i>""  and ""and the Kings of All Cities"" on <i>Lucas</i>-- left unchanged. (Should you want to re-convince yourself of the band's wide borders, know that the already ill-looking young girl on the album's cover is accompanied in the liners with full-panel drawings of cupped breasts and vaginal penetration.)</p>
<p>Mehlan's always been a little sex-brained-- see <i>Lucas</i>' ""Fake Tits""-- so funk is a natural, heh, bedfellow, but <i>Money</i> seeks that genre's fitful skronk more than its rubbery rhythms.  ""The THINGS"" opens with rumbling, moaning brass and sharp, tinny guitars. ""Fill My Pockets Full"" builds a small cacophony out of blasts of city-noise-- car horns, street chatter-- and two notes on a nervous piano. ""Dripper"" makes skittish, jazzy runs on an acoustic guitar.</p>
<p><i>Money</i> is a fitting title for the album, and it's worth wondering if Mehlan's been feeling the predictable strains of the consistently creative.  His prayers and petitions are eminently practical: ""Fill my pockets full/ My fridge with food to eat,"" he sings. Later, during ""STEPPER (aka Work)"", Mehlan sings, ""I'm gonna get paid enough to survive so I quit complaining for once in my life,"" slurring the ""paid"" as his band carves out a small strut.</p>
<p>So <i>Money</i>'s most alluring, come-hither track-- ""STEPPER""-- is a song about sticking with shit situations, but much of the album feels exclusive and angry in both sound and thought. Mehlan used to be charmingly offbeat, his city-hippie poses weird and welcoming. ""Why would I want to know these things/ The children of rich men know these things,"" Mehlan spits during ""The THINGS"", but that pales in comparison to the prickle Skeletons display during ""Eleven (IT'll RAIN)"", which abandons its pop-whimsy opening moments for caterwauling screams before returning to a Latin-leaning, horn-led coda. ""Unrelentinglessness"" caws slowly, contrary to its title, with Mehlan's nasal whinny sounding like a detriment over the track's un-tuned nonsense.</p>
<p>""BOOOM! (Money)"" (at least Mehlan has a healthy sense of humor about the green) hurries through wearying, chippy verses before launching seven minutes of quesey jamming in which Skeletons actually sound like they're beating nod-able rhythms back with their instruments. Money is full of tracks like this, songs in which Mehlan abandons poetry or eloquence, slumping his shoulders during cluttered, unspoken passages. ""BOOOM!"" is the sour gristle at the center, a brawny, stuffy album that sees Mehlan turn his wide-eyed creativity toward big adult messes. <i>Money</i> is no less creative or searching than Skeletons' previous works, but it trades too many of their fantastical charms for scurrying reality.</p></div>"|12791.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12791-money/|5.9|Andrew Gaerig

His grief-drenched 2007 debut, <i>Ash Wednesday</i>, explicitly and covertly referenced the death of his photographer mother in the 9/11 attacks and his actor father's from AIDS complications a decade earlier. Yet the record wasn't really depressing. It was melancholy, ruminative, allusive, and droll perhaps but also amazingly light on its feet, thanks to the tasteful brass, strings, and percussion that skirted Perkins' reedy tenor and acoustic guitar. Lyrics are the sine qua non of the troubadour game, and Perkins has shown he has a skillful way with words. ""I waited for the riddled sky to be solved again by the sunrise/ I've made a death suit for life for my father's ill widowed wife"" he sang in ""While You Were Sleeping,"" the exquisitely moving <i>Ash Wednesday</i> opener that earned him the ""next Dylan"" albatross for his troubles.</p>
<p>Track one is again the standout on second LP, <i>Elvis Perkins in Dearland</i>, an album that formally incorporates Perkins' three-piece touring band (among them, the trio play an impressive 10 instruments, including saxophone, harmonium, and clarinet). And if it wasn't already clear that the Dylan comparison is a nonstarter, Perkins proves an able bandleader, both charismatic and comfortable ceding the stage to his mates. Like a florescent bulb gradually growing to full vibrancy, ""Shampoo"" fades in on a dense swarm of whistles, strummed guitar and damp organ before a crisp, snapped snare kicks off the terrific folk-rocker proper. It's unambiguously a band, not a singer-songwriter, performance.</p>
<p>The lyrics' opacity make it hard to say for sure, but I like to think ""Shampoo"" cites director Hal Ashby's 1975 comic yet caustic referendum on 60s counterculture (set on the cusp of Richard Nixon's 1968 election win), a film that begins as a sexual morality tale and ends as a mortality one. ""I don't want to die/ However dark tomorrow may be,"" Perkins sing-slurs from our own anxious political/cultural crossroads. Given his personal history, it's easy to imagine him, at that moment, as a sort of sacrificial lamb/prophet.</p>
<p>As ""Shampoo"" hints (""Black is the color of my true love's arrow/ Black is the color of my blood"" inverts an amorous blues convention) Perkins has sloughed many of his earlier folk influences for the R&amp;B base of nascent rock. On ""Hey"", the bopping upright bass, shadowy female harmonies (courtesy of Lavender Diamond's Becky Stark), and Perkins' strangulated basso profundo growl transport the song back half a century, or at least as far as the Fat Elvis era. ""Hours Last Stand"" is a straight-up Mississippi river-dredger (even if Perkins' voice will always sound more like Woody Guthrie's than Robert Johnson's); the bright and brassy ""Doomsday"" shoots for a New Orleans funeral vibe; and ""I Heard Your Voice in Dresden"" could be one of Buddy Holly's, replete with Lone Star hiccupped hollers.</p>
<p>Decent as these tracks are, the rest of the album never quite lives up to ""Shampoo""'s potential. And songs like ""I'll Be Arriving"" and closer ""How's Forever Been Baby"", whose harmonica whine is more giggle-inducing than profound, are lead anchors. Fortunately, such maudlin moves are rare and Perkins' ability to air out material that continues to brood on death, abandonment and ordinary ol' breakups is a credit to his good songwriting and arranging. The guy's probably got a superb album in him; <i>Dearland</i>, however, isn't it.</p></div>"|12823.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12823-elvis-perkins-in-dearland/|6.7|Amy Granzin

In other ways, though, the theatrical Portland folk-rockers' noble sojourn into heavy narrative prog-folk was probably always in the stars. Ornately antiquarian diction was their <i>Ziggy Stardust</i>. Ginormous song suites based on world folklore were their deaf, dumb, and blind kid. Yes, they were meant for <i>The Wall</i>.</p>
<p>In an interview with <i>Paste</i>, singing guitarist/songwriter Colin Meloy mentioned that <i>The Hazards of Love</i> was ""initially conceived as a musical... but I decided about halfway through my time in France that it wasn't going to work as a stage piece. But it would still work as a rock record, so that's where it ended up."" Alas, for all the derring-do of the Decemberists' resolutely un-sold-out (I guess?) fifth album, its failures as a stage piece may explain some of the problems that hamper it as a rock record.</p>
<p>It makes sense that the Decemberists would end up here. A willingness to make their fans put in some work, whether with fancy language or sprawling song suites, has been part of their steez ever since the baroque reveries of 2002 debut <i>Castaways and Cutouts</i> and stagey bookishness of 2003 breakthrough <i>Her Majesty</i>-- both of which still kick pantaloon. After 2004's <i>The Tain</i> EP flashed the first signs of metalhead envy, <i>Picaresque</i> a year later ended the Decemberists' indie years with their most relatable and poppiest album (still my favorite of theirs). Capitol debut <i>The Crane Wife</i> showed no symptoms of what Meloy had termed ""major-label sellout-itis"".</p>
<p><i>The Hazards of Love</i>, inspired by UK folkie Anne Briggs' 1966 EP of the same name, has thick stoner-metal sludge and peat-bogged prog-folk arpeggios. Tucker Martine, who mixed <i>The Crane Wife</i>, produces exactly right for the material, focusing on the songs. Multi-instrumentalist Jenny Conlee and bassist Nate Query add several string arrangements. Robyn Hitchcock adds subtle electric guitar textures on an instrumental interlude, and My Morning Jacket's Jim James and the Spinanes' Rebecca Gates are in there somewhere, too. Still, although the album's grandiose narrative about star-crossed lovers William and Margaret-- and the dastardly villains who beset them-- has some nice twists, it's not exactly Andrew Lloyd Webber. Usually here's where I'm supposed to say, ""That's OK, you don't have to follow the plot, because the songs stand on their own""-- except, with a few exceptions, they don't, not quite.</p>
<p>It doesn't simplify things that Meloy sings the parts of multiple characters, also including ""First Voice"" and ""The Rake"". The blessedly thorough lyric sheet makes advance mp3s like dark infanticide memoir ""The Rake's Song"" a lot funnier, full of witty wordplay (""I was wedded and it whetted my thirst"") and sly foreshadowing (""You think that I would be haunted""-- he will be), but reading isn't the same as listening. Too much work, not enough payoff. (Hmm, imagine <i>that</i>.)</p>
<p>Not that the Decemberists' latest has anywhere near the smugness that haters might wrongly expect-- they sang ""California One/Youth and Beauty Brigade"", calling ""all bed wetters"", after all. ""The Wanting Comes in Waves/Repaid"", in which Meloy's William argues against the Queen to set him free to be with his beloved, has blazing classic-rock riffs and a commanding vocal by My Brightest Diamond's Shara Worden. (The reprise is less essential, unless you're still following the plot.) Worden returns on the ""The Queen's Rebuke/The Crossing"", which has blistering dynamic shifts, an organ solo, and plenty of lurching Black Mountain heaviness. Surprisingly, it all sounds like the Decemberists, at least if you've been paying attention over the years.</p>
<p>For the love songs, then, <i>The Hazards of Love</i> puts on some Nashville twang. Pedal steel cries alongside swaying accordion on ""Isn't it a Lovely Night?"", with a precious post-orgasm (post-Pete &amp; the Pirates?) pun. As the pregnant Margaret, Lavender Diamond's Becky Stark is a welcome pairing for Meloy, smiling with<i> Princess Bride</i>-like serenity through her worries on ""Won't Want for Love (Margaret in the Taiga)""; Meloy's voice is at its vulnerable best on the trembling meadow-makeout ballad ""The Hazards of Love 2 (Wager All)"". I can take the undead children chanting on ""The Hazards of Love 3 (Revenge!)"", but not the watery wedding vows on the drunken finale-- what can I say, I really, really didn't like <i>Titanic</i>.</p>
<p>Enough happens musically on <i>The Hazards of Love</i> that I can still see it being fun for fans in a live setting, especially if you know the lyrics. On disc, though, it's largely missing the catchy choruses and verisimilar emotions that previously served as ballast for the Decemberists' gaudy eccentricities. As a turn toward metal, <i>The Tain</i> EP's smaller portion was more satisfying-- although, as mid-career change-ups go, this is still a fair piece more enjoyable than something like MMJ's <i>Evil Urges</i>.</p>
<p>""Doing <i>The Hazards of Love</i> took a lot out of me,"" Meloy confides in the press bio. ""And I'm definitely curious what will come out now that I've got this out of my system."" The Decemberists already released three non-album singles last year, compiled as the <i>Always the Bridesmaid </i>EP; ""Sleepless"", a lovely orchestral lullaby from the recent <i>Dark Was the Night</i> charity compilation, suggests the Decemberists still have plenty more nautical epics to perform. ""I've got nothing to hold onto,"" Meloy sings. A friend of Bobby McGee's once called that feeling freedom, and it only took a four-and-a-half-minute song.</p></div>"|12842.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12842-the-hazards-of-love/|5.7|Marc Hogan

It's a purposefully messy and undirected record that sounds like early Boredoms and industrial music. I have tried listening to it sitting down, standing up, on the bus, in my room, fixing soup, just before bed, and just after my morning coffee, and I don't like it very much. I will humbly try and explain why.</p>
<p>Growing is a drum-less project that, at best, makes rippling, druggy, and exquisitely loud drone music. Gang Gang Dance is, like Animal Collective, a hip, urbane band trying to integrate non-Western dance rhythms into experimental pop. Both are self-consciously progressive but take comfort in the past-- Growing in early ambient music and the sublime patterns of 1970s composition, and Gang Gang Dance in post-punk and no wave's tribal outliers.</p>
<p>I.U.D. is a side project that will be marketed based on its members (even in this review's homepage blurb), but it doesn't share a lot of common ground with either Gang Gang Dance or Growing. As a listener and writer, this is a simple but frustrating position to be in. Just because I own leather boots does not mean I want a hamburger. But if I give the hamburger a try and don't like it, my waiter will remind me that I ordered a hamburger not leather boots. Admittedly, that's not the cow's fault.</p>
<p>And yet there's a latent, dangerous fascination to stuff like side projects and stylistic departures-- Lil Wayne's terrible, post–Axe body spray rock music is interesting <i> because</i> it was made by Lil Wayne and not by a contractor who downgraded to day-old bread at Food Lion for a year to be able to afford Pro Tools. This is the sad, populous border at which audiences forsake the experience of music to psychologize and contextualize.</p>
<p>If I'm listening to I.U.D. fairly, they sound like a band with goals: music that feels animalistic but self-aware, chaotic but controlled. Most of the songs are built from layered shrieks, thuds, and samples. No real melodies, few discernible lyrics. The best tracks on <i>The Proper Sex</i> sound great on headphones-- the dense, spirited bricks of ""Glo Balls"" or ""911"", for example, where drums and voices tumble across the sound field, demanding attention for an instant before being wrestled aside. These are moments of violence and vitality. These are moments where I don't even register that I'm listening to I.U.D., let alone a Gang Gang Dance/Growing side project-- a full-on nightmare state that fellow New Yorkers Excepter and Black Dice have been chasing for nearly a decade.</p>
<p>But most of <i>The Proper Sex</i> is conducted with the compassion of a bank transaction: distracted, a little inert, a little perfunctory. I know, I should be taking I.U.D. at face value. Maybe the loping ""Girls Just Wanna (Time to Have Sex)"" and ""Monk Hummer""-- 11 and 8 minutes, respectively-- are supposed to lack... climax. In that case, it's blasé, threat-less industrial music, a concept with no more internal logic than skydiving from 20 feet. Ultimately, <i>The Proper Sex </i> sounds like a lark: harmless and a little ignorable for everyone involved; perfectly irrelevant; gravy-- in a way, just what you'd expect from a side project.</p></div>"|12856.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12856-the-proper-sex/|3.5|Mike Powell

Fellow Georgians Mastodon have rocketed to fame due to hard work, press hype, and acceptance by non-metalheads. Fellow Savannians Baroness have earned plaudits due to a sound that's more classic rock than metal. Kylesa, too, have alloyed sludge metal with melody and finesse. Their star, though, has brightened more slowly. After four albums and thousands of road miles logged, its shine has become brilliant.</p>
<p>Kylesa formed in 2001. From the beginning, it was somewhat of a mutt. Hardcore punk, crust punk, caveman metal, and rough-hewn prog did battle on its self-titled debut. 2005's  <i> To Walk a Middle Course </i> was darker, dragging sludge metal through murky depths. The following year's  <i> Time Will Fuse Its Worth </i> was a breakthrough for several reasons. First, its production was relatively clear, exposing diverse elements: flashes of psychedelia, dueling male and female vocals, punk and metal at each other's throats. Second, it was Kylesa's first album with two drummers. At that time, though, their impact was greater live than on record. Most importantly, the band discovered catchiness. ""Hollow Severer"" found guitarist/vocalist Phillip Cope carrying an actual tune, and its video got MTV exposure.</p>
<p>The lessons learned are manifest on  <i> Static Tensions</i>. In the past, Kylesa's songs were often about a minute too long. Their head-down pounding worked well live, but dragged on record. Now riffs repeat only when necessary. Songs climb up and down with relentless momentum. ""Scapegoat"", for example, is basically a hardcore punk two-step. But despite this newfound efficiency, the songs are more baroque than ever. They flaunt melodies shamelessly now. Choruses are insistent. Practically the whole record is hummable. The bright theme of ""Unknown Awareness"" arcs like a rainbow overhead. ""Running Red"" alternates Slayer harmonies with riffs redolent of Black Sabbath's ""Iron Man"". Laura Pleasants' singing, once a buried gem, is often upfront. She ranges from a mysterious coo to more forceful declamation. Both provide a feminine contrast to roiling, downtuned riffs underneath.</p>
<p>Headphones, or a good stereo, reveal this record's masterstroke: production that mostly separates the drummers hard left and right. This yields both greater clarity and density. Together, the drummers form a prickly thicket of percussion. But they often separate into rich counterpoint. ""Said and Done"", for example, pits blastbeats on the left against slow accents on the right. They're playing in time, but they're almost fighting each other. The body is torn as to how to react.</p>
<p>Such push and pull echoes Kylesa's lyrical obsession with time. Yesterday and tomorrow are common concerns. The specter of aging haunts this record, with repeated references to fading away. ""Insomnia for Months"" swims in a haze of ""Multitude of memories/ Left in a stupor/ Sobriety out of boredom."" But the delivery is sharp, with ride cymbals cutting through tumbling syncopations. Kylesa's lyrics lean towards the abstract and personal. They avoid grand gestures or obvious themes that allow for easy grasp. (Contrast, for example, Mastodon and mythology.) This time, though, grasp is almost moot. The band has etched light, dark, sky, and earth so deftly onto wax that it vibrates the very soul.</p></div>"|12807.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12807-static-tensions/|8.2|Cosmo Lee

Black Emperor to, more recently, Deerhunter-- but from the start the concept behind the label has been pretty consistent: They sign what they like. In fact, as recalled in a recent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/7580-kranky/"" target=""_blank"">Pitchfork interview</a>, label founders Bruce Adams and Joel Leoschke originally formed Kranky specifically to distribute their discovery Labradford, and the rest rolled out from there. Other bands have brought it more money or attention, but looking back to its roots, Kranky remains the record label that Labradford built.</p>
<p>Alas, Labradford went on indefinite (if unofficial) hiatus back in 2001, but vocalist/guitarist Mark Nelson has continued to release records as Pan American, a close cousin to Labradford's trademark drone and drift. Given Nelson's minimalist métier, it's a wonder he's been able to get the mileage out of his music that he has. Yet Nelson's work as Pan American has been admirably consistent in tone if somewhat uneven in quality. The excellent 2004 release,<i> Quiet City</i>, for example, re-imagined Labradford as a radical chamber outfit (albeit still draped in static and gauze). But 2006's oblique meditation on fatherhood,<i> For Waiting, For Chasing</i>, was virtually weightless in its ambient approximation of amniotic stasis. Pan American is a small-scale project in every sense and only a fan could explain the differences between one album and the next. But by this point, it seems safe to say that Nelson is probably not out to make new converts.</p>
<p>The new  <i> White Bird Release </i> isn't nearly as passive as its predecessor, but at the same time, it does often hew closer to linear ambient drift compared to the dub-inflected early Pan American releases or Nelson's subtle experiments in rhythm. At times, the album recalls Eno's mysterious but organic opus <i>Ambient 4: On Land</i>. Other times it's more modern and digital, like something from Kompakt's pop ambient stable (with an even less-defined pulse). Throughout, however, it's proof of how ambient music can benefit from a songwriter's disciplined ear and instinct for concision.</p>
<p><i> White Bird Release</i>, while not as conceptual as  <i> For Waiting, For Chasing</i>, almost by default flows as a sort of suite, with each track named after a fragment of this quotation: ""There can be no thought of finishing for 'aiming at the stars"" both literally and figuratively is a problem to occupy generations so that no matter how much progress one makes there is always the thrill of just beginning-- Dr. Robert Goddard in a letter to HG Wells, 1932."" (Labradford used a similar trick ten years ago on  <i> E Luxo So</i>, using the album credits as song titles.) Just what bearing each track has on the next-- track one is ""There Can Be No Thought of Finishing"", track two is called ""For 'Aiming at the Stars'"", and so on-- is unclear, other than to emphasize rocket scientist Goddard's awed contemplation of infinity.</p>
<p>Much ambient music serves a similar purpose, designed to float and mingle in the background almost invisibly, like it's part of the very air we breathe. Nelson is as guilty as anyone of occasionally making music seemingly designed to disappear. In its own quiet way, however,  <i> White Bird Release </i> knows how to call attention to itself. ""There Can Be No Thought of Finishing"" begins with a thoughtful and pretty tremolo guitar melody, enhanced by Nelson's whispered vocals, but ends butting up against some discordant digital noise and echoing, almost random percussion. ""For 'Aiming at the Stars'"" starts as a repetitive homage to Frippertronics-- Nelsontronics?-- before a rubbery bass figure pulls the minimal melody in new directions. ""Both Literally and Figuratively"" pulls off a similar trick, congealing into something close to a traditional song, replete with rhythm section, halfway through.</p>
<p>""Is a Problem to Occupy Generations"" may be not much more than hum and hiss. But it helps emphasize the pacific Nelsontronics piece ""So That No Matter"" before ""How Much Progress One Makes"" conflates all the impressive qualities that have marked past Labradford and Pan American releases into an impressive, deceptively propulsive whole. The static-filled noir of ""There Is Always the Thrill of Just Beginning"" and the Zen-inducing ""Dr. Robert Goddard"" ease the disc down gently, illustrating the beauty to be found between the notes, while ""In a Letter to H. G. Wells, 1932"" highlights the soulful essence-- invisible but present nonetheless-- in all the empty spaces and near-silence.</p>
<p>""It is difficult to say what is impossible, for the dream of yesterday is the hope of today and the reality of tomorrow,"" said Goddard, who spent his life bringing mankind closer to outer space. One imagines  <i> White Bird Release </i> would have therefore left him impressed, since it, like the best ambient music, achieves what once was considered impossible: With the ease of an old hand, the ever-steady Nelson brings the awesome and infinite recesses of space down to earth.</p></div>"|12750.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12750-white-bird-release/|7.0|Joshua Klein

The reason seems to be threefold. The clearest reason is necessity: The 15 songs on <i>Advance Base Battery Life</i> are culled from three years of contributions to split 7""s and compilation albums-- all but two are on CD for the first time here. Also, the compilation shows off the sheer size of Ashworth's output. From 2004 through 2007 (the period that <i>Battery Life</i> covers), he released two full-lengths, but he also released almost as many songs outside of those albums as on them. Anyone who has complained that the three-year absence between CFTPA albums was too long will now bite their tongues, considering that this collection proves just how busy Ashworth has been. And finally, with the forthcoming <i>Vs. Children </i>adding new instruments and mostly avoiding the lo-fi keyboards from which the band takes its name, it seems like <i>Battery Life</i> is a last hurrah of sorts, a good reminder of how Ashworth has made so much out of so little for so long.</p>
<p>Though the expected tracks of washed-out vocals, shimmery keyboards, lonely drum machine thumps, and efficiently told tales of romantic disappointment abound, there are also surprises here. ""The Only Way to Cry"" is a 46-second blip of bedroom-recorded, droning keyboards that would play as novelty if its sentiment wasn't so strangely moving. Succinct like a musical haiku, its tells its story in only five lines, but its economy of language makes the tale of a man who buys out a movie theater just so he can have a good cry alone even more affecting. And ""Holly Hobby"" flips the script on Ashworth's usual ""why isn't she with me"" storyline, indulging in his inner manly heartlessness with a blunt monologue to a girl whom he's treated the way he's always complaining that he is: discarded and unappreciated. ""I'm sorry that you fell/ But you should have known just as well/ That you're just a hobby, Holly,"" he sings against a disarmingly sweet synthesizer melody.</p>
<p>The covers that backload the album-- Missy Elliott's ""Hot Boyz"", Paul Simon's ""Graceland"", and Bruce Springsteen's ""Streets of Philadelphia"" and ""Born in the U.S.A.""-- act as added evidence for Ashworth's style, proving that even the biggest hits of the uber-masculine Boss can sound fragile and vulnerable when buried in layers of distortion and stripped of all studio gloss. The Missy cover is especially ingenious, keeping the rhythmic heaviness and playful skittering drum line of the original, but adding the slightly bored, girlish vocals of Dear Nora's Katy Davidson to undercut all the lyrical consumer-porn.</p>
<p>That said, <i>Advance Base Battery Life</i> is not likely to earn Ashworth many new fans. If you already have little patience for his mumbled delivery, devastatingly astute observations of the banalities of slacker life, and amateur production technique (or lack thereof), then you won't be swayed by these buzzing, muffled tracks. But those who already like his sorrowful whispers will find these intimate odes to ennui stirring and sad. The good news for the haters, however, is that, with the impending arrival of the more floridly arranged <i>Vs. Children</i>, this album might be the last bow for Ashworth's Casiotone, which, it seems, may no longer be so painfully alone after all.</p></div>"|12821.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12821-advance-base-battery-life/|6.9|Rebecca Raber

The current apex of ten years' collaboration between siblings Karin Dreijer Andersson and Olof Dreijer, it's one of a handful of albums from the past decade that one might argue sounded like nothing before it. In the three years since, the Dreijers have treaded lightly, touring and remixing in carefully managed bursts before quietly receding back into silence altogether.</p>
<p>When news of a Dreijer Andersson solo project called Fever Ray broke in October, one would have been forgiven for wondering if the duo hadn't secretly made good on their threats to call it quits. God knows, they still might. The point is, you'll get no clues here: although every bit as alluring, this debut has as much in conflict as it has in common with <i>Silent Shout</i>. The sounds often square, but the ferociousness has been subsumed by a slow drip of anxiety and dread. The macabre nursery rhymes have given way to lyrics that imply a sort of domestic cabin fever. It's still of the same creator, just not from the same swamp.</p>
<p>Things move slowly here; they slither instead of stomp. The house-inflected, booming low end of <i>Silent Shout</i> has been scrubbed away, leaving Karin's voice naked and upfront, anchoring the songs in a way it hasn't previously been required to. Although no less inscrutable, her lyrics adjust. Where those on <i>Silent Shout</i> had a witchy scale and ambition appropriate to the hugeness of the songs, Fever Ray's words feel so interior as to seem slightly unhinged. Indeed, one of Fever Ray's most remarkable aspects comes from how Dreijer Andersson funnels little moments of humor, banality, remembrance, mania, and anxiety through her deadpan affect to create a central character worthy of any psychological horror. You might even reasonably suggest this record is about psychosis. ""I've got a friend who I've known since I was seven/ We used to talk on the phone/ If we have time/ If it's the right time,"" she declares conspiratorially, amidst pattering drums and faintly tropical synths in ""Seven"". In the morose, slumbering ""Concrete Walls"", she slows her voice to a pained yawn, which repeats the final couplet to a resigned fade: ""I live between concrete walls/ In my arms she was so warm/ Oh how I try/ I leave the TV on/ And the radio.""</p>
<p>In addition to many of the same plasticky percussions and goofy synth sounds that the Knife made their stock in trade, Fever Ray also brims with fragile, more finely articulated sounds, such as the delicate mallet instruments that punctuate ""Now's The Only Time I Know"", the bamboo flute that wanders through ""Keep the Streets Empty For Me"", and the grinding guitar sound in ""I'm Not Done"". The album moves at roughly the same pace and with the same general tone, rendering some of the songs indistinguishable at first, but committed listens will reveal this to be as nuanced and as rich of a production as anything either Dreijer has done.</p>
<p>The highlights are many. Opener ""If I Had a Heart"" is a shivering, timely meditation on greed, immorality, and lust for power that dovetails nicely with AIG and Madoff (""This will never end cause I want more/ More, give me more, give me more""); ""I'm Not Done"" is a pressurized squall that culminates with Karin dueting with a helium-voiced version of herself; while seven-minute closer ""Coconut"" rumbles on a pattern of synths and staccato drums before a ceremonious wall of voices arrive at the midpoint to march it to a close. Except, ""close"" implies it was written: the more time you spend with Fever Ray, the more you become convinced that these songs aren't written so much as they're temporarily let out. They're too starved, too eerie, and too transfigured to have been anything but.</p></div>"|12845.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12845-fever-ray/|8.1|Mark Pytlik

But it won't be surprising. In a rare interview, the shy Deerhunter-er told blog BBQCHICKENROBOT that he started recording his album at the beginning of 2007. Since then, Deerhunter has released <i>Cryptograms</i>, the <i>Fluorescent Grey</i> EP, and last year's <i>Microcastle</i>/<i>Weird Era Cont.</i>; lead singer Bradford Cox's Atlas Sound has released <i>Let the Blind Lead Those Who Can See But Cannot Feel</i>, plus a staggering number of mp3s, mixes, and non-album tracks. At shows, Pundt can be seen strumming wordlessly, staring toward his effects pedals.</p>
<p>And yet the sole figure behind Lotus Plaza has had a huge-- and all too often unacknowledged-- role in establishing Deerhunter's hallucinatory sound. The Atlanta band's chaotic 2005 debut, <i>Deerhunter</i> aka <i>Turn It Up Faggot</i>, gets kind of a bad rap, no doubt in part because Cox disavowed the thing. But it shows that Deerhunter didn't turn into the shoegaze-drenched dreamweavers we know and love until after Pundt joined. Pundt wrote the music for some of Deerhunter's most indelible songs-- ""Strange Lights"", ""Like New""-- and made his singing debut on <i>Microcastle</i>. The Atlas Sound album, which features Pundt's guitar on ""Cold as Ice"", is dedicated to him.</p>
<p>So that the first Lotus Plaza album, <i>The Floodlight Collective</i>, is a hazy bedroom reverie shouldn't surprise listeners accustomed to other Deerhunter-related projects, the hypnotic solo work of Panda Bear, the lonesome longing of Jeremy Jay, or to a lesser extent the introverted homemade racket of Wavves and Dum Dum Girls. Produced by Brian Foote of Nudge, the album submerges plaintive vocals in layer after reverb-washed cloud layer of ethereal guitar atmospherics, achieving a woozy and sometimes barely intelligible prettiness. That can best be heard on tracks like the tambourine-jangling ""Whiteout""-- its gentle melody gaining force on repeat listens-- or the squealing, Quickspace-esque rocker ""What Grows?"" (it does, an abstract Yo La Tengo). Pundt plays all instruments, except for Cox's turn on Factory-ready drums for the sweet dream pop of ""Different Mirrors""; a bouncy Supremes beat gives way to outer-space Roy Orbison on ""Quicksand"". The krautrock pulse and piano-dripping radiance of seven-minute centerpiece ""Antoine"" sound like a Stereolab disciple starting to come into his own.</p>
<p>As with bashful Blur guitarist Graham Coxon on his own solo debut more than a decade ago, Pundt at times lets his diffidence get the best of him. For all the subtle detail in a track like the mournful, pitch-shifted ""Sunday Night""-- which vaguely recalls Atlas Sound's ""Bite Marks"" in its nostalgic main riff-- with Pundt's melodic and conceptual strengths so submerged, the album can begin to run together. That's probably the point: From the washed-out cover art to the few discernible lyrics, <i>The Floodlight Collective</i> is obsessed with the indistinctness of memory, the dazzlement of bright lights. Opener ""Red Oak Way"", maybe Pundt's ""Hazel St."", longs for ""sunny Saturdays watching cartoons in the living room,"" warm rays shining through the windowpane. So <i>The Floodlight Collective</i> is a mostly elegant listen, and one whose failings are part of its theme: Like a vague recollection, it's still a little hard to hold onto after it's over-- pretty albeit somewhat ephemeral. Memory knows before knowing remembers, sure, but too much light makes the baby go blind.</p></div>"|12844.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12844-the-floodlight-collective/|6.8|Marc Hogan

Despite some notable exceptions (Art Brut's ""Formed a Band"", Pavement's ""Range Life"", Jackson Browne's ""The Load-Out"" among them), the ratio of great bands to great songs about being in a band is still remarkably small. But astonishingly, this Detroit-area trio has created not just one catchy track about the journeyman's life, but a song cycle of sorts of vigorous, stupidly sloppy power-pop that deals explicitly with the details of life in a rock band. Perhaps this is because, between its three members, Friendly Foes have quite a bit of experience in that area. (Aside from Allen's aforementioned affiliation, bassist/vocalist Liz Wittman is one half of Kiddo and drummer Brad Elliot played with Satin Peaches.)</p>
<p>Listeners are warned from the onset, with opening track, ""Full Moon Morning"", that  <i> Born Radical </i> is going to be an overtly ""meta"" experience. Encapsulating everything from the excitement of first playing together (""Picked a name, picked a sound/ Played some shows, the kids came out/ But remained underground when they couldn't figure us out"") to the less savory details of road life (""Our clothes smell like piss/ We're running out of strings/ Do you think we'll live like this through the winter and the spring?""), the track manages to cram a warts-and-all look at life as a struggling musician into barely two minutes of sugar rush harmonies, crashing cymbals, and insistently downstroked, fuzzed-out guitars. A few songs later, on ""Couch Surfing"", the three-piece try to prove that not all slackers are unmotivated, as Allen sings about the chasm between his ambitions and his circumstances. And while he yelps about his dream of his band getting good reviews and not having a permanent place to sleep, he's backed by Wittman's girly ""ba ba bas"" and some cutesy woodblock percussion, making Friendly Foes sound like the New Pornographers on particularly strong amphetamines. ""Wild (Once in a While)"", the final track in the triumvirate of songs that overtly addresses band life, has a comparably spare opening-- though it later blooms into a bouquet of ""ooh la la""s, bright, driving keyboards, and crashing cymbals-- that reminds listeners that at the bottom of this saturated sound lurks Elvis Costello's melodic economy.</p>
<p>Musically, Friendly Foes sit on a precarious highwire, balancing between cheery 1970s power pop and the gloriously lo-fi ""college"" rock of the early 90s. Despite the similarities to a jittery Carl Newman and his crew, Allen's infectious, chugging guitar riffs and nasal, androgynous delivery make it hard not to hear Superchunk pretty explicitly as an influence throughout the album, though Mac McCaughan's group never sounded this rich or sunny. Adding to the 90s nostalgia is Wittman's babydoll voice, which recalls Juliana Hatfield and the slew of other  <i> Sassy </i> female frontwomen of her era. ""Get Ripped"", the only track of the collection to feature her lead vocals, feels like a sped up version of ""My Sister"" (or better yet, something off Belly's 1993 debut). Wrapped in purposely rough production that makes it seem like the distorted guitars and muddy, trebly vocals were literally recorded in a garage, Friendly Foes seem punk, even though, at their heart, their nerdy, hyperactive anthems are no more punk than songs by the similarly named slick English dance poppers with whom they are often confused (that would be Friendly Fires).</p>
<p>Admittedly, as  <i> Born Radical </i> wears on, its helium-injected vocals become tiring to the ear. Ditto the record's full-throttle velocity, though there is something to be said for the enthusiasm of a group that can't help but play at maximum speed at all times. But luckily this 13-song collection only lasts 34 minutes, so listeners will barely have time to register such fatigue before the album is over and they're craving its hooky blasts of harmony all over again. After all, you'd be hard pressed to find another album this year that will give you such an accurate feeling of what's it's like to be a band (and no, being an expert at ""Guitar Hero""<i> </i> doesn't count).</p></div>"|12780.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12780-born-radical/|7.0|Rebecca Raber

Twenty-two years later, ""Bang on a Can"" has become as much a movement as an organization, having gathered forces and expanded in all directions with a tenacity that would impress the Wu-Tang Clan. Despite their countless offshoots, side projects, collaborations, and a growing number of disciples, Lang, Wolfe, and Gordon remain the beating heart of BoAC, and their shared aesthetic has come to define a wide slice of the American contemporary classical scene.  <br/> <br/> The three tend to subsume their individual efforts into the collective, so it is enlightening and refreshing to hear when one of them breaks off on their own. Lang's music, released mostly on the BoAC's Cantaloupe label, does arguably the clearest job of defining the ""Bang on a Can"" sound of the three. If we're sticking with the Wu-Tang analogy, then Lang is the GZA figure, the one who most deftly negotiates all of the quirks and contradictions that make BoAC's world worthwhile and interesting. <i>Pierced</i> is a further refinement on that world, a place steeped in both the New York rock and the minimalism of the 70s without being overly indebted to either, an ingenious meld of film-score ambience, rock propulsion, and minimalist textures.  <br/> <br/> Lang's pieces come in two basic varieties: rippling, liquid, and quietly restless (""My Very Empty Mouth"", ""Sweet Air"", both off of 2003's excellent  <i> Child </i> ) and chattering, agitated, and bustling. The works on  <i> Pierced </i> fall mostly in the latter category, which can make it a tougher listen. The title track, for example, is a near-exhausting exercise in rhythmic rug-pulling, a hard downbeat switching accents every few bars while strings shudder and groan like a leaky barge and a piano endlessly hammers a low note. The piece lurches in place for almost 14 minutes, an equal parts maddening and absorbing shell game of ""where's-the-beat?"" ""Cheating, Lying, Stealing"", an older work, has a similarly spiky hide, bristling with nervously stuttering piano, low bass-clarinet blats, and feedback squalls, all scored by the bangs and clunks of scrapyard-metal percussion. It resembles the sort of bracing urban chaos that Industrial Age composers like George Antheil sought to capture in his 1924  <i> Ballet Mecanique</i>, except that here the machinery has rusted and grown creaky with age.  <br/> <br/> There is a long, mournful moment of repose, though, in Lang's startling reworking of the Velvet Underground's ""Heroin"". Art-rock legends and classical composers often make dicey bedfellows, but Lang wisely avoids trying to win cool contests against Lou Reed. Maintaining the original's trancelike quality, he ditches everything else, recasting the song for the hauntingly pure-voiced singer/composer Theo Bleckmann and a single cellist. The result resembles a cross between an English Renaissance ballad and a Chet Baker-style torch song, stripping away the thin veil of bravado and leaving only piercing sadness. The only work that directly references rock music, it's also the most ""traditional""-sounding piece of classical music on the album, a canny switch-up that demonstrates how comfortable Lang is in the cross-genre slipstream. The album isn't perfect-- there are a few dead patches towards the end-- but Lang, who won the Pulitzer in 2008 for his  <i> Little Match Girl Passion</i>, remains the rare Downtown composer who has managed to enter the Uptown world of big-name commissions and hefty grants with both his spirit and voice intact.</p></div>"|12774.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12774-pierced/|7.2|Jayson Greene

The ad, which Dupieux directed, featured a puppet named Flat Eric bobbing his little yellow head to a skidding, shuddering bassline. That's him on this album's cover, about to get eye-sliced  <i> Un Chien Andalou- </i> style. This seems to impy that Mr. Oizo is putting Flat Eric-- and perhaps the catchy, irritating style of ""Flat Beat""-- out to pasture for good. But this turns out not to be the case. If you can remember (or YouTube) that commercial, then you already have a good idea of what to expect from  <i> Lamb's Anger</i>: cockamamie bass patterns that zoom and stutter, ear-grating trebles punching in, and a sense of going nowhere fast on Daft Punk's fumes. The album seems intent on emphasizing its own annoying qualities; you start to wonder if Oizo is secretly a minimalist trying to destroy French touch from the inside.</p>
<p>Overblown and frantic, with a surplus of sounds and a dearth of ideas,  <i> Lamb's Anger </i> too often falls back on cliché, and a shrieking, nerve-shredding resgister. There are hideous vocoder mumbles on ""Hun"", arpeggios based on an idea of funk derived from the ""Seinfeld"" theme on ""Z"" and ""W"", schmaltzy guitar and horn licks on ""Cut Dick"", cynically hedonistic club raps on ""Steroids"" and ""Two Takes It"" (the former a snap-music-inspired Uffie vehicle, the latter an electro flip of Rob Base and DJ E-Z Rock's ""It Takes Two"" featuring Carmen Castro, who's either a spot-on Uffie imitator or just Uffie under a pseudonym). There are antagonistically ugly synth tones bleating all over the place, and squealing soul-diva cuts on the astonishingly cluttered ""Gay Dentist"", which sounds like a C + C Music Factory song imported to iTunes from a badly scratched CD. It isn't the only track that verges on open hostility; See how long you can withstand ""Blind Concerto"", with which Oizo closes the album, as if maliciously farting on his way out of the room.</p>
<p>The most lucid and listenable tracks are the smoother ones-- the aforementioned ""Cut Dick"", and the breezy lite-funk of ""Jo"", a blatant approximation of the Field. A handful of experimental pieces, like the ominous rave-siren workout ""Bruce Willis Is Dead"", fare better than the club songs, simply because they're  <i> supposed </i> to be incoherent. But they suffer from the same structural deficiency; namely, a profound lack of communication between adjacent loops, which are so isolated that they might as well have picket fences between them. Most tracks consist of rigid repetitions of a single basic theme, afflicted with every rhythmic convulsion and soft-synth tone imaginable. There's a glut of movement  <i> within </i> each bar, but little sense of movement  <i> across </i> the bars, no overarching pulse or momentum. This constant feeling of starting over at every one-beat is exhausting, and makes the music seem at once predictable and erratic. Groups like Justice do tooth-grindingly obnoxious machine-noise anthems right, a thrilling hair's breadth away from too-muchness. But handled this clumsily, this ungenerously? There's not enough cocaine in the whole wide world.</p></div>"|12778.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12778-lambs-anger/|2.9|Brian Howe

But when you're talking about records by supergroups, that logic doesn't always hold. Projects run the risk of being trampled by big feet and bigger egos. Avoiding these pitfalls is Swan Lake, that three-headed dragon comprised of left-field Canadian indie rockers Dan Bejar (of Destroyer and the New Pornographers), Spencer Krug (Wolf Parade, Frog Eyes, and Sunset Rubdown) and Carey Mercer (Frog Eyes, Blackout Beach). As vocalists, they range from downcast warble to abrasive yelp; as writers, they're known for cryptic, densely allusive songs that twist and slither into unexpected places. The phrase ""acquired taste"" comes to mind. But their 2006 debut <i>Beast Moans</i> was muscular and melodic and dizzying in all the right places; when the three crashed into each other on tape it made for a satisfying ""Kablaam!"" that reflected the weight of their pedigree and differing gifts.</p>
<p>But then again, for better or worse, that first record only hinted at the fireworks a less manic or dense collaboration might yield. <i>Enemy Mine</i> finds the group in such a wide-open brainspace-- breathing easy and totally in step. Containing just nine songs, each songwriter enjoys three distinct showcases. And while Bejar's tics tended to dominate on <i>Beast Moans</i>, this time it feels more inclusive-- you can hear them coaxing the best out of one another, fortifying the spaces that separate them. Opener ""Spanish Gold, 2044"" arrives on a platter of serrated guitar and moans, all of which can be traced to Mercer. And as strong a first step as it is, the track doesn't take off until Krug and Bejar join in with wails and instrumentation of their own. Then there's ""Paper Lace"", a Krug-fronted pop embrace with a feathery hook that Mercer and Bejar amplify but never overwhelm. And Bejar? He finishes up the opening blast with ""Heartswarm"", a ballad that stands tall on album full of them. It's not the nutty poetry or ""Duke of Earl""-like chord changes that gives the song its shine, but rather the warmth of the textures they've bundled it up in. As relatively bare bones as some of these arrangements are, the songs are as kinetic as one might hope for from such dynamic songwriters. They just wouldnt sound as rich had they been fleshed out by any other set of players.</p>
<p>Still, the album's middle stretch sags quite a bit in comparison. Bejar's self-references, Krug disappears into the tangles of his own keyboard work, and Mercer, despite emerging here as a not-so-secret weapon, collapses from the weight of his inhalations and spasms. But even this lull is a useful reminder. Because as triumphant as the closing seconds of ""Spider"" and ""Warlock Psychologist"" are (and they really are), it's important to remember that Swan Lake's appeal can be found in the way their creative personalities merge. More unites these dudes than just a tireless work ethic, Bowie fetish, and hair-raising vocal delivery. All have made names for themselves by crafting fractured pop music, for framing the off-center beautifully. It's not only remarkable that they found each other, but that they're able to make so much room for one another as well.</p></div>"|12839.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12839-enemy-mine/|7.4|David Bevan

While he started out in the early 1990s as a jingle writer in São Paulo before moving to rock production and performing, his subsequent move to techno was motivated primarily by the desire for control: He wanted to be able to run his own studio from his living room. And control he did: <i>Chromophobia</i>, his 2007 breakthrough on Kompakt, evangelized the steady bass pulse and austere dissonance of contemporary techno within the context of inviting, discrete songs. In 2007 Boratto and Axel Willner, aka the Field, mixed a powerful serum of pop-aware techno. They posited consumer-friendly full-length albums that appealed to rock listeners skeptical about dance music's extreme repetition and track-driven culture.<i></i></p>
<p><i>Take My Breath Away</i>, the follow-up, folds the cold abstractions of techno into the lyrical sheen of synth-pop. You can take the album's title any way you like-- a reference to the <i>Top Gun</i> Berlin jam, a mawkish platitude, or a winking jab at both. In any case, the record is quite different thematically from <i>Chromophobia</i>. The latter was an elemental evocation both aesthetic (reflecting Boratto's desire to expand his expressive palette) and political (""Chromophobia"" being a veiled reference to the racial and sexual tensions of the style). Cover art comparisons rarely do their subjects justice, but here it suffices: Boratto approached <i>Chromophobia</i> as an abstraction of design; <i>Take My Breath Away</i> is a living, breathing portrait painted in simple (maybe even simplistic) terms.</p>
<p>For better or for worse, <i>Take My Breath Away</i> feels comfortable and content. Boratto battered <i>Chromophobia</i> opener ""Scene 1"" with skittering rhythms and gong-like bass revelations, pushing the mix so far in the red it almost knocked the track off its rhythmic foundation. ""Take My Breath Away"" purrs in comparison, winding up tension not via rhythmic interplay, but by the fact that he's actually playing it straight. Single ""Atomic Soda"" offers the same sort of view from 10,000 feet, playing like a streamlined mix of <i>Chromophobia</i>'s ""The Blessing"" before burning into and re-constituting itself via glitchy beats in the breakdown. The lead synth lines on ""Colors"" and ""Azurra"" could have been cribbed off a ""Legend of Zelda"" game, but Boratto contextualizes them within a sentimentalized backdrop and sells them convincingly: they are discrete little packets of schmaltz.</p>
<p>Fittingly, ""No Turning Back"", this record's standout track, reaches for the same heights of pop idolatry as <i>Chromophobia</i>'s ""Beautiful Life"". Slower and kissed with cymbals from his drum machine's ""Rock"" kit, ""No Turning Back"" delivers on Boratto's unstated notion that techno's best grooves are really just rock riffs extended over longer time periods. Vocalist Luciana Villanova (Boratto's wife) also sang on ""Beautiful Life"", and her simple and divine verses again arrive pregnant with empty meaning. Yes, Boratto's loudest denial of techno strictures, smack dab in the middle of an album full of such denials, arrives in the form of a house music diva verse. The words themselves are so dull, they verge on parody; her voice is detached but holds dear to the song's platitudes as the siren-wail of guitars surrounds her, sublimely unexpected. It's one of the best songs of the year so far, but it may have delivered the final stroke in painting Boratto into his own corner of semi-serious banality. No turning back, indeed.</p>
<p>Boratto once told Stylus Magazine of ""Beautiful Life"": ""There's that bassline at the end of the track-- well, I made a little joke. I was pretending to be like [New Order's] Peter Hook. It was just a little joke."" I never really believed that New Order jab was really a joke. Boratto's fluency with the pop music idiom informs his eloquence within the hard jargon of techno. But what really makes his work special is his ability to speak two musical languages at once without sounding like he's pandering to either side. His deliberate inflections of melody often emerge with a ring of truth, especially as he guides his repetitions through the peaks and valleys of his little mostly-nonverbal anecdotes. One gets the sense, however, that in acknowledging where his inspirations came from and figuring out where his compositions will go on <i>Take My Breath Away</i>, he's misplaced the present tense and the once-present tension.</p></div>"|12843.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12843-take-my-breath-away/|6.1|Mike Orme

I've picked up a few of these in flea markets, used record shops, and online, and I've frequently been surprised at how great some of them are. I guess if you spend every night playing the same songs, putting together a pretty great album of those songs is a cakewalk. The musical life of the Caribbean has long been one of cross-currents and mixed identities. The black, slave-descended populations of the islands have towering musical histories, often in spite of European attempts to squash those histories, while the legacy of colonialism and the reality of tourist-driven economies adds European and American influences-- to say nothing of what the hundreds of thousands of Indian and Chinese immigrants brought to the region after slavery's abolition brought with them (some of Folkways' LPs of Jamaican traditional music include Hindustani dance music).</p>
<p><i>Calypsoul 70 </i> reflects that melting pot through the lens of the funky 70s with an inspired and wide-ranging selection of tracks from Cuba, Trinidad &amp; Tobago, Bahamas, Martinique, St. Vincent &amp; the Grenadines, St. Maarten, St. Lucia, Jamaica, Dominica, Antigua, and mainland Guyana that range from Carnival rave-ups to disco, reggae, gospel, hard funk, and soul jazz with garage rock organ on top. The use of the word  <i> Calypsoul </i> as an umbrella term is more clever than historical, and it could be argued that the disc's broad focus means it fails to tell much of a story about this music, but it could be argued more strongly that such a body-moving mixture needs no larger intellectual justification-- there's a lot to be said for shutting up and getting down.</p>
<p>Getting down is no big challenge when confronted with the riff-heavy proto-disco of the Revolution of St. Vincent's ""The Little You Say"", one of a handful of dancefloor burners that are the stock-in-trade of compilations like this. Where the disc gets more interesting is when it heads a little further off the beaten track into distinctly Caribbean recordings. Clarence Curvan &amp; His Mod Sounds turn in a swinging Carnival instrumental with the compilation's title track, mixing trap drums and hand percussion with a crashing, celebratory horn section and even a twangy guitar solo, while the Hondells' ""Raycan"" travels similar ground. It's uplifting, insanely fun music that sounds all the better for its relatively ragged production values. You can hear the horns in a room, all gathered around one microphone and just blowing.</p>
<p>Politics were never far from the mic in calypso music, and there are some brilliant examples of that at work here, from Tyrone Taylor's roots reggae ""Move Up Blackman"" to Biosis Now's raucous funk celebration of independence, ""Independent Bahamas"". Duke (known earlier in his career as Mighty Duke) is openly confrontational on ""Freedom in Africa"", offering that if dialogue doesn't produce results, war is certainly an option. The best of the political offerings, though, is Lancelot Layne's stunning ""Yo Tink It Sorf?"" The Trinidadian singer's style is sometimes called rapso, which makes total sense-- his sing-speak cadence on this song prefigures both dancehall toasting and rapping. The song's musical backing is little more than an army of hand drums and some flute, while Layne rips into Trinidadian youth's idolization of American ghetto life, sometimes oddly harmonized in his raps by his backing musicians. ""How you going to feel to see a child suffer permanent brain damage from lead poisoning/ Who you go blame when they end up in the hands of some lawless lawman?"" It's a breathtaking track and a revelation for calypso fans who don't know his work.</p>
<p>The other musically radical track is Martiniquan pianist Marius Cultier's wicked, rocket-propelled tribal jazz workout ""Guanavaco"", which opens with a call-and-response chant over wild hand drumming before settling into a strong piano-funk groove. Even tracks that scream novelty up front, like Amral's Trinidad Cavaliers Steel Orchestra's steel drum cover of Gwen McCrae's ""90% of Me Is You"" turn out to be great. For a lot of Americans and Europeans, the Caribbean is an entire region reduced to a couple tri-fold brochures and a taxi ride straight from the airport to the resort hotel. This collection doesn't change its image as a sunny, friendly place, but it does reveal deeper aspects of its melting pot culture and complex politics. It's a superb first step into the region for beginners as well.</p></div>"|12753.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12753-calypsoul-70-caribbean-soul-calypso-crossover-1969-1979/|8.0|Joe Tangari

So when relatively unknown Detroit producer Omar S told the dance-music  site <i>Resident Advisor</i>, ""I don't even know who Ricardo Willalobo  is""-- backhanding Ricardo Villalobos, techno's frustrating, progressive  king-- pundits rushed to their keyboards, birthing messageboard threads  that reached 10 pages in length but rarely moved past a collective <i> oh no he didn</i>'<i>t</i>. On the one hand, Omar S knows how to handle press-- curse,  a lot (nine instances of ""fuck"" in under 150 words!); show more  interest in illegal auto racing than the genre you perform in; claim  to not buy music; claim, even, not to really like it. On the other hand,  the prospect that he really is a know-nothing-- or, at least, that he  doesn't care about his environment-- is magnetic. In a scene that  often seems to feed off itself, it's hard not to wonder what Omar S  is eating.</p>
<p>So London club and label Fabric asks  him to make his own mix, and he turns in 80 minutes of his own tracks,  some dating back to 2004. (""I don't need other people's music; I got  over 100 songs released."") Whether that's heresy or not, I don't  care. Most of this stuff was only on vinyl until now, and it's just  as easy-- and as rewarding-- for me to think of this disc as a compilation  of his productions as a DJ mix.</p>
<p>His music isn't unlike his public  persona-- brash, bitter, soulful, and vaguely threatening. The tracks  collected on <i>Fabric 45</i> aren't funky, but they have a zombie-like  imperative to them. They're not melodically complex, either, and when  he builds a half-memorable tune-- ""Oasis 13 ½"" or ""Psychotic  Photosynthesis"", both which resemble Kraftwerk, a little-- he straps  it to the bassline in a way that suggests he thinks melody is frivolous.  They're built on blocky, simple sounds, but structured with subtlety  and control. For someone who flaunts as much confidence and ego as Omar S  does, his music is almost impetuously basic at times-- he's like a  woodsman who builds a lean-to in your living room when you already set  up the air mattress. It's not conservative, it's gutter, it's  flamboyant.</p>
<p>The occasional vocalists-- on ""U""  or ""The Maker""-- sound lonely and disoriented, like deep-house divas  who collapsed in alleyways before ambling home in the last few minutes  before dawn. Video-game samples pollute 19th century church  organ (""Strider's World""); and brutish, deadlocked four-four gets  syncopated with noise (""Simple Than Sorry""). Zealots say the crown  is ""Psychotic Photosynthesis"", a dizzy, slow-bubbling track whose  melody peels out of its bassline so carefully that it's hard to notice  until it's fully arrived-- it definitely stands out, but doesn't  overshadow.</p>
<p>While it's tempting to draw Omar S  into the long narrative of Detroit techno, he doesn't fit the mold:  Detroit, as I always heard it, represented a banging but sophisticated  futurism; Omar S, by comparison, is definitively unrefined. The cover  of his one full-length album, 2005's <i>Just Ask the Lonely</i>, is  a sloppily altered photo of him playing an arcade console whose display  shows a picture of what are presumably his kids. He claims to sign his  white labels with the same marker he uses working a day job at Ford. <i> Just Ask the Lonely</i> takes its name from a Four Tops song-- another  Detroit institution, Motown. ""Day"", on the Fabric mix, samples the  Supremes' ""Come See About Me"", briefly. Omar S' music doesn't  have any of the charm of Motown-- it's unfriendly, nocturnal stuff.  But in a way, Motown's an even better touchstone than Detroit techno:  Music made with efficiency and confidence; music that didn't have  to be too aware of what was going on around it because it was busy trying  to make a little world of its own.</p></div>"|12824.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12824-fabric-45/|7.9|Mike Powell

Then there are the ones like  <i> White Light Strobing</i>, the full-length debut of the recently upsized Olympia, Wash., trio Desolation Wilderness. Records like that just hang in the air. If you're fond of word-shy, languid rock in the style of, say, Galaxie 500, you know the kind of record I mean: they're long on atmosphere, and the really good ones making themselves known only after you find yourself a spot amongst the beds of spindly guitars and hushed drums. If you're fond of such records, it won't take you long to get acquainted with  <i> White Light Strobing</i>.</p>
<p>To paint  <i> White Light Strobing </i> as This Is More of Our Music is, of course, reductive. But it's all there, from Nicolas Zwart's unhurried, unaffected vocals to the gentle gyrations of the guitars down to the record's lovely live-in-a-room sound. If Zwart took his vowels down under a bit, his high, clear (but not exactly  <i> strong</i>) voice could pass for Dean Wareham's, too. Instrumentally, Desolation Wilderness are almost certainly more accomplished; not a great feat considering the amateurish glee at the heart of so much great Galaxie music, but a point in their column nevertheless. Lyrically, however, it's no contest. Whereas Wareham's moony non-sequiturs helped hang even a lackluster melody among the stars, Zwart's not saying much of anything worth mentioning throughout  <i> White Light Strobing</i>. What we're left with is a whole lot of atmosphere-- which will be all too familiar to most folks who find this record-- in search of better songs.</p>
<p>It'd help some if there were more to say about the vocal tracks. Limber though they are on record, Zwart seems to treat his instrumentals with the utmost care: The gently cascading ""Road Song"" is just pure gorgeousness on wax, and if they play their cards right, it'll soundtrack one hell of a Gap commercial someday. You can practically hear the frost growing on the glistening ""Paris to New York"", and ""Turquoise and Gold"" flits around like Chet Atkins playing with Codeine. For the most part, however, the tracks on which Zwart gets a word or two in on don't have the weight to support even the flimsiest of vocal melodies. There are quite a few songs about cars and girls, but nothing that reads more like poetry than a placeholder, and hardly a song with vocals that wouldn't have sounded better with another guitar or something instead. And the songs never sink in, they sound just as willowy and pleasant on first listen as they do on the 20th, and they pass through your ears in much the same manner. It doesn't help that Zwart, a singer in the ""Well, guess somebody's gotta do it"" school, mumbles his way through half these tunes, often rendering his voice the least interesting element in the mix.</p>
<p>With all that said, it's still easy enough to see an instrumentally assured, atmospherically gifted Desolation Wilderness stepping back from the reverberations on their forebears and cranking out a gem. It's gonna take better songs than these to match the sumptuous swirl they've got down pat here on  <i> White Light Strobing</i>, however, and whether that means Zwart spends more or less time pushing the pen around the lyric page, this is a band with greater strengths than they're playing to on  <i> White Light Strobing</i>, and one that'd do well to hang some of their glorious noise on something more worthy of it. All those reverberations gotta start from somewhere, after all.</p></div>"|12775.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12775-white-light-strobing/|5.6|Paul Thompson

The first answer that sprang to mind seemed somehow perverse: Dan Deacon's <i>Spiderman of the Rings</i>? I certainly didn't think this was one of the best, most profound, or most life-sustaining records I'd ever heard, and it wasn't as if I had some great personal attachment to it; I'd only first heard the thing that spring. But it seemed like a lifetime on a desert island would get awfully lonely, and there was something about the album that seemed like a solution to that problem. All the happy massed shouting on a song like ""Wham City""! There's plenty of music in the world that conjures up the feeling of crowds, but so much of it feels mob-like and jack-booted, or else it's just hero-worship of whoever's posing on the stage in front. Here, on <i>Spiderman</i>, was at least one song where the crowd felt joyous and inviting, like people celebrating the fact of sharing something. Which seemed about as essential, desert-island-wise, as a good sharp knife.</p>
<p>The press material for Deacon's follow-up, <i>Bromst</i>, talks about the notion of community, and the odd knack Deacon has for evoking it, but I'm not so sure that's entirely the point anymore. Sure, Deacon's method and sound remain mostly the same here; if you feel like you recognize the chord progressions from <i>Spiderman</i>, there's every chance you're right. The guy trades, after all, in movements that <i>feel</i> simple: He creates a dense rush of sound and then guides it through changes as broad as mountains, these shifts that slide together like blocks and burrow straight into some basic pleasure center deep in the gut of the western scale. What's different, on <i>Bromst</i>, is the texture and size of it all. Deacon does what most acts do to follow up a small hit: The palette is richer, the samples smoother, the space larger, the programming slightly less buzzy. Actual instruments, the kinds with microphones next to them, abound-- live drums, layers and layers of mallet instruments, a player piano that goes fluttering up and down the scale like it's stuck in the lobby of an avant-garde department store.</p>
<p>As for community? Deacon's still fond of massed shouting, and the overlapping exhortations of electronically processed cartoon vocals-- and all the pounding of toms and ecstatic chanting <i>can</i> leave much of <i>Bromst</i> feeling like the pagan rituals of some woodland filled with chubby, bespectacled Deacon-gnomes.</p>
<p>But those small changes manage, strangely enough, to change <i>everything</i>-- including the question of the happy crowd. <i>Spiderman</i> felt grainy, cheap, and primary-colored, an overload of cartoon buzz and bodies dancing. The denser, more sedate sound of <i>Bromst</i> shoots off in the opposite direction; it makes Deacon's music feel almost solipsistic, like it's ceased to come out of speakers and now lives deep inside your brain. If <i>Spiderman</i> was for dancing on sticky floors, <i>Bromst</i> feels better suited to sleeping, or contemplating the sublime, or anything else that happens mostly between your ears. As it closes, with the gorgeous ""Get Older""-- building from malfunctioning-modem synths into dreamy sheets of buzz on an achy major-seventh chord-- it actually begins to resemble the heavy, romantic sound of acts like M83, or Pluxus, or shoegazer bands, or the 8-bit ""chiptune"" programmers Deacon shares some kinship with. These are people who make music for getting lost inside your own head.</p>
<p>What makes this change worthwhile is the complexity of Deacon's project. Most of us could have been forgiven, after a cursory listen to <i>Spiderman</i>, for not noticing that Deacon was conservatory-trained. But as <i>Bromst</i> rushes steadily by, mostly avoiding the big crowd-pleasing breakdowns and exclamations of its predecessor, the clearer production lets you sink into the minutae of it-- say, the Steve Reich-style rhythms of different mallet or drum patterns overlapping one another. The music becomes something like a natural process: one clean, simple sweep, but built from an insane complexity of detail. And there's enough to un-knot in there to make this a terrific step for Deacon-- out from the sticky basements into a space where he can try to tackle the sublime.</p></div>"|12833.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12833-bromst/|8.5|Nitsuh Abebe

It's direct not just in name (both reflecting Lowe's current stylistic bent and logically supplanting 1989's  <i> Basher: The Best of Nick Lowe</i>) but also because it begins with what may literally be the very best of Nick Lowe: the increasingly canonical ""(What's So Funny 'Bout) Peace, Love, and Understanding"". That song could have appeared on this set in any of several different forms, each equally important to Lowe's career, albeit for different reasons. There's of course the popular and most recognizable version by Lowe's friend Elvis Costello. There's also the less familiar version by Curtis Stigers, found on the soundtrack to  <i> The Bodyguard</i>, whose massive sales earned Lowe enough cash to subsidize his 90s  <!--StartFragment--><span>resurgence</span>. Then there's the stripped-down version Lowe typically plays live these days, indicative of the hushed turn his career has taken in its fourth decade.</p>
<p>The version that begins the new 2xCD best-of set, however, is by the marginal pub-rock band Brinsley Schwarz, the early outfit that gave Lowe his start. The Brinsley Schwarz cut dates back to 1974, well before Lowe hitched his wagon to the nascent Stiff imprint, produced vital singles by the Damned and Pretenders (among others), struck out on his own with a brilliant debut,  <i> Jesus of Cool</i>, rode a solo career through many ups and downs (both musical and personal), and eventually even married into the Johnny Cash clan (Lowe's ""The Beast in Me"" would also become a highpoint of Cash's own contemporaneous comeback, <i>American Recordings</i>).</p>
<p>Which leads us to where Lowe is today, a place far removed from his sly roots-rocker persona and more inclined toward post-war proto-rock and subdued soul. If there's one favor this new best-of does, it's reminding us that this other side of Lowe was in fact there all along. ""Endless Sleep"", from 1977's cleverly titled  <i> Bowi </i> EP (released in response to Bowie's  <i> Low</i>) wouldn't be out of place on any of Lowe's recent records, and the same could be said for 1979's ""You Make Me"", 1982's ""Raining Raining"", or 1990's ""What's Shakin' on the Hill"".</p>
<p>On the other hand,  <i> Quiet Please </i> is the product of artist prerogative. Its tracklisting was handpicked by Lowe, and with the benefit of hindsight the artist has deemed a few songs from his previous best-of unworthy of inclusion here. If the effect isn't quite the rush of <i>Basher</i>,  <i> Quiet Please </i> does offer a more fully-formed portrait of the artist as a young man, old man, and all places in between, tossing in among the obvious ""Cruel to Be Kind"", ""I Love the Sound of Breaking Glass"", ""Without Love"", ""I Knew the Bride (When She Used to Rock and Roll)"", and a handful of tracks from Lowe-related projects such as Rockpile and Little Village before moving on to more recent material.</p>
<p>Lowe has claimed that his current reinvention as a classy and classic crooner stems from toting his acoustic guitar out into the countryside and playing anonymous music halls until his own compositions approached the somewhat obscure numbers he'd long admired. You can sure hear that in songs like ""You Inspire Me"", ""Lonesome Reverie"", ""Faithless Lover"", ""Lately I've Let Things Slide"", and the wry ""Has She Got a Friend"" (essentially a gender-swapped rewrite of Richard Thompson's ""Has He Got a Friend for Me"", and the lonely companion to Lowe's blithely misogynist ""I Trained Her to Love Me"").</p>
<p>Admittedly, not everyone has taken to Lowe's quiet side, and compared to his early work it's easy to confuse his weariness for snooziness. But that early work's still there-- and here-- for the listening. What  <i> Quiet Please </i> does, then, is offer a clearer trail of breadcrumbs leading anyone familiar with Lowe only at his most witty and high-energy to his current role as punk jester in repose.</p></div>"|12805.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12805-quiet-pleasethe-new-best-of-nick-lowe/|7.7|Joshua Klein

That was just in the UK and, needless to say, mostly for the better. Many of those acts weren't even memorable enough to be forgotten. Of course, that hasn't stopped a cottage industry of reissue imprints from treating every lost album like a classic, but every so often, the stream of overlooked acts given second chances turns up something pretty great.</p>
<p>Case in point: the Lines. Falling somewhere between the minimalist funk of A Certain Ratio, the angular Spartan punk of Wire or early Cure, and the atmospheric art rock of fellow coulda-beens the Sound, the Lines existed between 1978 and 1983, releasing five singles, one EP, and two LPs. The group apparently never toured and, more obviously, never took off, disappearing off the grid to all but the most avid collectors. But when those singles and EPs were compiled last year as  <i> Memory Span</i>, many wondered how a group like the Lines could escape notice for so long, especially considering the band's linear post-punk owed much to the evergreen (and everhip) Factory Records aesthetic (even if, like a lot of the Factory stable, the music boasted more potential than payoff).</p>
<p>Still, the group had something, and finally, with the release of  <i> Memory Span</i>, new fans had something as well. And now with  <i> Flood Bank</i>, they have something more. Specifically, the set rounds up the group's two LPs,  <i> Therapy </i> and  <i> Ultramarine</i>, resequenced for impact rather than chronologically, offering a fresh way to approach the Lines' admittedly limited output, whether you caught them the first time around or (more likely) didn't.</p>
<p>There are some great tracks here, most of which have escaped the post-punk reissue craze. ""Stripe"" is half-speed funk, all groove and menace, while ""Airlift""'s combo of canned and live percussion, spare guitar, and rubbery bass leads to an unexpectedly melodic chorus. The sentimental ""Blow a Kiss"" comes off almost as a UK take on Buddy Holly's pop primitivism, and if the hectic ""Have a Heart"" is more recognizably proto-new wave, it's sparse enough to have escaped many of the era's gaudy trappings. The ballad ""No Hiding"" doesn't sound quite fully formed, yet the slow jam ""Ultramarine"" could have been a college radio hit, given more spit and polish.</p>
<p>Lines leader Rico Conning (now a noted engineer) hailed from Macclesfield, also home to Ian Curtis, and you can often hear glimmers of Joy Division, too, in the tribal percussion and studio experiments. (Conning himself claims allegiance to Krautrock and Television, among others.) But the more time you spend with the Lines, the more individual character the music exudes. This isn't the sound of train-jumping followers but contemporaneous leaders-- leaders no doubt shocked that few were lining up behind them. So belated or not, let the queue start here.</p></div>"|12804.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12804-flood-bank/|7.2|Joshua Klein

Her second album,  <i> L'Entredeux</i>, was reportedly written during the break-up of her marriage to fellow Tucson musician Naïm Amor and certainly deals with desires relieved and thwarted, commitments betrayed, relationships redefined. That Dissard sings in French only makes her subject matter seem more precarious and interiorized, as if she is keeping listeners at a safe distance even as her low, smoky chanteuse vocals draw them closer. Born in France but based in Arizona, the singer-songwriter-filmmaker writes as if she must constantly take stock of a relationship, sorting through memories both good and bad. She thanks him for ""hot tea and a weather report"" on ""Merci de Rien du Tout"", then adds ""thanks for nothing."" On ""Les Confettis"" she toasts ""to my handkerchiefs, to your laziness... all our hopes in pieces by night"" in a one-woman ticker-tape parade for dashed dreams. Finally, ""Indiana Song"" delivers harsh closure: ""It's over,"" she sings, her voice quavering only slightly. ""We won't save our skins no more.""  <br/> <br/> <i> L'Entredeux </i> may be Dissard's  <i> Rumors </i> or  <i> Shoot Out the Lights </i> , but the album sounds idiosyncratic: a coming-together of European musical traditions and American sounds. This is chanson adapted to the American southwest; of course Joey Burns produced the album. Dissard may be best known for dueting with him on ""The Ballad of Cable Hogue"", from the Calexico's  <i> Hot Rail</i>, and he returns the favor by giving  <i> L'Entredeux </i> an arid luster, full of soundtrack strings, curious accordion, and John Convertino's rumbling, shuffling drums (few drummers have a sound as immediately recognizable as Convertino). Long-time Willie Nelson cohort Mickey Raphael lends high-desert harmonica to ""Sans-Façon"", and Amor himself even adds snappy guitar licks to ""L'Embellie"" and """"Ce Visage-Là"". Burns' Wurlitzer turns ""Les Confettis"" into a dark carnival, then ends ""Merci de Rien du Tout"" with a lengthy sound collage outro pasted together with pieces of a sampled French lesson.  <br/> <br/> At its best, <i>L'Entredeux</i> sounds lively and expansive, an idiosyncratic view of French and southwestern musics; at other times it sounds a bit too much like Calexico. But generally Burns keeps the arrangements textured enough to be interesting but not intrusive: a mere backdrop to reinforce Dissard's endeavors of intimacy. With the crisp phrasing of Françoise Hardy and the bluesy tone of Chan Marshall, Dissard holds the album together bravely. Unless you undestand French, you may not apprehend the narrative specifics of the garage-rocking ""Trop Expres"" or the slow-burning ""Cayenne"", but she easily and naturally communicates each song's strange mix of strong desires and overwhelming regrets.</p></div>"|12748.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12748-lentredeux/|7.2|Stephen M.

Blackshaw, a British guitarist descended from the modern primitive tradition of John Fahey and Robbie Basho, and van Wissem, a lute player and minimalist composer from Maastricht, both produce searching but accessible music that lends itself to meditative states. It should come as no surprise, then, that the music they make together traverses similar terrain. The tension between texture and melody in Blackshaw's music and van Wissem's love of palindromic melodies and spare composition are each well in evidence on these four joint compositions-- it's a pairing of rare sympathy, but it also feels somewhat more slight than the work of either man on his own. <br/><br/>Perhaps it's the brevity of the album-- half an hour-- or the fact that the first seven minutes is nothing but a wandering exploration of guitar harmonics and the wolf tones of the lute, but any chance for true immersion the album affords is lamentably fleeting. That's not to be taken as a write-off. At its best, this music is vibrant, deriving amazing amounts of energy from simple interplay of repeated figures. Blackshaw plays a 12-string guitar tuned to DADEAD on the whole album, and van Wissem counters with a specially-built 13-course Baroque lute. The tones of the instruments blend well, allowing the listener to concentrate on the slow mutation of patterns and the strange symmetry of the musical figures. <br/><br/>The two middle pieces are the best of the four, with the title track beautifully building a collection of tiny melodic fragments into a gentle flowing, lighter-than-air bed of sound that almost resembles a harpsichord caprice. Its nearly nine minutes pass by in a flash as the figures come and go in steady waves. ""Into the Dust of the Earth"" is a little more involved, harmonically, revolving around ancient-sounding, cycling melodies. The rhythm is accented with hard, buzzing plucks of the strings, and 12-string guitar has an interesting, almost chorused sound in the lower registers.  <br/><br/>The album's longest piece, ""I Am a Flower of Sharon and a Rose in the Valley,"" closes things out on an intentionally unresolved note, ending its spare, fragmented run by leaving a few notes just hanging in the air-- it's a neat piece from moment to moment (especially when van Wissem breaks out the bottleneck slide in the mid-section), but it lacks the flow from tension to release and back that characterize the best tracks on the record.

What it is, for E-40, turns out to be something of an endurance test: Even the limber-tongued rapper struggles to assert himself through the breakneck pace of MSTRKRFT's power chords. It's like listening to someone trying to rap in a lightning field. This is a telling moment on an album that always seems to be shouting over itself, a tone that accounts for <i>Fist of God</i>'s virtues and shortcomings alike.</p>
<p>Jesse F. Keeler still played bass and synths in Death from Above 1979 when he formed MSTRKRFT with producer Alex Puodziukas (aka. Al-P), which is now his primary endeavor. The transition represents Keeler gradually weaning himself off of rock, trading his bass guitar for various consoles and his dance-inflected rock music for rock-inflected dance music. Indebted to Daft Punk's vocal-infused robo-house, Justice's arena-sized stomp, and Vitalic's tooth-grinding tunnels of distortion, <i>Fist of God</i> has an metallic quality that doesn't falter even when riffage occasionally subsides, like on John Legend vehicle ""Heartbreaker"", where piano phrases seem wrought in gleaming chrome. More often, the tracks are comprised of loops caught perfectly between guitar- and synth-sounds. MSTRKRFT use delay, reverb, attack adjustments, and distortion to carve up these loops, reveling in quicksand bass and scintillating treble. At their most aggressive, the various strands of each track seem locked in mortal combat. ""1000 Cigarettes"" is like an electro-funk version of ""The Devil Went Down to Georgia"", with Eddie Van Halen as Johnny and a Roland drum machine as the devil.</p>
<p><i>Fist of God</i> improves on MSTRKRFT's first effort, <i>The Looks</i>, simply by jettisoning its omnipresent vocoder. If anything, it's <i>too</i> well-groomed, despite its wild-out vibe. There's a whiff of genre-exercise in the way strobe-light drum claps telegraph whooshing surges, vocal snips crisply striate each measure on the title track, and each contorting lick moves inexorably through real-time filter sweeps. With an ever-expanding collection of hardware and software, samples and sound banks, analog and digital synths, MSTRKRFT's sound is formally pristine, but a few stray hairs would lend it more character.</p>
<p>As it stands, <i>Fist of God</i> is a roundly enjoyable album with few highs and lows. A couple of the cameos are worthwhile: N.O.R.E.'s turn on ""Bounce"" suits the record's tone, and the track rates a prestige-bolstering remix on A-Trak's forthcoming mix album, <i>Infinity + 1</i>. Freeway is game and energetic on the alternate mix of ""1000 Cigarettes"", although he sounds rushed (and you can imagine how gnarly a track must be to rush Freeway), and Little Moe's deep-house diva turn on ""It Ain't Love"" holds up surprisingly well against the track's dot-matrix abrasion. John Legend's incredibly insipid lyrics about butterflies and rainbows don't do ""Heartbreaker"" any favors, but neither do they completely ruin it. It's a mystery why Jamal of soul-punk band the Carps warranted two guest spots, as both are profoundly anonymous.</p>
<p>And what the hell happened with ""Word Up"", the Ghostface collab? His warm-up chatter predicts a firebrand verse that never arrives-- instead, a couple of innocuous phrases (""word up,"" ""do it hard"") get cut up in uninteresting ways with clipped rave sirens and gymnastic synth-bass. You have to wonder if they got Ghost in the studio and then couldn't get anything worthwhile out of him, but you can't blame them for attempting to work with what they got-- would you pass up the chance to write ""feat. Ghostface Killah"" on your tracklist? In a way, this is representative of the album-- it's got all the right moves in place, but MSTRKRFT's handle on content is still slightly lagging behind their facility for tone and form. But if you're just looking for well-turned, rock-friendly, dance-party fodder, you could do a lot worse than <i>Fist of God</i>.</p></div>"|12835.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12835-fist-of-god/|6.0|Brian Howe

They brought with them their musical tastes, which were often derided by Californians but which created a market for Texas swing far beyond the Dust Bowl. In this environment, Bob Wills and His Texas Playboys flourished: He appeared in Hollywood westerns, played to enormous crowds from San Diego to Seattle, and-- with a handful of performers like Spade Cooley and Tex Ritter-- dominated country &amp; western radio. In an attempt to expand his audience and further entrench His Texas Playboys (as well as his offshoot groups, led by his brother and various associates) as a pre-eminent touring act, Wills formed Tiffany Music, Inc. with a radio disc jockey named Cactus Jack and a businessman named Clifford Sundin, with the intent of syndicating performances to radio stations across the country. Wills and the revolving line-up of Playboys recorded 26 radio specials between tours, showcasing an incredibly wide repertoire that included his biggest hits, raucous live staples, and an array of covers.</p>
<p>For three decades, the transcriptions sat in Sundin's archive, until Kaleidoscope Records purchased the masters, edited them to 150 songs, and distributed a 10-record set through Rhino starting in 1981. Collector's Choice has based its new set on that release, replicating the tracklist on ten discs and adding liner notes by usual suspect Rich Kienzle. It's difficult to overstate the set's importance, as it allows a valuable glimpse into the group's creative process and musical prowess, but  <i> The Tiffany Transcriptions </i> is no dusty artifact: This is Texas swing at its rowdiest and most anarchic, corralling jazz, blues, swing, jug band, and Zydeco stomps and reels into a distinctly American sound that has more than a little in common with the rock'n'roll of the next decade.</p>
<p>Because these transcriptions were recorded between the Texas Playboys' long tours throughout the left half of the United States, these songs sound practiced and a little punchy, with a rawness not heard in the more popular studio versions. Wills directed his band in much the same way as his more urban counterparts, taking the conductor's role and calling out sidemen to solo. Only, his sidemen soloed on string instruments-- fiddle, mandolin, and acoustic, electric, steel, and pedal steel guitar-- instead of horns. That made the 16-inch format of the transcriptions ideal for the Texas Playboys: With more room to stretch out in a song, the crack band could really cut loose, taking more solos and locking into longer jams that only hint at their rambunctious live shows.  <i> </i></p>
<p><i> The Tiffany Transcriptions </i> includes 150 songs and only one repeated (as both an instrumental and a vocal), which gives an idea of their vast repertoire that ranged from Texas songwriter Cindy Walker to New Yorkers Cole Porter and Billy Strayhorn to Singing Brakeman Jimmie Rodgers. At ten CDs (each handsomely packaged in gatefold cases with period artwork), the set is enormous and daunting, but there are enough jaw-dropping moments to make it more than accessible. Listen to Lester ""Junior"" Barnard's electric guitar snaking into the solo on ""Take Me Back to Tulsa"". Or Wills egging on piano player Millard Kelso and guitarist Eldon Shamblin on ""At the Woodchopper's Ball"". Or Alex Brashear's jazzy trumpet high-stepping through ""I Had Someone Else Before I Had You"". Or Wills tripping up Tommy Duncan's straight-man vocals on, well, just about any song. Or the way their road-weary dynamic makes this the definitive version of ""San Antonio Rose"" (never mind that it's titled here ""Lum &amp; Abner Special (San Antonio Rose)""). Or Tiny Moore's otherworldly electric mandolin solo on ""Playboy Chimes"". Or Dean &amp; Evelyn McKinney's sisterly harmonies on the tenth disc. I could go on and on. I could also climb inside this box and live for a few years.</p>
<p>Tiffany Music, Inc. was not especially profitable. By and large, the stations that picked up the series were already playing Wills' music, and under these call letters, the Tiffany series was wildly popular. But their number was too small to expand Wills' market, with most non-C&amp;W stations attaching a bumpkin stigma to the music, and the company shut down before all 26 transcriptions were distributed. The venture may have failed financially, but it left us an undeniable musical success.</p></div>"|12742.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12742-the-tiffany-transcriptions/|8.9|Stephen M. Deusner

""<i>Heavy Ghost</i> is streaming in its entirety over at AsthmaticKitty.com!"" he blogged recently, alluding to the impending release of his full-length debut. ""I recommend steamed potatoes as an accompaniment. Steam them, then fry them a little, then shake some soy sauce over them. I had mine sliced an eighth of an inch thin and they were delish. Fever's still here but I'm full of yum. And a little broccoli. Excellent.""</p>
<p>But Stith's casually quotidian conflation of his cooking and craft (overlooking, for now, the intimation of illness) is belied by the weight of <i>Heavy Ghost</i> itself, a perfectly named disc. A designer by trade, Stith has apparently always been musically inclined, but it took working with Shara Worden on My Brightest Diamond's bow to serve as a catalyst for releasing his own works. Yet it's hard to imagine Stith keeping this music bottled up and private for so long. ""Music feels less like striving for acceptance and more like life,"" wrote Stith on his site a few posts earlier, and that admission provides a more accurate glimpse into the subconscious but intensely spiritual inclinations that make Stith's idiosyncratic songs tick.</p>
<p>As for just what those songs constitute, well, that's a tall order. As a vocalist, Stith shares some soft-spoken similarities with the ever wistful Robert Wyatt, especially on tracks such as ""BMB"", ""Creekmouth"", ""Thanksgiving Moon"", and ""Morning Glory Cloud"", but as with Wyatt's own records the music's difficult to encapsulate. Here that beguiling elusiveness manifests itself as a sort of eerie chamber cabaret, full of distant choirs and hypnotic percussion, folky interludes and dissonant deconstructions, augmented by strange scraping and strumming and the occasional striking shift from minor to major chord. It's this push and pull between equally mysterious poles that makes songs such as ""Pigs"" and ""Pity Dance"" so entrancing, if ultimately, intriguingly tough to pin down.</p>
<p>Elusiveness can be a frustrating quality in music, rebuffing any attempts to engage and often leaving the song suspended in a state of untouchable purgatory, but here that elusiveness works largely in Stith's favor. As tough as it may be to pin down the pastoral but still somehow strikingly tense ""Fire of Birds"" or the stunning emotional catharsis of ""Braid of Voices"", the experience of being trapped with Stith in such a strange, <i>sui generis</i> little world is in some ways compensation enough, even if the odd, unpredictable melodies and structures make a quick embrace impossible. <i>Heavy Ghost</i> is music that demands attention but rarely acts out as an easy means of getting it.</p>
<p>It's an impressively dense and mature work, and without a doubt sometimes tough listening, too, but somehow not hard to listen to, let alone hard to like. It's almost as if Stith is meeting the listener halfway but no more than that, keeping his distance rather than helping us over that final hurdle. No, that would be ""striving for acceptance,"" and therefore unacceptable. Rather, <i>Heavy Ghost</i> is, in Stith's words, ""more like life:"" sometimes challenging, sometimes confusing, but, in the end, rewarding.</p></div>"|12814.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12814-heavy-ghost/|7.6|Joshua Klein

That would be a shame: Gibson has more to offer than vague descriptors like ""folksy"" and ""understated"" would suggest, and besides, her music is far better suited to a fireplace and a cup of warm apple cider than to your local Starbucks. Raised in a tiny coastal town, the soft-spoken songstress inched quietly into the scene in 2006 with <i>If You Come to Greet Me</i>, her refreshingly homespun if sometimes staid full-length debut. At first blush, the follow-up, <i>Beasts of Seasons</i>, doesn't appear to mark a significant departure from its predecessor. But unravel its seemingly rudimentary façade and you'll find an affecting study in contrasts from a songwriter a good deal more sophisticated than she's generally willing to let on.</p>
<p>At the core of this study is a thematic concept of Gibson's own design. She's divided the record roughly in half; ""Communion Songs"" comprise the first part, while the second is made up of ""Funeral Songs"". Yet the two ideas are hardly mutually exclusive, a notion Gibson makes evident in the opening song, seven and a half minutes of gently cascading majesty entitled ""Shadows on Parade"". Apart from evoking the passage of time, the song's central image-- ""I will watch the shadows on parade""-- suggests the solitude, repose, and even isolation of the lonely and the waiting. With Gibson's ""parade"" description, however, the solitary activity of shadow-watching becomes something contrastingly communal and celebratory, a point underscored by the sample of a distant drum corps and crowd she and producer Tucker Martine (the Decemberists, Sufjan Stevens, Mudhoney) use to close out the song. It's the first of many little moments on the record that illustrate Gibson's willingness to see an image through at a time when a lot of similar songwriters are content to settle for what ""feels good"" or ""sounds good"" and move along.</p>
<p>Shadow-watching gives way to other pensive activities as <i>Beasts</i> continues: reminiscence, daydreams, diary-like appeals to an unnamed ""other"", and the meditations on mortality that mark the ""Funeral"" half of the record. ""If these bare walls could sing,"" Gibson begins on the transitional track ""Funeral Songs""-- is she still watching and waiting for something even after the sunset has extinguished that parade of shadows? Indeed, a line about a body ""swaying like a drunkard"" and a trio of ruminations on Gibson's mother, father, and sister on closing track ""Glory"" are among the few moments where we're transported from Gibson's head to someplace outside. Yet for all of the singer's insularity, she never sounds alone on <i>Beasts of Seasons</i>, thanks to a mostly exquisite array of backing arrangements courtesy of a host of PDX luminaries, including Laura Veirs, labelmate Shelly Short, and members of the Decemberists, M. Ward's band, Menomena, and Norfolk &amp; Western. ""Spirited"", easily the record's liveliest track, gets a boost from a chorus of ""OOH-ooh-OOH""s and booming percussion-work that keep things moving at a steady cantor, while ""Where Have All Your Good Words Gone?""'s fatalistic imagery rubs up against foreboding timpani rolls and chilly fiddle-playing that calls to mind Death bowing the buried to life in Saint-Saëns' <i>Danse Macabre</i>.</p>
<p>As a singer, Gibson treats syllables with the same patience and loving precision a mosaic maker might put into cutting and arranging his/her tiles. It comes as little surprise, then, that words are a lyrical preoccupation of Gibson's throughout <i>Beasts of Seasons</i>. On ""Come By Storm"", the singer recalls how she ""took great care with words,"" and, later, how she loses herself to them. ""Spirited"" finds her describing how ""morning tends to... turn our words to smoke,"" while the aforementioned ""Where Have All Your Good Words Gone?"" has her grappling with the loss of a loved one by asking, ""Where are all the pleasures from the timbre of your tongue?"" Yet for all her talk of words, Gibson allows herself a fairly limited lexicon on <i>Beasts of Seasons</i>. If she knows some ""good"" ones like her sesquipedalian-prone onetime tourmate and fellow Portlander Colin Meloy, she wisely forgoes them in favor of repeated references to bodies and bones, trees and tongues, pictures, poems, and stories-- all of which lend the record a reflexivity that rewards repeat listens.</p></div>"|12816.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12816-beasts-of-seasons/|7.2|Matthew Solarski

Teeth-grittingly tense and with chilling atmosphere, they play the appropriate soundtrack for a bombed-out, water-damaged Brooklyn basement with one bulb for light. If the Yeah Yeah Yeahs had pursued the more confrontational branches of New York no-wave, they would probably sound like this. Since drafting Bill Salas on drums, electronic percussion, and weird noises in 2007, they've been adding 8-bit bells and whistles and a touch of 1990s Warp sound palette to the band's art-rock. Meanwhile, Pat Noecker continues to use his guitar to gnash and threaten around the edges of the songs, never being much of a riff guy from Liars to n0 things to now. Singer Anna Barie babbles, barks, and purrs over the peculiar pastiche.</p>
<p>When it all comes together, it makes for something singular, and there are three great examples at the top of their latest,  <i> All Aboard Future</i>. Opener ""Easy Answers"" starts with a galloping glam bounce of a beat-- somewhere on the same line as Battles' ""Atlas""-- that makes sampled handclaps and firecrackers indistinguishable from one another. Noecker's guitar and blurts of keyboard sound like ducks honking in a military march, while Barie veers between a mocking mutter and possessed wail.</p>
<p>""Life of Birds"" continues with the evil carnival vibe, with especially high and grating guitar bends and more of a spotlight on Barie, purring come-hither nonsense in between screams over a bubbly electronic two-step. ""Double Double Yolk"" has a thick, slow beat and startling ascending and descending electric tones; Barie sings more than screeches, while there's little to no guitar at all. You can pretty easily guess at the contributions of each member here, but you can just as easily see them working together and pulling back or stepping forward to lift the track higher.</p>
<p>From there, the record withholds the release on all of its tension. ""Parallel Shores"" resolves itself instead with melodic guitar work; ""Light After Sound"" is largely static and nearly aimless, whispering the same phrase repeatedly over an ominous mechanical hum, until the band kicks in without ever breaking the mood. It seems like the kind of experiment in tension that These Are Powers might have grown out of, given the progress from release to release and their promising  <i> Taro Tarot EP </i> from 2008. ""Adam's Turtle"" and ""Glass Blocks"" are more spooky, if familiar, skronk with unusual percussion, from steel drums to handclaps to water drops. But the parts seem more incongruous here, the slow, menacing beats of both being the only constant.</p>
<p>There's not a lot of middle ground between no-wave and laptop workouts or modern R&amp;B, but TAP are committed to finding it while steadfastly adhering to the creepy mood of their self-described ""ghost-punk."" This brief album is carefully sequenced, and even the most static of their songs has added texture and direction, sounding more purposefully tense. Their catchier material that front-loads the record is so distinct and stunning, however, that it's hard not to be left wanting more after those opening tracks.</p></div>"|12798.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12798-all-aboard-future/|6.9|Jason Crock

Despite the unabated use of adjectives like ""sprawling"" or ""sweeping"" or ""epic,"" the indie road trip album has become  something of a lost art, with bands mostly forgoing dense, pent-up instrumentation that slowly unfurls and releases-- you know, that lonesome crowded sound.   You could blame it on so many bands being from autophobic NYC, or that the Pacific Northwest gods of indie are still going too strong  to already be a primary influence, but neither would explain New York's  Cymbals Eat Guitars' <i>Why There Are Mountains</i>.  While there's  plenty of geographical signifiers on their debut, it's almost topographic in its approach, without  hooks and choruses so much as map-like layouts of mountains and sloping  valleys.</p>
<p>Six-minute opener ""...And the Hazy Sea"" has <i> Why They Are Mountains </i>sounding like it could immediately implode,  kicking off with the kind of cataclysmic blowout Built to Spill used to  get to in a few minutes' less time. Occasionally adding reverbed guitar and electric piano to give an eye-of-the-storm calm, the band reaches about six different crescendos; it's less showy theatrics than Cymbals Eat Guitars just  packing a lot of ideas into their songs.  It's  tough to consider structures this unpredictable to be templates, but upon hearing the subtle instrumental shifts  of ""Indiana"" evolving from noise-rock interlude to a horn-led piano waltz, you locate a certain pretzel logic in  these songs-within-songs.  Yelpy and adenoidal, bombastic and yet  unkempt, you could pretty much slap a sticker on this thing saying ""RIYL:  indie rock.""</p>
<p>""Some Trees (Merritt Moon)"" emerges from the feedback exhaust of ""...And the Hazy Sea"" into  two minutes of tightly coiled post-punk dance and strangulated,  sugary hooks.  At first an environmentalist's lament  of suburban sprawl, a much more sinister effect of deforestation is  revealed-- ""I was thankful for the mystery/ But by the time the girl had  hanged herself/ I could have looked out my back window and watched her neck  just snap."" CEG are rarely as dark as they are on ""Some  Trees"", but besides a sound engineer, the group also shares with Modest Mouse a tendency to turn supremely stoned observations into startling  lucidity.</p>
<p><i>Why There Are Mountains </i> gains as much impact from its quieter moments, especially ""Share"", which parlays queasy, whammy-bar shoegaze atmosphere into a defeated,  yet regal procession of horns.  As its followed by ""What Dogs  See"", four minutes of echoing rubble and near spoken-word mumbles,  it initially seems like a pokey bit of sequencing, but the song evolves  into a prelude to the deceptively bouncy ""Wind Phoenix"", which turns personal devastation into a sing-along. The scattered lyrics could pass for a whimsical recollection  of an Indiana youth spent watching Notre Dame football and listening  to Sub Pop until you focus on the song's macabre laments.</p>
<p>What's most admirable about  this sophisticated self-released debut is Cymbals Eat Guitars' willingness to think big with gestures that shouldn't fly in the hands of a young band, instrumentally or thematically.  Occasionally, albeit  rarely, it leads them astray, as in the closer ""Like Blood Does"", where the group dawdles a bit too long before reaching its arresting conclusion. But that's a minor quibble considering how <i>Why  There Are Mountains </i>ends up being like any great result of  wanderlust-- here, the journey is the end not the means; fortunately, that gives <i>Why There Are Mountains </i>astounding replay value.</p></div>"|12826.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12826-why-there-are-mountains/|8.3|Ian Cohen

Froberg has a long legacy to live up to-- if he didn't want albatrosses like Drive Like Jehu or Hot Snakes around his neck, he should have been in bands that were less awesome-- but while there's evidence of growth here, there's not enough change to alienate fans. If they can appreciate a little less mania and a little more melody, <i>I Blame You</i> will be a comfortable fit. Along with the voice that fronted his old band, Froberg carries the same staunch, traditional, almost obstinate approach to guitar-driven rock'n'roll. He even continues his streak of doing all the artwork for his albums.</p>
<p>Despite a tongue-in-cheek cover claiming it's ""Xtra Compressed for Maximum Listener Fatigue""-- another shot at modern recording methods and another window into Froberg's own ideals-- <i>I Blame You</i> just sounds right: dueling guitars that have refined the echo and twang of surf and rockabilly into a sharp edge, basslines that are less walking than swaggering, drums too respectful and too evil for elaborate fills. Yet with all that, it is probably Froberg's most melodic and diverse record. ""Widow of My Dreams"" treads familiar ground with a descending surf-rock riff and a few hair-raising guitar bends, and ""Two-Headed Coin"" is the album's catchiest and most linear track, built on a foundation of shimmying bass and the shake of maracas. The span of ""Pine On"" to ""Fake Kinkade"" is more than enough proof that no one has lost their touch, but outside of a rather jagged Snakes-esque run through of an old blues track by Kokomo Arnold, ""Mllk Cow Blues"", those songs are the exceptions rather than the norm.</p>
<p>Some of that aforementioned diversity translates into filler, including the meandering ""Run"", led by second vocalist/guitarist Sohrab Habibion, and the instrumental title track-- and that's just side A. Hearing Froberg later chart a failed relationship over the mid-tempo earnestness of ""SUD"" is rather leaden, but he takes a different tack with the same subject on closer ""Back and Forth"". The ""Be My Baby"" beat seems a little easy for someone like Froberg, who's found plenty of ways to rock convincingly on countless records without ever being obvious. But the winking retread and simple shout-a-long chorus doesn't sound tired here-- it sounds earned.</p>
<p>That's possibly in part due to Froberg's lyrics being no less cynical when slowing it down (""You say that nobody ever knows anyone at at all/ That's not true; I know you""). Nor is the album deficient for lacking big choruses or muscular shock and awe; in fact, many of this record's best surprises are moments like when the white-knuckle ascending riff of ""Light Sweet Crude"" recedes into a quieter, simmering chorus, something more appropriate for a low-gear pursuit on a dark, winding road than a high-octane highway chase. It's great that the band can slow down and still hold attention, and one hopes Obits will dig deeper and find new thrills in old traditions in the coming years.</p></div>"|12829.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12829-i-blame-you/|6.3|Jason Crock

But it's probably fair to say that his records tend to work best when focused on a specific theme. Take <i>Interstellar Space Revisited, </i> his live album with Gregg Bendian that re-imagined the legendary John Coltrane-Rasheed Ali classic, or <i>Ash and Tabula: Out Trios Vol. 3</i>, a set of full-speed improvisations with Andrea Parkins and Tom Rainey. Both are smart, sharp, and consistent. On the other hand, consider albums by his group the Nels Cline Singers-- all interesting, but also, as Aaron Leitko put it in a Pitchfork review, ""schizophrenic"" and ""hard to pin down... Because of this constantly shifting focus it's hard to call any one album the definitive Nels Cline statement,"" Leitko wrote. ""Each record is just another group of solid but diffuse tunes.""</p>
<p>The same applies to Cline's latest, the solo, all-instrumental <i>Coward. </i> According to a press release<i>, </i> the album resulted from him ""contemplating a solo overdub project for nearly 25 years."" So one might expect the record to be focused, and in fact each track has a clear, well-executed purpose. But as a whole, <i>Coward </i> is pretty schizoid. Spinning through delicate acoustics, genre homages, abstract meditations, and even an electro-funk number, Cline wanders around the map without much concern for connecting the dots. This dizzying diversity makes  <i> Coward </i> less an album than a collection of unrelated essays. It's easy to admire, not too tough to enjoy-- but the abrupt stylistic shifts make it hard to love.</p>
<p>Still, examining individual tracks reveals a wealth of interesting music. Opener ""Epiphyllum"" builds a tense, textured drone, while the obviously-titled ""Thurston County"" does a convincing impression of the Sonic Youth guitarist's Branca-punk style, yet gains enough momentum to become a worthy rocker in its own right. Even better are two acoustic guitar pieces, ""The Divine Homegirl"" and ""The Nomad's Home"", whose precise, patient tones recall the prettier tunes from Sir Richard Bishop's <i>Polytheistic Fragments. </i> The other acoustic pieces on <i>Coward </i> are less compelling, more like exercises in Derek Bailey or John Fahey scholarship than coherent songs. But even there, Cline's devotion and energy are never in doubt.</p>
<p>One section of <i>Coward</i>, a six-track suite dubbed ""Onan"", actually retains some thematic consistency, with a darkly insistent mood running throughout. Still, here again we get so much hopping around-- from the post-rock drama of ""II: Lord and Lady"", to the Pink Floyd psych of ""IV: Interruption (Onan's Psychedelic Breakdown)"", to the Black Dice throb of ""V: Seedcaster""-- that it's nearly impossible to get hooked by all the tonal leaps that Cline so quickly and effortlessly glides through.</p>
<p>It's perhaps unfair to fault Cline for stretching his many creative limbs-- the guy has long been adept at every conceivable guitar sound, and he could probably base a full album on each mode he employs here. But it's also likely that such albums would be more memorable than this one, whose songs are hard to recall once Cline has discarded them and jumped forward. There's no doubt that   <i> Coward </i> is a worthy addition to his canon, but the chances of it being anyone's go-to Cline disc are roughly the same as someone listing a compilation as their favorite album.</p></div>"|12776.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12776-coward/|6.9|Marc Masters

At least that's what Wilson later told critic Simon Reynolds. U2 soldiered on without Joy Divison's gothy glamor, and of course Bono wasn't the only one carrying an unforgettable fire for Curtis. Then and since, a long list of bands have tried fusing U2's stadium-size grandiosity with Joy Division's bleak foreboding. Sometimes they're Radiohead, sometimes they're Interpol, and sometimes they're White Lies.</p>
<p>The most relevant current comparison is probably Glasvegas, another UK band groomed early on for success, only to release a disappointingly ponderous debut album. Except where Glasvegas' roots in girl-group, JAMC, and early Creation bands amounted to an Exciting New Direction in the beleaguered British indie scene, White Lies have been striking the usual post-punk moves ever since a pair of Stephen Street-produced singles in 2006, back when they were called Fear of Flying. White Lies' debut  <i> To Lose My Life... </i> recently entered the UK charts at #1 and combines prose-purple darkness with rafters-shooting arena rock. It's better than Elefant, worse than the Stills, nearly on par with Editors-- which in the English rock press these days assures descriptors like ""classic"" and ""masterpiece.""</p>
<p>Produced by Ed Buller (Pulp, Suede) and Max Dingel (the Killers, Glasvegas), and boasting melodramatic accompaniment by a 20-piece orchestra,  <i> To Lose My Life... </i> can't be faulted in terms of tightness or radio-ready polish. If you liked the new Oasis and U2 records, never bought  <i> Turn on the Bright Lights</i>, and tend to ignore clumsy lyrics, you might enjoy raising your beer to this album just fine. Hell, the hummable Cars-esque new wave at the bridge of dour opening track ""Death"" is just what you needed if you're willing to forget ""Just What I Needed"". But White Lies know beer is really more for staring at glumly: ""Everything has got to be love or death,"" singer/guitarist Harry McVeigh declares.</p>
<p>Why not both? ""Let's grow old together and die at the same time,"" the title track urges, certainly not the last time someone will rewrite the Smiths' ""There Is a Light That Never Goes Out"" by way of the Modern Lovers' ""Dignified and Old"", crank up the bombast, and leave out all pathos, personality, and charm. White Lies' flirtations with mortality certainly don't help their drab tunes. ""If you tell me to jump then I'll die,"" goes the galloping ""E.S.T.""; ""As you said goodbye, I almost died,"" the weepy ""Nothing to Give"" adds. But their rote cheerlessness suggests no such emotional intensity. As McVeigh sings on POW-invoking sub-<i>Joshua Tree </i> ballad ""Fifty on Our Foreheads"", ""All we heard was lies about the truth."" Right, as opposed to the  <i> other</i> kind of lies.</p>
<p>White Lies could even get away with a little heavy-handed somberness if anything of their own (other than unintentional humor) shone through their reconstituted gloom-rock. A little less death, a little more love-- of creativity, of life in all its urgent particulars rather than just the hand-me-down cliches that stand in for them-- would go a long way. Take ""Unfinished Business"", where gothic organs, Interpol-like phrasing, and a jarring James Bond allusion convey little other than that White Lies own a few critically acclaimed records and probably know who Roger Moore is. ""Love and death are always on my mind,"" the Stills sang back in 2003. In other words, White Lies are boring and stuff.</p></div>"|12801.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12801-to-lose-my-life/|4.0|Marc Hogan

They're survivors, which isn't a comment on the music but a comment on the fact that they're still making music, undeterred in the mission despite the ups and downs implied by that album title. Then again, maybe that's a nod to geography: Principles Eric Carter and Daniel Hutchens hail from West Virginia, but have been based in Athens, Ga., for years-- and sound like it. Or that title could be about zombies.</p>
<p>For many listeners,  <i> Baby, They Told Us We Would Rise Again </i> will be their first exposure to Bloodkin, and many others heard them open for the Drive-By Truckers. There are enough musical similarities between the two bands, though, that it seems perfectly natural that Mike Cooley would cameo on  <i> Rise Again</i>, David Barbe would produce it, and Patterson Hood would write the liner notes. Bloodkin scribble with their guitars, creating churning ambience as well as cab-forward riffs. The guitar licks on ""Easter Eggs"" shoot like sparks from a campfire, peel paint on ""Ghost Runner"", course like heroin through the addiction lament ""The Viper"", which builds to a climax with Orenda Fink's trumpet. They see beyond the Truckers, though, to drivin' n cryin' and Georgia Satellites, to Skynyrd (of course) and .38 Special, yet the accomplishment of  <i> Rise Again </i> is that Bloodkin manage to sound like so many other acts but most of all like themselves.</p>
<p>And because they're Southerners by choice, there's a literary bent to  <i> Rise Again</i>, as if the legacy of Faulkner or even the Beats were alive on vinyl rather than in ink (Hutchens proclaims himself the ""bastard son of Neal Cassady""). The words are more carefully chosen and placed than the notes, as it usually is with the best southern rock bands. Occasionally the imagery can be a bit pat, as on ""Rhododendron"", when Hutchens sings, ""Life is a mystery, but it's fragrant as an apple tree,"" as the guitars crash into each other. On the other hand, considering the mean highway they've traveled, they've earned the right to such placid similes.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Bloodkin may be at their catchiest and most quotable when they're at their funniest. ""Heavy With Child"" is a litany of reasons to be happy, some sincere and some sarcastic. ""I'm so happy you're heavy with child."" ""I'm so happy that you're a real blonde."" ""I'm so happy the bathroom door locks."" And so on. But when Hutchens admits ""I'm so happy we're living the dream,"" he sounds like he means it, and the song's true meaning becomes clear: These are the reasons that make a happy, albeit imperfect, union, where the good outweighs the bad. Or, as they theorize on the road anthem ""A Place to Crash"": ""I think what saved us was we never lost that feel."" Here's hoping they never do.</p></div>"|12768.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12768-baby-they-told-us-we-would-rise-again/|7.3|Stephen M. Deusner

The drums are  steady. The harmonies are supple. Its various strings,  shakers, and horns captured and layered into a well-spaced, easily listenable  whole. After a spin or three, a handful of <i>Grrr...</i>'s 13 tracks  should stick, too, whether it's the vibraphone-abetted ""The Lion  &amp; the Teacup"" or the squiggling, lustful plunder-like-pirates  number, ""Shanghaied"". And maybe being swept up by a hook or two  is enough, but much like the politely irritated word it takes for its  name, the too-pleasant <i>Grrr...</i> concedes to middle-of-the-road safety, hoping to offend no one and,  in the process, says absolutely nothing.</p>
<p>Music that's safe, of course,  isn't necessarily worthy of derision, especially if its origins and  aims are pedestrian. If you're criticizing Jason  Mraz for writing ""I'm Yours"" to push a few  hundred thousand units, you're picking an easy and misguided fight. But, complete with references  to Pliny the Elder's ornithological bent, their borough's rooftop  activities, and a friend's broken vinyl records, <i>Grrr...</i> is  by, of, and for indie kids. In fact, Bishop Allen regularly remind us their protagonists are apart from and above the masses: Characters  climb roofs and hit the road in idealized beatnik fashion. They leave  everyone else behind, staring down from the tops of buildings or forgetting  people's names when they cross state lines. They treat the rest of  the world as a quaint curiosity.</p>
<p>What's more, Bishop Allen's  narrators see their surroundings solipsistically. The world is theirs  for the using, Bishop Allen suggests, an idea epitomized by the mercurial character of ""Dirt on Your New Shoes"". She turns seashells  into her necklace, the ground into her mattress, and the band into her  jukebox. And worse, Bishop Allen's subjects suggest the world has  no bigger worry than their feelings. When the South China moon shines  down, it burns ""a hole in my head out of spite."" The particularly  unstable narrator of ""Rooftop Brawl"" startles that the sun still  shines, not that he's lived long enough to see it again. That is,  he fancies that the world's fate hinges on his ability to outlast  his depression through the night. Fuck you and me and all y'all, really:  The sun rises only for him.</p>
<p>So this batch of smug tunes comes aimed above or around the lot of us, but it's not a significant  loss. In their neat instrumental outfits-- where everything is mannerly  and tucked and where a distorted guitar actually sounds parodic-- these  songs serve mostly as reminders that songwriters singing about love,  wounded friends, and hitting the road have long done this stuff better,  both through more relevant references and less banal sonics. Musically,  these songs don't deserve to pretend they're better than anything  else.</p>
<p>That's too bad, as Bishop  Allen's 2006 monthly EP series suggested  a band of guileless but educated, prolific but considered romantics.  Back then, Bishop Allen could turn moving a piano into heart-quaking  triumph (""Corazon"") or meeting a mistaken woman into reassuring  compassion (""Bellingham""). A sense of musical delight and adventurousness  served those EPs well. Mixing docile acoustic waltzes with clashing,  blunt bar rock, Bishop Allen sounded eager to explore all corners of  pop.</p>
<p>But even when Bishop Allen  regales with the crazy sights they've seen or the tough lives they've  lived, <i>Grrr...</i> seems transcribed from a distant memory or read  from the pages of a script (<i>Sullivan's Travels</i> perhaps, or <i>O Brother, Where Art Thou?</i>). In the movie <i>Mutual  Appreciation, </i>Bishop Allen frontman Justin Rice played an aspiring singer-songwriter named Alan  who said he was looking for experience, not happiness. Five years later,  Rice's real band-- which has never sounded so woefully self-involved  and unengaged-- would do well to heed that advice.</p></div>"|12831.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12831-grrr/|3.5|Grayson Currin

We may still most readily associate the nation with the famously disastrous UN peacekeeping missions of the mid-90s (documented in the book and film <i>Black Hawk Down</i>), yet a cursory glance at headlines in 2009 yields news of malnutrition, piracy, and ominous support of Al-Qaeda, and we're reminded that strife, fighting, and famine have been facts of life in Somalia for decades.</p>
<p>Somali-born rapper K'naan managed to flee the country in 1991, shortly after the outbreak of its still-ongoing civil war, yet there's no doubt he experienced more than enough violence and destitution in the 1980s under the totalitarian regime of president Siad Barre to last a lifetime. As you'd expect, emerging from one of the fiercest, bloodiest places on the planet has indelibly shaped K'naan's artistry. On his initially unnoticed but ultimately highly acclaimed 2005 debut, <i>The Dusty Foot Philosopher</i>, this intimacy with horror manifested itself in a combination of deeply felt African melodies and bitterly spat rhymes, which unblinkingly held up a picture of Third World hardship presumably exceeding in chaos and misery even the most harrowing upbringing in the ghettoes of the United States.</p>
<p>Truth be told, K'naan's weighing of the Somali experience against the inner-city struggles of American rappers became a fairly substantial talking point both on his debut record itself and in the media run-up to his first major-label offering, the newly released <i>Troubadour</i>. K'naan provides enough ammunition for music writers to fashion the comparison into the crux of their profiles and reviews, permitting them to rail against ""bling"" (<i>The Telegraph</i>) and ""braggadocio posturing"" (<i>Spin</i>) without coming off the slightest bit flippant, because hey, K'naan had it far rougher, and he finds current American rap (according to an interview with NPR) to be ""a comedy"" that's ""kind of cute"" in its attempts to be hardcore.</p>
<p>Regardless of the fact that I wouldn't last five minutes in Somalia and 50 Cent might not last an hour, it seems rather counterproductive and pointless to even indirectly diminish the very legitimate formative struggles of someone like T.I. or Lil Wayne. But it's hardly surprising, considering K'naan seems to be positing himself (and allowing himself to be posited) as an antidote to conscience-less, spoiled, insular mainstream rap in all kinds of ways. The ambition is admirable, and K'naan's talents are formidable, yet <i>Troubadour</i> suffers from the same shortcomings as many major-label debuts from arresting independent artists. Namely, it tries to do too much and aims to be too many things to too many people. K'naan hasn't yet demonstrated the capacity to be a full-on savior, and <i>Troubadour</i>'s noble breadth ends up stretching its protagonist too thin.</p>
<p>Without question, <i>Troubadour</i> makes K'naan more accessible and openhearted than the snarling, apoplectic emcee who often sounded like Eminem on his debut. The new album was largely recorded at the Marley-famed Tuff Gong Studio in Jamaica, and at its best finds K'naan remarkably approximating Bob's great gift for conflating the personal and the universal, for crafting broadly appealing global pop that brims with pathos and personality. There's the Lennon-echoing ""Dreamer"", which finds a teenage K'naan quoting A Tribe Called Quest to distract himself from the atrocity in front of his eyes, as well as ""Wavin' Flag"", a melodic gem and a stirring redemption song for the suffering people of his homeland. There's ""Somalia"", with its eerie spare flutes and haunting images of ""coffins closing,"" and the heartbreaking <i>Slumdog</i>-ish ""Fatima"", a devastating story of young love and big dreams dashed in a war zone. And to show cleverness and verve still thrive in an ill-fated land, there's ""15 Minutes Away"", a comically engaging saga about restlessly waiting for Western Union funds that evokes the scamp-ish charm of Mike Skinner.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this big-tent spirit also occasionally dilutes some of the elements that made K'naan's debut so striking. The grooves and hooks of ""I Come Prepared"", ""America"", and ""Take a Minute"" are far more limp than anything on <i>Troubadour</i>'s predecessor, which boasted richly native musical explorations like ""Soobax"" and ""Hoobaale"". What's worse, someone decided this coming-out party needed a dose of star power, and so even setting aside the presence of K'naan supporter and facilitator Damian Marley, the album unnecessarily features a sluggish Mos Def (""America""), a totally superfluous Kirk Hammett (""If Rap Gets Jealous""), and a game but jarringly out of place Adam Levine (""Bang Bang""). K'naan may well be prescient in his canny prediction that ""I'll probably win a Grammy"" (""America"") since his remarkable story and positive bent are pitch-perfect bait for such honors. Still, I wish I left <i>Troubadour</i> feeling like I knew more about Somalia than I did going in, and I'm not entirely sure that's the case.</p></div>"|12799.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12799-troubadour/|6.5|Joshua Love

When you waver from an ironic disbelief in religion to a stricken doubt in yourself, you've got yourself a great arc. Or as Deleted Scenes put it, more off-handedly, ""Got god, got boring/ Lost god, stayed boring, got drunk.""</p>
<p><i> Birdseed Shirt </i> isn't a record specifically about faith, but they work the theme hard. It carries through as they swing from grizzled jokes to unabashed emo bellows. The disgusted drunken Catholic schoolboy waltz of ""Deacons"" sits easily with the upbeat vibes of ""City That Never Wakes Up"". And the country humility of ""One Long Country Song"" still can't quite take a heartbreak lying down.</p>
<p>The band's boast that they're influenced by both the Danielson Famile and Talking Heads holds water, not least because frontman Dan Scheuerman has the range and power to give direction to their genre wanderings. He can carry two vocal modes-- modest, country and a little bit strange, and brave and ferocious; he saves the latter approach for special occasions, always making it pay off.</p>
<p>The songwriting is strong throughout the set, and even the short songs aren't slight. With Matt Dowling primarily on bass, Chris Scheffey on guitar, and Brian Hospital on drums, the band is a well-worn quartet that takes risks in the arrangements but never gets clever for the sake of it. They do big indie rock, like the build-up to the horns and harmony vocals that punctuate the opener, ""Turn to Sand"". The singalong and warm guitars of ""Take My Life"" make the deeply emo evocation of suicide surprisingly palatable. But they also picked up the best scraps from post-rock, including the vibes on ""Deacons"" and ""City That Never Wakes Up"", or the organ on ""Fake IDs"", a descendent of Radiohead's ""Let Down"" and the album's must-hear cut.</p>
<p>Credit to producer L. Skell,<i> Birdseed Shirt </i> isn't a knock-down-the-walls powerhouse, so much as a well-balanced demonstration of all the band's best sides-- from thoughtful existentialism to friendly irony to strange, drowsy downers. The finale, ""Get Your Shit Together for the Holidays"", encapsulates its spirit: warm and familiar at the outset, sliding into a massive, deliciously echoey climax, with dark lyrics that end on redemption-- except redemption basically means telling the protagonist to get off his or her ass and do the right thing for a couple of days. This is a young band, but they already know that good cheer will only last you so long.</p></div>"|12786.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12786-birdseed-shirt/|8.0|Chris Dahlen

Six years ago, the duo's second album,  <i> Finery</i>, might have seemed like the last word on fusing ""microhouse"" sonics with, you know, proper songs. But it was simultaneously the first-- and, it turns out, solitary-- word on a return of Tim Rice lyricism to pop: Amazingly, Alex Paulick's ear-tickling technicolor arrangements were less florid than singer Rob Taylor's thesaurus-happy songwriting and mannered Broadway vocals.</p>
<p>So it's not surprising that Coloma's profile has since been almost non-existent, nor that they immediately began to beat a trail away from the startling modernity of their early work and towards a more familiar and comforting ""real instruments"" sound. Perhaps they've reasoned-- quite sensibly-- that most listeners will only stand for so much scene-stealing idiosyncrasy at once.</p>
<p>On the duo's fourth album,  <i> Love's Recurring Dream</i>, the transition from sharply etched micro-pop to billowing chamber-pop is almost complete: The music's organic lines are colored in with jazzy drum fills, maudlin trumpets, even anonymously soulful backing vocals. Nonetheless, even leaving aside Taylor's sore-thumb singing, this is clearly the work of the same group. Guitars, harpsichords, and muted horns may have replaced synth burbles and skittery beats, but the arrangements are still by and large prickly and pointillist, each tiny sound burnished to a dazzling sheen. It's a remarkably neat, punctilious sound; whereas once a slightly buzzy bass line might have suggested a hedonistic looseness lurking under the surface,  <i> Love's Recurring Dream</i>'s composure remains unruffled throughout, offering only starched shirts as far as the ear can hear.</p>
<p>Coloma's poetic predilections have also been reined in. Once, the duo's songs sounded  <i> scripted </i> more than written and performed, complete with stage instructions like ""turn to audience"" and ""exit stage left.""  <i> Love's Recurring Dream </i> retains some of this air (""You look like a dummy in a shopfront... [<i>dramatic pause</i>]... and I mean that as a compliment""), and Taylor still hasn't overcome his fondness for terrible puns (see the found-sound cod-blues mope ""Blue Blood""), but most of the time these songs feel literary rather than verbose, less top-heavy with overblown melodrama than before.</p>
<p>All of which makes Coloma seem much more like other stuff you maybe already know and enjoy. In its softer and more traditional moments,  <i> Love's Recurring Dream </i> sounds a great deal like Rufus Wainwright if he spent more time paying tribute to Leonard Cohen than Judy Garland. Taylor has always shared a good deal of Wainwright's declamatory, slightly nasal vocal style and his tendency towards lyrical and performative overreach, but the more subdued, soft-focus arrangements sharpen the echoes of Cohen's patient craft. This is undoubtedly a smarter set of stylistic coordinates for the duo, but it's also a safer one: more agreeable, but less idiosyncratic, and correspondingly less demanding of obsession or even a great deal of repeat-listening.</p>
<p>Still, when the album tries to summon up a mirage of the band's former, electronically charged sound, the results are very good indeed. ""Do You Know What It Is Yet?"" is charming pastoral-schaffel reminiscent of Borneo &amp; Sporenburg's ""Boys in Shorts"". ""These Days Are Ours"" is breathlessly excited, buoyed by airy xylophone runs and a perky rhythm hidden away under a mountain since the late 1980s. The urgent throb of ""Standstill"" evokes the wide-eyed, widescreen majesty of Simple Minds at their pre-crossover peak. The iridescent echoes of ""Tired of Summer"" discover an uncharted middle-ground between Bark Psychosis and Basic Channel.</p>
<p>These occasionally magical moments always come as a surprise, as it's hard to accept that the duo could wrest such startling sounds from such familiar tools. If  <i> Love's Recurring Dream </i> proves anything, it's that Coloma were never about technology, but rather a sense of otherworldliness, however it might be acheived. Once, they offered a vision of the past as it might appear to people in the future; here, the duo's music sounds like our own past as it might appear in a dream. Like a dream, it retreats quickly into forgetfulness once you emerge from it, but moments of transfixing eeriness linger like a hazy memory of a memory.</p></div>"|12788.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12788-loves-recurring-dream/|7.0|Tim Finney

A judge didn't consider this work to be ""community service""-- Gucci was on probation for assaulting a man with a pool cue, a detail memorably documented in 2007's ""I Move Chickens""-- so it was off to the Fulton County jail for 2008's most important mixtape rapper. Once news of Gucci's impending incarceration hit the wire, protégé OJ Da Juiceman's promotions game kicked into high gear; a guest verse on a Project Pat single, successive mixtapes with cartoonish artwork riffing off his nom de plume, and a video single for tense earworm ""I'm Gettin' Money"". And now 2009 dawns with a debut release, a compilation of already-released material with few new tracks, an enjoyable but ultimately confusing consolation prize.</p>
<p>It's true that OJ's personality seems slight when compared to Gucci's manic creativity, humor, and range-- compared to Gucci's palette of adlib effects, even OJ's distinctive ""AYE! AYE! AYE!"" can feel one-note. But he does share Gucci's ability to ingratiate himself to the listener. Lyrically, he slots in as a rougher-edges version of Young Dro, sharing his impressionistic embrace of trapper status as signified by colored jewelry, seafood, white boy tags, and his own ""fruity-crazy-stupid-swag."" Unlike Dro, Da Juiceman's raps have a halting quality, and his strained-voice approach feels undistinguished next to Gucci's stuffed-nose ignorant flow. Although OJ's vocals are far from sonorous, trapped in one tone-deaf timbre, that limited range becomes its own aesthetic. The effect is unsettling; when relaxed, his nonchalant calm suggests he hides a murderous instinct; over up-tempo tracks his vocals have a frenzied yelp. But this isn't like Freeway's emotive enthusiasm; for OJ it is a stylistic affect, unconcerned with sincerity, purely conveying visceral style. He embraces the tension between exuberance and nonchalance, as if he's constantly restraining the volume of his voice.</p>
<p>The previously unreleased material, what little there is, is promising. ""Batman"" is a breakneck-tempo trapper's version of T.I.'s ""Whatever You Like"" with sizzling synths from beatmaker Fatboi and a classic rapid-fire chorus. It should put doubts about OJ's rapping abilities to rest; fast raps give his shambolic flow a stilted grace. The beats, provided primarily by Gucci's usual crew, including Zaytoven, DJ Speedy, and Fatboi, embrace a crafted ""cheapness""; listen to the horns on DJ Speedy's ""Good Night"", which harmonically aim for uplift, intentionally undercut by the raw rapping and the ""cheap"" synthesized horns, like a southern version of the Lox's ""Wild Out"". Everything is high on treble and heavy on keyboards, absent ""soulful"" signifiers and midrange, with heavy trunk-rattling bass thump.</p>
<p>That said, purely on a conceptual level, this record feels unnecessary; much of it had been previously released on mixtapes, and it's not a particularly comprehensive document of those. The unofficial word has been that this is the ""album-before-the-album,"" a chance for his label to test whether OJ's buzz can translate into sales. While it is nice to have these tracks without DJ drops, it's hard to imagine major-label records doing all that much artistically for street rappers these days anyway. Lil Wayne's records were more fun before  <i> Tha Carter III </i> dropped. Check OJ's  <i> Culinary Art School </i> mixtape now, catch Da Juiceman chopping it up on Rachael Ray's show later.</p></div>"|12755.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12755-the-otha-side-of-the-trap/|7.0|David Drake

And I suppose it was; chances are, if you know Handsomer Fur Dan Boeckner, you know him as co-marshal of Wolf Parade. More than that, though, <i>Plague Park</i> was far too long on mood and entirely too spare with the nervy buildups and outsized choruses Boeckner's provided to his parent band's records. What <i>Plague</i> lacked in focus it made up in atmosphere and the odd killer hook, but it was an oddly dispassionate album for a couple of young lovers, and it did little more than make one wish Wolf Parade would get on with it already.</p>
<p>In the couple of years since <i>Plague Park</i>, Wolf Parade issued the intriguing but ultimately underwhelming <i>At Mount Zoomer </i>and Boeckner got himself properly hitched to Alexei Perry, also his partner in Handsome Furs. The two found a little time in between merging their checking accounts and posing for increasingly salacious press photos to craft <i>Face Control</i>, and boy, the sound committed now. On every conceivable level down to the cover art, <i>Face Control</i> bests its predecessor, adding stuttering nuance to their previously too-spare sound, which they drape over some of the finest songs Boeckner's ever written.</p>
<p>The Furs' greatest songwriting strength is their ability to imbue a select line or two with a terrific amount of meaning; even when said line could easily turn cliché in less able hands. Boeckner's proven this time and again with Wolf Parade-- ""This Heart's on Fire"" ain't exactly a new thought, but a helluva chorus-- and it's a skill the Furs used all too sparingly on <i>Plague Park</i>. ""All We Want, Baby, Is Everything"" isn't just the title of <i>Face Control</i>'s best song; it's the text of the entire hook, and, really, it doesn't mean a whole hell of a lot just sitting there on the page. To hear Boeckner sing it, though-- especially over the effortlessly exultant chiming provided by he and Perry-- you'd swear you knew just what he was on about. <br/><br/>Lyrical inscrutability peppered with the occasional waft of clarity has always been a Boeckner trademark, and <i>Face Control </i>continues that. Disaffection, if not necessarily rage, seems to be directed at the machine this time but Boeckner's well-hewn vocal affectations and the album's sleek, spare veneer lend its lines a palpable sense of dread. There are a few tunes that reference Russia in one way or another, which, coupled with the album's oft-synthetic Glasnost-era sonics, at times suggest a particularly Cold War-borne paranoia, but it's not quite so clear as that; Boeckner and Perry keep their words open enough to invite interpretation without resorting to either nonsense or platitudes, and these easily applicable feelings of dread seem like a good fit for these strange times we find ourselves in.<br/><br/>Fittingly, <i>Face Control</i> is just more than a little addled, due in no small part to the inspired synth work of Ms. Perry and an increased focus on the eerie snap of their drum machine. Where keyboards would float by on <i>Plague Park</i>, they splatter and stain on <i>Face Control</i>, finding the sweet spot between the clattering underpinning and Boeckner's sturdy, sometimes searing guitar. Though they pepper the mix with a lot more stuff this time around, there's a spare, dubby quality to most of the record that smacks of fellow minimalists Spoon. All the more appropriate a setting for allowing Boeckner's impressionistic verses and revelatory choruses to rattle around in your head, I'd say.<br/><br/>Sure, not every song hits quite as hard as the New Order-referencing ""All We Want"" or the terrific closing twofer ""Thy Will Be Done"" and ""Radio Kaliningrad"", and ""Nyet Spasiba"" shares a bit too much with ""All We Want"" to be sequenced quite so close together on the disc. Small quibbles, though. What's clear is that Boeckner and Perry ought not break that embrace they're so often captured in; they're clearly a match made in weirdo heaven, and we're nearly as lucky to have them making strange, sumptuous records like <i>Face Control</i> as they appear to be to have each other.</p></div>"|12827.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12827-face-control/|8.0|Paul Thompson

Perhaps three discs released almost concurrently is a bit much but the Cure's discography is deep, complex, and, most importantly, erratic enough to give  <i> Just Like Heaven </i> and  <i> Perfect As Cats </i> a chance. You could pay tribute to just how much ground the group has covered from their spiky, spooky post-punk origins to their current status as revered figureheads of nearly all forms of alternative rock, or you could stick to a single style that emphasizes the strength of the songwriting. The participants could show their devotion by digging through the vaults for lost treasures or they could try to find a new angle in their more popular canon.  <br/> <br/> But  <i> Just Like Heaven </i> chooses the latter for both and does nobody any favors, especially the listener. It's jammed with enough Nick and Norah-styled bands to make  <i> Dark Was the Night </i> come off like the  <i> Judgment Night OST</i>-- you know the drill: cutesy band name, mussy, bored-sounding guy, mousy, bored-sounding girl, lots of childish synths, and the burden of waking up every day knowing damn well ""Young Folks"" will totally pwn anything they ever come up with. And of course, they're going to pick the sort of songs that the Cure just kept on the right side of embarrassing, the kind that you might have viewed as gospel in your hormonally challenging teen years that their cloying, lustless approach will completely ruin for you. In other words, don't expect ""Shake Dog Shake"" or ""One Hundred Years"" here.  <br/> <br/> At least you're tuned in to how bad things are going to be from the first second. How much does Robert Smith convey in just the first line of ""Just Like Heaven""? But Joy Zipper can't be bothered: Instead of evoking the desperation and dire, wrist-slashing romance of the original, they conjure the self-satisfied smugness of every couple you hate in an insultingly flat and tuneless performance. Tanya Donelly and Dylan in the Movies' (teasingly, ""Tanya Donelly and Dylan..."" on your iPod) mismatched voices prepare ""The Lovecats"" for a cross-species CGI love story yet to be made. While Robert Smith has claimed that ""Friday, I'm In Love"" is a Cure song for people who don't usually like the Cure, there's an undeniable uplift in the chorus lauding the possibilities that the weekend can bring to even the most harried of us. The way it's handled by Dean &amp; Britta, you'd think it was called, ""Friday, So What Do You Want to Do Tonight? I Dunno, What Do You Wanna Do?""  And did you know that there was a shitty mall-punk song dying to get out of ""In Between Days""? If so, then you'll hear what Kitty Karlyle heard when they left the studio.  <br/> <br/> How hard could this be? Take an emo sensibility, slow down some Cure songs and add a layer of updated studio trickery and boom, you have the coordinates for Jimmy Eat World's increasingly prophetic  <i> Clarity</i>. But Luff and the Submarines pick the wrong tunes for the job-- though both classics, ""Jumping Someone Else's Train"" and ""Boys Don't Cry"" are more powered by the vigor of their streamlined arrangements than the depth of the lyircs. Here, they're lugged at a slowcore pace and are exposed as sonambulent bitch sessions. At the very least, ""The Walk"" is done justice by the Rosebuds-- not surprising since that very song pretty much invented their  <i> Night of the Furies</i>-- and Elk City turns ""Close to Me"" inside out to a sprawling, percussive clatter. (Though it still falls short of Kaki King's understated virtuosity on the  <i> Perfect as Cats </i> version.) And unlike  <i> Perfect as Cats</i>, this isn't even for charity.  <br/> <br/> It's not every day where a 2xLP tribute is a favorable alternative to anything, but  <i> Perfect as Cats </i> immediately trumps  <i> Just Like Heaven </i> with generally more inspired song selections and a greater level of talent...or at the very least, more recognizable talent, though it doesn't stop relative headliners the Dandy Warhols from making a typically bored walk-through of ""Primary"".  <br/> <br/> Xu Xu Fang take ""Fascination Street"" on a trip through Massive Attack's  <i> Mezzanine</i>, with static crackle, flutes, and a portentous tom beat inverting the sentiment from wide-eyed wonder to heavy-lidded menace. Credit Bat For Lashes for skillfully retaining the grayscale psychedlia of ""A Forest"" without turning it into trip-hop. But the people who put together <i>Perfect as Cats</i> seem to be acknowledging the ridiculously remote possibility that anyone could want to listen to this 33-song platter end-to-end and ignore anything that could pass for smart sequencing or pacing. Witness putting two versions of ""The Walk"" back-to-back, the first in which Indian Jewelry takes it under the Knife with clamorous steel drums and general awfulness. The next is Geneva Jacuzzi's near perfect facsimile, right down to the lead synth tone.  <br/> <br/> Strangely, it suggests the trajectory for the rest of the affair, where the more satisfying numbers are either straight covers or complete about-faces. The Muslims (now the Soft Pack) wisely resist ""Killing an Arab"" and instead apply their no-bullshit garage rock to ""Grinding Halt"", while ""In Between Days"" is stripped down to a  <i> Three Imaginary Boys </i> chassis by Blackblack. On the other side, Jesu stretch out ""The Funeral Party"" to post-rock infinity, Joker's Daughter does the inevitable J-Pop twist on ""Kyoto Song"" and ""Hot, Hot, Hot"" is given a salacious en francais treatment by Les Bicylettes Blanches.  <br/> <br/> But even after all of that, it must be stressed that the vast majority just proves how many bands you've never heard of can pull off perfectly good imitations of Robert Smith (Rainbow Arabia, Wolfkin, Buddy, the Corridor and Ex Reverie, stand up and be counted!) and yet somehow still miss the point that these things should at least try to be entertaining. I'd hate to suggest that fame is correlative to great music, but in this realm, maybe that's the case. You want to hear a familiar act taken out of their comfort zone or a song doing the same. Here, it's just Amateur Hour three times over proving that the Cure were better than anyone at doing what they do.

<p>Post-rock is stuffed with overrated albums, so it's extra-exciting to find an underrated one, like Jaga Jazzist's  <i> What We Must </i> . Its flirtation with smooth jazz is the probable sticking point. Fey reed instruments are laden with uncool associations-- it's all good to graft some severe classical strings to your rock music, but heads turn when you start fucking with Kenny G. Even their name downplays the fact that they're a rock band (understandably-- ""Jaga Rockist"" is problematic). It's too bad, because  <i> What We Must </i> brims with indelible melodies set in muscular rhythms: the lively, interlocking motifs so much post-rock forsakes for morose blears.</p>
<p>If Jaga Jazzist excels at weaving together striking set pieces,  <i> Kaleidoscopic </i> insinuates that Lars Horntveth is the band's driving force. In this 37-minute composition, his sprightly themes seem like glass cases in a museum, both self-contained and part of a greater narrative. At the beginning of the piece, Horntveth returns to a cunning device used on Jaga songs like ""All I Know is Tonight"": By setting an eerie lead melody against a quiet shimmer, he makes it contort gracefully in an isolated field. Then come the piles of gushy strings (the orchestra contains 34 string players), the glinting harps, the sly pizzicato sub-rhythms, the unfurling brass, and coiled woodwinds. On the whole, it suggests Prokofiev's  <i> Peter and the Wolf </i> minus the Boris Karloff narration: jaunty, temperate, and willfully naïve. It improves upon Horntveth's solo debut,  <i> Pooka</i>, by desegregating his instrumentals, making them talk to each other.</p>
<p><i> Kaleidoscopic </i> occupies the ambiguous region between classical and pop/indie-- the same one occupied by Horntveth's stated influences, including Joanna Newsom, Robert Wyatt, Stereolab, and Jean-Claude Vannier. On one hand, it was recorded in a small church in Riga with 41 members of the Latvian National Orchestra (Horntveth himself plays piano, clarinet, and horns) and conducted by Terje Mikkelsen of the St. Petersburg Philharmonic and the Moscow Radio Orchestra. On the other, it isn't grounded in any cultural meta-narrative or musicological doctrine. Instead, it takes up that indie-est of subjects: his emotions. Horntveth has said that  <i> Kaleidoscopic </i> sought to document his evolving state of mind, which sounds like a fancy way of saying that he wrote whatever he felt like writing and then knitted it together. In the same year when Arvo Pärt addresses himself to the book of John (on his new release,  <i> In Principio</i>), Horntveth takes up the book of Lars. The self is the new culture.</p>
<p>This explains the album's roundabout, intuitive progression, and gives one the impression that Horntveth is a pretty sanguine guy. Only the mildly menacing piano of the middle section disturbs the beatific mood, which is rather refreshing at a time when menace's currency seems drastically inflated. For the most part, the album wavers between pensive happiness and outright ecstasy-- a tingly shine constantly attends it, like the air just above a glass of something highly carbonated. If this makes  <i> Kaleidoscopic </i> sound a bit lightweight, that's because it is-- a charming, unapologetically frothy bagatelle, more concerned with spontaneous inspiration than formal rigor. But I had the pleasure of seeing its premiere performance  <i> </i> at Oslo's Øya Festival last summer and can attest that the skill of the players belies the lack of ambition Horntveth's vague thematic content might imply. In fact, this ambiguity-- this tinge of slackness and self-obsession-- might make it the consummate indie-symphony: navel-gazing, capricious, influence-heavy, and broadly accessible.</p></div>"|12762.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12762-kaleidoscopic/|7.7|Brian Howe

Lately, on  <i> Angst Is not a Weltanschauung!</i>, his seventh or fifth album-- not even his label can agree on the number-- he's been wandering a little beyond his remit. An older track of his, ""Phones and Machines"", a standout from 2006's  <i> The Humbucking Coil</i>, was a typical hunk of skittery digitalia, forthright in emotion and playfully oblique in composition.  <i> Angst </i> 's ""Phones, Machines and King Kong"" builds on this track, riveting above it Daniel Johnston's ""King Kong"", diminishing the haunting quality of Johnston's heartfelt song. It's an impossible task, to hold on to the deeply personal resonance that Johnston drew into his song, but although it falters on those terms, Fleischmann's ambitious mash-up does offer a number of neat surprises.  <br/> <br/> The other collaborations trade in transformation, too, with a little more success. Take ""24.12"", where Sweet William Van Ghost stars in a miniature Christmas romance manque that hinges, improbably, on borrowing ice from a neighbor. Sweeter than this desperate gesture is Fleischmann's carefully programmed percussion, and the husky quaver of Marilies Jagsch, which blanket the song with a wintry sparkle, and maybe a bit of saccharine. But the flinty-widow feminism at the heart of it, and a Christmasy falling-snow guitar figure in the background, catches you off-guard with its delightful moral and sonic complexity. Another Van Ghost piece, ""In Trains"", gives over more space to the earthy tremble of his voice, an instrument that shares its rusty, heartworn finish with John Cale and Lee Hazlewood.  <br/> <br/> All these tracks work because they leave behind IDM traditions, more or less. Others are more faithful. Though it may not merit the iffy label ""intelligent dance music,"" ""When Last We Met at a T&amp;TT Concert"" points toward the bubble and glisten and space of Richard D. James's ambient period, the amorphousness disciplined slightly into a pop structure. Compared to the rest, however, instrumentals like this are not the standouts here. The idiosyncratic duets and mash-up make that clear enough, but for once, even Fleischmann's own notoriously flawed singing outclasses his wordless pieces. In fact, on Angst, the two tracks graced with his vocals (the eulogies ""Even Your Glasses Miss Your Eyes"" and ""Still See You Smile"") are among his most potent, less for their arrangements than for their somberly biographical, yet still expectedly off-kilter, lyrics of grief and memory.  <br/> <br/> Refreshingly light on self-seriousness, as the title likely gave away,  <i> Angst </i> still manages to move. That upbeat exclamation, the kind of thing you imagine a Hegel professor yelling at his undergraduates, is dead right as a descriptor of Fleischmann's own musical bent. Since 2000's  <i> A Choir of Empty Beds</i>, he has commanded a broad emotional palette absent in the ominous monotony and thoughtlessly turgid textures of that whole generation of cookie-cutter Aphex Twin copycats. All the way up to this most recent release, recorded in the wake of a friend's death, Fleischmann's subtly uplifting tunes have never lost the through-line of melancholy that winds back to his Morr Music debut,  <i> Pop Loops for Breakfast</i>. Angst continues that upward curve of building complexity and nuance, owing no small debt to the chorus of new, colorful, delicate voices that, to take a phrase from his closing song, fill up Fleischmann's castles of memory.</p></div>"|12777.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12777-angst-is-not-a-weltanschauung/|6.9|Roque Strew

Obviously there was the track's queer bounce, the future-retro glam-rock rhythm partly inspired by Battles' interest in German ""schaffel"" techno, a sound pioneered by the Kompakt label, one of Koze's benefactors. But also: Go back and listen to Battles'  <i> Mirrored</i>. Then throw on  <i> Reincarnations</i>, this bulging new collection of Koze remixes. Rhythmically, they have next to nothing in common. Instead, they're two albums that delight in the goofy-unto-surreal things electronics can do to the human voice.  <br/> <br/> There's hardly a track on  <i> Reincarnations </i> that's not peppered with tweaked vocals. Koze is a devotee of the ancient art of the vocoder or its modern-day software plug-in equivalent. He loves to use gender-flipping filters to turn his singers into robot androgynes. And he's not above a David Seville-ian blast of pitch-shifting just for fun. Sometimes, as on the sublimely silly ""Minimal"" by Matias Aguayo, the vocal is outlandish enough that Koze can more or less stay out of its way. And other times, as on Matthew Dear's ""Elementary Lover"", Koze the remixer overstuffs the track's four minutes-- from arch, starched whiteboy funk to a Venusian stadium rock outro. If you're cringing slightly at the thought of yet  <i> another </i> techno remix album filled with identikit instrumentals, know that Koze's vocal play on  <i> Reincarnations </i> adds new facets to already interesting tracks and turns boring cuts beguiling.  <br/> <br/> And lest you think his cut-ups are all laughs, there's nothing comedic about Koze's take on the laid-back funk of Heiko Voss' ""Think About You"". Instead he stretches the ""I"" in the ""I think about you"" refrain into an angelic background hum that sets the whole track swooning. It's a subtle move that points up the other thing that makes  <i> Reincarnations </i> so listenable: Koze's craftsmanship, which is often put in the service of the kind of spaced-out, gentle loveliness that characterizes the ""Think About You"" remix. He may have a shameless a weakness for novelty shock tactics, but Koze's also a big softie with deft touch. The aforementioned ""Atlas"" remix is on the one hand truly perverse, stripping away that big, booming, instantly recognizable schaffel beat for fractured mid-tempo micro-rhythms. But its oddness becomes enchanting when the drums drop out entirely for a twinkling breakdown straight out of the late-1990s IDM school of music box melodies. Indeed, Koze's breakdowns alone elevate many of these tracks, even the ""already good"" ones: the water-torture pauses in Sascha Funke's ""Mango Cookie""; the rave-y bleeps colliding with smeary swells of strings on Malaria's ""Kaltes Klares Wasser (DJ Koze &amp; the Tease Remix)"".  <br/> <br/> <i> Reincarnations </i> isn't flawless. Koze's take on Lawrence's ""Rabbit Tube"", for instance, settles for the kind of passable but generic minimal techno that's so temple-clutchingly dull across an entire album. But the fact that the ""Rabbit Tube"" remix acts more as a palette cleanser here, slipped between Koze's sonically restless techno-pop (Wechsel Garland's ""Swim"", with its long, silty intro) and dancefloor experiments (the drunken jazz of Noze's ""Danse Avec Moi""), points out how effectively  <i> Reincarnations </i> is programmed, if nothing else. That ear for sequencing means Koze's fashioned that rarest of remix albums: the kind might play start to finish, and more than once.</p></div>"|12769.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12769-reincarnations-the-remix-chapter-2001-2009/|7.5|Jess Harvell

Oh, what the hell am I on about. <i>Fuckbook</i> is, despite outward appearances, the new record by Yo La Tengo. But the bait-and-switch goes a little deeper than pseudonym, itself a (pretty funny!) dozen-year-old joke from the booklet of the band's 1997 effort <i>I Can Hear the Heart Beating As One</i>. See, <i>Fuckbook</i> is a covers record, even more so than 1990's <i>Fakebook</i> (thus concludes the gag portion of our program).</p>
<p>Yo La Tengo touch on about a million things in their music with varying degrees of success; the Condo Fucks, however, only do the one: <i>Fuckbook</i> gathers 11 mostly garage-borne rockers from the likes of the Troggs, Slade, the Kinks, Richard Hell, and others and, from the sound of things, runs 'em all through a shredder. If you've heard a Yo La Tengo record, you've probably heard a Yo La Tengo cover, but rarely if ever like these; so often the band adds its fine-tuned tumble to whatever they interpret, and the results are often reverent and, with some notable exceptions, inessential. But even the least jagged edge of this <i>Fuckbook</i> might give you a papercut. The thing rips-- its closest sonic counterpart is the Stooges' <i>Fun House</i>. You ever think you'd see a sentence like that about a Yo La Tengo record?</p>
<p>This gnarly, live-in-a-room sound isn't unprecedented: You could easily cherrypick a dozen similarly scuzzy rockers from the past four or five Yo La Tengo records proper, albeit with a generally higher production standard. But <i>Fuckbook</i> is leaner than a typical Yo La Tengo record in every way: It halves its predecessor's length and triples its volume, resulting in the most cohesive thing they've released since <i>Painful</i>. But while a singularity of purpose hasn't always worked out for Yo La-- see the sleepy <i>The Sounds of the Sounds of Science</i> or the haphazard live-on-air covers set <i>Yo La Tengo Is Murdering the Classics</i>-- <i>Fuckbook</i>'s lazer focus makes it  the most immediately enjoyable, endlessly replayable entry in their catalog in some time.</p>
<p>Though not all radio hits, these tunes are clearly familiar favorites to the band-- and, since no Yo La Tengo review would be complete without mentioning Ira's tenure as a rock critic, here's that part; to that end, the song selection's pretty impeccable, too. A false start marks the beginning of their opening take on the Small Faces' ""Whatcha Gonna Do About It"", and from there it's on; for the next 30 minutes and change, drums pound, guitars spill every which way, and a few voices you might recognize bleat out a tune or two you know by heart. Though they gleefully slop up every song here, quite a few stay close to their source material in tempo and timbre. For most bands, playing it that close to the hip would earn them a mark in the bad column, but even on the most reverent cover here-- the Georgia-sung ""With a Girl Like You""-- they sound like they're having a blast, like something like this was just what they needed.</p>
<p>When they start to veer off the beaten path, <i>Fuckbook</i> really gets going. Their take on the Flamin' Groovies' ""Dog Meat"" actually manages to bring out the surfy central riff even further to the forefront, and James McNew's vocals throughout the disc-- and on their closing cover of Slade's ""Gudbuy T'Jane"" especially-- are a perfect fit with the material. Ira, a supremely underrated guitarist, gets his best showcase in forever here, and Georgia's as rock solid as ever behind the kit. She and Ira still aren't the most natural singers for this particular stripe of rock'n'roll, but their willingness to go for it adds a lot of <i>Fuckbook</i>'s appeal. And, frankly, because the whole thing's so out of character, a lot of the charm of these somewhat unlikely lo-fi heroes-- who, even with Times New Viking, Fucked Up, and Sonic Youth as labelmates might be the single skronkiest band current signed to Matador-- lies in the fact that they just up and did this thing without provocation, and it worked. Sure, it's a covers record and a fairly unambitious one at that, unless ""being confusing"" and ""being loud"" are ambitions. And maybe for Yo La Tengo, they oughta be; as much as I'm looking forward to the next one from Ira, Georgia, and James proper, it's gonna have to work awfully hard to match the effortless blast that is <i>Fuckbook</i>.</p></div>"|12819.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12819-fuckbook/|8.3|Paul Thompson

At the time, Montreal's music scene was holding Stateside listeners in thrall, with legions of talented and energetic multi-instrumentalists crafting classically trained bombast. Bell Orchestre's more abstract <i>Recording a Tape</i>, an entirely instrumental work, received a deservedly high profile but was perhaps unjustly viewed through the same lens.</p>
<p>That's because the Orchestre essentially exists as a nexus, a connector of things. They're baroque pop without the pop, post-rock without (most of) the rock. The works on <i>As Seen Through Windows</i> might be called ""neo-classical,"" except to a classical listener they sound cacophonous: Opener ""Stripes"" is an orchestral take on Neu!, or maybe just an orchestral warm-up set to an insistent motorik beat. But for the group's proud no-synths policy, the brass lead could just as easily have been conceived as a Minimoog from the progressive 1970s.</p>
<p>The analog sound comes in part from producer John McEntire. Under the Tortoise leader's helm, the Orchestre seems to have nudged a bit over into jazzy vibraphone ambiance. The rhythmic complexity and duration of songs has increased, but even the tracks ranging north of eight minutes flow with the easily parsed dynamics of three-minute works. The ""Arcade Fire thing"" is still relevant (violinist Sarah Neufeld and redheaded Napoleon Dynamite doppelganger Richard Parry are full-time BO members)-- the group engages in the same happy onslaughts as their better known contemporaries. Yet whereas Arcade Fire engage the listener in personal and political appeals, Bell Orchestre offer impressionistic narratives of the world around them.</p>
<p>For example, ""Elephants"" actually features brass recalling a pachyderm call, accompanied by string screeches sounding like wayward seabirds. In lieu of actual vocals, lyricism is derived from the character of a French horn, the tenor of a violin's hurried bow, the Dave Fridmann-esque drum stampede. The work evokes a scene rather than a style, asking the listener to reconstruct veldt and seaside imagery in the context of (at least loosely) a rock song.</p>
<p>Granted, some of this may seem similar to the overly conceptual work of post-rock forebears like McEntire's Tortoise. It might seem pedantic, but the over-referenced Arcade Fire thing is actually the best rebuttal. Orchestre, like many dedicated post-rock artists, are themselves critics, triangulating the state of rock music by abstractly recasting it according to their own training. But they're also editors, often juxtaposing subtle hints of their own influences with energy, subtlety, and originality.</p>
<p>Take the record's closer: ""Air Lines/Land Lines"" breathes a folksy, almost antebellum charm before engaging a hymnic and jazzy crescendo, then closing by mediating on its original theme. It crystallizes Bell Orchestre as a group whose talented players voraciously consume the world around it and re-channel its varied histories into the works. <i>Windows</i> extends the filmic dynamism and orchestral spark that carried <i>Recording a Tape</i>, but instead of remaining in the background, the narrative-- impressionistic and imperfect-- comes to a often-unpredictable present.</p></div>"|12820.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12820-as-seen-through-windows/|7.5|Mike Orme

That's not an altogether uncommon occurrence, but it usually doesn't happen with stuff I downloaded for free online. Free downloadable rap usually means mixtapes with shitty sound-quality and obligatory obnoxious yelled DJ ad-libs. It doesn't usually mean lush, full-bodied Southern slow-creep stuff, well-recorded music that gives itself some room to breathe. That  <i> The B.C. Era </i> sounds so good speaks to Bobby Creekwater's situation. He's one of the token Southern rappers on Shady/Aftermath, which, thanks to the almighty Dre/Eminem/50 triumvirate, is maybe the single most successful rap label ever. But these days, Dre and Eminem can't get it together to release their own albums, let alone those of their talented underlings. And so Bobby Creekwater remains in some moneyed limbo: not starving, not anxious, but not able to get his stuff heard unless he releases it directly to the internet. Which he did.  <i> <br/> <br/> The B.C. Era </i> only barely qualifies as an EP; at nine songs and 30 minutes, it's practically as long as  <i> Illmatic</i>. That's long enough that it gives us a strong idea of Creekwater's aesthetic sense and short enough that it doesn't outstay its welcome. The production comes either from Creekwater himself or from unknown associates like D. Focis. That's a red flag, but this thing sounds great. The beats are so expansive and intricate that at times they almost become oppressive. Organs blare, horns bleat, drums explode. But it's never intense; all of this music unfolds at a lazy crawl, sunny and elegiac at the same time. This is car music, not club music, and we rarely hear this sort of warm thump anymore. It's Southern rap in the organic, bluesy mid-90s Dungeon Family/8Ball &amp; MJG tradition, not the Casio bloops that dominate the market now. And the one exception, the skeletal bass-heavy knock of ""When I Go"", recalls an even older age without simply recreating it.  <br/> <br/> Most rappers would try to yell over beats this grandly all-consuming just to be heard, but that's not Bobby's style. His rapping voice is slow and deliberate but also expressive and melodic, somewhere on the continuum between Young Bleed's flat mutter and T.I.'s melodic twang. And so he inhabits these tracks, sinking into them rather than popping off them. Even his boasts are smaller-than-life, conversational everydude shit-talk rather than transcendent ghetto-superhero noise: ""I see you niggas on that rap rap rap/ Shit, you need to be filling out a app app app."" When he talks about his money, it's on a small, approachable level: ""I'm not the early bird but I'm fashionably late, mayne/ Convertibles made me hate rain."" If he was talking about his Learjet, I'd call bullshit, but yeah, I can believe he could afford a convertible.  <br/> <br/> Creekwater never mentions Eminem or Dr. Dre by name, but his situation does come up incidentally a couple of times. ""Shady Records, name a label we ain't outsold,"" he says, which is cute but sort of sad, since Bobby Creekwater himself has sold basically no records. And even if his label boss wasn't off in a Vicodin stupor somewhere, Creekwater would have a tough time being heard. These are lean times for intimate, small-stakes rap like this, and it's a shame that he had to dump all this onto the internet for free. But be glad he did. He didn't have to or anything.</p></div>"|12733.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12733-the-bc-era/|7.7|Tom Breihan

Then again, when you're a moderately successful but still mostly under the radar Swedish rock act with fondness for bands that made excess a big part of their art, perhaps it's more of a mystery why you don't release double-albums more often. Indeed, the well of maximum R&amp;B from which the Soundtrack of Our Lives draw will never run dry. And that doesn't even take into account all the things the group can do to its 1960s psych and classic rock influences by filtering them through the subsequent forty-plus years of musical progress (not that the band has ever tried terribly hard to bring its rocking retreads ""up to date"").</p>
<p>Yet a double album today is a much more demanding proposition than it was in the time of Quadrophenia. The two discs of  <i> Communion </i> , the Soundtrack of Our Lives' fifth full-length (with the emphasis on ""full""), runs a total of a whopping hour and a half. To put that in classic rock perspective, that's about ten minutes longer than the aforementioned epic by the Who, which both had the advantage of a) a plot; and b) the band's already substantial iconic legacy.  <i> </i></p>
<p><i> Communion </i> may not have a plot but it may, however loosely, have a concept, either one song for every hour of the day, or maybe even that old standby, a meditation on ""the state of the world."" Regardless, meaning isn't nearly as important here as execution, and to that end the band has easily come up with its best set of songs since its sort-of 2001 breakthrough Behind the Music. If not every track on the set is a winner, neither are there any outright stinkers. And then there's the added bonus that rarely does the album sound nearly as belabored as, say, Oasis, a band with which TSOOL's shares a certain dubiously defiant rockist mentality.</p>
<p>Unlike the oppressively self-conscious Oasis, however, there's a real joy driving the Soundtrack to Our Lives. And the result is an album that embraces both the bluster and the grandeur of past high-watermarks of portent with a refreshing lack of both irony and cynicism. It's this vital distinction that helps songs such as ""Babel On"", ""Ra 88"", ""Mensa's Marauders"", or the Faces-y ""Thrill Me"" kick into gear, or the band's unexpected remake Nick Drake's ""Fly"" take off in the mold of early Who (much as the Byrds similarly adopted so many Dylan songs as their own).</p>
<p>And that's just the first half. The slightly gentler second disc brings about a sigh of relief when the opener ""Everything Beautiful Must Die"" begins to solidify to suspicion that, hey, maybe the band will actually pull this thing off. It's a feeling ratified by songs such as ""Flipside"", the pretty instrumental ""Digitarian Riverbank"" and equally lovely ""Lifeline"", the stomp (but not obnoxious swagger) of ""Reconnecting the Dots"", and the Eastern-tinged ""Utopia"".</p>
<p>After all those songs and all that time, a lesser band might have finally given in to the urge and ended the album on the most over-the-top climax possible. But  <i> Communion </i> ends instead with the pleasingly restrained conclusion ""The Passover"", by which time the Soundtrack of Our Lives have pulled off the rarest of victories: bombast minus the abuse.</p></div>"|12736.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12736-communion/|6.2|Joshua Klein

One is represented by the Jewelled Antler collective, the San Francisco wing of the operation. The other surrounds Vermont's Matthew Valentine, who rose to a kind of prominence as Tower Recordings, and more recently plays as MV &amp; EE with his partner Erika Elder.   <br/> <br/> Of course, there is plenty more to this freewheeling, loosely defined scene. And, at his best, Valentine embodies everything that marked freak folk as a promising path for American musicians looking to place a woodsy focus on acoustic sounds, whether Western banjos or Eastern tablas. The new record breaks rank.  <i> Drone Trailer </i> arrives-- after numerous CD-Rs and tapes of cross-cultural, relentlessly unconventional music to stargaze by-- bearing principally unthreatening, old-fashioned rock'n'roll.  <br/> <br/> A curveball of cosmic proportions, ""Anyway"" opens the record, muscling through with fuzzy, hard-rock riffs. The cataract of distortion overpowers Erika Elder's singing, leaving audible only the enigmatic question, ""Hey spaceman, hey spaceman/ Whatever happened to the master plan?"" Valentine repeats, ""Anyway I can"" from across the room, a gentle faraway presence that sounds spectral and disembodied.</p>
<p>Turning around completely, ""The Hungry Stones"" finds Valentine channeling Neil Young circa  <i> Sugar Mountain</i>. A surprising juxtaposition of close-up harmonica and distant distortions amplifies the melancholic singing and nostalgic-stoner lyrics. The sleepy vocals and daydream guitars on the 10-minute ""Weatherhead Hollow"" and ""Huna Cosm"" verge on slowcore, a sort of bucolic Low. The title track suggests a Deep South-meets-the-Subcontinent fantasia, in the soupy swirling together of Doc Dunn's curving pedal steel, Valentine's bantar, and Elder's anesthetized, steel-magnolia delivery. A fitting summation of a batshit philosophy that, on  <i> Drone Trailer, </i> goes down easier as straight-ahead rock.</p></div>"|12737.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12737-drone-trailer/|5.8|Roque Strew

During those 14 perfect minutes, it's just her voice and finger-picked acoustic guitar, augmented cautiously by piano, organ, and ripples of electronics. Surrounded by little else but her own melancholy, Nadler sums up her career's existential despair: ""Ghosts and lovers/ They will haunt you for a while,"" she sings. And while they do, <i>Little Hells</i> suggests through 10 of Nadler's best songs yet, the sadness will either kill you or keep you going.<br/><br/>Nadler's earlier albums delivered this somberness almost exclusively through songs for acoustic guitar. On those records, her backing musicians seemed intent upon emphasizing the spectral, lost-love tendencies of her words, adding ominous cello shrieks, sinister electric leads, or raggedy lo-fi touches, which found her tagged from the start as a freak-folk artist. As late as her most recent album-- the exquisite breakthrough <i>Songs III: Bird on the Water</i>-- she did little to dispel that categorization, filling the record with archaic language and outsider accompaniment by New England experimentalists like multi-instrumentalist Greg Weeks and cellist Helena Espvall.<br/><br/>At last, <i>Little Hells</i> moves Nadler well beyond easy categories, thanks to a newfound clarity in her words, a compelling link between her songs, and production that sharpens her old strengths wheile brightly exposing new ones. Sonically, her reach is wider and more assured. On ""Mary Come Alive"", circular drumming, gauzed vocals, and synthetic harmonium suggest the unlikely union of Cocteau Twins and Swans. Meanwhile, ""Loner"" stacks organ sustains and submerges them beneath Nadler's strum and half-hummed coo. It's like Grouper coming back down the Hill or Valet emerging from the Acid, but more memorable and accessible than both.<br/><br/>But the LP's highlight is still the four-song core that recalls vintage Nadler-- now played, captured, edited, and arranged better than in the past. Her only solo turn here, ""Brittle, Crushed &amp; Torn"", is crisp and concise, the presentation revealing the strength of the melodies in her bass-heavy picking and the wispy vocals above. ""The Whole Is Wide"" uses only that voice and Dave Scher's staccato piano march; the simplicity helps the album's most lyrically complex song translate off the page as Nadler intertwines the stories of two women, Sylvia and Laila, who waste their life away in the absence of a man. Nadler swaps first- and third-person pronouns and twists verb tenses, building tension by suggesting that they're both dead or at least headed that way. That time-and-person slipstream is what binds the 10 tracks of <i>Little Hells</i> so well. Nadler mixes images of individuals in various stages of love and loss, often pairing them with imagery of death, decay, and rebirth.<br/><br/>What Nadler's done on <i>Little Hells</i> suggests Antony and the Johnson's work on one of the year's other accomplishments, <i>The Crying Light</i>. Hegarty too alternated between thoughts of giving up, getting out, or fighting back. To do that, he eschewed the guests of <i>I Am a Bird Now</i>, choosing to sing with himself through fascinating harmonies, vocal lines intersecting with one another in unexpected patterns. He also expanded his sound in unexpected directions while refining what he'd always done well-- luxuriously layered arrangements-- through subtlety and tension. Nadler does all of that on <i>Little Hells</i>, and-- like Antony-- she's transcended freak folk as a result.</p></div>"|12813.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12813-little-hells/|8.3|Grayson Currin

Since then she's had far more ups than downs, hooking up for collaborations with artists such as Black Cat Orchestra and Tara Jane O'Neil, releasing 2004's outstanding <i>C'mon Miracle</i>, and providing the soundtrack for the excellent political documentary <i>Young, Jewish, and Left</i>.</p>
<p>Fittingly for such a skilled lyricist, the title of Mirah's latest solo album, <i>(a)spera</i>, is a play on the Latin words ""asperak,"" which means ""adversity"" and ""a spera,"" which translates as ""hope."" And it's between the fine lines of this double entendre that the roots of this album begin to grow. It encompasses a range of ideas on a grand scale, as the listener wades through her candid musings on unrealized love, death, the nature of time, emotional suffering, and the shedding of material wants.</p>
<p>Mirah's songs have always thrived on modest instrumentation, which tend to belie the careful intricacy of their structures, and are often emphasized by one instrument in particular, such as the commanding drumbeats that gave <i>Advisory Committee</i>'s wonderful opening track ""Cold Cold Water"" such a fiercely memorable edge. <i>(a)spera</i> keeps the trick rolling, except that in the last few years Mirah has grown markedly as a songwriter and the emphasis is now mostly provided by expansive string orchestrations, bold bursts of horns, and deftly placed vocal harmonies that recall early Cat Power. It's been five years since her last studio release, but from the opening violin flourish of <i>(a)spera</i>'s startling opening track, ""Generosity""-- arguably one of the strongest songs she has ever written-- it is clear that Mirah's walking a different path, and whatever route she chose to get there proves to be well worth the wait.</p>
<p>Until now, Mirah's most appealing quality as a songwriter has been her immediate intimacy and sincerity, which manifests itself at the center of every song. While these characteristics are more present than ever on <i>(a)spera</i>, they have been taken to another level through the sheer diversity of her choice of instrumentation. She has completely avoided the trap of sounding too repetitive-- a curse of many solo singer-songwriters who have released a few albums-- and instead chooses to employ a different approach to every song. On the Phil Elverum-produced ""Shells"" she drafted the remarkable Mandinka harp player Kane Mathis to provide the soundtrack to her tale of a diver hunting for a dinner of mollusks for a land bound lover. Later, she moves into the intricate, bossa nova-inspired frenzy of ""Country of the Future"", sparse electric guitar interplay on ""Bones &amp; Skin"", and animated conga accents on ""Gone Are The Days"". Not only does each song have a vivid personality of its own, there just isn't a weak track on here-- a mighty feat indeed.</p>
<p><i>(a)spera</i> is the sound of a musician accomplishing the challenges she has set herself, both musically and communicatively. There's an interdependent exchange of significance between the music and lyrics, and their subtle yet compelling message ends up staying with you long after the stereo is switched off.</p></div>"|12809.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12809-aspera/|7.8|Mia Clarke

Rosenbaum's considerable personal collection (which spans a half-century, contains thousands of hours of tape, and is supplemented by Rosenbaum's own photographs, paintings, and drawings) demanded more than just four discs; Dust-to-Digital plotted a second volume in response.  <i> Vol. 2 </i> follows the same basic organizing principle as its predecessor: The four discs are arranged by theme (Survey, Religious, Accompanied Songs and Ballads, Unaccompanied Songs and Ballads), and are comprised exclusively of field recordings, provoked and captured in living rooms, churches, front porches, backyards, graveyards, and parlors across the Southeast, Midwest, and Canada.</p>
<p>Without discounting the participants' musicianship, the real pleasure of these boxes is in the peripheral noise, the clinks, rustles, guffaws, giggles, and snorts of ordinary life, the self-composed and self-delivered introductions, the soft-spoken folklorist nudging from the corner-- that's the true and precious miracle of field recording. We now know, for example, that there exists no more sublime a preface to ""Steamboat Bill"" than Iowan Jack Bean-- in his deep, gnarly, slightly-too-loud voice-- barking ""My name is Jack Bean, I live in Wapello, I'm 70 years old, and I'm a half-assed musician. Or was."" This is how folk music functions; this is what it means. It is as real as anything.</p>
<p>The scope of Rosenbaum's work makes it difficult to talk about these volumes in general terms; although this is all ""folk music,"" in the broadest, most earnest sense of the word (see Louis Armstrong: ""All music is folk music. I ain't never heard no horse sing a song""), it's also a gloriously diverse package of styles and eras. (Rosenbaum himself addresses the nomenclature issues in his sharp and graceful introductory essay.) Maybe what's most remarkable is how well  <i> Vol. 2 </i> actualizes the (shriveling?) notion of acoustic blues, folk, and gospel music as a malleable oral tradition (""The deep river of song,"" as Alan Lomax put it), destined for splicing and rearranging-- here, over and over, bits and pieces of traditional songs emerge and recede, providing both context and ornament. Even though charting the origins of these fragments is pretty much impossible (and entirely beside the point), it does make the controversy over samples and mash-ups feel heavily foreshadowed, if not kind of moot.</p>
<p>Although it's certainly worth consuming whole - give yourself a full, glorious Sunday on the couch-- there are a few unmissable highlights: Otha Cooper and Imogene Riggens' a cappella rendition of ""There's a Man Going Around Taking Names"" (recorded in Athens, Georgia in March 1981) is barely 90 seconds long, but the sadness and seriousness in their voices lingers for weeks, maybe longer. Rev. Willie Mae Eberhart and Sister Fleeta Mitchell (who also appear on  <i> Vol. 1 </i> , accompanied here by Eddie Ruth Pringle) offer up a prickly version of ""A Charge to Keep I Have"" (according to Rosenbaum's notes, the melody is moaned so the Devil can't hear it), while Mary Lomax, another star from  <i> Vol. 1 </i> , sings ""Billy Staffer"" with unparalleled aplomb-- ""The way my paw used to sing it,"" she explains. Helen McDuffie's ""Talking Blues"" is a textbook example of the kinds of talking blues that inspired Woody Guthrie and later Bob Dylan; Mabel Cawthorne's ""Going Up the Country (Some Kind of Blues)"" features some of the richest (if stubbornly imperfect) piano-playing around, and her vocals-- un-self-conscious, raw, squealing, cracked-- are genuinely riveting.</p>
<p>It doesn't require a crack sociologist to understand how America's oral traditions are changing (most of the performers Rosenbaum captures here are of advanced age, and come from relatively rural climes), but there's still something comforting about the notion of a song as a family heirloom (it can never be lost in a fire), and Rosenbaum's work will make you yearn for childhood lullabies, for-- precious as it sounds-- the songs that you keep in your heart.</p></div>"|12770.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12770-the-art-of-field-recording-vol-2/|8.6|Amanda Petrusich

It's a buoyant song that typifies the band's seamless blend of American rock music with benga, Kenya's ebullient and propulsive dance music, but like a lot of benga songs, it packs a serious message into the lilting, doubled vocals, sung mostly in Luo, with an English verse by Ian Eagleson. ""Next time, it could be you,"" Eagleson reminds English-speaking listeners; near the end, there's a cry of ""ok-oyot!"" amid some celebratory cheering, a reference to the title of their debut LP, and a phrase that roughly means ""It's not easy.""</p>
<p>And nothing has been easy for this band. For a moment, set aside the fact that half the members live on one continent and the other half live on a separate one, a challenge in itself, and consider their path to this point. Original member Otieno Jagwasi died of AIDS-related illness before the first album could be released, and his brother Onyango is now in the band, dueling with Eagleson's guitar. The other original Kenyan member, drummer Onyango Wuod Omari, sings lead on ""Ukimwi"" an impassioned plea to wipe out the disease that killed Otieno Jagwasi and holds much of eastern and southern Africa in a terrible thrall. Three years ago, the Kenyan members needed intervention from then-Senator Barack Obama to get visas to enter the U.S., and the threat posed by last year's violence is self-explanatory. So it's a small triumph that the band even still exists.</p>
<p>The music on  <i> Thank You Very Quickly </i> is a triumph of a different sort. Extra Golden have conquered whatever divide there once was between rock and benga to create a distinct sound of their own that respects both traditions. They've gained so much confidence in their sound that they've even begun to expand it beyond that collision. ""Fantasies of the Orient"" is a hard-grooving track laced with psychedelic organ and three-against-four rhythms that recall the pop music of Kenya's neighbor to the north, Ethiopia. Eagleson and Jagwasi trade lines throughout the song, dueting in two languages while their guitars carry the multi-lingual conversation into the music, pitting distortion against clean fluidity.</p>
<p>I'm grateful that Extra Golden have continued their partnership, not only because of the quality and uniqueness of the band's music, but also for the fact that the band is a powerful symbol for the good that can arise from an interconnected world. They're a community-building entity on multiple levels, from the way they inspired fans to reach out and help their families in a time of tremendous need, to the way they feed into notions of global community.  <i> Thank You Very Quickly </i> is an album for everyone from four guys who've discovered a way to make our world just a bit smaller.</p></div>"|12763.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12763-thank-you-very-quickly/|7.5|Joe Tangari

The excellently titled opening track, ""Toothless Beau"", sounds uncannily like an outtake from Deerhoof's  <i> Friend Opportunity</i>, bridging the same terrain between bracing chaos and cutesy charm that makes that band so entertaining. The similarities between the two groups are so apparent at first that it takes a few tracks before Hi Red Center's own quirky personality comes out to play, finally coaxed out of the shadows of its influences.  <br/> <br/> <i> Assemble </i> is more focused and crisp sounding than the band's 2005 debut,  <i> Architectural Failures</i>, and this type of production better suits their current material, providing space for all the intricate layers of sound to radiate through. The New York-based six piece have an extensive amount of ideas up their sleeves, the most obvious being their penchant for juxtaposing seemingly oppositional sounds and demonstrating how well they can work together. The two dominant tones on this album are fractured, dueling U.S. Maple-style guitar lines that rub against the delicate plinks of a vibraphone, such as on the song ""Littlest Giant"", which shows the band at their hyper-experimental best. Not an instrument to be underestimated, the vibraphone's prominent place on  <i> Assemble </i> is a light melodic springboard, always present for the other sounds to bounce off. Since vocalists Laura Barger and Marla Hansen joined the original core members in 2007, the band have also been able to experiment more fully with gang vocal rounds, and on tracks like ""Symmetry Chameleon"" this brings a sense of unity to the recording, tying the shards of guitar together with staggered, rich mini-choir interludes.  <br/> <br/> Although the sheer hyperactivity and stop-start nature of  <i> Assemble </i> can make it a somewhat uncomfortable listen at first, it is worth rising to the challenges Hi Red Center present. Their experimental noise rock is frequently defined by a deceptively disheveled structure that is in fact highly restrained, much like the SKiN GRAFT label's 1990s catalog. While it takes a bit of patience, this energetic, rhythmic approach combined with moments of unabashed, childish glee makes for some highly adventurous pop.</p></div>"|12764.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12764-assemble/|6.8|Mia Clarke

Fans waited until 2006 for <i>Happy Hollow</i>, which showed the quartet developing in leaps and bounds musically while earnestly exploring themes such as the conflict of religion in North American society and the depressing blandness of suburban life. It signaled an enterprising departure for the group, both lyrically and melodically, and seemed to open up abundant possibilities for their future development, as though Cursive could go in any number of directions. So it's a little disappointing that their latest full-length, <i>Mama, I'm Swollen</i>, rarely strays far beyond the most palpable and predictable emo-punk. It's a straight shot of melodramatic misery and despair from beginning to end.</p>
<p>During a tour in 2007, original drummer Clint Schnase left Cursive and was replaced by Cornbread Compton of Engine Down, whose fantastic beats really make their mark on <i>Mama, I'm Swollen</i>. Singer Tim Kasher, also of fellow Saddle Creek band the Good Life, has more than proved his mettle as a lyricist in the past. Here he turns his attention to an obsession with hell, the worthlessness of humanity, and the Peter Pan Syndrome of adults who want to ""live life duty free"" (""Cavemen"") or fuck away their fears (""From the Hips""). Kasher's words, like his vocal delivery, veer from whisper to anguished yowl. At times he is on top form, particularly on ""We're Going to Hell"" and ""Mama, I'm Satan"". But lines such as ""I'm at my best when I'm at my worst"" and ""Every record I've written has left me smitten/ It's a career in masturbation"" sound like they belong in a teenager's journal and feel somewhat pathetic coming from the mouth of a 34-year-old-- an opinion that Kasher is no doubt slamming throughout the record in his defense of social nonconformity. All the same, it's a bit humdrum in light of what he's capable of.</p>
<p>Musically, Cursive's range is subtler here compared to their previous albums, but there are some satisfying occasions when everything pulls together nicely. Shifting time signatures keep the more straightforward songs from getting dull, and there are plenty of thoughtful guitar hooks interlaced with brass sections, strings, and an intermittent flute. Unfortunately, it's the occasional appearance of these additional instruments that sparks the most excitement while listening to this record. The final song, ""What Have I Done"", a tale of a man holed up in an El Paso motel scratching lyrics on paper plates instead of writing a great novel, turns out to be the album's most memorable track. It impresses with its swell of electronic ambiance, growling bass, and triumphantly dejected chorus as Kasher keeps screaming ""What have I done, what have I done, what have I done!"" until he is out of breath.</p>
<p>Considering their devout following, Cursive fans are likely to be divided by <i>Mama, I'm Swollen</i>. There is of course a huge market for their kind of angst-ridden emo, and in many ways-- particularly lyrically-- this album sounds like it's been lifted straight from the emo handbook, which may well satisfy many listeners. For the less committed, however, the lack of the band's usual wit and musical inventiveness will be missed.</p></div>"|12818.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12818-mama-im-swollen/|5.2|Mia Clarke

It sounds giddy and spontaneous, though for all I know it could've been recorded the day after McCain claimed ""the fundamentals of our economy are strong"" and saved for November 5th. Coming from a rapper who made his name on social contemplation, righteous anger, and battle-rap vengeance, Ali's joy and (guarded) hopefulness in the humbling face of history resulted in a rare but revealing moment of optimism. Question is, how much of that's going to carry into his subsequent work?</p>
<p>Being a comparatively small collection of B-sides, outtakes, and new material, <i>The Truth Is Here</i> EP doesn't completely answer that question. Meant to tide fans over until the projected fall release of his follow-up to <i>The Undisputed Truth, The Truth Is Here </i>catches the lingering shockwaves of that 2007 album's fierce momentum, packages them under a title that invokes one of its more defining hooks, and somehow manages to work as an album without giving off that stale odds-and-sods feel. It wouldn't seem the least bit out of place as a pack-in with some theoretical future deluxe edition of <i>The Undisputed Truth</i>: there's a whole lot of beats by his regular producer Ant, who contributes some comfortingly familiar barfly lounge-jazz vibes in the woozy muted horns of ""Real as Can Be"" and the somnambulant last-call piano of the ironically-titled (or at least ironically-sequenced) closer ""Begin Here"", not to mention the usual brand of uptempo, heavy-bumping soul-derived anthems that's permeated Ali's last couple records (""Palm the Joker""; ""The Believers""). And when it comes to subject matter, <i>The Truth Is Here</i> hews pretty closely to its predecessor album's b-boy snapshot of political (and personal) turmoil at the conclusion of the Bush years.</p>
<p>And, let's face it, the beginning of the Obama years, too: With the continued expansion of settlements on Israel's West Bank this spring and February's shooting death of a 14-year-old Palestinian stone-thrower by an IDF soldier, Ali's ""Philistine David""-- originally part of the soundtrack to Jonathan Demme's 2007 documentary <i>Jimmy Carter Man From Plains</i>-- could've been recorded last month. It could turn out to be one of his most contentious tracks-- which is saying a lot for the man who recorded ""Uncle Sam Goddamn""-- but by stepping into the perspective of a teenage, Palestinian potential suicide bomber and depicting him as a sympathetic figure with understandable (if desperate) motives, he's articulately humanized a struggle in a way most artists have a difficult time doing. Closer to home, ""Little Rodney"" examines the psychological damage that comes with being incarcerated (""Boxed in, dropped in a hole and forgotten/ Frozen to the core of your soul feelin' rotten""), ""Good Lord"" is an introspective, gospel-tinged examination of his Muslim faith, and ""Palm the Joker"" teems with non-specific but interconnected diatribes about an overwhelming sense of urban despair: ""I see a poor victim's face/ Reflected on the pawn shop's glass pistol case/ The breath make it foggy and then it gets clear/ Now which metal here would fit best in the ear?""</p>
<p>These are subjects that aren't just going to trundle down to some Crawford ranch and disappear, so there's no reason to imagine Ali's firebrand politics are going to diminish any-- and if they inexplicably do, there's still his mic-controller pride at stake. Ali's battle-rap bonafides serve as a sort of flipside to his political facet; quite literally, in the case of ""Talkin' My Shit"", since it originally came out as the B-side to one of the limited-edition 12"" pressings of ""Uncle Sam Goddamn"". It's one of those classic Ali trash-talk cuts, mixing self-effacement with hard-assedness-- ""Labels turn me off, I ain't what they lookin' for/ I ain't got a six-pack, tattoo or a bullet hole/ But I'm muscle underneath all that, you get your peanut smacked/ I scrap like Butterbean on crack""-- but it comes across with a vibe of grateful, earned arrogance. There's more of it where that came from-- including the requisite Minneapolis summit with an enjoyably snotty Slug on ""The Believers""-- but it doesn't necessarily dominate. Then again, between the politics, the road anthems, the battle tracks, the gratitude tracks, and the love song (""Baby Don't Go""), no one aspect of Ali's personality really dominates. <i>The Truth Is Here</i> is all the stronger for it, and that can only be considered a good sign.</p></div>"|12808.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12808-the-truth-is-here/|7.4|Nate Patrin

<p>This is the story of François Luambo Makiadi, who was born to a Congolese breadbaker in 1938, built a guitar when he was seven, released his first single at 15 (after peers nicknamed him Franco), became one of the most popular bandleaders in his country's history (before Mobutu Sese Seko's dictatorship nicknamed him  <i> le </i> <i> Grand Maître</i>), fathered 18 kids, and burned a mark so indelible that state-run radio played his records for four days straight after he died in 1989.</p>
<p>More than a businessman, lyricist, and guitarist, Franco was a musically innovative bandleader: someone who worked over old traditions, someone who refocused trends through own vision, someone who built genres. In his compositions, Afro-Cuban  <i> rumba </i> that always sounded brittle and formulaic to me sounds pliant and flush with possibility. By slowing down a dance rhythm for ""Likambo Ya Nana"", he isn't just writing a slow dance, he's revealing and reengineering where accents in the music fall, he's changing its character and breathing patterns. Other recordings, like ""Kinsiona"", unfold in strange, protracted waltzes filled with the chatter of syncopated percussion-- styles that sound approachable but almost without precedent.</p>
<p>The difference isn't between good and bad music, because there's plenty of expertly played music that follows formula-- it's between the work of musical  <i> thinkers </i> and of musical  <i> entertainers </i> . As far as I can tell, Franco was both.</p>
<p>Not that I hush and murmur over  <i> Francophonic-- </i> it's not always that poetic. Franco records are, primarily, music for the masses and their asses, even if his arrangements seem to give asses undue philosophical consideration. There's ""AZDA"", which I later found out was used as an ad for a Congolese Volkswagen dealership-- fortunate for them because it's exhaustingly catchy. There are children's choirs and snatches of conversation that remind me of hip-hop skits. He didn't just have a broad ear for great melodies; he had a mind to be sneaky with them, delaying the listener's gratification, stretching tunes out until they wind down somewhere you didn't expect them to.</p>
<p>Though I don't know Lingala, I understand, second-hand, that Franco wasn't bad with lyrics, either, punning about how great his band, OK Jazz, was; cataloging the evils lovers do (force-feeding each other feces, apparently); flashing dialects that upset the government; and singing about AIDS just as people started realizing what it was (but after, as most agree, he started dying from it).</p>
<p>OK Jazz were full of brilliant musicians and had a slew of vocalists, so Franco's presence can sometimes feel secondary. He sidestepped the center of attention to assume the subtler, more controlling role of directing where the audience's attention would focus. He occasionally sang, but the guitar was his true voice. On some songs-- first to memory is ""Tcha Tcha Tcha de mi Amor""-- his playing suddenly sputters over the arrangement as if to remind his band who the fucking boss is.  <i> Francophonic </i> , which spans two discs and the best years of his career, is an essential release, whether you know Franco's music or not, or even whether you know central African music or not. It does the important service of collecting his greatest music released stateside with stuff most of America has never heard.</p></div>"|12735.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12735-francophonic-vol-1-1953-1980/|8.8|Mike Powell

If you're part of Sinden's presumed audience-- young, multicultural, and stimulant-friendly, with omnivorous taste in hook-centric dance music-- you could easily fall in love with his Fabriclive mix.</p>
<p>Despite a few clunkers, mostly in an opening stretch of what can only be described as 21st-century hip-house, Sinden collects great cuts from around the world. Like Caper's ""Hybrid"", which pairs a grinding, circa-1997 speed garage bassline and a delicate synth-pad breakdown off a classic ambient jungle tune. An easy contrast between dark and dainty, but one that makes for a great dance record. Shiver inducing, even.  <i> Fabriclive 43 </i> is littered with similar small gems. And like all Fabric mixes, Sinden blends them quite adroitly, regardless of country of origin, tempo, or release date. But over the long haul, his top-tier DJ's skillfulness actually proves draining.</p>
<p>That's obviously a problem. The disc's momentum is pedal-to-the-floor throughout-- this a very club-centric, peak-time sound. There are few chances catch your breath, just one tightly-wound record slamming into another, and the lack of variation in Sinden's pacing quickly becomes as exhausting in your living room as it would live. Granted, this lack of variation isn't stylistically; Sinden's taste is laudably liberal on paper. But even if you're into furiously-paced dance mixes, you might still wish Sinden had slowed to ask, ""Should I really mix these records together?"" His inclusive aesthetic occasionally strips each subgenre of its idiosyncracies; dubstep really  <i> should </i> conjure a different mood than blistering pop-house, not that you'd know it from  <i> Fabriclive 43</i>.</p>
<p>Sinden's commitment to keeping the party flying at top speed, without sacrificing eclecticism, works best when he sticks to records that emulate the ginormous b-lines and clattering snares of turn-of-the-millennium London. (Roisin Murphy chopped up like an old-school UK garage diva? Count me in.) The digital wobble of the dubstep stretch is  <i> Fabriclive 43 </i> at its most gripping, for what it's worth, but Sinden still fixes on the most jittery examples of a notoriously torpor-centric sound. Even when he can stick to one mood, his agitator's instincts get the best of him.</p>
<p>Common sense says dance mix is obviously supposed to energize you, the listener/dancer. And Sinden's high-energy antics would obviously keep an adrenaline-charged dancefloor's momentum at a howling peak. But clubbers might stumble for the door after an hour or so, worn down by the relentless channel-surfing between bass-heavy blog favorites. Outside the club,  <i> Fabriclive 43 </i> could probably push you through that afterwork gym session or hardcore housecleaning you'd rather avoid. Slogging through it otherwise might be more work than it's worth.</p></div>"|12756.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12756-fabriclive-43/|6.0|Jess Harvell

The others barreled beyond the five, seven, eight, and 11-minute marks, respectively, all powered by the spiraling guitar solos of Dave Heumann. At  <i> Rites of Uncovering </i> 's best, Heumann sounded like indie rock's new guitar idol, unpredictably dodging strict meter, melody, and form. Like Jerry Garcia circa 1972, Heumann crested the rhythm section, pulling his outfit through thundering rock and scorching noise. The band was plenty good, you know, except the show belonged to  <i> this guy </i> .</p>
<p>But of the eight tracks on Arbouretum's third album,  <i> Song of the Pearl </i> , only one breaks the six-minute mark (and barely so). What's left of Heumann's guitar heroics have largely been folded into the songs-beneath or between the verses-or truncated so that they no longer comprise the album's apex.  <i> Song of the Pearl </i> feels more like the work of a seasoned rock band that's experimenting with textures like strings and piano while focusing the songs with conventional restraints. Thing is, before  <i> Song </i> , this quartet only recorded three tracks as a band. On  <i>Kale</i>, the band's 2008 split with labelmates Pontiak, the unit's workmanlike stability gave Heumann's ideas room to roam. The promise of those tracks goes largely unfulfilled on  <i> Song </i> .</p>
<p>Arbouretum becomes less of a trio supporting Heumann and more of a quartet featuring Heumann here. The move doesn't play to Arbouretum's strengths, meaning that-at worst-this hits like a ""jam band"" flatlining through a proper studio session. Like  <i> Rites </i> ,  <i> Song of the Pearl </i> is alternately driving or drifting, anxious or languid. The extremes are less compelling, though, and the bulk of the record feels too staid to be effective. The first four tracks float right by, the band plodding through opener ""False Spring"" and ""Another Hiding Place"". The title track trots in and out at mid-tempo, strings rising swiftly between each line. It's an awkward stumbling block for the song's sidewinding motion, and it leaves little of an impression.</p>
<p>The second side is a bit more aggressive, at least, from the italicized beat and strident electric tone of opener ""Thin Dominion"" to the multiple spiraling guitar passes that sprint in every direction during ""Infinite Corridors"". Closer ""Tomorrow Is a Long Time"" is Arbouretum's best slow number yet, a smoldering reflection for a guitar with strings that sound as if they've been gathering rust for an eon, played through an amplifier sutured with string and scotch tape. Heumann's voice acts just as beleaguered, barely able to wash past the damage.</p>
<p>Change often hinges on trade-offs, and Arbouretum's shift from the rangy dynamism of  <i> Rites </i> to the stunted kinetics of  <i> Song of the Pearl </i> is no different: Though he leads us less with his guitar, Heumann's words are sharper now. On  <i> Rites </i> , he felt like a formal poet, filling his verse with forced end-rhymes that reflected allegiance to rules, not song. Heumann relaxes here instead, taking the rhymes when they come but not overreaching.</p>
<p><i> Song </i> 's more considered writing is the record's real payoff. As the band rages through ""The Midnight Cry"", the story of 19th century New England priest William Miller's failed apocalyptic prophecy, Heumann relies on repetition and redundant rhymes to differentiate the verses-- a smart strategy that binds the cascading narrative. On the other hand, Heumann's anxious imagery during ""The Fall Line""-- the collapse of the sun, the evil eyes of wolves, the peering watchman of the moon-- tumbles down without rhyme, meaning our narrator has more pressing worries than propriety.</p>
<p>Perhaps praising Heumann's improved writing plays like faint praise, but it's as significant a step in the  <i> right </i> direction as tightening the instrumental belt is in the  <i> wrong </i> direction. That it took just two years and one album to do both reflects Heumann's ability and desire to take this band anywhere. Movement, after all, made those old guitar solos glorious. You've got to think that, even after this net setback, Arbouretum's best work remains in its future.</p></div>"|12779.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12779-song-of-the-pearl/|5.8|Grayson Currin

It's been three years since Yancey's untimely death and his grip on the imagination and inspiration of hip-hop artists still hasn't loosened-- and somehow, for the most part, hasn't crumbled into exploitative shamelessness. You can chalk that up to most of the tribute-paying artists-- Q-Tip, Common, Busta Rhymes, Talib Kweli, ?uestlove, Erykah Badu, damn near every hip-hop artist in Detroit-- having known and respected the man on a collaborative level (and, in the case of <i>Yancey Boys</i>' Illa J, as family). Madlib's own personal musical tribute to Dilla is particularly faithful: They were two producer-MCs who had forged a mutual stylistic compatibility, one that began with beat-tape trading by mail and resulted in the underground classic <i>Champion Sound</i>, and in that album's wake they both wound up inspiring and pushing each other to expanded vistas. <i>Donuts </i>might have sounded like a drastically different album without the choppy, grimy aesthetic of <i>The Unseen</i> and <i>Madvillainy</i>'s production mind as a creative sparring partner, and Madlib's early <i>Beat Konducta </i>work, the creation of which ran largely parallel to the construction of <i>Donuts</i>, benefited greatly from his study of Dilla's meticulous drum and bassline construction. Among all the things that were lost to hip-hop heads with Dilla's passing, the possibility of future collaborations and stylistic cross-pollinations between these two beatmaking auteurs was one of the most significant.</p>
<p>As an elegy, a payment of a gratefully-acknowledged artistic debt and an expansion of one man's sound, the fifth and sixth volumes of Madlib's <i>Beat Konducta</i> series are a stirring culmination of everything Dilla did to affect Madlib as a musician. Granted, there's little mistaking it for anyone other than Madlib: There's a constant volley of vocal snippets, lyrical and otherwise, that fit his thematic blend of fragmented quasi-narrative and off-kilter humor. Plus, his restless, loop-jostling production style is instantly-recognizable here in one of its most dubbed-out, bass-heavy and atmospherically THC-soaked incarnations yet. Still, the Dilla influence is clearly evident in a number of ways, especially the way vocals are chopped and truncated to serve as melodic hook, percussive exclamations, and reconstructed grooves for several tracks, as well as the recurring presence of that weighty, synthesized bass Dilla loved to lace his tracks with. And there's a few other flourishes-- like the air-raid siren that popped up every so often on <i>Donuts</i>, or the ""Make It Funky"" clip of James Brown saying ""I don't know"" used on the Slum Village track of the same name-- that range from obvious nods to what seem like elaborate in-jokes between friends.</p>
<p>At 42 tracks stretched across 67 minutes, this looks a bit like an unwieldy collection of fleeting ideas when the tracklisting's all splayed out in front of you. And it's a bit difficult to get a firm grasp on everything, even after several listens: There's just so many ideas Madlib's managed to cram into even the shortest minute-long loop that it's hard to point to a particular track and highlight its characteristics without taking the rest of the album into account. There's some particularly inspired standout moments that'll stick with you: the soul strings that get hacked up into hiccupping, off-beat tics on ""The String (Heavy Jones)""; the way ""The Get Over (Move)"" actually welds the guitar riff from the Buzzcocks' ""Boredom"" to an archetypal Yancey boom-clap and somehow makes it make sense; the muffled/smothered beats on ""Smoked Out (Green Blaze Subliminal Sounds)"" where nothing's clear or amplified except a persistent tambourine slap.</p>
<p>But this isn't an album that benefits from a track-by-track dissection or a thorough inventorizing, even if the bulk of the beats sound attention-grabbing enough when they pop up as individual moments in a divorced, shuffle-mode context. More than any other collection of semi-instrumental productions Madlib's assembled, the combined <i>Dil Cosby Suite </i>and <i>Dil Withers Suite </i>is a complete work. The best way to listen to this album is to throw it on, zone out and keep your finger away from the controls, letting the rhythmic detours and left-field segues sneak up on you before dissolving into the next beat (abetted, every so often, by some sparse but well-placed scratches from guest turntablist J-Rocc). Before long you'll click with its flood of sounds and ideas and emotions, and the everywhere-at-once scope-- mournful and celebratory, solemn and comedic, starting from soul and circulating its way through every other vein of hip-hop production structure. Three years later, after all the eulogies for Dilla, this record stands as one of the most meaningful.</p></div>"|12772.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12772-beat-konducta-vol-5-6/|8.3|Nate Patrin

The lengthy and unedited interviews with Kim Hiorthøy included in each book capture Kristoffersen's struggle, not so much to maintain cash flow, as to deal with a product that seems anachronistic. Kristoffersen, who hates compression, doesn't pay much attention to his download business, and isn't so sure how this MySpace thing works, admits that he's a dinosaur.</p>
<p>His vision of a record label entails releasing strong, well-packaged albums and hoping people listen to them, and he has a pretty good roster to fulfill that vision. But a crappy CD costs the same $13-20 bucks as a CD by Supersilent, and so when it comes time to offer the fans something grander, Kristoffersen turns out a book like this one-- a for-the-fans collectible, featuring gorgeous pages of cover and sketch art, photo portraits of the artists, and a pair of CDs that collect album tracks and a few unreleased and live cuts. It's smaller than a coffee table book, unlike say, European art label ECM's  <i> Sleeves of Desire </i> , a similar self-celebration that now fetches hundreds of bucks on eBay. But at $65, it's strictly a way for collectors to satisfy their passion for the label.</p>
<p>No one will buy this just for the music, but that's not to say it isn't a good listen. In 10 years, the label hasn't moved far from its roots: Atmospheric electronica and refined European improvisation still prevail. Kristoffersen sought to stretch the profile with rock/pop acts like Susanna and the Magical Orchestra, and Shining. But here, they both sound more like ecletic art bands. Shining's cover of King Crimson's ""21st Century Schizoid Man"" is crisp and zany, and even the ferocious axework comes with a wink. On her two cuts, Susanna's gorgeous voice and ghostly heartbreak are unmoored from any real-world context. She's also gains much from Helge Sten, the producer whose grave sound helped shape much of the label's catalog.</p>
<p>Sten's also a member and the producer of Supersilent, the electro-acoustic quartet that gave the label its first album and remains its strongest act. Supersilent contributes ""C-6.1"", which sounds like an outtake from their last LP,  <i> 8 </i> ; strange and engrossing, it also tends to meander. The quartet's members show up on several other cuts, including the opening ""Mono Hum"" by Humcrush, a stately and sentimental improvisation by the duo of Supersilent keyboardist Ståle Storløkken and Food's Thomas Strønen. The sublimely soothing keyboards remind me how often brainy, European art music seems tailormade to charm little kids; see also Phonophani's toy-like electronic piece ""The Atlantic"". But Arve Henriksen, in collaboration with Jan Bang, chips in the even mellower ""No Horizon"", a wisp of a world ambient piece that gives fleeting glances at his falsetto vox and delicate trumpet tone.</p>
<p>But before you assume that frowning concentration is the label's signature, acts like Box shred into view: a new supergroup that includes Storløkken, Trevor Dunn, and Scorch Trio guitarist Raoul Björkenheim, they contribute a metalloid freak-out that pairs a diligent guitar riff with deep shocks of keyboards. The Scorch Trio also appears here, with ""Hys"", a power trio jam that smokes but never burns. And Jono El Grande changes things up completely for exactly one track: ""Eva's Horse Dance,"" an avant circus riot featuring garbled vocals, squawking soprano sax, and a whomping beat. The 1960s-slash-70s never died-- but they don't always sound this lively.</p>
<p>Though Jono's been with the label a while, he's one of the few surprises on the set. Little new blood has appeared on the roster since the last  <i> Money Will Ruin Everything </i> five years ago; outliers like Jono El Grande or MoHa! (not featured here) don't exactly refresh a label that started with folks like Supersilent, Maja Ratkje, and Arne Nordheim. Growth and riches were never on Kristoffersen's agenda-- he's not kidding about the album title-- but he also refrains from making a grand artistic statement, or shaping (or pruning) the nebulous field of improvised electronic art music. But the book's ultimate point is clear: Rune Grammofon remains a primarily Norwegian, primarily excellent label built entirely on the tastes of its owner. And his is a brand we can still count on.</p></div>"|12794.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12794-money-will-ruin-everything-the-second-edition/|7.4|Chris Dahlen

Zu, one of the most progressive no-wave metal bands ever to come out of Italy, were recruited by Patton for the release of their 14th album,  <i> Carboniferous </i> , and one cannot conceive a more fitting home for the trio.  <br/> <br/> Drummer Jacopo Battaglia, saxophonist Luca T. Mai, and bass player Massimo Pupillo, formed Zu in Rome 10 years ago. Since then, aside from releasing records at the rate of more than one per year, the band have toured the world relentlessly (their self-described Black Flag-esque work ethic has motivated them to play over 1,000 live shows), and collaborated with an impressive range of sterling artists such as Hamid Drake, the Ex, Han Bennink, Damo Suzuki, Alvin Curran, and the Stooges' saxophonist Steve MacKay. Given their predilection for ingenious improvisation, combined with the ability to absorb and incorporate an exhilarating variety of musical styles into their material, it is not surprising that Zu often sounds like a hundred bands in one, although the way they piece together their wild sonic jigsaw is unique to them alone.  <br/> <br/> Entirely instrumental except for Patton's guest vocals on ""Soulympics"",  <i> Carboniferous </i> veers alternately from free jazz and punk, to sheer metal, math, and hair-raising noise. By the time the album reaches the finish line, there aren't many stones left unturned. It sounds as though Zu have wrung out every last drop from their musical cloth, yet one doubts whether their imagination can possibly run dry. Arguably the most aggressive album the band has ever recorded,  <i> Carboniferous </i> is relentless in its volatile ferocity. Any brief moment of calm is torn from limb to limb by a monstrous tide of free jazz or Behemoth-style mania. On a song such as ""Carbon"", Mai's saxophone, the perfect melodic replacement for Zu's lack of vocals, sounds like it is fighting a battle as it screams and struggles against the rhythm section in an effort to set itself free. Other tracks take the listener inside the workings of an industrial factory. ""Chthonian"" and ""Axion"" are so forcefully precise and metallic sounding that it feels as though you are trapped in a steel foundry, narrowly escaping darts of sparks and rivers of molten metal.  <br/> <br/> At times the songs can sound cold, as though they want to keep their distance, refusing to shed any armor. Although this could be a handicap on other albums, it only serves to makes  <i> Carboniferous </i> more intriguing. Not exactly an easy ride, it will undoubtedly be too dense, tough, and quite frankly deranged for some listeners to take in. For others, particularly fans of fellow Mediterranean math rockers Uzeda, John Zorn's  <i> Cobra </i> improvisations, and all Patton-affiliated projects such as Fantômas and Mr. Bungle, Zu's massive accomplishment will be nothing short of breathtaking.</p></div>"|12765.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12765-carboniferous/|8.0|Mia Clarke

(Or if you're already famous for something else, I guess.) Despite TVOTR's high-and-gaining profile, Celebration's excellent Sitek-produced  <i> The Modern Tribe </i> flew under the radar in 2007, and there's nary a peep about Aleks and the Drummer's 2008 EP,  <i> May A Lightning Bolt Caress You </i> , outside of the two-piece outfit's native Chicago. A shame, because this band might be the most distinctive of the bunch, pulling equal inspiration from punk and from older traditions. And Sitek's name on the back might actually be his biggest contribution; the band seems to have a pretty clear idea of what its going for here.</p>
<p>The percussion-plus-Farfisa combo may read like kitschy carnival-punk territory, but the music of Aleks and the Drummer has its roots in something deeper and thrives on opposing forces. The most prominent of those tensions is the urgency of the music and the graceful, almost mannered voice of Aleks Tomaszewska-- clear and distinct, every syllable exact, soaring and cutting through the clutter while the band stops and starts in fits. ""I Want to Melt His Eyes"" starts out with surf-rock drum patter and B-movie one-finger organ riff. Then the vocals kick in, operatic and melodramatic, muttering the title just once over a musical figure never repeated. It's a fine example of the manic drumming meeting the icy calm of Tomaszewska's voice and organ. Though the melody takes a its share of twists and odd angles, it's still simple and approachable, like a child making up her own nursery rhyme.</p>
<p>The two-note shuffle and descending chorus of ""Closer"" is similar in tone, if catchier, featuring an odd break-beat bridge and a rhythm that clangs mercurially behind the simple and stark melody. ""Co Mi Panie Dasz?"", introduced with maximum vocal warble and a concise burst of psychedelia, is a jittery recast of a traditional Polish song, as Tomaszewska's voice goes from recital-ready proper to increasingly desperate. And then on ""Paper Crown and Sugar Shoes"" her breathy vibrato is almost soothing, until the song ascends with the grace and swagger of a 1970s rock-radio dinosaur.</p>
<p>While the band's palette of sounds is necessarily small, their melodies and inspirations are unpredictable, and they certainly have a few deft tricks when it comes to rhythm. The drums belong in the most rabid surf-punk outfit, and the Farfisa brings a nervy psychedelic edge, but Aleks Tomaszewska's graceful and powerful vocals are the most assertive element in a duo that juxtaposes old-world melodies with modern post-punk, giving their music a timeless-- or just out-of-time-- feel.</p></div>"|12743.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12743-may-a-lightning-bolt-caress-you-ep/|6.8|Jason Crock

St. Werner's best Lithops pieces are tightly wound sonic anomalies sparking out of white noise with transient, implied melodies. Unlike the malleable and transilient sounds of Mouse on Mars, Lithops compositions are, almost as a rule, embryonic and fragile ambient works.  <i> Ye Viols! </i> plays with the model at its own peril.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><i> Ye Viols! </i> compiles St. Werner's recent forays into composition for art installations, with these 11 instrumental narratives forming keenly rhythmic commentaries on a technophile world. Synthesizers flow and loop with urgency, beats arrive promptly on the downbeat, subroutines whir in the background. Each piece visits a different corner of the industrial maze, appealing to  <i> Zuckerzeit </i> -era Cluster on ""Graf"" while rushing the listener through factory floors, WWII radio rooms, and gamelan orchestras in ""21. jhrdt"".</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">But for all the ""recombined industrial iconography"" adorning  <i> Ye Viols! </i> , its works resist cohesion. The rave-tinged mechanics explored on ""Apps 1"" and ""Apps 2"" fritter along as a sly rejoinder to the sweat of the dancefloor, whereas the following piece, ""Bacchus"", whirs statically like a jet engine. The record ends up a jumble of techno-organic identifiers: Eleven works singing 11 vaguely similar tunes in 11 different keys. The installations that source the compilation reportedly span a number of themes: ""Graf"" accompanied a series of futuristic architectural sketches, whereas ""Bacchus"" soundtracked collages of imagined hybrid life forms. Decontextualized from their sensory environment, the pieces share only a superficial grasp at the wonders of technological innovation.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">As today's dominant technological upheaval, the Information Age, forces the evolution of music consumption, composers such as St. Werner are (for the better) diversifying their creative output in order to stay relevant. Ironically, while St. Werner has the chance to engage listeners on a new medium, this limited-edition run of 1,000 individually numbered  <i> Ye Viols! </i> CDs seems chained to a fast-dying world of shiny discs and brick-and-mortar commodities. The compositions on  <i> Ye Viols! </i> can hint at his Lithops' dynamism, but they are tailor-made for the passive participation of art installations, not for home listening.

That is, until while living in (where else?) Brooklyn, she was approached by (who else?) a curious and enthusiastic Devendra Banhart, who introduced Rio en Medio to the world via his Gnomonsong imprint. The rest, as they say, is indie history, at least for the handful of folks turned on to Stech-Homsy's quirky brand of bricolage.</p>
<p>If  <i> The Bride of Dynamite </i> was a product of private experimentation and serendipity,  <i> Frontier </i> is more considered. Recorded in Stech-Homsy's native and current home of New Mexico, the project supposedly began as a series of poems, which she subsequently fleshed out and expanded into songs. That non-musical literary foundation thus frees her up to design soundscapes sympathetic to her words, but the process doesn't affect the results too obviously. If someone said Stech-Homsy began with the sounds and added the words as an afterthought, that would likely fly, too.</p>
<p><i> Frontier </i> may have been recorded in New Mexico, but at times it sounds like it was mixed on another planet. The basis for most of the songs is frequently a simple guitar pattern (or perhaps baritone ukulele, her axe of choice) and Stech-Homsy's hushed voice, but overdubbed are various found-sound samples, synth squiggles, and a host of other intrusions, sometimes very much at odds with the ghostly mood but somehow still complementary to the tone Stech-Homsy means to convey.</p>
<p>Is ""The Umbrella"", for example, a spooky folk song enhanced by synthesizers and a mournful (fake?) trumpet, or is it a strange synthesizer track enhanced by the folky underpinning? Are the quiet static clicks, choral effects, and whale cries of ""The Diamond Wall"" intended as kitsch, invoking a scratchy sound-effects LP from grandma's basement, or are they meant to accent the melodramatic and oddly anachronistic orchestral elements, like Popul Vuh updated for the sampler age? (Eight-minute closer ""The Visitor"" all but demands its own Herzog film.)</p>
<p>Yet Stech-Homsy is also capable of relatively conservative folk of the stately British school. Indeed, were it not for the minimal pitter-patter of programmed percussion, ""Standing Horses"" could be a lost Vashti Bunyan track. Likewise ""The Last Child's Tear"". The title track, however, is pure psychedelic collage, while ""Fall Up"" approaches reserved electro-pop. ""The Light House"" sometimes sounds literally phoned in, as if from another dimension. Almost all these tracks go on a little too long, yet hide too many surprises-- like the backing vocals that burst into the hypnotic ""Nameless""-- to warrant cutting anything short.</p>
<p>These perplexing musical contradictions help keep  <i> Frontier </i> -- even at its most indulgent or confounding-- captivating and sometimes fascinating. If the album never quite sets, like a sculpture that refuses to dry, there's little doubting Stech-Homsy's dedication to her particularly inscrutable vision. Part cosmic fun house, part haunted house, it keeps you on your toes, waiting to see if the next song will amuse you, entrance you, or scare you silly. Or all three.</p></div>"|12751.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12751-frontier/|7.2|Joshua Klein

Like Tom Cruise, or life in Hobbes' state of nature, it can be nasty, brutish, and short. Language that would make Rahm Emanuel or a ""South Park"" writer blush.  Intolerance enough to have Rush Limbaugh sound like Gandhi. A mini shock'n'awe campaign of child-on-insect violence. And, every now and then, brief glimpses of nudity. Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian.  <br/> <br/> UK twee-poppers the Boy Least Likely To didn't disappear after 2005 debut  <i> The Best Party Ever </i> reclaimed the schoolyard. But their vividly imagined mix of whimsy and melancholy has attracted a magic-threatening share of the spotlight. A steady drip of TV, film, and retail licensing for single ""Be Gentle With Me"", originally released in 2003, culminated (so far) with a Coca-Cola commercial  during this year's Academy Awards broadcast. At the same time, in a world where Noah and the Whale exist, hipper-than-thou tastes have shifted back toward harsher, rougher sounds, or else impossibly perfect Auto-Tune chart-pop.</p>
<p>Boy will be Boy. Delayed by record-label collapse, sophomore album  <i> The Law of the Playground </i> evokes a nostalgia that has as much to do with those innocently optimistic days before financial meltdown, fake celebrity Twitter posts, and Hipster Runoff as with lazy summers. This still isn't kids music. But TBLLT's child's-eye perspective on English anorak pop, sunny West Coast harmonies, Belle and Sebastian-y folk, country, and soul, is now certifiably... theirs, just theirs. Dexys Midnight Runners-like strings join banjo, recorder, handclaps, synths, and glockenspiel. If the enchantment has weakened a smidge, the craft-- and the extreme cuteness-- sure haven't. TBLLT have covered both George Michael and the Field Mice; their own best songs combine the former's chart-conquering populism with the latter's practically mind-expanding wimpiness. ""I've got puppy powers,"" TBLLT lyrical and vocal half Jof Owen murmurs on current single ""Every Goliath Has Its David"", as multi-instrumentalist/composer Pete Hobbs wields birthday-party orchestration like a giant-killing slingshot.</p>
<p>Yet whether on gung-ho opener ""Saddle Up"", or self-pep-talk ""When Life Gives Me Lemons I Make Lemonade"", fear and neurosis almost always undermine the cheery arrangements. It's an old move, not just for these guys, but on advance download-only single ""I Box Up All the Butterflies"", with its twang and ""When I'm Sixty-Four"" oompah, TBLLT give gnawing insecurity a welcome charm. After ""the birds and the bees"" beset Owen when he's being entomologically cruel, dude reaches a koan-like understanding on acoustic ballad ""The Worm Forgives the Plough"", itself halfway between Sarah Records indie and Weezer's  <i> Pinkerton </i> ""Butterfly"". Harmonica- and glockenspiel-led ""Stringing Up Conkers"" juxtaposes grown-up body image problems with... shoving pencils up your nose.</p>
<p>Self-referentiality adds to  <i> The Law of the Playground </i> 's sense of déjà vu even as it lets the band try new angles on familiar themes. ""The Boy Least Likely To Is a Machine"" is a sad scientist's-workshop concept-song... sort of their ""Dr. Carter""; brassy swooner ""The Boy with Two Hearts"" could be the duo's autobiography (with its accompanying anxieties) or a love song (with its accompanying anxieties); ""The Nature of the Boy Least Likely To"" slows down and stretches out, fighting the same demons as  <i> The Best Party Ever </i> 's ""The Battle of the Boy Least Likely To"".</p>
<p>An old  <i> Calvin &amp; Hobbes </i> Sunday strip has been making the rounds again lately. Calvin tries to sell Susie Derkins lemonade, overcharges her because of ""demand"" for an exorbitant salary, uses sludge water to cut costs, goes to mom for a bailout when Susie won't buy. As strong and unusual as  <i> The Law of the Playground </i> is, especially out of step in 2009, it never quite feels as inspired, as fraught with conflicted beauty, as past songs ""Paper Cuts"" or ""Be Gentle With Me"" or ""Monsters"". But that doesn't mean melody, harmony, and earnest self-expression of the funny pathos of being human are any less relevant this year than they were in 2005. ""I'm still as stupid as I was before,"" Owen sings on poignant finale ""A Fairytale Ending"".</p></div>"|12787.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12787-the-law-of-the-playground/|7.5|Marc Hogan

It gave us the Field, who leans heavily on the techno side of the Gas aesthetic, arranging pithy scraps of musical information into deathless pulsations. It also gives us Seattle's the Sight Below, a mirror image of the Field. Burying the thump and emphasizing the ambiance,  <i> Glider </i> could have been marketed as a lost Gas album while raising only the most initiated eyebrows. It's a cunning facsimile, but a facsimile nonetheless. Luckily,  <i> Glider </i> gets by just fine on the sensual pleasure of Voigt's style.</p>
<p>And there is a key distinction: While Voigt worked mostly with samples, the Sight Below creates his tracks with autonomously generated sounds. Running a guitar through a variety of looping, reverb, and delay stations, he uses the E-bow, the slide, and tentative picking techniques to circumvent the physical essence of the strings and to marshal clouds of edgeless tone. Only the 4/4 drum tracks-- consisting of cymbal snips, crisp snares, and hypnotic bass bumps-- keep these translucent songs from floating away.</p>
<p>The Sight Below's emphasis on melodic and rhythmic regularity makes his music serene and contemplative; it also creates a limitation. This is largely static work, with very little by way of build or release. Ideas presented near the beginning of each track tend to vary only cosmetically, then peter out. Some songs are extremely abstract: On ""At First Touch"", a continuous sub-tone breathes out long, celestial resonances for a few minutes, then gently rocks to a stop. The gusty, towering ""Without Motion"" describes itself accurately. The tracks where palpable textures are admitted tend, naturally, to be more engaging. On ""Dour"", fragments of discernible guitar glint through the streaming haze; on ""Life's Fading Light"", they seem to pull backwards against the pneumatic beat and atmospheric hum.</p>
<p><i> Glider </i> 's derivativeness and inertia put a cap on its capacity to astonish, but it has a protracted shelf life. It's consummate mood music, which goes a long way toward compensating for its shortcomings. And the more I listen, the more esoteric divergences from Gas I start to perceive-- a different personality shining through, aloof and expansively pensive. Voigt alleged that he wanted to ""bring the forest to the disco""-- the Sight Below lines up behind the velvet rope arm-in-arm with the sky.</p></div>"|12741.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12741-glider/|6.8|Brian Howe

The ratio of great songs to filler is usually pretty low. Rarely do the tracks have anything to do with one another, save their performers' political affiliations. And the songs rarely give context to one another by being collected together. But because they are usually thrown together to raise money for a charity or salute a musical hero, it feels mean-spirited to critique them.  <i> Selected + Collected </i> , however, doesn't have that problem-- or those teflon advantages. It's a business venture, a collection of eMusic Selects acts-- favorite unsigned or rising bands that the online retailer features once a month-- designed to celebrate the program's first anniversary and lend the assembled acts a little bit of exposure. And as such, being brutal seems fair. Fortunately (or unfortunately, if you're the sort who loves to read scathing reviews), that isn't necessary; the album is a charming surprise. (Full disclosure: eMusic is one of our retail partners.)</p>
<p><i> Selected + Collected </i> proves eMusic editors deserve a pat on their backs for their astute curatorial efforts. Case in point: San Francisco's Girls, a breakout band who haven't even released an album. Rarely does a song earn a seven-minute run time. And it's even more rare when that song has just a handful of repeated lyrics. But Girls' ""Hellhole Ratrace"" (which snuck in at number 100 on Pitchfork's list of the best tracks of 2008) stokes the impatience for the band's debut with its layers of dreamy fuzz, gooey backing vocals, and strummy acoustic guitar that's punctuated by echoing sleigh bells and handclaps. Joining the hard-to-Google band (and 14 others) on this comp are recent Best New Music recipients the Pains of Being Pure At Heart. For those who have already worn out the grooves on their recent full-length and are jonesing for new songs, there's ""Kurt Cobain's Cardigan"", which showcases the exuberant yet nostalgic lo-fi pop brilliance that made their album one of the first must-buys of 2009. Not all the tracks assembled here are new or previously unavailable, but with so many of the collection's artists releasing albums either on their own or through tiny independent labels without widespread distribution, they may all seem new to you. Rademacher's standout ""If U Got Some Magic"", for example, is taken from the band's 2007 full-length debut,  <i> Stunts </i> , but its appearance here will have you kicking yourself for ignoring the smart, sprawling piano anthem for more than a year now.</p>
<p>Mostly  <i> Selected + Collected </i> is a rock and pop collection, but its two forays into other genres are so good that you'll wish there were more. ""Buttermilk""-- the collection's lone hip-hop contribution-- is a welcome burst of rhythm, falling victim neither to groovy backpacker clichés nor tough-guy braggadocio. The funky, female-sung hook that the track is built on adds a soulful, vintage dimension to Queens MC Homeboy Sandman's melodic flow and sparse arrangement. And despite the glaring throat-clearing that mars Victoire's dreamy fantasia ""A Door into the Dark"" halfway through, it is a pleasingly accessible entrée into the world of modern pseudo-classical music (or perhaps it's just a particularly baroque piece of instrumental chamber pop).</p>
<p>There's a lot more to like on this overstuffed album, too. Man/Miracle's ""Pushing and Shoving"" sounds like David Byrne sitting in with the messy, insistent rhythm section of the Velvet Underground while playing ""Heroin"". She Keeps Bees' ""Bow"", with its simple, fierce guitar chug, economical drumming, and abrupt ending, sounds like the Pretenders doing rockabilly. My Teenage Stride's ""Weirder Nightmare"" wraps hooky, horn-studded 1960s pop in layers of very modern-sounding feedback. And Glasser's ""Apply"" marries tribal percussion to an otherworldly synthesized drone and a strikingly clear female vocal, which easily maneuvers from jazzy trilling to guttural squeaks, grunts, and Yoko Ono-like ululations.</p>
<p>There are few misses, and even those are worth a listen. Rick Froberg, of Drive Like Jehu and Hot Snakes fame, is easily this collection's biggest ""star,"" but as an introduction to his new band Obits, ""Light Sweet Crude"" isn't the best first impression. Coming on like a sexy-voiced Stones fan hell-bent on a sloppy garage makeover, Obits get the snarled, gritty vocals right, but their repetitive, strangely spare music lacks the requisite swagger. And while it is definitely enough to pique listeners' curiosity for the band's forthcoming Sub Pop debut, it doesn't stand out in such elevated company. That is nitpicky criticism, though, of an album that is so uniformly enjoyable and surprisingly filler-free. One can only hope that, like the similar series curated by UK record shop Rough Trade, the bigwigs at eMusic make  <i> Selected + Collected </i> an annual celebration.</p></div>"|12795.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12795-selected-collected-an-emusic-selects-compilation/|7.8|Rebecca Raber

Listening to the Canadian band's debut  <i> Songbook </i> , an earnest bundle of hushed folk-pop, you can't help but picture Hamilton tossing cards into an upside-down empty hat when he's sad. The album's large cast-- human and instrumental-- makes the otherwise tinny songs sound more plush, but its loosely wound orchestration too often feels flimsy.</p>
<p>Sillily enough, Hamilton's first band, which formed in Scotland, went by the moniker Woodpigeon Divided by Antelope Equals Squirrel. Upon returning home to Canada, W/A=S was multiplied by an antelope and deducted a squirrel, leaving him with Woodpigeon, a word he adores and maintains looks like a rollercoaster when written in cursive. This simple, unabashed admiration is apparent throughout  <i> Songbook; </i> the eight-member band, which occasionally (and daintily) slurps in additional members to fiddle with lap steels, glockenspiels, and flutes, isn't ashamed to sound pretty.</p>
<p>Amid the piano toddles and chiming bells reside sentiments like ""Why must love play games with geography?"" and overlapping lines ""I listen for your footsteps/ Never come""-- lyrics indicative of Hamilton's admirable skills to keep his melancholy in high spirits. His wistfulness is interrupted with the ""Death by Ninja (A Love Song)"", a light-hearted lullaby about going to ninja school, then continues on its maudlin way.</p>
<p>Though Woodpigeon's arrangements are more bashful than those of Sufjan Stevens, they have a few things in common. Hamilton is undoubtedly prolific, extracting these 14 songs (even borrowing from ""Come Thou Fount of Every Blessing"", the same hymn Stevens covers for one of his Christmas collections) but writing in his press release that he's got about 100 others waiting to be picked for the next team. Both share a tendency to have the occasional long song title (though Stevens' word count has got Woodpigeon beat 53 to 12 with the second track of  <i> Illinoise </i> , which iTunes finds intolerable).</p>
<p>But where Stevens succeeds with lushness and excessive punctuation,  <i> Songbook </i> 's lack of cohesion becomes clear in the orchestral arrangements that more often than not dwarf Hamilton's timid voice. Even the band's feathered harmonies feel like more of a crutch than an embellishment throughout. A handful of the songs could have been sheared off to make the album tighter, allowing less room for what sound like haphazard arrangements. To echo the title of their closing track, that was good, Woodpigeon, but you can do better.</p></div>"|12734.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12734-songbook/|5.5|Kasia Galazka

Since his homemade cassettes and mpfree turbulence started damaging ears last year, Williams has become the focal point of what reads and feels like a maelstrom of chatter. Once something of a left-field mystery, the hype around him has built steadily throughout this young year. Now with drummer and a press photo, Williams has probably played about as many shows as he has songs to be heard. A spate of recent outings in New York a few weeks back had the scene in such a tizzy,  <i> The </i> <i> New York Times </i> sent a dispatch to bear witness. And, just a few days later, to capitalize on the swell, his new label expedited the digital release of  <i> Wavvves </i> , his second full-length in just four months.  <br/> <br/> Without delving too deeply into the muck of Williams' proper (and purely self-titled) debut LP,  <i> Wavves </i> , it's worth noting that each of his twin long-players share more than just a menu of goths, weeeeeeed, demons, breakers, and vintage skate photography. While his second is the marginally less abrasive, more realized of the two efforts, both feature the same roach-encrusted punk pop. Be it in the opening power chords of ""Beach Demon"" or ""To the Dregs"", there's a couple of fried amps' worth of trusted guitar tropes and distortion-- tricks borrowed from the Wipers and Sonic Youth-- enveloping Williams' carbonated choruses. The vocal hooks themselves come fast, usually propelled by titanic drumbeats nicked from 1960s girl group music. It's not immediate--- and hardly the ""pop"" record that some have characterized it as-- but deep in the froth of highlight ""No Hope Kids"" lurks more than just a thick dose of teenaged ennui or even volume. There's thrilling evidence of compelling, thoughtful craftsmanship as well.  <br/> <br/> Wavves' no-fi bent has been compared to No Age's. But while those guys tend to reach far outside of their own feedback for spaces more expansive, Wavves' music feels more insular, self-contained, and unsettling. These aren't shouts from a house party, but from a solitary bedroom. And  <i> Wavvves </i> ' outbursts are often tempered and sandwiched between clipped electronics (opener ""Rainbow Everywhere"" and ""Goth Girls"") or experimental noise (""Killer Punx, Scary Demons"") that help congeal the album as a whole.  <br/> <br/> As the hubbub surrounding his music and name game began to gather serious cybersteam over the past few months, the San Diego native wisely moved his signature from small-time imprint De Stijl, to the bigger, much more historically distinct Fat Possum. Business measures and consonant gimmicks aside, the hop down South makes perfect aesthetic sense-- this young man is most certainly singing the blues. Hopeless stoner/loner incantations are scattered throughout, though two of the album's most bulletproof moments are also it's most deliciously bleak. Next to the pains of ""No Hope Kids"" (no car, no friends, no family, no friends, no girl), ""So Bored"" leaves memorable blisters. It's the record's one slam-dunk earworm, and it's a total bummer. Over three melted chords and his own back-up oooooooh's and aaaaaah's, Williams' moans a mantra that's bled into every track: ""I'm sooooo booooored, I'm sooooo boooored."" Not for much longer.</p></div>"|12783.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12783-wavvves/|8.1|David Bevan

On his ragged teenage recordings, Pierce pitted walking with Jesus against dropping some drugs and howled the fixing-to-die blues when he wasn't moaning resignation to his depressed existence. One year after Spacemen 3 released their benchmark cosmic rock album,  <i> The Perfect Prescription </i> , the band busied itself with turning a London arts center into a recreation of La Monte Young's  <i> Dream House </i> , issuing a 90-minute drone that caused-- according to one review-- mixed indignation and awe. Similarly, Spiritualized vacillated between the 100-plus musicians who contributed to  <i> Let It Come Down </i> and the smaller ensembles that finished Pierce's subsequent records. Sessions with jazz improvisers, orchestrations with massive choirs, electric oblivion with a rock trio: Instability and its inspiration have linked the Spaceman's discography from the start.</p>
<p>So Pierce's dismissal of ""Soul on Fire""-- the glorious pop-gospel triumph at the top of last year's  <i> Songs in A&amp;E </i> , the band's first LP since 2003-- shouldn't have surprised anyone. ""I didn't want that on the album,"" Pierce told me last June in a Pitchfork interview. ""I'm constantly fighting with this thing inside of me that says I should be sitting in a room with Matthew Shipp, or I should have Han Bennink on drums, or this song should be playing for the next 20 minutes in my head, not a silly little pop song."" Just two years earlier, Pierce  <i> was </i> sitting in a room with experimental pianist Shipp, recording  <i> SpaceShipp </i> , their first release as a duo but their third album as collaborators. Spaceman and Shipp worked together on  <i> Amassed </i> , the 2000 record from collaboration-prone, outbound electronicists Spring Heel Jack. They later toured England with a larger Spring Heel Jack ensemble that included bassist William Parker and the mischievous Bennink.  <br/> <i> </i></p>
<p><i> SpaceShipp </i> divides into two tracks, a 41-minute hypnotic drone called ""Inner"" and an 11-minute pointillist improvisation called ""Outer"". The pieces work as stylistic but not dramatic foils; the second track isn't an attempt to resolve the first. Consistent with the careers of Spaceman and the prolific Shipp, who's made dozens of records this decade with artists ranging from Susie Ibarra to El-P, it represents a chance to try something different.</p>
<p>As La Monte Young suggested for his own Dream Music, ""Inner"" simply appears, as if Shipp opens the lid on a room-filling Harmonium hum that was waiting latently in the corner. A scrim of electric guitar noise floats just at the surface, and, for the next 40 minutes, they drift into each other like two slow streams. Young suggested that his own music was eternal, and ""Inner"" inherits that philosophy. Every time Spaceman's guitar growls a bit or Shipp shifts to the next dissonant note, the counterpart adjusts, pushing the track forward while keeping the sound itself fluid. ""Outer"" works through similar interplay. Shipp spells out little melodies, sometimes in short, rapid bursts, sometimes in slow, well-spaced trickles. Spaceman lets his guitar drift through whorls of feedback, breaking the still with angry, snarling moments. ""Outer"" grows quiet but discordant and restless, fading out just as ""Inner"" faded in.</p>
<p><i> SpaceShipp </i> could barely have less in common with  <i> Guitar Loops </i> , Spaceman's 2006 album for Treader, recorded just three days before he was admitted into a London hospital and diagnosed with the case of double pneumonia that nearly killed him. Loops was impatient and busy, digging through and discarding ideas like an unsatisfied antiques collector at a Sunday market. But patience unites  <i> SpaceShipp </i> 's dual tracks, recorded almost exactly a year after Spaceman was released from the hospital as he attempted to resume work on  <i> Songs in A&amp;E. </i> While it's opportunistic to read into the change in Pierce's pacing and his health,  <i> SpaceShipp </i> seems neither stunted nor stretched. It sounds like a well-paced, comfortable exercise between two experimenters risking nothing but a bit of trust in one another, their notes and effects pulling and pushing against the other's until things smear or stumble into some vast, unseen and unexpected horizon.</p></div>"|12754.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12754-spaceshipp/|6.5|Grayson Currin

There was one effort at wall art, the LP cover of Isaac Hayes'  <b> <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Isaachayes-blackmoses-unfolded.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> <i> Black Moses </i> </a> </b> , which folded out into a cross with the singer-- clad in a Biblical caftan and sunglasses-- holding out his hands not in a crucifixion, but in blessing. The actual LPs stayed in their paper sleeves next to his TV, but from that place of honor on the wall, the apostle of funk-- one of Memphis' patron saints-- looked down upon us benevolently through many parties and late nights. It became so totemistic to this circle of friends that the music and the artwork are completely inseparable in my mind.</p>
<p>I'm happy to report that Stax's new reissue of  <i> Black Moses </i> , unlike the initial CD release in 1990, retains that original foldout packaging. It may be glossy instead of the matte finish I remember, and it may be CD-sized instead of the full LP measurements, but it still folds out into a cross, smaller but still somehow holy. In this case, the packaging for this album remains particularly important, not because of my personal attachment to it nor as a reminder that pop's material culture is slowly disintegrating in the digital age.  <i> Black Moses </i> was at that point one of the most elaborate LP packages issued for a black artist and as such represented a show of faith that Hayes, fresh off the unprecedented success of the  <i> Shaft </i> soundtrack in 1971, could command sales to rival those of his white contemporaries. And like that foldout cross, it was a massively ambitious statement album, a collection of covers and originals that documented the collapse of Hayes' marriage. It was an enormous success, lodging at #1 on the black charts for seven long weeks.</p>
<p>The album title was not simply a glorifying nickname, but a sort of prophecy. Hayes led his people not to a promised land (racial relations in America during the 1970s were so complex and heated as to make any such place almost impossible to visualize) but to a freer musical sensibility that emphasized synthesis: rock, funk, disco, and new strains of soul music marked by elaborate arrangements and lengthy running times.  <i> Black Moses </i> is brashly, lushly, and lovingly orchestrated, each track piled high with soundtrack strings, insistent horns, tender flutes, sultry back-up singers, and of course lots of wakka-chikka guitars, a Hayes signature.</p>
<p>As far out as he got, Hayes always stayed rooted in pop music. Most of these songs are covers: Kris Kristofferson's ""For the Good Times"" a moody, pleading reminiscence; Bacharach-David's ""I'll Never Fall in Love Again"" a slow burn; the Jackson 5's ""Never Can Say Goodbye"" a dramatic testimony; Little Johnny Taylor's ""Part-Time Love"" a breathless groove; the Motown hit ""Never Gonna Give You Up"" a luscious jam. ""Good Love"", the lone Hayes original here, may be a minor horndog proposition, but in this context it sounds like a knowing smirk: ""We interrupt this broadcast for a special news bulletin,"" he intones in the intro. ""Let all the young women crowd around before the news begins.""</p>
<p>Some of the joy of listening to  <i> Black Moses </i> is hearing Hayes explode these songs from the inside, unpacking their groove potential yet leaving them recognizable. ""(They Long to Be) Close to You"" had already been a hit for the Carpenters and has since become a key exemplar of 70s pop cheese, but Hayes anchors it to a laidback drumbeat, adds the Hot Buttered &amp; Soul singers in the background, and unfolds it into a nine-minute jam. It's startling to hear him sing the opening lines-- ""Why do birds suddenly appear, every time you are near?""-- in his supremely honeyed bass, but he gives the song a straight reading. At the time some critics derided these songs as aimless and self-glorifying, and Hayes' ornate orchestrations still carry a whiff of kitsch, but  <i> Black Moses </i> remains unapologetic, often moving, and always entertaining.</p>
<p>Stax is also reissuing Hayes' 1976 album,  <i> Disco Freak (Juicy Fruit) </i> , accompanied by a similarly over-the-top packaging. The cover shows him shirtless in a pool blowing a kiss to the camera while surrounded by a bevy of fruit-draped beauties. Open the gatefold to see the women's feet with panties 'round their ankles. That packaging, likewise, is important: It may be the most interesting aspect of this album, which reveals Hayes' weaknesses just as surely as  <i> Black Moses </i> reveals his considerable strengths. It begins with three full minutes of barely intelligible chatter, as Hayes and friends chat up a woman in the studio. By the time the clamor bleeds into the title track, you may have already tuned it out. Fortunately, ""Disco Freak"" saves it by immediately establishing an elastic groove complete with gasping guitar licks, throbbing basslines, and a bridge that goes ""Juicy Fruit sure is cute in her sexy jumpsuit.""</p>
<p>This is Hayes in full disco mode, as the title makes clear, yet he never sounds quite as comfortable here as he does with the expansive hybrid soul covers of  <i> Black Moses </i> . Hayes, who had written many of Stax's biggest hits, penned all of these songs himself, but here the Bacharach-David influence becomes clear-- and clearly curbs his audacity. The choruses of ""The Storm Is Over"" and ""Lady of the Night"" sound too smoothly polished to be very uplifting or seductive (the latter is particularly ridiculous), and upbeat numbers like ""Music to Make Love By"" and ""Thank You Love"" slip too easily from horny funk into a sort of lite jazz, without the urgency or drama of his best work. Hayes sounds comical, a humorless, one-dimensional ladies' man rather than the wounded romantic of  <i> Black Moses. </i> This is not where he promised to lead us.</p></div>"|12760.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12760-black-moses-juicy-fruit-disco-freak/|8.7|Stephen M.

They almost seemed to produce more bands than the tiny South Pacific paradise knew what to do with, and certainly more than one might expect a nation outnumbered by its livestock to be able to support. For all we know, the island is still awash in just as many excellent acts but, without a label like the currently less-than-prominent Flying Nun to serve as a filter or point the way, fewer New Zealand bands than ever are making their way to ears outside the Antipodes.</p>
<p>Surf City, a Kiwi band formed by Davin Stoddard and Josh Kennedy and formerly known as Kill Surf City (and before that, the Fibs), sound like they spent a good deal of time studying Flying Nun's initial output of awesomeness, especially the Clean. A quarter-century after the release of the ""Tally Ho"" single, the Clean remains New Zealand's indie-rock standard-bearer, and Surf City's ability to channel that group's punky psychedelic pop is impressive. Indeed, 25 years ago, just about any of the songs on Surf City's debut EP could have been ""Tally Ho"", too-- or, caught up during that initial Flying Nun flurry, at least ""Tally Ho! Part 2"".</p>
<p>""Headin' Inside"" begins with the twang of surf guitar before congealing into a fuzzy guitar rush, with what sounds like a recorder echoing the Clean's rinky-dink Casio and the massed vocals and giddy shouts of ""1-2-3-4!"" hearkening back even further to punk's formative years. The simple but effective melodies of ""Records of a Flagpole Skater"" (this time there's an actual rinky-dink keyboard) and ""Dickshaker's Union"" (which recalls the shimmering glory of early Chills) keep the throttle on the way-back machine firmly engaged. Not surprisingly, ""Canned Food"" and  ""Mt Kill"" don't break from form. The latter blends perfectly into ""Free the City"", which, if you're not paying attention, could fool you into thinking it's actually the anthemic second half of the same song.</p>
<p>Needless to say, it's 2009, not 1981. But Surf City's backwards-looking NZ rock comes off not redundant but absolutely charming. Even at a brisk and easy-to-miss 20 minutes, the six-song EP provides pure pop nostalgia but also a reminder of what some may have missed the first time around. Heck, even the disc's brevity feels like a throwback, as does the fact that this set of rousing guitar-pop sounds like it could have been recorded in an actual garage. All that's missing is the crackle of vinyl for the illusion to be complete. How far the group can take its second-hand facsimile is another matter entirely, but for the time being, Surf City's pleasure for pleasure's sake approach already has me pining for more.</p></div>"|12744.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12744-surf-city-ep/|7.4|Joshua Klein

If it were, even more great but stupidly named groups would fall by the wayside than do already. Even so, ""Gringo Star"" brings to mind no less than a novelty Tex-Mex Beatles cover band, and that's asking for trouble. (In my conception, Gringo is joined on stage by Juan, Pablo, y Jorge, each donning a sharp suit and wearing a lucha libre mask.)</p>
<p>Granted, Gringo Star is already a better name than A Fir-Ju Well, the former nom de rock of the Atlanta band (a play on the last name of band brothers Peter and Nicholas Furgiuele). So that's progress. Yet Gringo Star aren't about progress so much as stylized regression to the expertly captured golden age of garage and British Invasion rock. In fact, it's easy to imagine catching Gringo Star one night and leaving persuaded you've witnessed the second coming. This kind of stuff-- packed with hooks, propelled by larger than life swagger-- tends to make converts when it's blasting in your face, and the band is doing everything in its power to make you pay attention. So: hooks, attitude, and a dead-on 1960s aesthetic-- what's not to like?</p>
<p>On its otherwise solid debut,  <i> All Y'All </i> , Gringo Star pretty much reveal everything you're going to get on the lead title track, which features all the usual 60s hallmarks and accoutrements-- handclaps, tambourine, tight harmonies, a thrilling riff here, a twangy lead there, a short but snarling solo tossed into the middle of it all-- each expertly shaped and assembled by producer Ben Allen into a perfect period reproduction. Then the band does it again with ""Ask Me Why"". And again with ""Up and Down"". And again with the infectious ""Come On Now"". And so on. After just a few songs in it begins to dawn upon you: this is good stuff, catchy and hyper-confident, but is it enough?</p>
<p>More to the point, does it need to be? Expectations lowered, or at least tempered, what's left is to simply enjoy the disc as the throwback that it is, as if it were the first disc of a hypothetical boxed set that captures a band's early days before it gets even better. That the particular parallel band in this instance happens to be the Kinks doesn't necessarily do Gringo Star any favors, since lyrically the Gringos don't connect as easily as the guitars do. When the tempos slow, as they do on ""Transmission"", the words become more apparent, and while the reveal offers nothing to be ashamed of, it's a far cry from the wit and bite of Ray Davies.</p>
<p>If it's unfair to judge a band by its name, it's just as unfair to judge a band by its primary influence, particularly that one influence. But when a band all but demands the comparison, it's setting itself up to fall short. After all, to attempt to match the Kinks is a losing proposition, since at best you're going to come close enough to emphasize how far you still are. Working in the band's favor, however, is the fact that (for the time being) Gringo Star exists and the Kinks do not, so every time the band hits the stage it can rest assured that in the uncontested Gringo Star/Kinks live showdown, Gringo will always end the night triumphant. The songs are strong, but it's the sweat that will need to do the convincing.</p></div>"|12745.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12745-all-yall/|6.4|Joshua Klein

Her voice can knock you over-- it's one of the strongest in any genre. She has immense control and surprising physical and stylistic range, able to jump from cowgirl honkytonk to pop muse to Americana banshee with ease and grace. However, on her fifth studio album,  <i> Middle Cyclone </i> , she literally becomes a force of nature: Case sings opener ""This Tornado Loves You"" from the point of view of an actual tornado, tearing up trailer parks and cutting a 65-mile swath in search for its beloved: ""I carved your name across three counties,"" she sings defiantly as the guitars whip around her and the snare patters frantically, suggesting destruction can be a demonstration of love. Later she's a cyclone, an elephant, a killer whale, a dove, a magpie, and possibly a mollusk. ""I'm an animal,"" she sings on ""I'm an Animal"". ""You're an animal, too.""  <i> </i></p>
<p><i> Middle Cyclone </i> is another strong entry in her strange catalog, a culmination of some of the lyrical and musical concerns she's been exploring since  <i> Blacklisted </i> , when she started receiving full songwriting credit. That 2002 album marked a turning point for Case as she abandoned the straightforward country-soul of 2000's  <i> Furnace Room Lullaby </i> for a spookier sound that favors odd song structures and odder imagery about serial killers, downed planes, and automobile accidents.  <i> Fox Confessor Brings the Flood </i> developed those ideas and  <i> Middle Cyclone </i> further refines them. It plays almost like a culmination of her career this decade, the final installment of a trilogy about the weird American wilderness of her mind.</p>
<p>Listeners more familiar with Case's previous work will appreciate the tendrils of mythology that reach from this album into her recent catalog. With its first-verse image of a man ""filleted on the stairs,"" ""Polar Nettles"" recalls the bloodspatter lyrics of ""Deep Red Bells"" on  <i> Blacklisted </i> ; ""Red Tide"" and ""Magpie to the Morning"" play with critter imagery similar to ""Lion's Jaws"" and ""Maybe Sparrow"" on  <i> Fox Confessor </i> . In fact, ""People Got a Lotta Nerve"" sounds like a sequel of sorts to ""The Tigers Have Spoken"", from her live album of the same name. Both concern zoo animals who rebel against their prisons, and both end, tragically and inevitably, in bullets. The album, however, doesn't demand any special context to be enjoyed: It sounds impressive and immersive on its own, so those who've only heard her name will find much to admire in her skewed songs. But because Case doesn't really write hooks and typically avoids the standard verse-chorus-verse song structure,  <i> Middle Cyclone </i> may take even longer than previous albums to reveal their charms and mysteries.</p>
<p>What ties everything together is her unmistakable voice. Pushing herself, she shows off a few new tricks in these songs. On ""People Got a Lot of Nerve"", she fashions one of the album's best hooks from the repeated syllables of ""man man man eater"", then ascends a vertiginous scale on the bridge, hitting that impossibly high note with no loss of tone. She layers her voice to create an airy chorus on ""Magpie to the Morning"" and a dramatic gospel on her cover of Sparks' ""Never Turn Your Back on Mother Earth"". ""Prison Girls"" may be her best performance here, with an emphatic vocal that gives the chorus-- ""I love your long shadows and your gunpowder eyes""-- new meaning and greater menace with each repetition.</p>
<p>Case remains her own best muse, a strong, feminine presence who demands you meet her songs halfway (she calls herself a control freak in every article I've read), but her band deserves credit for creating the ambient, dark-night setting in which her tales of murder and animals sound natural and compelling.  <i> Middle Cyclone </i> features the same core group she's been playing with for years-- including guitarist Paul Rigby, bass player Tom V. Ray, multi-instrumentalist Jon Rauhouse, and back-up singer Kelly Hogan-- along with a supporting cast that includes regulars Garth Hudson of the Band, M. Ward, Sarah Harmer, and members of Calexico, the Sadies, and Giant Sand. With an increasing familiarity between them, this cast finds new ways to sell her songs and couch Case's vocals in unpredictable arrangements. ""People Got a Lotta Nerve"" kicks off with a chiming Byrds riff that makes it impossible not to perk up and listen to the song, and a strangled guitar line staggers through ""Fever"", implying an unnamed threat just off camera. Much of the album is acoustic and subdued, and a few of the slower songs start to sag a bit. The album picks up considerably towards the end, as ""Prison Girls"" lurches ominously like film noir and ""Red Tide"" generates a rumbling garage-rock stomp.</p>
<p><i> Middle Cyclone </i> ends with ""Marais la Nuit"", which translates to ""The Night Marsh"". True to its title, it is 30 minutes of frog noises that Case recorded at her farm in Vermont, just outside the barn where most of these sessions were held. It's not surprising that her animal lyrics would break down into real animal sounds, and as chill-out music for any domesticated wildlife in your home, it's not unpleasant. It is, however, nearly as long as the album proper. Its inclusion show just how thoroughly Case has imagined her own little world on these three albums and how thoroughly she rules that realm.</p></div>"|12729.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12729-middle-cyclone/|7.9|Stephen M.

A lot. L.A.'s Abe Vigoda are self-described ""tropical punk,"" and Google results say this phrase appears 1,640 times next to their name. It's totally accurate. The band's second album,  <i> Skeleton </i> , mixed steel drum-mimicking guitars and stilted, hard-to-play (easy to call ""tropical""; more accurately ""syncopated"") rhythms. L.A. all-ages performance space The Smell was their musical home base. On  <i> Reviver </i> Abe Vigoda take the next logical step in the development of their easy-to-peg sound: they abandon it.  <i> Skeleton </i> was great, but also hinted that there were more variations and textures hidden inside the songs. Just as on  <i> Skeleton </i> , Abe Vigoda establish an aesthetic right from the beginning of  <i> Reviver </i> . Or rather, they establish what it is not; and this time it’s ""not-tropical punk.""</p>
<p>This EP contains five songs, but shows Abe Vigoda presenting a different but equally developed sound from ""Don't Lie"" onwards. On ""Don't Lie"", guitarists Juan Velazquez and Michael Vidal turn their instruments on an angle; and their guitars sound strident, and strained. The whole song feels darker, more languid than anything on  <i> Skeleton </i> . Vidal, the band's fresh-faced singer, croons-- actually croons-- ""Don't Lie"" and the rest of the EP as if he's lived several lifetimes since their last album. There's a slowness to it that feels like weight, but not drag, and this pull goes in many directions. Abe Vigoda pan their tracks to emphasize the contrasting guitar melodies, but their low production values let them blend and swirl together at times. Still, the separation is the most enjoyable across the EP. ""House"", for example, has that familiar jagged, unsteady beat, but the best and most disorienting sounds are its guitars. Here the guys do a crisp little tone in one ear, and spikier guitar stabs in the other. They don't clash, really, but they compete for your attention.</p>
<p>Abe Vigoda wants to make their adjustments explicit, by recording songs that've been done before. They cover both their own track,  <i> Skeleton </i> ’s ""Endless Sleeper"", and Stevie Nicks' 1983 hit ""Wild Heart"".  <i> Reviver </i> 's ""Endless Sleeper"" runs slower but shorter. There are no drums here, and the song turns into jelly without either a backbone or the hard, bright guitar of the original. It's a proof-of-concept for their new sound, but it doesn't beat out the energy that charges through the band's first edition. Their ""Wild Heart"" interpretation comes off better. The band sing only a fraction of Nicks’ lyrics and keep Vidal’s voice low. One of those lines, ""Another chill off an already broken heart"" defines the way the vocals work: Vidal's voice sounds deeper and dispassionate across the EP's five songs. ""Wild Heart"" rests on a five-note guitar melody and simple bass line. It feels methodical, sparse, and totally unlike them, which is exactly what they want.</p>
<p>If  <i> Skeleton </i> was island punk,  <i> Reviver </i> moves the band out to sea. The drumming feels less straightforward here and only adds to the dizzying effect that makes you feel like Abe Vigoda's members are working at cross-purposes. Sometimes it feels like they're playing two different songs, working from two different ideas. There's no steady view of the horizon anymore.

In the Britpop 1990s, Blur snarkily claimed to see no difference between ""Girls and Boys"", and Elastica made sexual demystification a lot more fun (""You could call me a car lover/ 'Cause I love it in a motor""). Brighton's Shrag are a sharp up-and-coming poppy post-punk band smearing their own dark lip gloss on sex and gender. But you can always tell deep down they're looking for real, vital connection.</p>
<p>They find it in more ways than one on their self-titled debut album, which mostly pulls together songs released on mp3 and 7"" going back to 2006, when ""Don't Speak""-ably stinging breakup ballad ""Hopelessly Wasted"" made a few waves. More often the three-girl, two-boy guitar-synth rioters are more bellicose-- hitting the giddy stratospheres of early Long Blondes singles (minus the glamour) while tremblingly shouting down a cheating lover on spiky-riffed ""Lost Dog"", or holding a ""long term grudge"" on fast, still-furious ""Long Term Monster"". Shoplifting is hard on the unrepentantly unruly ""Intelligent Theft"", but bratty MySpace-quote pop sounds easy. The most divisive track is likely to be Kate Nash-conversational ""Talk to the Left"", a bare electro-punk update on awkward sex jams (""Did he really say, 'Baby, now I'm heading south?'"") from the Au Pairs' ""Come Again"" to Art Brut's ""Rusted Guns of Milan"". ""Cupboard Love"" should get basement crowds belting out requests for W-2 information. You just haven't earned it yet, baby.</p>
<p>Like many of us in our increasingly autistic age, Shrag seek not just physical connections, but to participate in shared culture-- the essence of the English DIY movement. Even when they're talking about their bodies, Shrag use the language of fans. Love Is All-ish sax spree ""Pregnancy Scene"" is the best petulant protest against all our friends growing up and having babies since the Boy Least Likely To's ""Monsters""; the only previously unreleased non-instrumental, ""New Favourites"", obsesses over a clique-changing best mate like she's a once-favorite band; ""Mark E. Smith"" is the indie kid's ""Would you do that if Barack Obama was watching?"". My absolute favorite song here, ""Forty Five 45s"", is a beautifully crafted, basically one-chord wonder sung by a narrator who'd notice every nuance in the mixtapes you give her and then be really fucking pissed when you take off with all her mp3s except Jeff Buckley. You could've at least left the Los Campesinos! zine.</p>
<p>Only connect? Not hardly: ""Different Glue"" grapples with groping strangers who will make you glad you stayed at home tonight. ""Women get hassled at gigs if they're not with a bloke,"" Gang of Four's Jon King told critic Greil Marcus in 1980. The name Shrag, sort of a nice onomatopoeia for the younger group's tough-talking shambling, is also an actual English word that's obsolete. King's statement isn't-- neither is a good fanmade antidote to pop music that's some dying conglomerate's idea of how much self-expression you can handle. Things aren't perfect, but we've come a long way.</p></div>"|12723.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12723-shrag/|7.4|Marc Hogan

That fact has a lot of folks excited about the newcomer, but May is not your typical A.C.-related artist. In fact, on the wide spectrum of musical styles he's probably as far away from labelmates Black Dice and Excepter as, um, David Banner or Taylor Swift.</p>
<p>The Mississippi native offers here a kind of modern-day lounge act-- approaching his material as part sentimentalist, part jokester-- and sings in a manner closely reminiscent of indie pop vocalists like Stephin Merritt and Jens Lekman. May shares those gents' strong grasp of melody (his songs are nothing if not hook-laden) but unlike them he is a strict genre specialist. For this record, at least (allegedly there's a dance project in the works under his Dent Sweat alter ego), he functions entirely within the boundaries of the schmaltzy barroom pop and suburbanized island music of the 1950s and 60s. (""Meet Me in the Garden"", all tiki torches and umbrella drinks, might as well be the soundtrack to a backyard cookout thrown by  <i> Mad Men </i> 's Betty Draper.) Combined with his tongue-in-cheek lyrics, it can be a lot of shtick to swallow at once.</p>
<p>Since it's inseparable from the album's content, one really has to buy into the persona May is selling in order to enjoy  <i> The Good Feeling Music of Dent May and His Magnificent Ukulele </i> . That's much easier to do with a fellow like Jonathan Richman (with whom May shares an innocent-guy outlook and is often compared to), because his naiveté comes across as genuine and is leavened with humor. But May's attempts at winking cultural criticism often undercut his authenticity. On ""College Town Boy"", he awkwardly pokes fun at the academic set, singing, ""Since graduation day he feels like a fraud, he still regrets he never studied abroad."" Yikes. Prompting more winces on ""You Can't Force a Dance Party"", May revisits a hipster get-together gone awry: ""All the way from Brooklyn, Sally came to see me"", he says, but laments spoiling the fun by being ""in the corner reading poetry and prose.""</p>
<p>If you can look past these cringe-inducing moments,  <i> The Good Feeling Music </i> occasionally lives up to its title. One of the record's most charming cuts is ""Oh Paris!"", which finds May doing his best Morrissey atop strumming ukulele (yes, it is omnipresent) and ""shoo-be doo-be"" backing vocals. Just as pleasant is his reverential take on the Four Preps' 1957 classic ""26 Miles (Catalina)"", a wise cover choice since it fits snugly within his aesthetic. Alongside ""Meet Me in the Garden"", these songs represent a sufficiently enjoyable portion of the record. But to compare May again to one of his peers, there's nothing on par with Lekman's ""Black Cab"" or ""Maple Leaves"" here. At this early point in his career, May's tunes, while positively catchy and at times a lot fun, just don't have that kind of depth. They also lack heart, and that seems harder to forgive.</p></div>"|12725.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12725-the-good-feeling-music-of-dent-may-and-his-magnificent-ukulele/|5.5|Joe Colly

It's not a template that typically scores a lesser-known band a whole lot of style points, but pointing the finger at Longwave's most readily identifiable influence is the easy way out. Especially considering the undeniable potency of this shit done right-- Bono may not have the solutions to the world's ailments, but his band sure sounds like they believe they do. No,  <i> Secrets Are Sinister </i> is lame because it solidifies Longwave's position in an identifiable subset of acolytes-- Ours, Athlete, JJ72, and so forth-- that invert the presence of Larry Mullen and Bono to present a supposedly superior U2 that values modesty over any sort of ""pop,"" be it populism or popularity. And while that might seem like a potentially interesting idea,  <i> Secrets Are Sinister </i> comes off bloated  <i> and </i> boring, the work of a band that hardly believes in its own message.</p>
<p>If only Longwave could figure out how to stretch the thrills of ""Sirens in the Deep Sea"" into something that can last longer than the flavor in a wad of Big League Chew. ""Sirens"" isn't a great song or even an original one, but it at least makes an impression. They fire off all their guns at once here-- Steve Schiltz howls falsetto to the championship banners, a guitar solos with honest-to-goodness 32nd-notes, and a twinkly keyboard fills what little empty space is left. So you know that these guys are up to date on their Thatcher rock. Meanwhile, new addition Morgan King plays Kim Deal licks plated with titanium-- you won't hear a bigger bass sound outside of the Bug's  <i> London </i> <i> Zoo. </i></p>
<p>While nearly every track on  <i> Secrets </i> follows that path, a surprisingly bum production job by Peter Katis (the National, Twilight Sad) and David Fridmann renders Longwave merely loud instead of epic. You usually see ""shoegaze"" thrown about, but while the guitar is supposed to envelope like a tidal wave (or maybe their own ""Tidal Wave""), they sound like firehoses here-- direct, narrow, and brutal. Even the palm-muted rising action on ""The Devil and the Liar"" overpowers the vocals, and the relentless distortion of ""Shining Hours"" and ""Life Is Wrong"" add some steak and sizzle to the soggy whitebread of Coldplay's ""Yellow"". But even if you liked that song, since when were you all, ""Turn that shit up!""?</p>
<p>So yeah,  <i> Secrets Are Sinister </i> is a lame album, but not because Longwave never managed to be as cool as any of the early-00s New York bands they were wrongly lumped in with. Hell, in the past three years alone, French Kicks have released more enjoyable records than the Strokes and Interpol combined. No, them problem here is more one of direction.  <i> Secrets </i> has its finger on the pulse of mainstream radio, judging from its oppressive (note how ""oppressive"" almost sounds like ""overly compressed"" when you say it really fast) sonics. But stuck between a tired, nebulously elucidated artistic direction and their own nebulously elucidated commercial aspirations, they just sound a whole lot like the major-label also-rans that they actually are. Even if Longwave probably deserve better, it sucks when the suits are right.</p></div>"|12721.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12721-secrets-are-sinister/|4.8|Ian Cohen

How did these four Irishmen become the blueprint for every band with stadium aspirations? The Edge's churchly guitar chime-- which thrives on the same arena acoustics that can turn otherwise booming bands into mud-- is certainly a factor. So is their weakness for the big gesture-- whether it be a giant lemon, heart, or mouth. And Bono's cathartic mix of modern panacea-- love, God, mass culture-- gives them a reach to the back row and beyond. But, perhaps above all else, the band's restlessness and willingness to challenge both themselves and their patrons is why the Killers, Kanye West, and Coldplay want to be the next U2 and not the next AC/DC. It's why these four Irishmen still represent the punk spirit decades after they emerged from it.  <br/> <br/> ""You've got to balance being relevant and commenting on something that's happening today with trying to attain timelessness,"" philosophized the Edge in the early 1990s. The quote sounds like rock star bullshit...until you realize that's pretty much what U2  <i> did </i> for 20 years. From 1980 to 2000, it was difficult to tell exactly what the next U2 album would sound like. Briefly: They added atmosphere to new wave, looked for God and found hits, exhumed their rock'n'roll heroes, sent-up those same heroes while losing their religion, and punctured pop via mutated techno. Each move was more audacious than the last-- even 1997 knee-jerk victim  <i> Pop </i> saw the world-beating act taking completely unnecessary musical and financial risks in the name of Warholian post-modern pastiche. They then also managed to surprise on 2000's  <i> All That You Can't Leave Behind </i> by successfully returning to form after shrugging off the notion for so many years. But 2004's  <i> How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb </i> and its subsequent tour were troubling.  <br/> <br/> That record saw four guys famous for dabbing classic rock into all sorts of impressionistic frames (or dismantling it entirely via Village People costumes) uncomfortably grasping for old-fashioned riffs, when they weren't mindlessly feasting on their own past. It was completely predictable (""City of Blinding Lights""), canned (""Vertigo""), and depressingly Sting-like (""A Man and a Woman""). But the group did little to hide the fact that they were basking in their early-century comeback's afterglow; in concert, in place of the  <i> ATYCLB </i> tour's heart-shaped runway was a, um, circle-shaped runway. Still self-aware enough to sense stagnation, the quartet began to work on what would become  <i> No Line on the Horizon </i> with new producer Rick Rubin and an imperative to break all those piling U2 trappings once again. As Bono told  <i> The New York Times </i> this week: ""When you become a comfortable, reliable friend, I'm not sure that's the place for rock'n'roll.""  <br/> <br/> Sixteen years ago, U2 worked a snippet of Public Enemy's ""Don't Believe the Hype"" into their technologically prescient Zoo TV tour-- perhaps fans should heed that bit of sampled advice right about now. Because while this group of slick talkers may have set out to expand their own definition once more, they've ended up with old collaborators Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois --along with an album that's neither relevant nor timeless.  <br/> <br/> First single ""Get on Your Boots"" is a worrisome harbinger-- to call it a mess would be generous. The song combines sub-Audioslave riffs with Escape Club's ""Wild Wild West"" and sounds more disjointed than the worst Girl Talk rip off. ""I don't wanna talk about wars between nations-- not right now!"" claims Bono on the song, before extolling the virtues of tight leather boots. His off-the-cuff attitude and delivery suggests a cheekiness missing from U2's music for more than a decade, but it's a red herring. While other tracks like ""I'll Go Crazy If I Don't Go Crazy Tonight"" and ""Stand Up Comedy"" feature knowing lines that examine the singer's faults and hypocrisy, the album is heavy on half-assed word-salad characterizations and the sort of meaningless platitudes Bono used to be so great at (barely) avoiding. And there's a strong theme of resignation running through the record; whereas many classic U2 tracks have come from Bono's struggle with faith and certainty, he seems content to give up agency on songs like ""Moment of Surrender"" and ""Unknown Caller"". ""I've found grace inside a sound,"" he sings on ""Breathe"", and the line seems like a cop-out from a man who spent so much time struggling with salvation.  <br/> <br/> Meanwhile, the album's ballyhooed experimentation is either terribly misguided or hidden underneath a wash of shameless U2-isms (the three-note ring Edge nicks from ""Walk On"" for ""Unknown Caller"", the ""oh oh oh"" outro from ""Stay"" apparently copied and pasted into ""Moment of Surrender"", etc.). While Eno used to work his unique sound-bobbles and ambiance into the fabric of U2 songs, he seems content to offer spacey intros totally disassociated from their accompanying tunes here (see: ""Fez - Being Born"", ""Magnificent""). And oftentimes the band mistakes risk-taking for ill-fated arrangements and decisions. ""Surrender""-- reportedly improvised in one seven-minute take-- comes across as lazy indulgence, and the title track's hard-nosed verse is torpedoed by its deflating fart of a hook. As the go-to sonic innovator of the group, the Edge dials in a particularly dispiriting performance throughout; his rare solos usually pack in enough panache to fill stadiums but his bluesy blah of a spotlight on ""Surrender"" would barely satisfy a single earbud.  <br/> <br/> ""It keeps getting harder. You're playing against yourself and you don't want to lose,"" Adam Clayton told  <i> Q </i> last month. And he's got a point. After nearly 30 years of chart crashing and sell-outs, starting afresh can't be easy. There's only one ""One"". In a way, U2 spoiled their followers by consistently questioning themselves while writing songs that straddled the personal and collective consciousness. But  <i> Horizon </i> is clearly playing not to lose-- it's a defensive gesture, and a rather pitiful one at that.</p></div>"|12730.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12730-no-line-on-the-horizon/|4.2|Ryan Dombal

With their city then under the indie rock microscope, Malajube (still say it MAL-a-zhoob) scanned as yet more ramshackle hyper-pop, language less a  <i> barrier </i> than a Dungen-esque point of difference-- when it counted, say on the hook to commercial-bait standout ""Montréal -40°C"", these inaugural Polaris Music Prize nominees sounded no more francophone than, I dunno, Electric Light Orchestra. Media hype now gone home, Malajube up the labyrinthine stakes on  <i> Labyrinthes </i> , daring re-entry. It's not for the faint of heart-- or the fain to double back.</p>
<p>How do you say ""gone all prog""  <i> en français </i> ? The change is as much context as content-- multipart  <i> Trompe </i> mini-epics ""La Monogamie"" and ""Le Crabe"" already were reminiscent of contemporaries such as Mew-- but jarring structural changes are the norm on  <i> Labyrinthes </i> , suggesting Malajube's former ""progressive emo jam band"" MySpace descriptor may have been more apt than absurd. Six-minute opener ""Ursuline"" boldly announces the new approach-- and, if you understand the submerged lyrics (or read the interviews), the Catholicism/mortality-minded lyrical themes-- as blistering guitar solos, chopsy drumming, and portentous chants descend upon a placid piano intro, leaving only church bells in their wake. Juxtapositions juice a couple of the best songs: ""Casablanca"", which veers from hazy Tropicália-tinged pop to a fleet-fingered guitar coda, and ""333"", all gallops and screeches and echoes except when its inner ""Dust in the Wind"" breaks out.</p>
<p>Where Malajube fall flat, it's not due to complexity, but grim reality: Comedy rarely translates well. Jerry Lewis, anyone? ""It's good to have humor in music too,"" drummer Francis Mineau, lead singer Julien Mineau's brother, told the  <i> National Post </i> . The most immediately accessible tracks here-- spiky video selection ""Porté Disparu"", with its Ed Wood-worthy synth line, or the harmony- and piano-driven ""Luna""-- translate as light-hearted whether you know that ""Les Collemboles"" refers to eating bugs someday or just like to hum along with its call-and-response chorus. The more sinister ""Le Tout-Puissant"" and ""Cristobald"" convey instrumental prowess and grandiosity, sure, but I could use a pie in the face (OK, the closing growls  <i> almost </i> count). So although  <i> Labyrinthes </i> further establishes Malajube as French Canadians worth following, this time you may not make it far enough to save your brother from the Goblin King.</p></div>"|12727.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12727-labyrinthes/|6.4|Marc Hogan

But where those albums-- banjo-centric and cast with Temple's delicately high-pitched voice-- situated him firmly in the realm of borderline-precious indie folkies like Sufjan Stevens and Danielson,  <i> Here We Go Magic </i> works with a different form of alchemy. Four-tracked and supposedly cut in ""a two-month period of stream-of-consciousness recording,"" the album filters Temple's psychedelic muse through a much more muted palette: hazy electronic textures, endlessly-spiraling lyrical loops, occasional forays into extended sections of ambience and noise. The title itself indicates that Here We Go Magic might just be a spur-of-the-moment lark between more polished works, but its best points suggest we should only encourage Temple to mess around more in his off-time.</p>
<p>The old-timey waltz ""Everything's Big"" closes  <i> Magic </i> as both a reminder of the first two records and a neat index of the prevailing themes of the current effort: winsome, romantic philosophizing distilled to its very essence, with Temple agape, staring down the immensity of his existence. Opener ""Only Pieces"" has Temple singing a mantra about mortality awareness (""What's the use in dyin', dyin', if I don't know when?"") in a lo-fi wash of xylophone, clip-clopping percussion, and acoustic guitar. If it sounds like a field recording of a ca. 1971 Paul Simon acid trip, it's as much kismet as intent: Temple's vocals throughout the album are cast with a sense of boyish wonder that suggests Simon, but that's only because it's how a lot of young guys sound when they're confronting the enormity of the Big Questions.</p>
<p>The gentle abruptness of ""Only Pieces""' conclusion-- it just quietly fades away-- is indicative of Magic on the whole: we don't get proper endings, but brief interruptions in what seem like transmissions straight from Temple's unconscious.  The best bits of Magic are, like ""Pieces"", wispy and repetitive, emerging fully formed, drifting about for a bit, then disappearing. On ""I Just Want to See You Underwater"", Temple blanches his voice to Perry Farrell territory, and cycles through that phrase alone, mantra-like, as if it matters not to him that anyone actually hears it. All of ""Tunnelvision""s woozy vigor is also contained in Temple's undulating vocals, which glide effortlessly between notes over a backing of hiccupping guitars and the comforting sound of drumsticks on a guitar case. The result is a bedroom-folk ""Knives Out"", which is a good thing. ""Fangela"", the best and most fully realized track, is where clip-clopping percussion and handclaps share space with glimmering synth flecks, over which Temple's voice offers sympathetic counsel. Only swatches of the lyrics are intelligible (""Look at me,"" ""Feast your eyes,"" ""All is yours"") but that's part of the enchantment of magic: A fleeting glimpse of something that might have been transcendent, leaving our minds to fill in what we didn't quite see.</p>
<p>By definition, interior monologues are self-indulgent, and entrancing as it can be at its peaks, 11 minutes of Magic's brief 38 are taken with that trendiest of current indie tropes, the ambient/noise interstitial. Deerhunter, No Age, and Women have all found different ways to let the hiss take over, but Temple doesn't seem to have the same innate knack for this stuff (maybe I'm being too idealistic, but Temple seems too good-natured to simply broadcast white noise), and those moments combine to drag the album down a bit. More specifically, those bits suffer in comparison to those other 27 minutes of Magic: a sculpted version of that same disarming din, with a compassionate interpreter telling us what we're seeing.</p></div>"|12724.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12724-here-we-go-magic/|7.4|Eric Harvey

When Glasgow's Bis laid down their ""Teen-C Revolution"" manifesto in the mid-1990s, a vague but confrontational screed against fascists, homophobes, and adults, they put an expiration date on their band. But if their lyrics hadn't made it explicit, their music-- a mix of playground taunts, synths, and guitars-- would have spoken the same manifesto. You can trace a crayon line from Bis to young, shouting, dancing bands like the Gossip and Los Campesinos!. And so, a decade and a half years later, and on her first solo record, Bis singer and keyboard player Amanda MacKinnon (still using her Bis stage name Manda Rin) finds herself trying to catch up to bands that were, no doubt, influenced by Bis. She experiments with variations on the bright, kandy pop that Bis perfected and finds a more nuanced form of rebellion, but she can't find the reinvention she needs.</p>
<p>Shedding the shackles of Bis probably sounds ridiculous when most Americans have probably never heard of the band. In America the band are best known for writing the end credits song to ""The Powerpuff Girls"". But in 1996, the band played ""Top of the Pops"" before they even had a record deal-- the first group ever to do so. They released three albums and numerous EPs on the Beastie Boys' Grand Royal label here and the Delgados' Chemikal Underground imprint in Europe-- and sold 100,000 copies of their debut album in Japan.</p>
<p>Straight off, it's easier to see her connections to Bis rather than her defection. MacKinnon is in cartoon form on  <i> My DNA' </i> s cover, just as she was on many of Bis' EPs. But it shows her staring solemnly into a mirror at her real reflection, still wearing her trademark hair barrettes, but definitely looking more mature. On ""Tell It to the Kids"" Bis bragged that Manda Rin used her ""childlike appearance"" as a weapon-the  <i> My DNA </i> cover shows her older and a bit defenseless.</p>
<p><i> My DNA </i> tries on different variations of dance pop: disco, electro, even glassy Scandinavian dance. Sometimes these songs work: The title track's laserbeam keyboards and rubbery bassline are brash and fun enough to make up for Manda Rin's more subdued vocals. She's less relenting on ""The Word Out"", where her chants (""Did you ever write the perfect song/ Did you ever say sorry to who you should"") serve as cheerleaders for the song's ripsaw guitars. Manda Rin reaches for icy pop princess sheen on ""Love to Hate You"". Her voice can't support the tension. It aims for delicate but comes off thin. While the new tonal and rhythmic palette betrays desire to branch out, the results show more courage, but less confidence than her material with Bis.</p>
<p>Bis were never subtle, but MacKinnon wants more nuance and less shouting on  <i> My DNA </i> . She takes issue with issues like body acceptance (""Less Than Zero""), abuse (""Bruises"") and relationships (""Break-Up/Breakdown"").

After it tanked, Flash shifted his focus to become a highly in-demand touring DJ, which wasn't the worst career move: His status as a musical icon is indelible in any case, and some of the mixes he released-- like 2002's b-boy break/scratch showcase  <i> The Official Adventures of Grandmaster Flash </i> or 1997's disco mix  <i> Salsoul Jam 2000 </i> (re-released in 2005 as  <i> Mixing Bullets and Firing Joints </i> )-- are essential for anyone who likes old-school hip-hop.</p>
<p>But while I won't begrudge Flash for wanting to get back into the studio and reassert his place in the hip-hop pantheon, maybe we should all agree to pretend that  <i> The Bridge </i> doesn't actually exist. Expecting a great, sonically relevant album in 2009 from one of the few hip-hop artists to get pressed on wax 30 years ago might be a bit naïve-- especially when the artist in question hasn't dropped a full-length album of original beats since the Reagan administration-- but it's  <i> Flash </i> , dammit, the man who personified the DJ for an entire generation. How could he have a hand in anything so sub-par?</p>
<p>The reason is simple: he's trying to be something he's never been. The production of  <i> The Bridge </i> sounds like it came out of an extended catch-up session, the work of a man best accustomed to the breakbeat era's techniques trying his hand at the last ten years' worth of club-rap digitalism. That's why there's almost no samples on this album-- and, alarmingly enough, a severe dearth of actual scratching and cutting, aside from the interlude-length track ""Zuka the Sound"" and the clusterfuck ""Here Comes My DJ"", which features DJ Kool and DJ Demo and a lot of sub-Khaled yelling. ""Tribute to the Breakdancer"" is the only other track that sounds like it has some connection to the old-school continuum Flash helped establish, and it's such a fossilized, half-hearted remember-the-80s cliché that it marks the first time I've actually rolled my eyes when the immortal ""Apache"" break popped up.</p>
<p>The rest of the album is built on a foundation of flat-sounding synths and stylistic confusion: fluffy faux-Soulquarians (""Shine All Day""; ""Grown &amp; Sexy""), tinny, stagger-step pretend-Timbaland (""Bounce Back""), club-pop beats that Fergie would have to think for a minute or two about before green-lighting (""Those Chix""), and a number of post- Mary J. Rap&amp;B sounds that could've been constructed any time in the last 15 years (""Unpredictable""; ""Swagger"").   <span> </span> ""  <span> Oh Man </span> ""  <span> , the album-closing showcase for Natacha Atlas and MySpace find Syndee, is the least tone-deaf track on the album </span> --  <span> and it </span> '  <span> s essentially just straight-up house music. I don </span> '  <span> t doubt for a moment that Flash has kept his ear to the streets at every opportunity over the last several years, but this kind of thing just doesn </span> '  <span> t play to his strengths. </span></p>
<p>The guest list bears some of the blame for  <i> The Bridge </i> 's failings, too, though it's a bit of a disappointing surprise how perfunctory some of these legends sound. Q-Tip's verse on ""Shine All Day"" tries to extend the love vibes of  <i> The Renaissance </i> and comes up with Hallmark mawkishness (""ominous clouds come and get dreary/when you're around though, girl, I'm never weary""), Snoop Dogg's pimp-autopilot verse on ""Swagger"" isn't passable enough to endure Lynn Carter's syrupy, pitch-corrected hook for, and if you were geeked to find out that Big Daddy Kane shows up twice on this album, keep in mind it's ladies-man Kane and not best-MC-ever-candidate Kane. KRS-One comes closest to surprising, taking the potentially didactic world-without-hip-hop scenario of ""What If"" and, after stating that an entire culture would be poorer without it, admitting that criminal culture wouldn't be as widely celebrated either. Inner conflict? In  <i> my </i> nostalgia trip?</p>
<p><span> Flash does deserve some credit for giving some relative unknowns a chance to shine on a record with </span> hip-hop'  <span> s most legendary DJ on the cover, though it says something that the most intriguing-sounding of the album </span> '  <span> s obscure MCs </span> --  <span> Sweden </span> '  <span> s Afasi, Spain </span> '  <span> s Kase-O, Japan </span> '  <span> s Maccho, and Senegal </span> '  <span> s Abass, who liven up </span> ""  <span> We Speak </span> hip-hop""--  <span> don </span> '  <span> t even rap in English. The notion that Flash is an international ambassador of </span> hip-hop--  <span> and a man who escaped the meat grinder of pop music </span> '  <span> s disposable star culture to make it as an independently-operating veteran-- means a lot more than his ability to get behind the boards and crank out some generic club bangers. Weak as   <i> The Bridge </i> is, it </span> '  <span> s not even remotely enough to damage his legacy or his true skills on the wheels of steel. </span></p></div>"|12726.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12726-the-bridge-concept-of-a-culture/|3.5|Nate Patrin

In 1999, they were riding a wave of creativity the likes of which most bands can only dream about. In the year prior they'd released both <i>Super Roots 7</i>, which on better days sounds like the final word on the visceral power of rock'n'roll repetition, and <i>Super Ae</i>, on which they revealed themselves as masters of playful trance-inducing psychedelia with spiritual underpinnings. And they were about to put out <i>Vision Creation Newsun</i>, boasting a gentler but no less immediate vision that seemed, especially after Yamantaka Eye's <i>Rebore Vol. 0</i> re-working a bit later, to suggest that the musical possibilities in the decade to follow would be endless. All of this came after 10 previous years of painful noise, bad punk, hilarious song titles, pointless screams, and occasionally unmatched rock power. You couldn't pin this band down.</p>
<p>But in the decade since <i>Vision Creation Newsun</i>, Boredoms have interrupted long periods of quiet with absurdly grand gestures (the 77 Boadrum and 88 Boadrum events) and a couple of records that referenced or expanded upon past glories but never came close to matching them. <i>Seadrum/House of Sun</i>, from 2005, had two 20-minute-plus tracks that were not nearly as beautiful as the advance word made them sound, even if they managed to summon inspiring amounts of energy. (We heard talk of Eye leading his percussion-toting followers to the edge of the sea to record, conjuring images of the greatest drum-circle jams since the twilight of the Pleistocene.) And then 2007's <i>Super Roots 9</i> was a 40-minute monster for drummers and pitch-shifted choir that took one thing the Boredoms did well-- gradual builds to ecstatic climaxes-- and let it play out forever. Tracks going on for far too long filled with ideas that were beaten into the ground 10 times over has always been part of the band's M.O. But when releases are so rare, they don't serve the same prankster function that they once did. Now it kind of sounds more like the Boredoms doing that one thing the Boredoms do. Again.</p>
<p>Which, if you happen to freaking <i>love</i> that one thing, isn't so terrible. A new Boredoms release is still an event, even if you no longer feel the need to rush out and tell all your friends about it. <i>Super Roots 10</i> snuck up on people when it appeared for sale on a website in Japan earlier this year (by which time it was already sold out-- I'm reviewing this from downloaded mp3s). It is, with one huge exception I'll get to in a second, just the Boredoms being their post-<i>VCN</i> drum-happy, DayGlo-streaked, build-up-and-breakdown selves. After a short intro of bassy static, we hear a track called ""Ant 10"", which exists in a nine and a half-minute original mix and is then spun off into four different remixes that mostly flow one into the next. So it turns out to be essentially another 40+-minute track. The main features of the original version are layered tribal drums, an analog synth out of early-70s Tangerine Dream running scales, and Eye, sounding as joyful as ever, singing/shouting /chanting ""Ah-u!"" and ""Hey!!!"" and layering his voice in all sorts of fun ways. Toward the end there's some tape manipulation and huge cymbal-rushes, and then everything breaks down to silence, leading into ""Estero 10"", a remix by Japanese producer Altz.</p>
<p>The Altz remixes (another of his called ""Mineral Dub Break"" closes) and a remix by someone called DJ Finger Hat (my guess is it's Eye, which would be pseudonym number 1,328) offer an expected range of theme and variations-- drums get a bit housey, voices are extended into drones, Yoshimi's voice is added and layered to sound a little like an interlude from <i>Einstein on the Beach</i>, a guitar pattern is chopped into tiny pieces and sequenced. Even though it's now become so familiar and-- hate to say it-- formulaic, this stuff still has the capacity to thrill.</p>
<p>The huge exception to the Boredoms-by-numbers feel is the almost 11-minute mix of ""Ant 10"" by Lindstrøm. The Norwegian producer essentially takes his space disco approach and toughens it up considerably to meet the forward-leaning aggression of Boredoms. Heavy drums find their way to a 4/4 beat augmented by all manner of percussion fills, a Moog sounds for a moment like it's playing the intro to the title theme from <i>Grease</i>, a rubbery funk bassline for the ages folds in, and ""Superstition""-style Clavinet starts bouncing around. There are a million things going on, but it still grooves. Long-time Pitchfork contributor Dominique Leone, who reviewed the last couple of Boredoms releases here and released material last year on Lindstrøm's Feedelity imprint, even drops by, adding some ""Bow bow bow"" vocals at the precise moment they're needed. Even if Lindstrøm's remix is 90% Lindstrøm's and 10% Boredoms, the change-up is hugely welcome. It's like all of a sudden Boredoms find themselves in the middle of a crazy party, where someone left the front door open and you've no idea who is going to wander in next. Time was when all Boredoms get-togethers felt that way.</p></div>"|12715.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12715-super-roots-10/|7.6|Mark Richardson

Because it has less musical than conceptual cohesion (and sometimes neither), it plays as if on shuffle, one song by one act leading to another song by another act and making no demand on a listener's attention greater than three or four minutes. If/When the album finally surrenders to the single as the primary product of the music industry, various artists comps-- whether tribute albums, charity collections, or soundtracks-- will likely continue to haunt the periphery of the industry, like ghosts of the CD age. Worth at most a listen or two, most have a few solid tracks mixed in with failed experiments or dull B-sides, but usually they're panned as driven more by marketing or good intentions than by solid musical ideas.</p>
<p>A good example of possibilities of the form, the 15-track <i>Heroes</i> certainly benefits a good cause: <a href=""http://www.warchild.org/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><b>War Child</b></a> works globally to protect children living in war zones. On top of that, it has an intriguing organizing premise, an approach that sets it apart from others of its ilk. It's a covers album, but rather than pick 15 contemporary artists and have them choose their songs, <i>Heroes</i> takes the opposite tack: The producers asked older artists to pick younger artists to cover their songs. Bob Dylan picked Beck, and wise choice: He turns ""Leopard-Skin Pillbox Hat"" into a <i>Guero</i> stomp-- part T. Rex glam, part Spike Jones noise fest, and nearly unrecognizable from the original. U2 commission Elbow to cover ""Running to Stand Still"", one of the few<i> Joshua Tree</i> tracks that doesn't have U2 stamped all over it. The cover moves more slowly, but with a more psychedelic goal as the band stretch out the coda until it nearly stands still.</p>
<p>There are, almost out of obligation, some unimaginative pairings. The Kinks' ""Victoria"" gets covered by the Kooks, which means it's pretty much the same song, and of course Iggy Pop hires former duet partner Peaches to go down on ""Search &amp; Destroy"", which sounds no better, no worse, and no different than you'd imagine. But obvious choices don't always breed obvious results. Estelle turns in what sounds at first like a pretty straight cover of Stevie Wonder's ""Superstition"". It's not much of a stretch, but she starts scat-singing the horn line, threads in some wakkachikka guitar, and gives her version its own character.</p>
<p>Other pairings are much less obvious and either more satisfying or more puzzling. Duffy transforms Wings' ""Live and Let Die"" into a smoky soul number about the curdling of youthful idealism, opting for seductive rather than ominous or threatening. She even corrects Paul McCartney's infamous grammatical gaffe (""this ever-changing world which we live in,"" she sings with a copyeditor's eye), but I wish she didn't mewl over her consonants: Crisper enunciation might have turned a novelty into a solid reimagining. Rufus Wainwright has better luck choreographing Brian Wilson's ""Wonderful"" and ""Song for Children"" into a charming, droll stage medley, complete with muted trumpets and skipping piano. On their airy cover of ""Transmission"", Hot Chip hang Christmas lights and steel drums on the gloomy despair of the original, no doubt pissing off a lot of Joy Division fans in the process. However, because Alexis Taylor can sound simultaneously downcast and upbeat, this cover retains a kernel of melancholy angst.</p>
<p>Other acts on <i>Heroes</i> play a game of what if, exhibiting a deep and playful knowledge of their subjects' histories. What if Bowie had flown west instead of east and recorded in New York rather than Brooklyn? He might have come up with a version of ""Heroes"" as busy and flightless as TV on the Radio's? What if Sheena herself sang ""Sheena Is a Punk Rocker""? It'd no doubt sound like the Yeah Yeah Yeahs' cover, which is infectious (""What is she, Joey??!!"" Karen O shouts) despite never veering too far from the original. And what if Springsteen had turned those <i>Nebraska</i> demos into an E Street Band album? What if Clarence Clemons had played sax and Roy Bittan had played piano on the central riff of ""Atlantic City""? The Hold Steady may seem like an obvious choice to cover the Boss, but that mantra-- ""Everything dies, that's a fact / Maybe everything that does some day comes back""-- converges nicely with the Catholic imagery of <i>Separation Sunday</i>. And that's the point of V/A comps like this-- well, beyond the pint of raising money and awareness for a worthy cause. It's about hearing your favorite acts in new contexts and discovering new currents of influence between the veterans and the rookies.</p></div>"|12716.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12716-war-child-presents-heroes/|7.0|Stephen M.

Mali alone is home to so many spectacular musicians it boggles the mind. There's so much myth and mystery swirling about Mali that it's just as easy to discount the hype surrounding any specific artist as it is to take the country's impressive cadre and caliber of musicians for granted.</p>
<p>Of course, Rokia Traoré didn't decide where she would be born. But being born in Mali instantly puts her in the same musical circle as acts as diverse as the late Ali Farke Touré, Amadou and Mariam, Salif Keita, Toumani Diabaté, and Tinariwren-- all established West African superstars. Yet if many of Mali's great acts have musical roots that stretch back decades or even centuries, Traoré represents something of an anomaly. The privileged (by ethnic birthright) daughter of a diplomat, Traoré gravitated toward music independently, as a college student, and that same sense of independence has imbued her music with a special quality that sets it apart from that of many of her erstwhile peers.</p>
<p>Traoré's outlook has always been notably international in scope, not through compromise-- she sings primarily in Bamana, after all-- but in ambition. While still firmly allied to Mali, Traoré has accepted many opportunities to broaden her own musical palette. In 2006, she premiered an original piece in Vienna as part of a celebration of Mozart's 250th birthday. In 2005, she took part in a tour alongside the likes of Dianne Reeves paying tribute to Billie Holiday. Her 2004 release <i>Bowmboï</i> featured contributions from the Kronos Quartet and drew comparisons to Björk, one presumes not because Traoré's sounds like Björk (she doesn't) but because the two artists share a certain singularity of purpose.</p>
<p>Traoré's latest, <i>Tchamantché</i>, proceeds from a similar singularity of purpose, namely the sound of her Gretsch guitar. Indeed, <i>Tchamantché</i> is a guitar album, albeit a guitar album of a particularly understated bent. Engineered by the legendary Phill Brown (whose credits stretch from Bob Marley to Talk Talk), the album is hauntingly spare yet ridiculously well-defined, the timbre and tone of every string presented in perfect resolution, the occasional accompaniment of a rhythm section or Sly Johnson's human beatbox reserved but wholly effective.</p>
<p>Yet sharing top billing with those guitar tones is Traoré's voice, powerful without over-projecting, forcing you to meet her halfway rather than wait passively for her to bowl you over. Singing in Bamanan, French, and (in one conspicuous instance) English, Traoré weaves poetic declarations of love, of Africa, of pride. ""Tounka"", in fact, is the rare anti-immigration screed directed toward the potential émigré from their perspective. ""Are we not rich in Congo-Zaire? Are we not rich in Nigeria? Are we not rich in Mali?"" she asks. ""Say no to exodus.""</p>
<p>Other tracks are more deeply philosophical. In the aptly titled ""Zen"" Traoré acquiesces to the passage of time with the declaration that ""Day after day, I will afford myself the pleasure of doing nothing."" In the title track, she observes that ""We arrive in this world somewhere between the past and future,"" and that ""balance lies in relativity.""  And then, in the midst of all this solemnity and heaviness (which ultimately needs no translation), Traoré drops an English cover of Gershwin's (by way of Holiday's) ""The Man I Love"", which she first performed as a duet with Reeves and here is sung in accented English, a testament to the borderless nature of all great music.</p>
<p>An artist of less integrity might have recorded an entire album of Holiday songs, or more songs sung in English, but Traoré doesn't seem inclined to go that route. There's no need to pander, since the same qualities that make that cover so special flow throughout <i>Tchamantché</i>, namely those gorgeous guitar tones and Traoré's quiet vocals. These twin strands of transnational DNA-- guitar plus vocals-- wend through all music, but here they're made more entrancing by Traoré's refusal to abandon her roots while at the same time working subtly but assiduously to build upon them.</p></div>"|12708.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12708-tchamantche/|8.4|Joshua Klein

But if Cobra Verde's eternally youthful swagger belies their almost two-decade pedigree, the story of the band's sixth album provided a sad reminder that you can't be a kid forever-- upon its initial completion in summer of 2007, frontman John Petkovic was forced to care for his cancer-stricken mother, who passed away that December. The album, and the band, were put on ice for over a year-- during which Petkovic through suffered severe, prolonged bouts of insomnia.</p>
<p>So that album title is no exaggeration. But if the songs contained within predate Petkovic's breakdown, they suggest that, even before his familial trauma, the singer was well-accustomed to an after-hours regimen of strip clubs and booze. Cobra Verde's music has always simmered with nocturnal menace and seedy suggestion, but on <i>Haven't Slept All Year</i>, there's a greater awareness of the price for staying up all night: Having to make amends in the morning. The result is an album plays out in a binary sequence of comically over-the-top drunk-rock benders and sincere, open-hearted pleas for forgiveness.</p>
<p>But until the morning comes, Cobra Verde are happy to appeal to the most base-ic of instincts: ""Entourage""-approved opener ""World Can't Have Her"" is essentially a rewrite of AC/DC's ""Girls Got Rhythm"". But as certified students of rock'n'roll mythology (Petkovic is a journalist by trade; guitarist Frank Vazzano teaches pop-music history at Cleveland State University), Cobra Verde project a keen self-awareness: the Clash-city rocker ""Riot in the Food Court"" climaxes with a deadpan declaration of ""I'm in love with strippers on drugs,"" while the Replacements-styled nightclub jitters of ""Wasted Again"" carry the admission that ""drinking songs are so typical."" The implication is that Cobra Verde aren't playing around with hard-rock conventions merely for populist appeal and easy soundtrack money, but because it's precisely the sort of music that you'd hear blaring in the peeler bars and neon-lit corner dives that Petkovic's protagonists inhabit.</p>
<p>Cobra Verde also realize their ""drunken sex addict"" anti-heroes are not the sort of people you want to spend an entire album hanging out with-- particularly when they start leaning too heavily on the bar-band swing (""I Could Go to Hell for You""). So for every time Petkovic is called on to play the sleazeball, there's a chance to redeem himself as the sweetheart, and for the band to apply the more expansive approach that marked 2005's <i>Copycat Killers</i> all-covers collection: ""Home in the Highrise"" colors in its sketch of skyscraper-living sterility with rich Byrdsian harmonies; the turn-a-new-leaf anthems ""Something About the Bedroom"" and ""Run Away"" outfit Pavement with skinny ties and keytars. By penultimate acoustic ballad ""Can't Believe"", Petkovic is seeking forgiveness for all his sins-- á la Lou Reed on the Velvets' ""Jesus""-- from a god he doesn't believe in, at which point he's sentenced to an afterlife in the ""Haunted Heavens,"" where he's surrounded by devils and dead lovers, but where-- judging by the pristine jangle-pop presentation-- they're spinning the Flamin' Groovies for all eternity. In light of Petkovic's annus miserablis, that's the kind of hell he can certainly deal with.</p></div>"|12710.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12710-havent-slept-all-year/|7.0|Stuart Berman

They've excelled at the kind of head-bobbing tunes you'd expect from the Kindercore record label and, starting with their self-titled 2003 album, they also essayed the sort of enjoyable grrl-fronted rock that could fit right into a playlist between ""Seether"" and ""Bright Yellow Gun"". Throughout, Tammy Ealom's brash and giddy charm coupled with the group's way with a melody often won out over any objections. When they were not so good, Dressy Bessy exemplified what many would consider most obnoxious about both indiepop culture (the fetishistic and pointless appropriation of greasy kid stuff) and Ye Olde Elephant 6 collective (the fetishistic and pointless appropriation of 1960s psych-pop sounds and signifiers).  But if the group could be accused of  rubbing their pigtails in everyone's faces, even the grumpiest Gus would at the very least begrudge them their often inescapable hooks.</p>
<p>But that would be before the group's latest album, <i>Holler and Stomp</i>. It's a 13-song journey through a world where Dressy Bessy turns themselves into everything critics thought they were-- amateurish, tuneless, puerile, purveyors of the sort of ""catchy"" songs that spring the CDC into action.  It's as if the group chose to stoop to and limbo beneath the subterranean lows established by the awful cover portrait (with all due apologies to fans of the ""airbrushed street scene festooned with MS Paint graffiti and Oscar the Grouch trash cans"" school of artistry).  Some might be more generous, but there are only two tunes that stand out from this mess for their non-awfulness.  The album's nominal single, ""Simple Girlz"", features a sassy multi-tracked Ealom kicking up her walking boots in the general direction of shiftless dudes looking for easy breezy ladyfriends.   The other track is ""Left to the Right"", a stop-start number where Dressy Bessy, which to this point of the album comes off as existing somewhere between ""listless"" and ""inert,"" sound like they're actually enjoying what they're playing. There's more than a bit of irony to be had, though, with Ealom repeatedly singing the line ""Gimme something to sing"" in a song that's all the better for keeping her singing to a minimum.</p>
<p>Even the most casual listener would notice a change between Ealom's voice over the years-- her girlish chirp from the group's early days has developed a little husk and heft, making her sound not unlike Kim or Kelley Deal.  On most of <i>Holler and Stomp</i>, unfortunately, she sounds like a Deal sister looking for a melody and a paper sack.  It's bad enough that the songs, separate from the vocals, are pretty weak-- if the tunes on turds like ""Ease Me Down"" or ""Anyone Can See"" aren't bad enough, the use of cheesy Casio trumpets (on the former) or a rinky-dink drum machine (on the latter) make sure this shit stinks.  Then Ealom shows up, slightly out of step with the songs in question, singing melodies she's seemingly forgotten tied to lyrics that are best left forgotten.  Her performances comes off as awkward karaoke, and it's even worse when it comes on songs like ""Automatic"" or ""Sindy Says"" that superficially resemble what the group's done in the past (and done better).  If the future promises to bring more moments where Tammy Ealom croaks ""I want to steal your candy"" like a nic-fitted Wicked Witch, then it's probably time for folks to stow Dressy Bessy in the attic.</p></div>"|12713.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12713-holler-and-stomp/|2.9|David Raposa

Alas, they frequently end poorly, entering the world as collections of outtakes, abandoned ideas, and  uninspired covers. Whether that matters is another thing: If you share Natalie Portman's interest in the value of microcredit, or any number of executive producers' hope for more Darfur awareness or money for Doctors Without Borders, getting a decent Death Cab song or Afrobeat comp should simply be a bonus ""thank you"" for your minimal contribution.</p>
<p>For 20 years, the Red Hot Organization has been-- along with War Child, more on them in the upcoming days-- the gold standard for the charity album. Battling HIV and AIDS via pop culture, Red Hot came out of the gate with an eclectic winner, the Cole Porter covers record <i>Red Hot + Blue</i> (1990). Most of our readers are likely more familiar with their 1993 <i>No Alternative</i> disc, which collected tracks from Nirvana, Sonic Youth, Pavement, and others. Two decades later, they follow with <i>Dark Was the Night</i>, a collection of 31 new and exclusive songs from most of the heavy hitters of the NPR-friendly wing of indie music.</p>
<p>Produced by Red Hot, along with the National's Bryce and Aaron Dessner, the vast majority of the songs on this collection are worth owning regardless of where the money is going. The first of the two CDs, in particular, is full of gems. David Byrne and Dirty Projectors keep their vocal affectations on the right side of awesome on ""Knotty Pine""; Feist adeptly teams with Death Cab's Ben Gibbard on a cover of Vashti Bunyan's ""Train Song"" and later slow burns through the outstanding Grizzly Bear collaboration ""Service Bell""; and both Yeasayer's nimble ""Tightrope"" and My Brightest Diamond's smoky version of ""Feeling Good"" are eyebrow-raising lateral moves.</p>
<p>A few things that looked a bit too on-the-nose on paper turn out to work: Bon Iver, in the process of breaking away from the lazy ""guy in a Wisconsin cabin"" narrative, delivers a song about... a small town in Wisconsin; the Books, a half-cello, half-electronics duo, and José González, a Nick Drake-like singer-songwriter still best known for his covers, get together to do Nick Drake's ""Cello Song""; Kronos Quartet boldly transform Blind Willie Johnson's gut-wrenching, crucifixion-inspired 1927 blues moan ""Dark Was the Night, Cold Was the Ground"" (the track that gives the comp its name) into a chamber ensemble piece.</p>
<p>Not to be outdone by their invitees, the National shout-out Pavement on the languid ""So Far Around the Bend"", recalling Pavement doing the same to one of their favorite bands (R.E.M.) on <i>No Alternative</i>. Aaron Dessner pairs with Bon Iver for one of the record's several ghostly tracks, ""Big Red Machine"", while brother Bryce goes one better, teaming with Antony Hegarty to cover Bob Dylan's take of the traditional ballad ""I Was Young When I Left Home"". Antony in particular shines, giving it a somber matter-of-fact reading that lends the entire song, not just the purgatory of its final verse, a note of tragedy.</p>
<p>Disc One saves its best for last though: Sufjan Stevens breaks his relative silence with a cover of the Castanets' ""You Are the Blood"", scrapping his baroque preciousness for tactile avant-pop. Infusing the track with a twitchy, restless quality, Stevens re-imagines the song-- musically as well as lyrically-- as a tussle between the subject and his body, an appropriately haunting quality for this compilation. (Buck 65's remix, ""Blood Pt. 2"", isn't as successful.) Stevens teams a more cacophonous version of his traditional arsenal of horns and choral vocals with the sort of minimalist electronics he leaned more heavily on in the days before he earned indie-level fame.</p>
<p>Disc Two is more of a mixed bag. Spoon kick it off with a badly needed injection of rhythm; their ""Well-Alright"" feels like the jaunty bar-bandisms that used to soundtrack National Lampoon films-- think ""I'm Alright"" or ""Holiday Road"". Arcade Fire follow with a similar but less-interesting version of the same idea. From there things oscillate between meh and engaging, with quality contributions from the New Pornographers (covering one of their bandmate Dan Bejar's Destroyer songs), Yo La Tengo, Riceboy Sleeps (featuring members of Sigur Rós), and Conor Oberst with Gillian Welch.</p>
<p>Standing out even more positively, My Morning Jacket's laid-back ""El Caporal"" and Sharon Jones and the Dap-Kings' swivel-hipped Shuggie Otis cover ""Inspiration Information"" bring warmth to the proceedings; Belle and Sebastian's Stuart Murdoch-- one of the few non-North Americans here-- adds lyrics to an old Scottish folk song, and the resulting ""Another Saturday"" is one more quiet triumph for him in a career full of them. Best in class on this disc, however, goes to TV on the Radio's Dave Sitek, whose version of the Troggs' ""With a Girl Like You"" is like a Stephin Merritt pastiche with horns grafted onto it, but it's glorious because of, rather than despite, its obvious homage.</p>
<p>I confess though: My first reaction to listening to this all the way through was negative. When focusing on what's not here rather than what is, <i>Dark Was the Night</i> comes off as a gray, monotone look at the current indie landscape and, as a result, works best in small batches. It's missing not only rhythm and electronics-- more hip-hop, anything in the DFA axis, M.I.A., Animal Collective, etc.-- but volume and velocity as well. Sure, it's a charity record not a party soundtrack, but <i>No Alternative</i> was full of actual rock songs. On this evidence, today's guitar-based indie is primarily folkie tunefulness, baroque lines in which the guitar is subservient to other instruments, or, based on the original Simon Reynolds definition of the word, post-rock: ""Using rock instrumentation for non-rock purposes, using guitars as facilitators of timbre and textures rather than riffs and power chords.""</p>
<p>Dissecting the reasons for this and determining the consequences, if any, is another matter altogether, but it's a shame that the diversity of previously successful charity comps-- the Red Hot ones mentioned, War Child's <i>The Help Album</i>-- is missing here. Naturally these artists are more popular than their experimental, electronic, and rock brethren-- Gang Gang Dance, Air France, or No Age would sell fewer records than the Decemberists on any day of the week-- but the idea that rock is less central than folk music in underground North American music is not only really weird but a very new phenomenon. Again though, these songs are uniformally excellent, so it's a minor and possibly misplaced quibble. And, who knows, maybe-- hopefully!-- Red Hot is in the process of asking the Hold Steady or Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Hot Chip or the Knife, to help craft sequels.</p></div>"|12717.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12717-dark-was-the-night/|8.6|Scott Plagenhoef

On that charming but demo-ish jumble sale of an album Diane sorted through familiar folk forms (sea shanty, blues lament, narrative ballad) with a couple of chords and some sleepy arpeggios. If neither her vision nor her musicianship changed the conversation about the then-full-flowering new folk scene, Diane's arresting voice-- simultaneously vehement and serene-- put plenty of people on notice, including, apparently, a sizeable chunk of France. (Her Blogotheque <b><a href=""http://blogotheque.net/Alela-Diane,3813"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Take-Away Show</a></b> illustrates why big in France isn't necessarily aspersive: With her mass of dark hair and chic short boots, the girl was born to busk Paris' boulevards.)</p>
<p>Still, Diane thus far has played in the shadow of better-known Nevada City, Calif., product (and childhood friend) Joanna Newsom. As inevitable the comparison, it's not a very sensitive tool for evaluating either artists' work. Newsom, after all, pens wildly idiosyncratic songs for the harp and sings them in... a voice that takes some getting used to. On the aesthetically focused, meticulously arranged <i>To Be Still</i>, Diane is a traditionalist, partial to broad, universal themes-- nature, childhood, family, friends-- and gentle, lilting melodies that recall traditional ballads. She's also ditched many of the vocal tics and lower-pitch ranges that lent <i>Pirate's Gospel</i> a haunting melancholy and drew adjectives like ""eccentric"" but, in retrospect, better suit someone like Jolie Holland.</p>
<p>Diane demonstrated her broad range and flexibility, interpreting songs by artists as disparate as Vashti Bunyan, Jesus and Mary Chain, and Daniel Johnston on 2008's<i> The Silence of Love</i>, which she recorded with some musician friends as Headless Heroes. <i>To Be Still</i> will never fire up any parties, but its emotional range is as wide as that covers project's-- from ""Age Old Blue"", a wistful duet with craggy-voiced troubadour Michael Hurley about Diane's sharecropping Scottish ancestors, to the flushed-cheek, string-surging ""My Brambles"". Lead track ""Dry Grass and Shadows"" sets a playful tone, the sigh of steel pedal underlining her languid, country-twangy come-on: ""I like to look at your teeth lined up in perfect rows... Where the flatlands stretch inside your mouth/ And when you laugh all the star thistles tumble out."" A little hippie-dippy, but also utterly enchanting.</p>
<p>The album's first single, ""White as Diamonds"", best showcases her expanded musical ambitions and the record's pristine sound (coproduced with her bluegrass musician father in his studio). Two years ago, accompanied by acoustic guitar, Diane <b><a href=""http://www.daytrotter.com/article/739/free-songs-alela-diane"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">previewed</a></b> the newly hatched song for Daytrotter (second station of the cross for up-and-comers after Blogotheque) and claimed ""Diamonds"" is about silence and uh, snow. Disingenuous-sounding, for sure, but it's not like she's the first artist who'd prefer not to parse lyrics. She's also absolutely right: Simplicity is key to the song's stark power, and its uncluttered vocabulary of fiddle, cello, guitar and drawn-out, warbled ""wooooahs"" are as head-clearing as a cold February morning. Fill its white spaces with what you will.</p>
<p>When people speak of Diane's voice Sandy Denny's name comes up with increasing frequency, and the young American certainly shares her British predecessor's grace and gusto. But <i>To Be Still</i> is rooted in a different geography-- jagged California hills and faded towns that might be populated by doomed Steinbeck characters. In ""The Ocean"", the thick thump of bongos and a nervous flutter of mandolin sketch the numbing existence of a mountain woman who, landlocked by ""dirt ditch paths and pine cones... old hubcaps on the picket fence,""  dreams of the sea. It's a hybridized folk idiom and undeniably American.</p>
<p>Working with material hog-tied to the past and performed with traditional trappings puts Diane at some risk for creative stagnation and worse-- the kind of anonymity and irrelevance enjoyed by vast swathes of the contemporary folk universe. <i>To Be Still</i> avoids these traps thanks to Diane's spectacular voice and, well, the little, mostly indescribable things. The record's best moment comes somewhere in the center of the cautiously joyful ""The Alder Trees"". As Diane, easy-swaying sings ""girls clapping,"" a ragged clap-- hollow and a touch behind the beat-- emits from the back of the room. It's the kind of perfect little flaw that makes a record almost perfect, almost flawless.</p></div>"|12714.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12714-to-be-still/|8.0|Amy Granzin

When he recorded the sessions that make up <i>I Want to Go Where Things Are Beautiful</i>, he was 87 years old but had a mighty voice, a keen sense of humor, and a strong memory, recalling songs he had learned at the beginning of his life. Born in rural Kentucky in 1895, he began working in the coalmines at 14, and when he retired more than 40 years later, it was only due to a slipped disc and black lung. He was a union man, marching with Mother Jones in the 1920s and lobbying Congress in the 1960s for black lung compensation. He drank, smoked, fathered 13 children with his wife Mollie, released two albums in the 1970s, inspired a documentary, appeared in <i>Coal Miner's Daughter</i> in 1980, and recorded these <i>Beautiful</i> sessions in 1982. Never trained as a musician, the octogenarian sings with all the giddy irreverence of a five-year-old.</p>
<p>These sessions were recorded by Mike Seeger, a musician and folklorist (and Pete Seeger's half-brother) who received an NEA Folk Arts grant to document Workman's vast repertoire of songs. He spent several days at the singer's home in East Tennessee, interviewing and capturing his off-the-cuff performances. With no accompaniment, Workman rattles off hymns, jigs, comic tunes, dance numbers, war whoops, and Appalachian ballads, his sandpapery voice ringing clear with every note. It doesn't take much prompting to get him started talking about his grandfather's service in the ""Yankee Rebel war"" or about the long hours in the mines, when he would sing to himself while he loaded the coal cars.</p>
<p>Workman is certainly entertaining company. He keens out ""Casey Jones"" with remarkable power and worries over mortality on the eerie ""Oh Death"". Toothless, he makes a mash of consonants, but spits out the impossibly wordy ""Good Morning"" and ""Little David, Play on Your Harp"" with fast-talking verve and precision. He composed innumerable songs, but rarely, if ever, wrote them down: ""42 Years"" and ""Coal Black Mining Blues"" have real gravity in their low-key melodies, the latter stopping abruptly so Workman can recount his fight to make black lung a medically recognized ailment. A few tracks later, he's savoring the nonsense syllables of ""Sourwood Mountain"" and testifying mightily on the traditional ""Barbara Allen"".</p>
<p>For Workman as for many of his generation, singing served a very different purpose than it does for most current artists. During a time when music had a largely social function-- providing entertainment at gatherings or simply a reason to gather-- circumstances made it a solitary pursuit for him: Workman sang to keep himself company in the mines and to derive that simple pleasure from creating a joyful noise. His memory remained strong, recalling songs several decades old that still carried powerful meaning for him. He treats them like old friends, and that affection makes <i>I Want to Go Where Things Are Beautiful</i> not simply a catalog of 20th-century songs, but an amusing and affecting record of a man gleefully singing his autobiography.</p></div>"|12711.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12711-i-want-to-go-where-things-are-beautiful/|8.8|Stephen M.

Now trimmed to the core duo of songwriter Michael Tapscott and arranger Isaac Edwards, this is even more the case on <i>The Blue Depths. </i>Fueled by a passion for Vangelis soundtracks, 1980s-era Joni Mitchell, and the West Coast sounds of Jack Nitzsche, Odawas have here clearly chosen to immerse themselves in the enveloping comforts of the studio.</p>
<p>On their two previous Jagjaguwar albums, 2005's <i>The Aether Eater</i> and 2007's <i>Raven and the White Night</i>, Odawas dabbled in a little bit of everything: dreamy folk tunes, distorted psych-rock, and expansive high-concept librettos. For <i>The Blue Depths</i>, however, they've left behind nearly all of their more melodramatic art-rock moves, showing a newfound restraint only hinted at on <i>Raven</i>. Here their sound is rich and sumptuous, steeped in the willowy textures of homemade and/or vintage keyboards and Tapscott's yearning, romantic lyricism. Though this more streamlined approach does reduce some of the sheer anything-might-happen thrill of their earlier work, Odawas have here clearly found their niche, and it is a pleasure to listen as they fully commit themselves to this chosen course.</p>
<p>The subtle shift in the group's approach is evident from the first notes of ""The Case of the Great Irish Elk"". In the past, Odawas' various acoustic and electronic elements have sometimes co-existed uneasily in the mix, but here everything is submerged into the same graceful and luxuriant stream. Tapscott's acoustic guitar and harmonica are treated and processed in the same manner as Edwards' supple layers of <i>St. Elmo</i>'<i>s Fire</i> keyboards, while rogue elements of strings and percussion rise almost invisibly to the surface. As a result, <i>The Blue Depths </i>is by far Odawas most coherent and consistent work, as the duo are able to find a precise sonic and emotional tone and sustain it for the full length of the album's eight tracks.</p>
<p>Buoyed by the album's production, Tapscott delivers his most emotive performances to date, though like everything else his lyrics are frequently obscured in the gentle tides of the mix. His vocal style will always draw comparisons to Neil Young, but the electronic arrangements here are unlike anything in Young's catalog, hewing closer to Jason Lytle's work with Grandaddy circa <i>The</i> <i>Sophtware Slump</i>. The homespun radiance of Odawas' production serves to make Tapscott's voice sound all the more fragile and human on such dreamy tracks as ""Our Gentle Life Together"" or ""Moonlight/Twilight"", striking a reassuring harmony between the organic and the artificial.</p>
<p>Though there is nothing here quite as majestic and immediately captivating as ""Alleluia"" from <i>Raven and the White Night</i>, on the album's best tracks Tapscott seems effortlessly able to communicate a certain indefinable sense of loss and longing. On the chorus of the shadowy ""Swan Song of the Humpback Angler"" his voice keens with emotion, while the buoyant pop rhythms of ""Harmless Lover's Discourse"" help disguise what might be a lament of goodbye. His vocals drenched in reverb, Tapscott's specific words can get muffled, but more often than not that only helps to add a welcome sense of mystery to <i>The Blue Depths</i>, as for the first time it seems Odawas know precisely where they want to go and how they plan to get there.</p></div>"|12712.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12712-the-blue-depths/|7.7|Matthew Murphy

It's tempting to call him a chameleon, given the way he slides into musical partnerships without imposing his will on them. But O'Rourke doesn't mimic so much as he finds the parts of his creative personality that best match whoever he's playing with. Think of his affiliations with Wilco and Sonic Youth, his meshing with Jeff Tweedy in Loose Fur and Fennesz and Pita in Fenn O'Berg, his wide-ranging production work with Faust, John Fahey, U.S. Maple, etc. In nearly every case, it's hard to pick out which sounds and ideas are O'Rourke's, but the music is clearly affected by his presence.</p>
<p>Maybe it's easier to spot O'Rourke when he plays in a duo. But even then, he often fits his talents snugly inside those of his chosen partner. That was true of his first duo CD with Loren Connors, <i>In Bern</i>, and it's equally true of <i>Two Nice Catholic Boys</i>, recorded during the same 1997 European tour as <i>In Bern</i>. Part of the credit, of course, is due to Connors. His keen collaborative ear is as sharp as O'Rourke's, and his minimal guitar style, with its patient pace and open air, feels tailor-made for collaboration. Still, on all three pieces here, you can hear Connors' patented sound instantly, while O'Rourke's styles are slippier and sneakier, more cleverly camouflaged.</p>
<p>Take the first track, ""Maybe Paris"". It begins with overlapping sheets of fuzz, as the pair ignites flames by rubbing guitar sounds together. The wiry wails sound distinctly Connors-esque, but all the sounds mesh so well, they could be coming from either player. Five minutes in, the track shifts abruptly into sparse, gentle reflection. This section is pure Connors, a hypnotic string of notes that hint at melody but never fall into repetitive patterns. It's stunning how quickly and naturally O'Rourke adapts to this development. The two players circle each other so responsively that the piece is like a sonic Mobius strip. Each note feels like both a leader and follower, as if someone has discovered the world's first four-handed guitarist.</p>
<p>""Or Possibly Koln"" follows, leaning more toward the heavy end, including a thunderous section halfway through. But again, Connors and O'Rourke swerve into a restrained passage, mixing rhythmic loops with single notes in a way that recalls Lou Reed and Sterling Morrison's simple interplay on songs like ""Pale Blue Eyes"" and ""Jesus"". Only on the closer, ""Most Definitely Not Koln"", does the pair drift off-center a bit, with distant sounds that seem oddly disembodied. But even that track wakes up eventually, with a sudden passage of screaming noise on the level of feedback-wranglers like Jimi Hendrix or Keiji Haino. Such peaks are testament to the tenacity of these two accomplished musicians-- even at its most placid points, there's always the threat of surprise lurking around the corners of <i>Two Nice Catholic Boys.</i></p></div>"|12709.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12709-two-nice-catholic-boys/|7.2|Marc Masters

Howlett's proudly inelegant grooves made him a boogieman among critics allergic to bubblegum, even as the Prodigy enjoyed the kind of mass culture success that any dance producer would secretly envy. If you want to take a break from minimal techno to relive the rush of zillions-selling mainstream dance-- and you've misplaced your Chemical Brothers collection-- any of the three solid albums the Prodigy released between 1992 and 1997 will do the trick nicely.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as he now wraps up his <i>second</i> decade recording as the Prodigy, the nicest thing you can say about Howlett is that his healthy attitude toward self-cannibalization occasionally makes for decent music. Very occasionally. 2004's <i>Always Outnumbered, Never Outgunned</i>-- the first Prodigy full-length following 1997's multi-platinum, America-wooing <i>The Fat of the Land</i>-- was mostly a crass reiteration of Howlett's greatest financial success, offering slight tweaks to <i>Fat</i>'s booming breakbeats and pissed-off rock vocals. But if you stuck to the singles you could almost hear the glowstick gleam of the old hooks under the not-so-scary noise.</p>
<p>The new <i>Invaders Must Die</i>, however, may in fact be a cry for help. Howlett will not be budged from his noisy comfort zone, however much his fanbase shrinks in the face of creative burnout. From the first track through its final seconds, <i>Invaders</i> joylessly stomps through overly familiar territory. It's another lunkheaded, loud mash-up of rock and dance, a sound now so beefed-up and campy that it's perhaps only suitable for shotgunning cheap beer and practicing UFC chokeholds with your pals. The album-opening fade-in is about the only subtle touch on <i>Invaders</i>; Howlett's music is more intractably aggressive than ever before. When he takes an instrumental breather on <i>Invaders</i>, with ""Omen Reprise"", the result's closer to the dumb, portentous rush of a gabba techno track, minus the drums.</p>
<p>As for the ""songs,"" Howlett's motley crew of vocalists pull out all of the sneers and grimaces and nu-metal tricks to match the music's testosterone level. To say nothing of the volume level: The Jamaican chatter on ""Thunder"" sounds like he's straining to be heard over a double-decker stack of Marshalls, rather than nicing up the local dance. One track at a time, it sorta works, even with the non-stop bludgeoning of the rhythm programming and Howlett's complete lack of taste in rock. What doesn't work is an album that tries to fill even half its running time with Mockneys shouting dumb-ass catchphrases like ""your world's on fire"" over hip-house so heavily distorted it's become one big digital smear. Who knew we'd one day praise ""Smack My Bitch Up"" for its relative sonic nuance? Even a quarter-hour of Howlett's music has become exhausting.</p>
<p>Blessedly but briefly, halfway through <i>Invaders</i> the non-stop stadium rock posturing gives way to a fond look back the Prodigy's earliest (and best) records. ""Take Me to the Hospital"" and ""Warriors Dance""-- with their diva samples and sped-up dancehall soundbites and ambulance sirens and all the trimmings-- are the cheap tracks of the Prodigy's first phase re-budgeted for an era of shrill French techno and restraint-free blog house. They're pretty thrilling. But only a track later here's Prodigy pal Dave Grohl laying down a meathead motorik rhythm while Howlett displays a cringeworthy fascination with the oompah keyboards of modern day ""clownstep"" drum 'n' bass. At least it sounds like <i>he's</i> having fun.</p>
<p>But then you'd expect Howlett-- a 37-year-old man who's made a pretty penny by shamelessly holding onto the hormonally-amped constitution of a teenager-- would still find enjoyment in this stuff. For the rest of the planet, Howlett's brand of glee may no longer provide the same rush as when we were on the cusp of adulthood, fist-pumping to <i>Fat of the Land</i>. While it'd be nice if Howlett found a new generation of teenage dirtbags to take our places, the occasional burst of cloddish nostalgia-- dig that old school house piano on ""World's on Fire""-- doesn't alleviate the sad fact that even the Prodigy's singles, a source of mild throwback pleasure as little as four years ago, have becoming a slog.</p></div>"|12706.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12706-invaders-must-die/|5.8|Jess Harvell

The Montreal-based drone composer has, over the course  of the decade,  built oceans of ambient noise capable  of submerging his listener. His last album, 2006's <i>Harmony  in Ultraviolet</i>, took this large-canvas technique to its logical  end, so for his  latest project, Hecker focuses instead on shorter individual pieces-- albeit  with the same deliberateness and meticulous detail we've come  to expect from him.</p>
<p><i>An Imaginary Country</i> is, as its title suggests, an otherworldly landscape. Serving as our tour guide, Hecker uses each track to dream up one of its  distinct regions, necessitating his more tightly focused  approach. Take this journey with Hecker  and you'll be introduced to the coastal tide ebb and flow  on ""The Inner Shore"", the track's synths inhaling and exhaling  to mirror the current's natural rhythm. On ""A Stop at the Chord Cascades"", a wall  of descending chimes recalls the titular waterfall. And while there isn't much human life on this predominantly instrumental voyage, ""Utropics""  brings you closest to Hecker's imagined natives: A choir of haunted voices far off in the distance. Hecker is able to achieve this  transportive quality because he paints these portraits in painstaking  three-dimensional detail; the music is strikingly colorful. That said, <i>An Imaginary Country</i> isn't purely  concept-driven or a kind of ambient-techno pop-up book. Like all worthwhile  atmospheric music, there's a sense of choose-your-own-adventure here  that allows the listener to build his own interpretations.</p>
<p>Alongside his  more vivid storytelling, Hecker also wisely brings a broadened emotional  palette to the record. A primary criticism of his prior  work was that, while gorgeous and immense, his compositions  often came across as studied and technical to the point of feeling  impersonal. (See <i>Harmony in Ultraviolet</i>'s academic ""Harmony  in Blue"" suite.) With <i>An Imaginary Country</i>, though, Hecker  appears willing to address those concerns and more eager to convey drama.  On ""Paragon Point"", he juxtaposes dissonant shoegaze chords with  feathery choral synths to create a poignant, hopeful heartache. Like  stepping into the sunlight after a long, depressive stretch indoors,  the song expresses regret at time lost but also a sense of optimism  for a new day.</p>
<p>Together with these displays  of deeper sentiment, Hecker also showcases here a capacity for coaxing  natural textures out of his electronic arrangements. Album centerpiece  ""Borderlands"" demonstrates it best, where he establishes a plane  of twinkling, piano-like synths and lets gentle gusts of organic noise  drift above it. The digitally rendered effect feels remarkably untreated,  somehow indistinguishable from the earthly gust of wind it mimics. This  naturalism, combined with Hecker's sense of fantasy and mirage, is  part of what makes the album such a satisfying listen. Most impressive,  though, is that Hecker has built for us this make-believe area to inhabit,  to explore with him. While there's a bit less room in this space than  those he's constructed before, it's still very much an achievement,  and one to be celebrated.</p></div>"|12707.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12707-an-imaginary-country/|7.7|Joe Colly

It's a semi-unique practice for quasi-experimental, long-form composition but ultimately one of those ""it sounds like a turntable but it's really a guitar""-constructs that matters very little when a record is coming out of your speakers.</p><p>This is especially true when the duo's bushel-full of ""organic"" instruments (""Metal bowl?"" ""Books?"") are garbled to the point where they are unrecognizable anyway. But <em>Choral</em> is still the most coherent Mountains offering yet, its six tracks moving in definable, familiar arcs. The eponymous opening track feels transformative, an a.m. burst of percolating electronic undercurrents, reverberating piano chords, and wordless sighs. Each of its nearly 13 minutes is perfectly balanced, a base to whatever acids exist in your headspace.</p><p>Mountains are Brendon Anderegg and Koen Holtkamp; they founded the Apestaartje label in 1999 and have produced two albums of nimbly grand, organ-driven drone since 2005. Since their eponymous debut they've been unwinding their unwieldy compositions, leaving tracks whose instrumentation and mood hew closer to folk music than the electronic tone-poems of some of their peers.</p>
<p>The duo works mostly with recognizable sounds-- an organ key held until the gain huffs and pants, shimmering 12-strings, ruminative accordion swells-- and even when they employ electronic noises their compositions seem pleasantly threadbare. The Fahey-lite acoustic pickings on ""Map Table"" solidifies the idea that ""avant-folk"" is probably as appropriate a title for Mountains' work as drone or ambient. <em>Choral</em>'s palpitations and slow climbs make a comparison to someone like Jack Rose seem like a stretch, but Mountains can find camp near the warmed explorations of Charalambides or Six Organs of Admittance.</p>
<p>On ""Melodica"" the plateau'd organs act like a bug zapper for skittering detritus before the track yields to pillowy, fingerpicking. ""Telescope"" laces together humble electric guitars, resembling the slight dissonances of Flying Saucer Attack or Windy &amp; Carl. The bubbling loops of ""Add Infinity"" buoy the song's lake-clear acoustic thrum.</p>
<p>Mountains remain fairly straight-laced for an experimental project, and <em>Choral</em> contains many moments of blissful saturation. But the duo's build-build-fuzz-comedown formula leads to shiny moments that are pleasing but not exactly hard-earned. ""Add Infinity"" abandons its ear-pricking acoustic progression and descends into a typical white-noise fog; ""Telescope"" suspends movement for a long, trebly note before it fades; even ""Melodica"" rises to a cinematic swell. Aurally pleasing moments, all, but their inevitability precludes the total blissouts those tracks suggest.</p>
<p>As a result, <em>Choral</em> sometimes feels staid and a little postcard-y: a pretty gesture that fails to eclipse the experience of actually going somewhere. That's OK: The best parts of <em>Choral</em>-- the title track, ""Melodica"", most of ""Add Infinity""-- suggest that the band's moniker refers less to the vistas their music may or may not evoke and instead to the shifting strata of sound they create. On <em>Choral</em>, Mountains arrange those layers in ways just subtle and precise enough to shift your headspace.</p></div>"|12698.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12698-choral/|6.5|Andrew Gaerig

In most cases they've gained more than they lost: From the shamanic trance of 2006's ""Where We At"" (in collaboration with Henrik Scwharz and Dixon) to the dynamic surge of 2007's ""Balandine"" and ""Enoi"", the increasing seriousness of Âme's aesthetic is never in vain. In fact the portentousness of their sound is of the best sort, not so much awesome as itself awed and alienated by some apocalyptic vision somewhere off-screen.<br/><br/>But in taking this route, Âme are swimming against the tide, discovering the strange joy of masochistic submission at the same time as their peers retreat further into the safe harbor of deep house re-re-revivalism. So while 2007's <em>Coast 2 Coast</em> mix was a near-perfect document of the latter impulse (reveling in the soft warmth of deep house old and new), they spend much of<em> Fabric 42</em> carefully retracing the steps of a scene that is abandoning them, offering up a combination of viscous minimal techno and rigorous tech-house; the vibe starts off anxious, ends up muscular, and on the way somehow bypasses ""sexy"" and ""soulful"" altogether. <em>Fabric 42 </em>certainly shares <em>Coast to Coast</em>'s lack of pretension, more interested in constructing a cruisy, enveloping feel than making any kind of statement or wowing with its diversity; but whereas the easy gentility of <em>Coast to Coast</em>'s deep house sound made it a charming home listening or dinner party staple, <em>Fabric 42</em> is just hard-edged enough to seem slightly ill-suited to any context other than the dancefloor itself.<br/><br/>All of which serves to make <em>Fabric 42 </em>appear rather inessential, and I must confess that I found it hard to pay adequate attention at first. It doesn't help that Âme have deliberately avoided including any established or even potential bangers, with the exceptions of their own churning epic ""D.P.O.M.B."" (a homage to DJ Pierre's ""Wild Pitch"" early-1990s house sound, again composed in collaboration with Schwarz and Dixon) and the riveting old school techno classic ""Loop"" by LFO vs Fuse-- included at the end of this mix like a victory lap, the hour-long grimace of concentration relaxing into a broad, triumphant grin. Earlier, things can get a bit grim at times, although not always for the worse: The ungainly groove of Jens Zimmerman's ""Modmod Blubbblub"" is not at all helped by the pseudo-existential wordplay of its detached narrator vocal, but the far superior ""Raw Structure"" by Edward (seething old school house propping up an excoriating slam poetry vocal) shares the explosive furrow-browed intensity of its blueprint, Green Velvet's ""Preacher Man"".<br/><br/>It's a grimness that has to sneak up on you to work. When I actively concentrate on the music, I want a lascivious diva vocal, an impudent piano riff, or a camp string arrangement to appear somewhere, anywhere; switch my concentration to something else, though, and the music's inexhaustible physicality takes on a compulsive power, locking in to the ""jack"" component of house with a fierceness you'd think would be beyond two effete German boys. And, as usual, Âme distinguish themselves with some inspired (if unflashy) transitions: the arrival of the skanking waterlogged drums of STL's ""Something Is Raw"" over the top of the fading acid bleeps of Armando's ""Don't Take It"" sounds so perfect, so exact in its unlikely mix'n'match, that the eventual emergence of the dominant organ riff on STL's track seems vaguely disappointing.<br/><br/>The duo spend much of the second half of the mix alluding to their taste for all things ""Wild Pitch""-- a weakness they share with Tiefscwharz, who have plotted a similar stylistic trajectory from lush prettiness to riotous intensity. What's at stake here is nothing less than the function of dance music itself: unlike other current revivalist trends, Wild Pitch revivalism maintains a vision of house music as rave-flavoured and populist rather than soulful and specialist. This secret compact with hectic populism survives as a ghostly undercurrent even when<em> Fabric 42</em> threatens to get a bit dour and greyscale, and it's that undercurrent that makes those moments worth sitting (or, better, scrubbing) through.</p></div>"|12696.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12696-fabric-42/|6.9|Tim Finney

I'm listening to songs like ""Running Up That Hill"" and ""Billie Jean"" and ""Back in Black"". I'm parked here next to the turntable because I'm playing 7"" singles, which means I need to be ready to put something new on every three or four minutes. But something strange is going on: ""Back in Black"" consists only of a couple of sine wave tones for bass and a few blasts of white noise static for the guitar riff; ""Billie Jean"" is little more than a few clicks, and you can just barely make out the bassline; and I can't tell you what is going on with this crazy ""Running Up That Hill"".</p><p><em>Recovery</em> is a 7"" box set (10 singles, 20 tracks) put out by the Fractured label. It comes housed in thick box and the design of the set (by Graham Dolphin) is sharp and well put together but not too fancy. It feels a bit more like an art object more than a functional set of music, which I guess is appropriate. The people behind <em>Recovery</em> asked 20 artists working in the realm of experimental music-- they are drone purveyors, laptop abstractionists, extreme techno minimalists, and improvisers, but they don't have much truck with popular music-- to cover a song from the past that's been especially significant to them. So we get extreme minimalist Ryoji Ikeda doing AC/DC, UK click'n'cutters SND doing Michael Jackson, and Mika Vanio, best known for his post-industrial work in Pan Sonic, doing Kate Bush.</p><p>In the best tracks here you can hear a sense of discovery and the fresh crackle of energy that comes from two aesthetics colliding. Richard Chartier makes highly detailed microsound pieces, and Russian producer/composer CoH is too prolific to pin down, though he has a fondness the harsh and noisy. But they come together on for a version of  Soft Cell's ""Bleak Is My Favorite Cliché"", slowing the original to half-speed, adding some mechanized hum, and whispering the lyrics. It feels like isolationism/dark ambient soundscaping mixed with proper goth, and the effect is thrilling. BJ Nilsen, best known now for his albums of field recordings, covers Joy Division's ""Heart and Soul"", keeping the tense, grinding groove of the original almost exactly but fleshes it out with judiciously placed distortion, and the affection he brings to the material is palpable. Thoughtful re-works these might be, but the pleasures are immediate and obvious.</p>
<p>Matmos' terrific choice of cover, Bow Wow Wow's ""C30, C60, C90, Go!"", is a sly reminder that <em>Recovery</em> is a defiantly physical object (vinyl-only, no mp3s), comprised of songs from a time when all music could be held in the hand. Google the lyrics of the 1980 hit and marvel at how accurately they predict present modes of music consumption (Matmos thought enough of the words to print them on the 7"" label here). Matmos also deliver musically, mirroring the clattering Burundi beat of Bow Wow Wow quite closely while adding some wicky high-pitched squelches and whispered vocals for a net effect that is cartoonish and playful. (Here I note that Matmos' Drew Daniel has written for Pitchfork.)  The flip of the Matmos single is Barbara Morgenstern doing New Order's ""Temptation"", which serves as a reminder of how hard it is to mess up a brilliant song, though her slightly awkward phrasing and modest bedroom pop production nicely play up the song's vulnerability.</p>
<p>Interesting but perhaps not surprising is that most of the songs chosen come from the 1980s and, depending on how broad your definition, can be loosely classified as new wave. It's a clear reminder of how much sway that era held for artists later working in the electronic field, even the bands that haven't since been canonized. Both Fennesz' version of A-Ha's ""Hunting High and Low"" and Jóhann Jóhannsson's take on OMD's ""Souvenir"" zero in on the lush romanticism of the new pop era's sonics, blowing things up to 70mm widescreen proportions. Though in the press notes for the set Jóhannsson claims that his track is ""revenge"" for being seduced by OMD as a kid before later discovering their superior influences, these two tracks feel like loving homages that demonstrate how almost any song's unexplored corners can be transformed into something new by a good listener. Serving as counterweights to these highs are the handful of tracks that seem like conceptual goofs, some of which are pretty fun (Ikeda on ""Back in Black"") some of which are boring (Vanio's track is nice enough, but its relationship to Kate Bush is vague at best) and some of which seem pointless (never really dug SND's original stuff, and this ""Billie Jean"" does nothing for me.)</p>
<p>It goes out without saying that cover comps these days are a dime a dozen. Indie artists pay tribute to heroes, smirk along to guilty pleasures, and logroll with like-minded contemporaries to keep their names in the blogs. It seems a harmless trend, if uninspiring. But the artists here aren't involved in such games. These are intellectual types, people with concepts, who think things through when taking on new projects. <em>Recovery</em> reflects this more cerebral and considered stance, and some of these covers seem like commentaries or venues to work through ideas more than musical tributes (or, for that matter, send-ups). Which means that <em>Recovery</em> is ""interesting"" more often than it's ""fun."" But there's still enough variety in the mix to make the whole project worthwhile.</p></div>"|12704.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12704-recovery/|6.5|Mark Richardson

Yeah, big deal-- we could be talking about any number of new jacks with a competent PR team. But this is ...And You Will Know Us By the Trail of Dead-- fiercely Austinite and not the kind of people you'd call ""joiners."" If you're checking in for the first time since 2002, Trail of Dead followed up the monumental <i>Source Tags &amp; Codes</i> with a spending spree of goodwill, beefing with label execs, hectoring reviewers, and having their live shows punctuated with intraband violence. And yes, they made albums, too. While I won't tell how high the perversely enjoyable, self-immolating clusterfuck of <i>Worlds Apart </i>ranked on my 2005 year-end list, I can assure you my enthusiasm for it placed me in the minority. On its follow-up, <i>So Divided,</i> Trail of Dead didn't even bother trying to be provocative. It would've been the sound of a band bottoming out if they hadn't gone on to <i>open</i> for Dethklok in one of the most emasculating turnarounds in rock history.<br/><br/>Having departed Interscope, and now far enough under the radar to avoid the BS of backlash for backlash's sake, Trail of Dead are in their best position in years to resuscitate their image. What stands out on <i>The Century of Self</i> is a sense of confidence in what Trail of Dead have become-- though they're still sorting out their big-top ambitions a bit too prog for radio airplay (but not too prog to necessarily discourage it), gone are the overbearing orchestrations and baffling genre experiments that often served as cloaking devices for either weak songs or a dearth of ideas. It's easy to overstate the ambition thing-- much of this LP approaches the six-minute mark with discernible ""movements"" and the overreaching religious tirade is given a name like ""Isis Unveiled""-- but the architecture is easy to navigate. <br/><br/>""Bells of Creation"", for example: First featured on last year's <i>Festival Thyme EP</i>, the song throws in a Who-style midsection of anticipatory drum rolls and key trills but it merely serves as a welcome jolt between the piano drone of the verses. The use of piano, certainly increased, isn't the story or the scapegoat it could be made out to be. Trail leader Conrad Keely's always had a taste for sap, and here he often embraces softer, streamlined arrangements: ""Fields of Coal"" moves from a feathery waltz-time appropriation of Mercury Rev's <i>Deserter's Songs</i> to a stein-raising sea shanty, and it ushers in a surprisingly potent run of ballads. It shouldn't work-- Trail of Dead have rarely been at their best when it leads with Keely's voice. But while he strains and slides against the slicker numbers, his voice displays a nice worn-in quality. One of the better songs they've written, ""Luna Park"" evolves from a <i>Screamadelica</i> comedown to the most naturally epic crescendos of <i>Century</i> with a directness often missing from the rest of the album. <br/><br/>But even when the music takes a lighter touch, Trail of Dead can't quite resist heavy-handedness. <i>Century'</i>s second half is bookended by ""Insatiable (One)"" and ""Insatiable (Two)"", a couple of ""Scarborough Fair"" non-starters that are still too close in sequencing to really generate any sort of thematic quality. So in a way, <i>The Century of Self</i> turns out to be every bit as stubborn as its predecessors, even as it goes a certain way towards justifying them. The naysaying didn't suggest a path towards redemption using a sort of Coldplay/Secret Machines hybrid, yet you'll recall that both of those bands made decent records as recently as 2008, and really, this is the sort of company that Trail of Dead should feel most comfortable around: Keely's now 36, and I'm fairly certain he can't afford to smash a piano every night.</p></div>"|12703.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12703-the-century-of-self/|6.8|Ian Cohen

Such is the balancing act at play on <em>Hungry Bird</em>, veteran countrypolitan rockers Clem Snide's bow-out that wasn't. A few years back, after a decade and a half as Clem Snide, songwriter Eef Barzelay announced the end of the Clems, while his own solo output (never far from the Clem Snide aesthetic anyhow, given Barzelay's strong presence and Clem Snide's oft-changing lineup) multiplied. A final album of Snide songs, recorded around the time of Barzelay's 2008 sophomore solo effort, <em>Lose Big</em>, had reportedly been laid down around the same time; now it surfaces as <em>Hungry Bird</em>. One twist: In December, Barzelay announced that Clem Snide had patched things up and are giving this band thing another go.</p><p>There is a resigned quality to <em>Hungry Bird</em> that stands in sharp contrast with the sprightly, slightly goofy tack the band took on 2001's career highlight <em>The Ghost of Fashion</em>. Gone, too, is most of the twang that characterized a good chunk of the band's sound, replaced with a series of spare, watery soundscapes that threaten to spin out into either a <em>Pablo Honey</em>-style fiery crash or, erm, ""adult contemporary."" This record does indeed sound wounded, and Barzelay's songs feel as if they might be his last set for a while, no matter whose name wound up on the spine. (A little digging suggests <em>Hungry Bird</em> details some sort of post-apocalyptic vision. I didn't get that on my own, nor I suspect will you; awfully dull-seeming end times, anyhow.)</p><p>But ""wounded"" isn't the best look for a sometimes-humorous band who found early fame warming up collegial sorts at Ben Folds solo shows. A decade ago, Barzelay might've turned one of the ultra-earnest brooders here into a ""Joan Jett of Arc"", slipping just a hint of light and pathos into an otherwise stone-faced ballad. There's just not much levity at play on <em>Hungry Bird</em>, and-- as occasionally overdone as it is throughout the Clem Snide back catalog-- it's funny just how much you miss it when it goes away.</p>
<p>""Me No"" kicks things off with a slack-strummed guitar and splattering drums, but the song itself-- a series of pleas, however impassioned-- falls apart in a series of ""bah-bah-bah""s. Highlight ""Born a Man"" has a nice, easy way about it and some of the set's best lyrics, but it's bogged down by a Bruce Hornsby-like piano and an all-too-easy lyrical climax. It goes on like this, bouncing between mood pieces and more standard folky fare, with Barzelay doing precious little to invoke either the ""see what I did there?"" lyricism of old or revealing much about whatever's so clearly bothering him.</p>
<p>Lambchop associate and Nashville producer of note Mark Nevers surprisingly had a hand in this one (as he did on 2005's <em>End of Love</em>), though the production's credited to Barzelay himself. The sound of <em>Hungry Bird</em> shares more than a studio rat (and a bunch of musicians) with Kurt Wagner's ever-changing crew, but whereas Lambchop find a way to make 300 people sound like just the right number, the six musicians who comprise the Clem Snide of <em>Hungry Bird</em> sound as if someone's halved their efforts. A few <em>End of Love</em> songs share this sparse approach with Hungry Bird, but that's just it: a few. I get that these songs are meant to sound ""intense,"" what with all the strategic volume bumps and Barzelay opening up his throat as minute four turns to minute five. But virtually all 10 tunes here share the same threadbare twilit veneer, and it causes the album to feel far longer than its 46 minutes.</p>
<p>It doesn't take long for the best of <em>Hungry Bird</em>'s vocal melodies-- ""Burn the Light"", ""Born a Man"", ""Hum""-- to become familiar, even though the same can't be said for the lyrics themselves. That's an admittedly odd bit of encouragement for a band like Clem Snide, who once got by on so much more. Alt-country is all too often such serious business, so it was nice to have a band around who might elicit at least a simper now and again. It takes no stretch of the imagination to tie the dour tone of <em>Hungry Bird</em> to the apparent split in the wake of its creation, and maybe its unpleasant bitterness is just a temporary side-effect of Barzelay's heartburn. Whatever it was, though, it wouldn't have been the first breakup in history due to a lack of interest, and that's ultimately the impression left by <em>Hungry Bird</em>.</p></div>"|12705.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12705-hungry-bird/|4.4|Paul Thompson

Founded around the turn of the century by Lawrence English, the label has become the prolific home of many of Australia's best ambient and electronic musicians, as well as a rest stop for guys like Keith Fullerton Whitman, Philip Jeck, Oren Ambarchi, David Toop, Thurston Moore and Luc Ferrari. Japanese singer and experimentalist Tujiko Noriko's here makes her second appearance on the label.<br/><br/>Noriko's 2005 effort for Room40, <em>Blurred in My Mirror</em>, had a beguiling and murky atmosphere but nonetheless offered moments of stunning pop clarity-- this collaboration leans much more heavily to abstraction and the pure celebration of sound. John Chantler, whose association with Room40 goes back to its beginnings, and label founder Lawrence English play a variety of rock instruments in a decidedly un-rock way, but they focus mostly on their synthesizers, while Noriko layers her voice to build on their soundscapes. She seems to revel in the juxtaposition of different types of singing. On ""Make Me Your Private Party"", she very cleary carries the central melody in sharp, child-like ""la la las,"" surrounding them with slightly processed vocal parts that feel somewhat sinister. The effect rolls between fantasy and nightmare.<br/><br/>English has curated compilations that focus on illustrating the sleep state, and he and Chantler seem keen to explore that territory here, creating a series of musical backdrops that often sound like half-remembered songs or mirror the way external stimuli can wiggle into our dreams. ""12 O'clock on the Highway"" opens things strongly, with a nebula of Noriko voices softly meandering in and out of harmony, before the song shifts into an abstract psych groove. Much of the album expertly bridges obtuse style and pleasing sound, though it closes meekly with a wandering track comprised mostly of accordion, Noriko's quietest mumblings and crackling samples of voices.<br/><br/>Whatever its fleeting shortcomings, though, this is an album of singular vision, and one that's bound to appeal to admirers of all three artists.

I say ""according to"" because rumors that Bogner's story is a hoax-- a cover for music Jelinek made himself-- have already circulated. Some cite the recordings' rather clean fidelity, odd for music purported to be this old and inexpensively produced; others claim to hear Jelenik's minimal style in Bogner's simple compositions. Then there's the fact that <em>Recordings 1969-1988 </em>is the first release on Jelinek's label, Faitiche-- a name the label's own website claims is a French/German hybrid meaning ""factish,"" or ""a combination of facts and fetishes [that] makes it obvious that the two have a common element of fabrication.""</p><p>Barring any denials or confirmations from Jelinek, that's probably all we'll ever know. His entertaining liner notes make Bogner's story seem plausible. Born in Germany in 1946, she became a pharmacist, wife, and mother by her early twenties, but still found spare time to study painting, printing, and electronic music. The latter interest led her to record her own synthesizer-based compositions on reel-to-reel tapes in a studio she built herself. Some songs survived intact, while others had to be assembled by Jelinek from individual, unmixed tracks.</p><p>The truth of this tale is ultimately a minor concern, because as intriguing as the story is, the songs on <em>Recordings 1969-1988 </em>are much more interesting. Bogner's work fits squarely in the world of early electronic music-- the period from the late 1950s to the early 70s, when synthesizers were so new that using them to craft melodic songs and create abstract sound were both considered ""experimental"" pursuits. The king of this era was Raymond Scott, whose whimsical jazz was adopted for cartoon soundtracks, and whose electronic inventions resulted in radio commercials, Jim Henson film scores, and unique curios like <em>Soothing Sounds for Baby</em>, a series intended to help parents pacify their infants. Bogner's music bears much of Scott's playful spirit, finding common ground between nursery-rhyme simplicity and the absurd humor of abstract art. Some of these songs are practically direct Scott rip-offs, but you can also hear echoes of Scott contemporaries and descendants: the radio concoctions of Daphne Oram, the comic pop of Perry and Kingsley, the conceptual art of the Residents, even the post-rock repetition of Black Dice.</p>
<p>Most of <em>Recordings 1969-1988 </em>sounds simultaneously like pop and art. Bogner's M.O. is to take a few simple loops-- rumbling bass, water-y plops, chirping squalls, laser-like blasts-- and overlap them, producing songs so sweet they'll make you laugh (the elephant-march opener ""Begleitung für Tuba""), so repetitive they'll hypnotize you (the swinging ""Inversion""), and so inventive they sound alien (the robotic ""2 Ton""). At best, like on the jazzy ""Punkte"" and the cresting ""Expansion"", she crafts pulsing, organic melodies that burrow into memory like tree roots gripping the ground.</p>
<p>I've often wondered why the music of Raymond Scott, as catchy as it could be, is frequently relegated to the status of odd curiosity or gear-geek niche. The same will certainly happen with Bogner, whoever she ""really"" was/is. And sure, the songs on <em>Recordings 1969-1988 </em>(as well as the included shot of her with big glasses and floppy bowl cut) have a tech-y, art-nerd sheen. But give these tunes time, and you may find yourself humming them randomly, much the way a 60s housewife might have unwittingly memorized Scott tunes via the background noise of his sneaky radio jingles.</p></div>"|12694.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12694-recordings-1969-1988/|7.3|Marc Masters

Molly Schnick won't be getting back the 10 years she spent as cellist with Bay-Area-turned-Brooklyn electro-punks Out Hud, but she's been spending the time since their 2005 breakup with herself again. On the debut of solo project Jean on Jean, Schnick wonders aloud whether she's losing her taste for the nightlife. The answer, based on this strummy bedroom chamber-pop U-turn, is a qualified yes. <em></em></p><p><em>Jean on Jean</em> boots almost everything about Schnick's old band, down to the dub-chamber vocal effects and Fall Out Boy-like song titles. The songs themselves convey intimate, everyday experiences with homespun charm. Over the uncharacteristic electronic beats of ""Cold Horse"", the narrator gets to her train station, then to one of life's forks in the road; ""You and I"" makes ""a sink of party dishes"" a metaphor for what's left after lost love. A couple of the most emotionally resonant tracks for me raise the sorts of questions people nearing 30 might jot in their FaceSpace/Twimblr. ""Will I ever again own the night?"" Schnick asks between castanets and tambourine on ""Grown"". To which methodical working-stiff lament ""Change"" appends, ""Where is the harm in comfort/ And not going out at night?""</p><p>A gentle soul throughout, Schnick layers her endearingly plainspoken vocals over cellos, ramshackle guitars, keyboards, various reverb-coated percussion instruments, and, on wavy beach meditation ""Hawaii"", even bird noises. The album is almost always more intricate than its modest tone suggests, with the best tracks recalling wallflower tunesmiths from the Zombies' Colin Blunstone to the Softies. (Schnick cites Blunstone and late California folkie Judee Sill as influences; Blunstone's catchier, Sill's twangier, and Jean on Jean can't match either great just yet.) Opener ""Tonight"", the first video selection, may not quite make you pull over to the side of the road the way its narrator does, but it's right up there with the Headlights' similar 2008 track ""Cherry Tulips"". Schnick's string arrangements, meanwhile, should grab some fans of Joanna Newsom, Andrew Bird, or Beirut-- see the classically elegant bridge on finale ""Finally"".</p>
<p>If you can root against Schnick as she goes it alone in such a super vulnerable way, you're an asshole. But that doesn't mean her album is flawless-- pretty sure that's part of the appeal. The one-two punch of ""Circle"", a folkier number with Schnick's breath as percussion, and ""Summer"", with 1960s psych-pop keyboards and harmonies, walks the line between minimal and monotonous. For such a pop-tinged album, choruses in general tend to be a bit unremarkable; for such a personal-sounding album, a couple of lyrics ring jarringly un-conversational notes here or there. That <em>Jean on Jean</em> isn't perfect piles heartache on heartache. But it shouldn't stop a small, hopefully devoted cult from cherishing this album. And it shouldn't stop Schnick from trying on her Canadian tuxedo again some other rainy day. For wild nights out, there's still her guest work with ex-!!! guy John Pugh's Free Blood.</p></div>"|12699.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12699-jean-on-jean/|6.7|Marc Hogan

But it's long past time we put the band's reputation and ridiculous press aside and look at them for who they are; they're neither buffoons nor savants, and they deserve to be judged on their music, which was plenty maniacal without taking any outside factors into consideration. Now on the verge of a potential breakthrough-- maybe because of it, who knows-- on <i>200 Million Thousand</i>, Black Lips sidestep expectations and make a record less approachable than its predecessor.</p>
<p>Indeed, the cleaner sound and summery pop of <i>Good Bad Not Evil</i> has been ditched here for a psychedelic haze. From opening track ""Take My Heart"" onward, vocals are more obscured by echo, guitars play queasy, atonal leads, and the rhythm section pokes and ambles around the beat. Some tracks are subtly weird-- like the simmering breakdown of ""Drugs"", where the band's voices get not so much quieter as they do smaller-- and there's more full-on psychedelia on""Big Black Baby Jesus of Today"", a Southern swamp shuffle drenched in toothache-inducing guitar bends and unhinged vocals. Closer ""I Saw God"" takes an already near-inscrutable ode to a minor drug epiphany and manipulates it with tape-masking and censoring ""bleep"" noises, before its full-band climax goes off less like a tidal wave of sound and more like someone falling over a drum riser. If there's beauty in imperfections, some of these songs are shrines.</p>
<p>No one's going to mistake this record for anyone but Black Lips, but they are stretching out as band here, pulling back their own tics in favor of things like style and tone. Vocal duties are spread more democratically among the band, and more styles are dabbled with, though they haven't moved the needle too far on the college radio dial. There's faux-innocent greaser-pop like ""Drugs"", some Byrdsian jangle added to the sobriety pledge of ""Starting Over"" (""while I'm still lucid... my wounds won't stop oozing""), and ""Trapped in a Basement"", a weirdly theatrical number that combines country twang with woozy keyboard tones.  But before you say there are no surprises on the record, there's also a rap song: ""The Drop I Hold"" is a definite departure, though maybe not one as drastic as it first seems. The scratchy orchestral loop underneath that would be more appropriate for an early Wu-tang record, but Cole Alexander rap-sings its lyrics, sings its hook, wails like a ghost in the background in the same way they hit the high notes in ""Trapped in a Basement"", and even imitates a turntable scratch with childlike exuberance. It's as if he's singing along to a favorite song that existed already.</p>
<p>You could say the same about many of this band's best songs, and that's no criticism. They're obvious about their influences, but thankfully never fussy or precious about them. The results still hold something palpably reckless and earnest, refracting tradition through their own filthy lens. Black Lips haven't lost their lack for songcraft-- ""Short Fuse"" is so sleekly and effortlessly catchy that any disparate sound they graft onto it (paisley 60s pop, hammy piano hammering, an ancient B-movie <i>whoosh</i>) sticks by force of inertia. But whether or not Black Lips have changed their M.O. much, <i>200 Million Thousand</i> is less consistent than any of their previous albums, with more winding paths than real peaks.</p></div>"|12702.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12702-200-million-thousand/|7.3|Jason Crock

Funny he didn't think he could be both, because that's basically what he was: six-foot-three, stiff-lipped, carrying a guitar shaped like an M16 (a gift from a fan), cursing every 10 seconds, serially high, and considered such an effective agitator by cops that they beat him half to death in mid-1978. ""I survived them by intellect,"" he said later. Yuh. Tosh may have been a natural mystic, but I'm sure pot helped.</p><p>His reggae career started alongside Bob Marley and Bunny Livingston in the Wailers, a group he left in the mid-70s after Island Records' Chris Blackwell refused to release his first solo album. No surprise, really-- compared to Marley, Tosh was nearly unmarketable. On love songs: ""You turn on the fuckin' radio, 24 bumboclaat hours a day you hear, 'Darlin I love you.' A man wouldn't sing to the almighty a rasclaat, him love a woman more than the creator who create the sun and the moon and the bumboclaat star."" On the enlightenment of the common man: ""I am going to kill the fuckery out there. People is going to be in demand for the truth."" If ""One Love"" was Bob Marley's song about paradise, ""Equal Rights"" was Tosh's: ""Everyone is crying out for peace, none is crying out for justice,"" a reminder that nobody argues against feelgood platitudes, but nobody works to make them come true, either.</p><p>But one season's rebel is the next's vogue, and by 1978, Tosh was guesting on ""Saturday Night Live"" flanked by Mick Jagger dancing like an electrocuted game hen. In 1987, two years after the first digital dancehall single (King Jammy &amp; Wayne Smith's ""Under Mi Sleng Teng"") radicalized Jamaican music, Tosh won a Grammy for <em>No Nuclear War</em>, a lukewarm hash of roots reggae-- the kind of muck longtime contributors to their fields finally win Grammys for regardless of quality. Months later, he was murdered in a botched robbery.</p>
<p>For the volume and intensity of Tosh's anger, he had a poetic side, animated by magic and religion-- factors more obscure than politics, though equally as susceptible to bullshit.<em> Stepping Razor: Red X</em>-- a documentary packaged in <em>The Ultimate Peter Tosh Experience</em>-- is based on a series of cassettes called the Red X Tapes, part biography, part philosophy, part folktale. Much of it is babble, but it's artful, seductive babble. This is the part of Tosh that sounds unreliable on record, but compelling in the form of a documentary, where anonymous commentators rally to elevate him to the level of myth. Even though the documentary isn't part of Tosh's output as a recording artist per se, it helps highlight what made him interesting: The conflict between art as a tool to disseminate truth to the masses, and as a way to mystify it as private ritual.</p>
<p>Now to the product at hand. <em>The Ultimate Peter Tosh Experience</em> is a $35 package containing one 14-track audio disc and two DVDs: <em>Stepping Razor: Red X</em> (which is already commercially available) and footage of several performances. It's not what it claims to be. His most famous songs-- ""Legalize It"", ""Equal Rights"", and ""Stepping Razor""-- are either absent or represented by alternate versions. There's nothing from his first album, <em>Legalize It</em>, and there are two versions of ""Wanted: Dread and Alive"". Why? I'm guessing it has to do with licensing. Shame on Shanachie Records, frankly. Tosh's biography was always more interesting to me than his music, but he certainly wrote some good songs, played with great sidemen, and released some brawny, tuff reggae-- all reasons he deserves a lovingly selected single-disc compilation behind his name. In fact, he <em>has</em> one already. Several. There's a part of the Red X Tapes where he talks about a time the devil wrapped him in barbed wire, which sliced peepholes in his eyelids that let him see the world's hypocrisy and corruption. I wonder what he'd see in this.</p></div>"|12695.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12695-the-ultimate-peter-tosh-experience/|4.0|Mike Powell

So the cleaner and more carefully arranged sound of their latest album, <em>The Mountain,</em> is a new step for them. From the opening title track, it sounds like a confident one. A muffled guitar introduces the simple minor-key progression, but then the whole band kicks in, stretching the sound from pan-and-scan to widescreen, while a soaring electric slide guitar adds to the song's understated majesty. Producer Mike McCarthy has done a fine job of making the band sound clean without being antiseptic, but the focus is very much on the dirty guitars and the voice of frontwoman Erika Wennerstrom. Her voice is distinctive, powerful, and exudes an easy lived-in authority; it's the kind of voice any band playing this kind of straightforward rock would die to have fronting them.</p><p>Heartless Bastards seem like their trying to grow and diversify without losing sight of themselves or their sound-- a tricky undertaking since they've made it thus far on bare-bones rock. But even with the added touches, <em>The Mountain</em> still a pretty austere affair. The most ostentatious moments are the record's softer ones. ""Wide Awake"" is one example, with its reserved strum augmented by mandolins, a martial drumbeat, and Wennerstrom singing an ambitious, vaguely Eastern-sounding vocal melody (<em>Led Zeppelin III</em> seems seems like the band's North star  on how to add depth). ""Early in the Morning"" and ""Out at Sea"" are more typical plugged-in mid-tempo stompers, the latter having a few overdubs and incidental noise that slyly suggest a psychedelic touch. ""Nothing Seems the Same"" is that song's simmering cousin, gradually building and receding without ever bursting through, with some of the same production touches.</p><p>If anything drags <em>The Mountain</em> down, it's tempo. The title track is immediately deflated by the acoustic campfire strum of the following ""Could Be So Happy"", though the simple ascending chorus promises that it'll linger in listeners' minds once it's over. . ""Hold Your Head High"", however, is  maudlin world-weary, little-help-from-my-friends tripe that even Wennerstrom's voice, hammering every brassy high note within reach, can't save. ""So Quiet"" is another folky detour, with a string chart that screams starched collars in comparison to the band's blue ones, and they follow that right up with ""Had to Go"", more acoustic fun with added banjo and fiddle. Compared with the record's earlier slow songs, ""Had to Go""'s languid tempo seems purposeful and patient, with Wennerstrom in total control of the melody-- but most arresting is the open space that they've allowed into the song. The last two songs signal a return to volume and normalcy, but while closing track ""Sway"" is a perky step sideways from the record's somber tone, ""Witchypoo""  is not nearly sublime enough to sustain its sluggish pace. With <em>The Mountain</em>, Heartless Bastards have shown that they have the tools and the talent to take at least tentative steps forward into a more ambitious and diverse sound. But it's surprising that they sound so introspective here when they could, and occasionally do, sound world-beating.</p></div>"|12697.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12697-the-mountain/|6.5|Jason Crock

But when Edmonton quintet Faunts released theirs (the imaginatively titled <em>Faunts Remixed</em>) late last year, it was a logical continuation of a process that began with 2006's <em>M4EP</em>, which saw the band's hazy sprawl refashioned into extended electronic-based workouts. Now, Faunts' second full-length, <em>Feel. Love. Thinking. Of</em>., provides greater evidence that the remix project helped not simply to reconstuct the band's back catalogue, but the group itself: slow-motion shoegazers reborn as purveyors of luminous and deeply affecting electronic pop.</p><p>There is, of course, precedent for this sort of evolution-- most notably, Joy Division's transition into New Order. But beyond a surface stylistic debt, Faunts share with their Manchester forbears the ability to vividly reflect their surrounding urban environment in their music. If you've never spent a winter in Edmonton-- a sizeable but geographically remote city in central Alberta-- <em>Feel. Love. Thinking. Of</em>. reconstructs the sensation well, with an austere presentation that effectively puts the ""ice"" in isolation, but infused with beautifully melancholic melodies that beg for the thaw.</p><p>Part and parcel of this transfromation is the promotion of the voice from obscured, textural detail to emotional focal point, with Faunts' trio of singers-- brothers Steven and Tim Batke, and Paul Amusch-- stepping up to join Junior Boys' Jeremy Greenspan and the Notwist's Markus Acher in the pantheon of sad-robot balladeers. And like those bands, Faunts' production intricacy is nicely complemented by their emotional simplicity: While the pulse-quickening opening title track approximates the rush of a burgeoning romance, second song ""Input"" has already fast-forwarded to relationship's end, the emotional stagnation and disconnect echoed by a skittering beat that struggles to cohere into a groove.</p>
<p>But rather than play on typical human-vs-synthetic dynamics, Faunts score their most moving performances when their singers are at their most numb, and must rely on technology to fill in the blanks: the effects-pedal fireworks that close out the haunting ""Lights Are Always On"", or the quivering, pitch-shifted synth line that essentially serves as the wordless chorus for Amusch's ""It Hurts Me All the Time""-- a track that, for all the contemporary bands dancing on Joy Division's grave, is one of the few to capture the glacial beauty of ""Love Will Tear Us Apart.""</p>
<p>For an album mostly preoccupied with cataloguing past relationships and the mistakes that did them in, it follows that <em>Feel. Love. Thinking. Of</em>. would manifest those feelings with nostalgic sounds, some welcome (""Das Malfitz"", which reimagines Pink Floyd's ""Another Brick in The Wall, Pt. 1"" as a vintage Detroit-techno track),  others less so (the too-slick guitar riff underpinning ""I Think I'll Start a Fire"" that sounds like an attempt to further last fall's unwanted Fixx resurgence). And if the album's more languorous second side serves up too much wallow and not enough wallop, it could just be a strategy to make closer ""Explain"" feel all the more euphoric: with a fade-in a la New Order's ""Temptation"", the song springs forth on a sunset-bound motorik beat and waves of rippling guitar riffs that carry with them the promise to leave all those doomed romances, regrets, and miserable winters behind. This year in Edmonton, spring comes early.</p></div>"|12701.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12701-feel-love-thinking-of/|7.2|Stuart Berman

Startling, too-- at least considering her background in the Fall-meets-Melt-Banana noise-punk group Scissor Girls and the no-wavey Bride of No No, who were about as far from the pristine smoothness of <em>Aja</em> as you could get. Unlikely as the source may have been, 2003's ballad-wracked <em>Enantiodromia </em>and the following year's marginally poppier <em>Life on the Fly </em>(which actually went so far as to mimic the cover-art aesthetic of <em>Countdown to Ecstasy</em>) were likeably skewed mutations of Walter Becker and Donald Fagen's sardonic, piano-driven jazz-rock, right down to Azita's outsized caricature of the latter's hiccupy vocal tendencies.</p><p>But Azita Youseffi seems to have gotten most of the ""Doctor Wu"" out of her system for <em>How Will You?</em>, a more traditional (if subtly unnerving) take on cabaret-pop. It's harder to pinpoint a singular aesthetic here-- she's expanded the range of her voice, settling into a more comfortable and subtle series of melodies that still retains some of her unique character, and she's branched out into a broader array of musical styles that give her more room to stretch out her compositional artfulness. Ideally, this expanded palette would sound like a breakthrough for an artist once constrained by a more specific frame of reference, yet still retain fans who enjoy piano lounge music transformed into brooding strangeness.</p><p>The problem is that, musically, it's a bit too polite: the jazz-rock influence is still evident on ""Things Gone Wrong"", but it sounds a little mannered, more in the vein of Ben Folds Five's arch faux-cheeriness than the moody melancholy of her last two albums. ""Scylla and Charybdis"" boasts the most startling vocal performance on the record-- an aching, keening wail that evokes Debbie Harry undergoing a complete nervous breakdown-- but that vocal has to carry the entire song, since it's backed by a listlessly strummed acoustic guitar that might as well be an afterthought. And even with only nine songs on the album, she goes to the well more than once on one idea: The early 1970s post-Beatles mode of ""I'm Happy""-- think Badfinger in their more downtempo moments-- is a compelling-enough opener, but then it's practically reprised, with only a couple of chord changes and some additional atmospherics, two tracks later on ""Away"".</p>
<p>The compelling moments are there if you're patient. ""Come William"" is a wintry, slow-build piece that pits a brisk, intense piano against an otherwise-elegaic arrangement, and the gradual shift in ""Laughter Again"" from lonely-sounding early Joni Mitchell balladry to vigorous alt-country-tinged guitar rock should make Neko Case fans happy. But most of the appeal to this album will be in Azita's voice and lyrics, which are accessibly versatile and somewhat impenetrable, respectively. It's saying a lot that she can make some of this stuff work; lines like ""Hey you with the lightning eyes and the starry fate"" (""Things Gone Wrong"") and ""Bonafide when the summer calls the tune/ In pale alabaster"" (""Laughter Again"") read a bit like bogus poetry without her alluringly sharp/sweet voice to back it up, and it's easy to drift away from listening to what she's singing in favor of the way she sings it. If this album evokes anything, lyrically or otherwise, it's the feelings that arise when love and ambivalence cross paths, maybe best personified in the last line of ""Come William"": ""I don't want to mean or believe or seem anything/ Only want to carry along."" Maybe that's why so much of <em>How Will You?</em> sounds only halfway captivating.</p></div>"|12700.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12700-how-will-you/|5.7|Nate Patrin

<p>Condon's self-confessed Francophile leanings still run strong, particularly in his Jacques Brel-meets-Serge Gainsbourg vocal delivery, and Balkan folk patterns continue to remain at the core of his musical references. Yet his flourishing interest in Mexican wedding and funeral music, highlighted by the animated huffs and puffs of a ""barely rehearsed"" brass band, inevitably takes these recordings somewhere different. <i>March of the Zapotec</i> is the sound of a musician continuing to evolve and, most importantly, allowing himself to be persuaded by his inspirations without losing sight of his own creative personality. Like many young, culture-hungry travelers, Condon seems to be embracing as much as possible, re-shaping his interior musical landscape as he continues to learn the tricks of the trade from masters and street performers in various parts of the world.</p>
<p>Just as Mexican funerals are known not only for reflection and mourning but also for the celebration of life, the six songs that comprise <i>March of the Zapotec</i> sound as joyous as they do melancholy. The jolly three-step-waltz of ""La Llorona"" and ""The Shrew"" wouldn't sound out of place on a soundtrack to Emir Kusturica's dark and memorably shambolic wedding scene in the film <i>Black Cat, White Cat</i>. ""The Akara"" is similarly expressive, introduced by a bold but despondent trumpet fanfare that slips into a lively melody as Condon sings through his malaise, ""so long, my fate has changed, it's hindering.""</p>
<p>But <i>March of the Zapotec</i> is just one half of this intriguing and disparate 2xEP. The second is very different, and closer in sound to Condon's pre-Beirut bedroom recordings, when he went under the alias Realpeople. Having spent years making electronic music as a teenager before focusing on the elaborate acoustic inventions he is now known for as Beirut, it seems only natural for Condon's older methods to finally see the light of day. Although he has more than proved his mettle as a masterful, highly visionary musician, it will perhaps be a relief to fans of Beirut that <i>Holland</i> does not feel out of place beside the material that initially drew Condon to popular attention. It is after all, an extension of an already strong musical direction or, in his words, ""different aspects of my personality.""</p>
<p>These five songs, mostly recorded alone, begin with the lyrically superb ""My Night With the Prostitute From Marseille"" and take more than a few notes from the Magnetic Fields and, perhaps a little surprisingly, Boards of Canada. ""Venice"", with its dreamily atmospheric intro, which gracefully crackles in the background like old letters burning on a fire, is a fine example of Condon's apparent knack for constructing a home-- whether permanent or temporary-- on a wide range of melodic turf.</p>
<p>As a concept, this EP could be seen as rather puzzling with its marrying of such stylistically different material. However, listening to the two discs back to back allows insight into the development of Condon's burgeoning ideas. Rather than re-tracing the path that made him popular, he has hacked into the wilderness of his new inspirations, no matter how divergent, and emerged triumphant. As another of his favorite French luminaries, Jean-Luc Godard, once famously said: ""It's not where you take things from, it's where you take them to.""</p></div>"|12689.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12689-march-of-the-zapotec-holland/|8.1|Mia Clarke

The combination of self-loathing, female troubles, and stress-fueled antagonism in his lyrics could be off-putting to heads whether they liked Mos Def or UGK, and for a while Sean Daley seemed to revel in it, like he knew that the backlash against his growing modest-scale fame was pre-ordained. He responded with a sort of self-effacing rope-a-dope strategy, putting together a portfolio of tracks filled with a conceptual hook of Slug as Dickhead, as though it'd mollify the skeptical listeners who already harbored that suspicion. Of course, he also offset that with an increasing amount of humorous good will and been-there sympathy (something last year's <i>When Life Give You Lemons, You Paint That Shit Gold</i> thrived on). From the first-track get-go of ""Trying to Find a Balance"", from 2003's <i>Seven's Travels</i>, he really started to master the process of fine-tuning his lyrical persona until he made it, if not always likeable, at least easier to imagine having an empathetic beer with.</p>
<p>That makes the re-release of 2002's cusp-of-fame album <i>God Loves Ugly</i> stand out that much more as a grim, almost completely joyless anomaly in Atmosphere's discography. While the melancholy and broken-up bummer-rap Slug became (in)famous for was manifest on 2000's <i>Lucy</i> and <i>Ford One &amp; Two</i> EPs, it didn't dominate nearly as much as it did on this follow-up album. <i>God Loves Ugly</i> is propelled almost completely by a mixture of distrust and anger, which makes it a difficult listen for reasons almost completely unrelated to Slug's talent. It's not that he isn't good at what he does here, or that he doesn't have good beats to accompany him; he is and he does. It's that he's so in tune with a specifically bleak, hostile, and borderline self-destructive character. Add some of the sparest, gloomiest beats Ant's ever put together-- glowering dub on ""Blamegame""; half-gothic stagger-step boom-bap on ""The Bass and the Movement"" and ""Flesh""; post-RZA soul melancholy throughout -- and you'd have to be in a rarified state of misery to actually get the most out of listening to it.</p>
<p>Most of what you need to know about the defensive-slash-aggressive tone of the album comes in most tracks' first lines: ""We came here to slit your throat""; ""I wear my scars like the rings on a pimp""; ""She abandoned me, left me out in the cold/ No surprises, I guess that's how it goes"". Hell, the first moments of the album consist of a couple girls chanting ""you're so ugly, you're so ugly"" (to Slug, or the listener?) and Slug snarling the name of his group a couple times before barking ""Atmosphere, and maybe you don't like us."" Atmosphere was still in the process of building their national following and solidifying their craft when <i>God Loves Ugly </i>was being recorded, and whether Slug's sour tone was the direct result of some real-life personal struggles or just their first really ambitious concept record-- or maybe a bit of both-- it set the tone for many of the preconceptions and misconceptions that would follow him throughout his career.</p>
<p>The two major targets of Slug's angst on this album are women and himself. If anything offsets whatever potential misogyny might be in that lyrical turf it's the fact that it's not entirely clear who's at fault. ""Fuck you, Lucy, for defining my existence,"" he shouts in ""F*@K You Lucy"", and it's harder to tell if he's angrier at her for fucking up his love life or himself for obsessing over it. (Maybe he was predicting how many people would start seeing him as ""that dude who always raps about that girl who left him."") He's a bit more glib and casual about his stressed-out love life elsewhere, like the admission on ""Saves the Day"" that ""I sleep next to women that I don't deserve/ They like to hurt my pride while I work their nerves."" And even when he tries to play slick, like he does on  standout single ""Modern Man's Hustle"", he does so in a way that reveals he still can't quite let go and that he wants to make things right again. Shit, maybe it's just god and/or fate that's to blame for fucking everything up anyways: the only people who really seem to hit it off without a hitch on this record are the two partygoers in ""Hair,"" and they die in a fatal car crash in the last line.</p>
<p>Aside from that, there's the haters and the doubters and the nameless targets of various dick-based trauma who earn Slug's wrath for being in his way on tracks like ""The Bass and the Movement"" and ""Blamegame"". Those moments feel kind of weird, since time's shown Slug to be more gifted as a smartass than a hardass, and they don't quite ring as true as the times where he focuses more abstracted variations of his frustration on post-9/11 paranoia (""Vampires"") or ruminates on his potential post-death legacy (""Lovelife""). Since this reissue throws in the tour video diary <i>Sad Clown Bad Dub 4</i>-- labeled with the tongue-in-cheek disclaimer ""the camera followed us around… so we smiled a little more than normal""-- it's easier to see where Atmosphere were headed once they got this catharsis out of their system: with that much success in front of you, all that anger doesn't seem so damn serious anymore.</p></div>"|12680.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12680-god-loves-ugly/|6.6|Nate Patrin

I'm sure I'm not alone. Irishman who sang proto-punk ""Gloria"" and drunken dorm-formal singalong ""Brown Eyed Girl"" and went on to do <em>Moondance</em> goes into a midtown Manhattan studio with top-notch jazz sessionmen. Pours out stream-of-consciousness stuff about love, rebirth, and a pain that passes all understanding, in an impressionistic folk-jazz-blues idiom that transcends existing rock conventions. Nobody buys it. A decade later, Lester Bangs calls <em>Astral Weeks</em> ""a mystical document."" In 1995, <em>MOJO</em> ranks it the #2 album of all time; eight years later, <em>Rolling Stone</em> ranks it #19; in between, damn thing finally goes gold. To a hopeless romantic, what's not to love?</p><p>Only <em>Astral Weeks</em> the album could live up to <em>Astral Weeks</em> the legend. A 23-year-old Van Morrison howls, he hollers, he cajoles, he grabs hold of the ineffable and caresses its edges, bending and reiterating it like an instrumental virtuoso. Guitarist Jay Berliner (Charles Mingus' <em>The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady</em>), bassist Richard Davis (Eric Dolphy's <em>Out to Lunch</em>), and drummer Connie Kay (of the Modern Jazz Quartet) create an improvisatory space for Morrison's haunted freeform meditations; Larry Fallon's overdubs add strings, woodwinds, and harpsichord. You breathe in you breathe out, baby baby baby, way upon way upon, dry your eye your eye your eye, too late to stop now, the love that loves the love that loves the love that loves the love that loves to love the love that loves to love the love that loves, I know you're dying. The legend is <em>with</em> the album, and the legend <em>is</em> the album.</p><p><em>Astral Weeks Live at the Hollywood Bowl</em> was a pair of concerts held last year at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles, honoring the legendary album (scheduled to be reprised February 27 and 28 at New York's Theater at Madison Square Garden). Now <em>Astral Weeks Live at the Hollywood Bowl </em>is also an album honoring the shows that honored that legendary album. Sadly, one thing that this record isn't: legendary.<em></em></p>
<p><em>Astral Weeks</em> was released 40 years, almost to the day, before Van Morrison performed the whole thing live two straight nights last November. ""We did the songs and took them somewhere else. Transcended the originals, if you know what I mean."" That's Morrison talking to the Associated Press recently. The shows featured guitarist Berliner from the 1968 sessions, along with other previous Morrison collaborators and a full string section; they were generally well-reviewed. As recorded on <em>Astral Weeks Live at the Hollywood Bowl</em>, the performances retain the improvisatory approach from the record, right down to changing the song order-- the all-loving, possibly transvestite-themed, vaguely pro-civil-rights hymn ""Madame George"" now closes, rather than atmospheric mortality rumination ""Slim Slow Slider"". There's much rejoicing.</p>
<p>I guess you had to be there. On disc, <em>Astral Weeks Live at the Hollywood Bowl</em> is a bland, bluesy celebration you can afford to miss. Oh, it still consists mostly of great songs-- the two ""bonus"" tracks slightly less so-- performed with skill, and recorded at fine quality, but it's hard to imagine why anyone other than souvenir-seekers or live-music absolutists would need to listen to this more than once as long as the original LP remains in print. An album brave enough to embrace life in all its ugliness and anguish, right on through to its inevitable end, becomes just another document of the rock'n'roll generation's stubborn confidence it will outlive itself. Sort of like those Dick Clark teeth on the cover.</p>
<p>""I believe I've transcended,"" Morrison sings on an extended outro to the opening, title track. ""Slim Slow Slider"" is now jammy, incongruously upbeat, fixed in time and place by the live audience-- some guy loudly cheers the song's placement after a newly percussion-crowded ""Beside You"". An ignoble thunk disrupts the harpsichord in the left speaker near the start of ""Cyprus Avenue"", which now inexplicably follows swinger ""The Way Young Lovers Do""-- and lacks the dramatic, showstopping interlude described by Bangs, documented on 1974's <em>It's Too Late to Stop Now</em> live LP. Morrison's voice here is heavier, still distinguished, but as he slurs his way through the ordinarily sublime verses of ""Sweet Thing"" before breaking off for a superfluous harmonica solo, this much is clear: A work of art can withstand the ages. People never do.</p>
<p>A high point is ""Ballerina"", the possibly prostitute-themed song where Morrison's voice sounds richer and fuller; his growled ""get on up!"" evokes both James Brown and Morrison's own Brown-esque ""good God!"" barks back in his youth. ""Madame George"" ends with Morrison's communal invocation to ""get on the train""-- well, actually, it ends with some hokey guy shouting Van Morrison's name over and over into a microphone. Still, better than the drippy bonus track version of ""Listen to the Lion"", originally from <em>St. Dominic's Preview</em>, where the same dude bellows, ""Vaaaan Morrison! The one! The only!"" as a saxophone hits barge-like brown notes. If it sounds like I'm overstating my complaints, it's only because listening side by side with <em>Astral Weeks</em> can't help but magnify them. You don't need <em>Pet Sounds Live</em>, either.</p>
<p>There's a case to be made that <em>Astral Weeks</em>, the album, never quite captured <em>Astral Weeks</em>, the idea. Morrison has complained about producer Lewis Merenstein's chosen running order. Then again, he has also denigrated his accompanists and described <em>Astral Weeks</em> as a ""rock opera"". The repetitions in Morrison's songs carry over to his discography: Prior to <em>Astral Weeks</em>, he recorded <em>other</em> studio versions of ""Madame George"" and ""Beside You"". A 10-minute ""Slim Slow Slider"" was supposedly edited down to 3:18; nothing's set in stone. OK, so maybe what <em>Astral Weeks</em> represents to so many of us <em>can't</em> be perfectly recorded, whether on vinyl or in 1s and 0s-- definitely not in words. But I can feel it in my bones when I listen to the original album (turn it up, so you know it's got soul). When I listen to <em>Astral Weeks Live at the Hollywood Bowl</em>, I just feel lonely, and old.</p></div>"|12688.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12688-astral-weeks-live-at-the-hollywood-bowl/|4.5|Marc Hogan

Locomotives have inspired scores of country and western songs from ""Waiting for a Train"" to ""Let the Train Blow the Whistle"", which have made them metaphors for loneliness, wanderlust, death, freedom, imprisonment, and so on and so forth. Possibly only zombies have more allegorical potential. Hammond's day-job band, the Old 97s, is named after a train song (""Wreck of the Old 97""), and his first album as a solo artist, <em>I Don't Know Where I'm Going But I'm on My Way,</em> is a collection of originals and mostly covers that employ trains as vehicles for a spiritual journey, casting life's tribulations (Hammond's: the death of his father, the hard times in the Old 97s) as treacherous mountain passes and arduous treks along miles of tracks until it reaches a heavenly destination. It can be heavy listening, but Hammond's ear for odd, droning soundscapes, his fondness for shuffling brushed-snare beats, and his liberal take on old songs lend it a sense of real discovery.</p><p>This is an album steeped in history, but not beholden to it. Hammond takes liberties with these tunes, showing himself to be a curious sonic tinkerer. In retrospect, he seems an underutilized presence in the Old 97s, where he is overshadowed by frontman Rhett Miller. But <em>I Don't Know Where I'm Going</em> sounds more musically adventurous than anything that band has ever done, despite Hammond's reliance on traditional tunes. The album opens with Texas jackleg preacher George Washington Phillips' ""What Are They Doing in Heaven Today?"", which Hammond turns into a Jimmie Rodgers-style yodel. The Carter Family's ""I Never Will Marry"" descends from Appalachia for a high lonesome sound that's as flat as a Texas plain, and Hammond draws three train songs (""Life Is Like a Mountain Railroad"", ""You Will Often Meet Obstruction"", ""As You Roll Across the Trestle"") from a work by renowned Mormon poet Eliza R. Snow. But his greatest risk may be the ""Satan, Your Kingdom Must Come Down"" triptych, which begins as an instrumental performed on a homemade kit banjo, transforms into a strange reading of scripture (man's prayer in one ear, God's answer in the other), and ends as a stalwart reading of the hymn.</p><p>Covers dominate the album, nodding to country-music and railroad history, but Hammond includes a few originals that stand up alongside his best work with the 97s (namely, ""Valentine"" and ""Crash on the Barrelhead""). ""Wreck of the 97"" is a pensive account of tough times in that band, with Hammond's vocal phrasing rushing the song forward at a pace just shy of reckless. <em>I Don't Know Where I'm Going</em> closes with two of his best compositions: ""Other, Younger Days"" places a major-key acoustic guitar over a droning harmonium (recalling his track on the <em>Teach Me to Sing</em> compilation) to create a sense of wide-open space, with Hammond's vocals drenched in reverb, and on the spare ""I Believe, I Believe"" his high, keening yodel-- so searching earlier in the album-- sounds contented and fulfilled, as if he has finally reached the end of the line.</p></div>"|12626.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12626-i-dont-know-where-im-going-but-im-on-my-way/|7.7|Stephen M.

Instead, the Georgia five-piece receives perfect marks for settling on a name that reads exactly like what it implies: the first in what is sure to be a wave of new, poker-hot bands that puree alt-country tropes together with the muddy crash of grunge-- specifically in the unmistakable, steamrolling style of a one Kurt Donald Cobain. They are a band out of time, not place.<br/><br/>Snatched up last year by the same Gary Gersh that signed Sonic Youth and Nirvana to Geffen Records in the early 1990s, the Atlanta-via-Augusta (via-Aberdeen, har) quintet's riff formulas are throwbacks on many a level. Recorded in the Austin studio wherein <em>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</em>'s grisly sound effects were captured, the fusion wears its stitching well. Much of the arranged marriage between grunge and Southern-rock figures feels spurred on not by any subtle deviation in sonics, but the inescapable way in which frontman Hardy Morris pitches his fits. As soon as the first riffs of opener ""Heavy Petting"" kick tires, Morris looses Cobain-ified moans with a twist: drawl. Sure, there's the seductive blend of country-fried guitar tones and steel-mimicking wails any MMJ or even Band of Horses fan might jump at. But it's the all-too-familiar way Morris lacerates his vocal cords that glues it all together so powerfully. During the minor chord writhing of ""Start Me Laughing"", Morris' cribbing of Cobain comes dangerously close to tracing the bloody coughing of <em>Bleach</em>'s ""School"". And if you recall that classic CD's closing track (er, ""Downer""), you should have a pretty good idea as to the origins of Dead Confederate's lyrical aims.<br/><br/>The songs, penned primarily by Morris, have a darkness to match the tar-black, wind-through-dead trees arrangements. In the drag of ""Goner"", one of <em>Wrecking Ball</em>'s shortest (and most direct) cuts, Morris returns time and again to a chorus that colors all sides of the record: ""I could be gone, you would never know."" Short and not so sweet, but that's just fine. Album centerpiece, single, and religious right invective ""The Rat"", finds all of these elements in a perfectly formed storm of tears and suds. And while ""All The Angels"" briefly lets a bit of light peek through, it shuts it out just as quickly. When one slaps loner angst like this on top of coiled chord progressions, the result can't feel like anything but a drawn-out gutting.<br/><br/>Ultimately, <em>Wrecking Ball</em>'s successes holler at the kind of new genre hybridization that's become all the more welcome as early 90s alt-rock anthems take their seats in the classic rock pantheon. But the quiet-loud-quiet-loud dynamics and turgid crunch taste and feel just like middle school. And even if that weren't the case, it's safe to say we've heard aches like just these before. That was then, and this isn't a good kind of hurt. </p></div>"|12675.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12675-wrecking-ball/|5.7|David Bevan

So part of me wants to apologize for racking up more plays from the Lonely Island's <i>Incredibad</i> than any other album this year. I feel like a nerd. But I think the Lonely Island have found a populist way to elicit the same nerd thrills one would get from the best sketches from ""The State"" or ""Upright Citizens Brigade"".</p>
<p>Comedy fans first noticed the Lonely Island's Andy Samberg, Jorma Taccone, and Akiva Schaffer when their series, ""The 'Bu"" debuted on Channel101.com, a site that pushes or pulls comedy shorts based on viewer votes. Because they came from the web, Lonely Island's ""Saturday Night Live"" work understands viral video, so much so that the bulk of their audience may come days or weeks after the original air date. That contributes to the stickiness of their videos. Lonely Island's digital shorts don't care about the instant gratification of ""SNL""'s premise-based sketches (a gratification so instant it usually ends minutes before the sketch does). They're more interested in sustained laughs, clinging tenaciously to tangents, or using repetition to unfold a new layer of weirdness in each iteration. All of those traits apply to their musical shorts, and thus to their first major release, <i>Incredibad</i>. (The album also comes with a DVD of shorts, everything you've seen on ""SNL"" except ""Iran So Far"" and ""I'm on a Boat"", plus two older Lonely Island videos, ""Just 2 Guyz"" and ""Bing Bong Brothers"". ""Just 2 Guyz"" gets remade as ""We Love Sportz"" on <i>Incredibad</i>, but the amazingly awkward original remains the better track.)</p>
<p><i>Incredibad</i> seems unique among musical comedy projects. Production and delivery-wise, ""Lazy Sunday"" and ""On a Boat"" are honest-to-goodness hip-hop tracks. But if you think the target of the satire is hip-hop itself, you're missing the point. Lonely Island don't sell genre parody or irony. These dudes, particularly beatmaker Jorma Taccone (who often writes with his brother Asa Taccone), are obviously hip-hop fans, as <i>Incredibad </i>is appreciative homage, more Beastie Boys than (simply) white and nerdy.</p>
<p>That's not always true. Sometimes part of the joke is the contrast between the singer's subject matter and their delivery, (""Lazy Sunday"", ""Natalie's Rap"") though the latter is really all about character destruction, not parody. Most of their jokes come inside the lyrics. Even ""Ras Trent"", their riff on trustafarians, is more about lines like ""Me toil part-time at ja Cold Stone Creamery"" than Rastafarianism itself.</p>
<p>Although ""Dick in a Box"" and others are available online, the album-only tracks make it worth getting<i> Incredibad</i>, instead of firing up Hulu.com. ""Like a Boss"" and ""Dreamgirl"" [ft. Norah Jones] deserve video treatment on ""SNL"", but both are hilarious on their own. Like their best, ""SNL""-aired material, these songs get better as they go on, mostly because of the way the lyrics carry the joke to its logical and grotesque endpoint. ""Like a Boss"" begins making fun of Rick Ross and Slim Thug (""Talk to corporate (like a boss)/ Approve memos (like a boss),"" but ends with the singer fucking a giant fish, turning into a jet, and crashing into the sun.</p>
<p>Absurdity is the Lonely Island's strongest suit, and thus, the premise-based songs sometimes fall flat. E-40, playing Carlos Santana on ""Santana DVX"", puts in the funniest verse on this premisey song, but Jack Black can't save the guys' one joke on ""Sax Man"". Also, the dudes found another way to respect their favorite genre: Their between-song skits aren't very funny.</p>
<p>The Lonely Island understand repetition and exaggeration. On SNL, that was most apparent in their ""Dear Sister"" sketch, its melodramatic, ""O.C.""-savaging death scene iterations getting funnier and funnier. On<i> Incredibad</i> it's the ""boiled goose"" line on ""Boombox"", the endlessly repeated chorus of ""I'm on a boat!"" from ""I'm on a Boat"". Basic comedy stuff, sure, but the guys also have a good sense of when to quit (see also the ""cool beans"" segment in ""Hot Rod""). Maybe it's that same sense of rhythm that guides their songwriting. Maybe that makes this comedy music, instead of musical comedy, because it's hard to tell which one's modifying the other. Still, good timing's good timing.</p></div>"|12690.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12690-incredibad/|7.7|Jessica Suarez

That entry was quickly deleted, signaling either a renewed commitment to songcraft or a realization that he's more qualified to be a singer-songwriter than anything else. So perhaps his impending nuptials are the reason for the more-intense-than-usual weirdness emanating from Camp Adams and for <i>Extra Cheese</i>, an iTunes-only EP featuring six previously released songs and a studio version of an obscure, 10-year-old live track. Ostensibly this collection of babymaking music is a Valentine's Day tie-in, but it might double as a mixtape to the future Mrs. Adams. Or triple as a sort of non-chronological career retrospective-- a greatest-hits package with no actual hits.<br/><br/>As such, <i>Extra Cheese</i> is fairly thorough, drawing from nearly every stage of his Universal/Lost Highway career. So there's no Whiskeytown or <i>Heartbreaker</i>, which is a shame, but also no <i>Rock N Roll </i>or <i>29</i>, which is a relief. Instead, the EP culls from <i>Gold</i>, <i>Demolition</i>, <i>Cold Roses</i>, <i>Easy Tiger,</i> <i>Follow the Lights</i>, and <i>Cardinology</i>-- arguably the highlights of his tenure at the labels. ""Two"" may be the best song here and one of his best songs period, with a strong hook justifying the laidback vibe and Adams' voice mixing nicely with Sheryl Crow's. It actually could have been a hit, or at least the soundtrack for a sappy TV drama (oh wait, it was). ""Answering Bell"", from his would-be breakout <i>Gold</i>, is less impressive. Adams affects his vocals mawkishly, the band pales next to the more inventive Cardinals, and hey, is that Hold Steady tourmate Adam Duritz singing backup? ""Blossom"", which is not about the 1990s sitcom, hails from deep within Adams' short-lived Grateful Dead phase with a steeply ascending hook that shoots for pretty but comes off as gangly. <br/><br/>As <i>Extra Cheese</i> proceeds, Adams strips away the instruments until only he, an acoustic guitar, and a harmonica remain. ""Desire"" sounds like it was scribbled on a Waffle House napkin at 2 a.m., then stuffed into his jeans pocket until he discovered it weeks later and hit ""&lt;RECORD&gt;"". It feels lived in and off-the-cuff-- a setting where Adams shines-and after so many full-band tracks, its modesty is refreshing and reassuring. ""Evergreen"" and ""My Love for You Is Real"" both reach for the same intimacy, but like much of Adams' recent material, they sound too slick and deliberate. Finally, there's ""Hey There Mrs. Lonely"", which is only sorta new: The song first appeared on the bootleg <i>Live at Almost Blue in 1999</i>, recorded around the time Whiskeytown disbanded. Even on this studio version, with its double-tracked vocals and intertwining guitars, ""Hey There"" remains spare and melodic, but the young Adams' lyrics overreach: ""I'm the plastic three-inch armies you destroyed,"" he sings. ""I'm the monster underneath your bed you ain't afraid of yet.""<br/><br/>What makes ""Hey There Mrs. Lovely"" stand out isn't its newness, but the hints of conflict and lust mixed in among the childhood metaphors. There's no real angst and very little desperation in these songs; instead, a general neediness permeates <i>Extra Cheese</i>, trying to pass itself off as heart-on-sleeve earnestness. But Adams is much more interesting when he's writing and singing about romantic confusion than when he's pledging his desire and devotion, and he gets no points for acknowledging his schmaltziness with that tongue-in-cheek EP title. This drowsy set of songs may represent the mainstream crossover Adams aspires to be, but it gives little clue to the complex artist he actually is.</p></div>"|12687.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12687-extra-cheese-ep/|4.1|Stephen M.

Walter Kammermeier and Arno Merziger of Booka Shade, the crown jewel of their Berlin label Get Physical, have built a loyal following from their globe-hopping career as a DJ duo. Fans wondering if the atmosphere and groove could transfer found on <em>Memento</em>, their impressively cohesive electro-house debut, were pleased that it did. Not so in last year's <em>The Sun &amp; the Neon Light</em>, which skipped schizophrenically between uptempo spark and downtempo fizzle. For the most part, the record was greeted with furrowed brows and question marks.</p><p>This should not have come as a shock. At its core, the expansive sound of Booka Shade is marked by restraint and repose, not trance's rollercoaster crests and troughs. <em>Movements </em>was a show-stopper, but it is hard to deny that, apart from ""In White Rooms"", the album's Apollonian cool doesn't make it easy to work into hot-blooded Dionysian DJ sets. The slower tempos and softer beats didn't stop there. Listeners discovered that the elegant lightness of the first two LPs was also missing in the recent <em>The Sun &amp; the Neon Light</em>, which had a languorous density that brought to mind Cluster, Depeche Mode, and the Orbital of <em>Snivilisation </em>and <em>In Sides</em>. There will always be a gulf between Booka Shade the DJs and Booka Shade the recording artists; as it widens, the gulf is merely being enshrined in their new compilation.</p><p>""Outskirts"", the first track from their last record, opens this collection as well. Recast by Trentemoller, the relatively conventional, slow-burning original morphs into a cosmic journey, proceeding at trip-hop speed into space-western territory. It seems to be the perfect entryway into a compilation clumsily dubbed <em>Cinematic Shades (The Slow Songs)</em>. All the looped bloops and blips of digital percussion on the <em>Movements</em> version of ""Night Falls"" withdraw, in the Larry Gold reimagining here, to the wings. What's left isn't so much the orchestral maneuvers of Philly International disco baroque, but instead something closer to, believe it or not, a Van Dyke Parks arrangement: layers of violin given to peppy flutter and assertive stabs.</p>
<p>These are the strong points. Six tracks are filed as <em>Cinematic Shades</em> edits, over half of which we encountered over the past few years. Obviously we heard the title track of the last album on, you know, the last album, but we also heard, for instance, ""Outskirts (Cinematic Shades Edit)"" there as well, billed simply as ""Outskirts"". So plainly the problem with <em>Cinematic Shades</em> isn't the aesthetic: as far as chillout records go, this one operates a very high level of artistry and sonic detail-- though it isn't unreasonable to bemoan a stylistic slip from Berlin's warehouses toward Washington D.C.'s Eighteenth Street Lounge. Most long for the old Metro Area vibes of <em>Memento</em>'s ""Vertigo"" or <em>Movement</em>s' ""Night Falls"". The problem is that we have heard these before, not the general sound but specifically <em>these </em>songs, and their resurfacing here will strike fans as unnecessary.</p></div>"|12679.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12679-cinematic-shades-the-slow-songs/|4.7|Roque Strew

And unlike Scarlett Johansson or Zooey Deschanel, it's not in part cuz he's pretty. <em>Nighttiming</em>, Schwartzman's 2007 multi-instrument-playing debut as Coconut Records, didn't meet with rapturous Interpraise, but it wasn't pummeled with virtual fruit, either. Hey, dude's Max Fischer-- he gets a pass. And, unlike most of his thespian peers, Schwartzman has played in bands longer than he's acted in films. Remember the theme to that Fox teen drama everyone used to watch before they watched ""Gossip Girl""? As Schwartzman deadpans on new Coconut Records album <em>Davy</em>, ""I was a drummer in a band that you've heard of""-- or at least, heard. The other reason the guy gets a pass? He doesn't totally suck.</p><p>Yeah, so it's a shin-high bar. But even pitting <em>Davy</em> against similar small-scale pop projects, it's a credible effort, laying claim to several instantly likeable, catchy songs indebted to the one-off British invasion cuts favored by director pal Wes Anderson, <em>Revolver</em>/<em>Sgt. Pepper's</em>-era Beatles, and the artists who revived those sounds in the 90s, like Weezer, Elliott Smith and Matthew Sweet. At its weakest (second-half tracks ""The Summer"" and ""I Am Young"" tread Olympic-sized pools of water) the tunes are never worse than forgettable. There's little ego-tripping to hate on, either. Schwartzman's face graces the album's cover, but it's etched with spidery white lines like someone's used it as a scratch pad. And while <em>Davy</em>'s lyrics are fed by a network of autobiographical arteries, this source material only fortifies the record's moderately angsty life-in-your-twenties concept with concrete, ground-level detail.</p><p>The aforementioned ""I Was a Drummer"" is probably Schwartzman at his most personal, but album opener ""Microphone"", with its pensive Elliott Smith-style acoustic guitar and piano arrangements and spot-on lyrics like ""I know that you're not coming home/ There's nowhere to park after it gets dark,"" is the one destined to join ""Heartless"", ""For Emma"", and some Flight of the Conchords track on 2009 breakup mixes. ""Saint Jerome""-- the album's best track-- pulses with ""A Day in the Life""'s jaunty rhythms, and despite (or perhaps because of) Schwartzman's limited vocal range, its ""Saint Jerome, I don't never ever want to be alone"" chorus is less agonized lament than laid-back, sun-baked musing.</p>
<p>Coconut Records, in fact, never suggests that much is at stake, and Schwartzman doesn't pull any muscles attempting to articulate strong feelings. Songs like ""Courtyard"" and ""Is This Sound Okay?"" are only ever just a little bummed out. Schwartzman neither leverages nor squanders his celebrity capital with this project, seeming content to play a modest guy with a guitar and a handful of hooks.</p></div>"|12677.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12677-davy/|5.9|Amy Granzin

But for DJ and music video director Alex Moulton, the two aren't mutually exclusive. As the founder of media production house Expansion Team, Moulton lords over scores of tightly wound marketing storylines for corporate clients like Target and McDonald's. His debut full-length <em>Exodus</em> gives him the freedom to confront those filmic aspects while wearing his DJ hat. With <em>Exodus</em>, Moulton constructs an instrumental science-fiction adventure that, unencumbered by lingual constraints, functions as a narrative mirror, its proggy signifiers pursuing only an obsessive sense of escapism.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">The single visual that accompanies <em>Exodus</em>, its cover, depicts such a sci-fi scene: A shirtless stud holds a damsel in distress, both suspended in time, frozen in flight from a fiery cityscape. The CD's label is a mockup of printed vinyl grooves. And from the first stabs of Moog arpeggios cutting across ""Overture"", the proverbial laser-stringed harp of Jean-Michel Jarre looms large. Moulton said of <em>Exodus</em>: ""I wanted to make something like a Pink Floyd record, where you put it on and you listen to the whole thing all the way through and it takes you on this crazy journey."" The nostalgia that he invokes is clearly the kind that imagined an analogue future.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">However, Moulton's idea of psychedelia is more Tangerine Dream's Klaus Schulze than Floyd's Roger Waters, embracing the Berlin school knob-twiddler conflict between man and machine rather than any Cambridge or Canterbury absurdity. In the course of <em>Exodus</em>, he bounces between his retro muse and one of its fast-forwarded descendents, filter disco, and the shadows of Daft Punk and Alan Braxe appear out of his gauzy synthesized lines in ""Out of Phase"", ""Meridians"", and ""Paradise"". Just as often, however, his dance beats give way to live drums and even tribal rhythms. Interludes play a central role in Moulton's story, linking nightclubby action scenes, otherworldly jungle chases (""The Sacrifice"") and somber love themes (""Together Again""). Indeed, the mood changes so drastically and so often-- nearly every song-- that it's sometimes hard to feel in tune with his greater conceit.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">That's one of the reasons why <em>Exodus</em> leaves so many unanswered questions. ""Exodus"" sounds like the climactic battle, and the final two cuts, ""Ad Astra"" (""to the stars"" in Latin) and ""L'Arc en Ciel"" (""the rainbow"" in French) hint at some sort of romantic transcendence, but Moulton leaves the details up to the listener. As its conceptual cousin <em>Interstella 5555</em> visually depicted, the success of an otherworldly storyline can't mask the awkward realities of his medium. <em>Exodus</em>'s 14 tracks and 68 minutes rise and fall like 14 little films, with the larger narrative rising almost exclusively from the songs' shared analog antiquity. Moulton's concept falters when the listener tries to piece these sensory experiences into a linear progression, but <em>Exodus</em> is still a fascinating and problematic listen as a whole. It's the individual works, however, that emerge as the stars of their own little show. In that sense, Moulton has not only met his goal of the simultaneous concept album and DJ mix-- he's exceeded it by light years.</p></div>"|12684.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12684-exodus/|6.9|Mike Orme

Spiegel is Spike Jonze's brother, and Gonzales is a pro skateboarder, so it stands to reason that they'd both know some famous people. But the sheer number and scope of guests on <i>The Spirit of Apollo</i> is just absurd. As the sticker on the cover proudly trumpets, the album features ""over 40 guest performances,"" and they come from all over the genre map. Plenty of the contributors here are the type who would show up to the studio if you promised them a half-empty bag of Doritos (looking at you, ca. 2009 David Byrne). But Spiegel and Gonzales have also corralled people like Tom Waits, Sizzla, Scarface: legends with uber-devoted core fanbases who don't <i>have</i> to guest on <i>anyone's</i> album, who only record collaborations when they feel like it. It's tough to calculate what combination of people skills, time management, and networking Spiegel and Gonzales must've put into this thing. They must have some really, really great Doritos.<br/><br/>But it would be nice if <i>The Spirit of Apollo</i> had a compelling reason to exist beyond just showing off these guys' Buddy Lists. Because this album is a mess. And worse than that, it's a directionless, vaguely condescending mess that wastes the talents of some people who really should've had better things to do. ""Music and art have the tremendous power of bringing people together, and this is our goal: To show through these mediums that we are all one race of human beings,"" say the liner notes. Which, okay, fine. Noble goal, even if it is the sort of thing that 10th-graders say when they're trying to sound sensitive. But when your idea of creating community is to mush artists of different genres together into a character-free paste, all you're really doing is making a good argument for genre xenophobia.<br/><br/>Spiegel and Gonzales are producers, and their beats on this album are total washed-out dorm-room funk, the sort of things that Prince Paul would've tossed in the garbage even at his <i>White People</i> nadir. ""The People Tree"" is an excessively polite bloopy organ groove. ""Way Down"" is the reason acid jazz no longer exists. ""Hip Hop"" is a horribly boring attempt at ca. 1998 sunny smiley-face West Coast indie-rap. And on it goes. These guys were too busy making friends to figure out how to make a beat knock.<br/><br/>And if you were wondering how they'd even find room to cram all these guests in, the answer is that they didn't, really. Seu Jorge gets reduced to David Byrne's backup singer, which, I mean, that guy was in <i>City of God</i>. Lykke Li sort of chirps underneath Santogold (who is now called Santigold), and you have to be concentrating hard to even hear her. About half the tracks feature consequence-free wickety-wickety scratch solos from vaguely famous turntablists.<br/><br/>And even when the guests actually get to make their voices heard, in most case they shouldn't have bothered. N.A.S.A.'s lighter-than-air uptempo beats have the unfortunate effect of making half the guest-rappers sound exactly like Chali 2na of Jurassic 5. And all I can say about that: If Chuck D shows up and it takes you a minute to realize that he's not Chali 2na, you've got a problem on your hands.<br/><br/>Another damning example: ""The Mayor"", buried near the end of the album. The last time Ghostface and Scarface showed up on the same track, it was on one of those goofy Kay Slay official mix albums. And Slay, not exactly known for his great instincts, at least had the good sense to give them a banging low-budget NY rap beat and a gimmicky song title (""Face Off"") and just let them rip. Spiegel and Gonzales give them a cluttered cartoon-funk beat and force them to share space with a DJ AM scratch-solo and the motherfucking Cool Kids. Even those of us who like the Cool Kids acknowledge that these guys don't have anything approaching the gravitas you need to share a mic with these two.<br/><br/>Look, it's not all terrible. On ""N.A.S.A. Music"", E-40 and Method Man manage to get a nice little back-and-forth going, and the beat, with its windy guitar and Afrobeat horn-stabs, stays out of the way. ""Gifted"" is a decent shot at glossy Richard X electro-pop, and Kanye West and Santigold handle it ably. M.I.A.'s chorus on ""Whachadoin?"" will not leave my head, ever. But I'm still planning on deleting the not-terrible tracks from my iTunes the second I turn this review in. Even the best of these songs are not worth the hard-drive real estate.<br/><br/>If anything, <i>The Spirit of Apollo</i> should serve as a cautionary tale. These clusterfuck all-the-cooks experiments, more often than not, add up to way, way less than the sum of their parts. It might look great on paper to get weirdo visionaries like Kool Keith and Tom Waits on the same track, but if you actually <i>do</i> it, you'll probably end up with Keith blathering non-sequiturs all over the beat while Waits makes sandpapery fart noises. And as for the impression of Donald Duck busting a nut that someone does at the end of ""O Pato"", I can't imagine that even looked good on paper.</p></div>"|12686.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12686-the-spirit-of-apollo/|1.6|Tom Breihan

An extraordinarily perceptive and sensitive song, especially coming from a 24-year-old, ""Outfit"" finds a working-class father lending advice to his rock star-wannabe son, narrating along the way his own story of teenage rebellion curtailed by the adult responsibilities he ultimately came to cherish.<br/><br/>""Don't sing with a fake British accent"" was one of dad's more memorable dictums, and regardless of how true-to-life ""Outfit"" may have been, it's a charge Isbell has taken to heart. During his five-plus years with the Truckers, Isbell impressively gained a songwriting reputation on par with the band's longtime principals, Patterson Hood and Mike Cooley. Yet while Hood's unconventionally hoarse yelp attracted twang-wary indie fans and Cooley's gunslinger drawl was irresistible no matter how you felt about country, Isbell's booming, manful voice irredeemably marked him out as the least hip of the Trucker singers for the duration of his stay. Being the overweight guy in the group for a spell probably didn't help either.<br/><br/>Even when Isbell slimmed down considerably, however, he still retained the voice of a guy who takes ham with every meal. When Isbell sings it's not hard to picture an artless blooze belter at some sadly anonymous roadhouse. Now add in the fact that since leaving DBT he's delved much more deeply in musically treacherous blues-rock waters than his erstwhile mates. What it all amounts to is a guy who has just released his second solo record in less than two years and who nonetheless seems destined to be eternally underrated. His occasional bar-band leanings may cause some to miss that Isbell is an invigorating songwriter and one of the better lyricists of his generation.<br/><br/>Indeed, Isbell has had trouble catching a break. His 2007 solo debut, <em>Sirens of the Ditch</em>, mildly disappointed some of his staunchest admirers with its lack of historical or regional specificity, spoiled as they were by the likes of DBT songs like ""Outfit"", ""Decoration Day"", ""Danko/Manuel"", and ""The Day John Henry Died"". Yet what Isbell's achieved over the course of that album and his self-titled newest is no less admirable for its paucity of proper nouns, finding unique ways to approach sex, politics, and isolation while delivering rousing, hooky rock'n'roll. So while ""Seven Mile Island"" does reference a real place, and ""However Long"" definitely does seem to reflect an Obama-spurred sense of societal optimism, they're not the album's real lyrical standouts. That honor belongs to the ruminative ""Streetlights"", which shows us an itinerant musician calling home from some faraway bar, and especially ""Soldiers Get Strange"", an utterly spellbinding snapshot of a serviceman who comes home from overseas and finds a return to marital sex and ""toeing civilian lines"" to be a psychological impossibility.<br/><br/>Many of the songs on Isbell's sophomore release don't necessarily aim for (or achieve) such profundity, yet they still compel through sheer verve and Isbell's unwillingness to let an unhip sound or idea discourage him. Sure, ""Blue"" sounds like Los Lonely Boys filtered through RHCP's ""Under the Bridge"", but it's still a damn fine song, Isbell showing off his ability to at least be evocatively oblique when he's not exactly hitting his lyrical mark. And if you're going to ape 1960s Stax soul, you might as well dive in headfirst like Isbell does on ""No Choice in the Matter"", an unrepentant throwback that nonetheless nails the warm horns and spindly guitar sound of a classic Otis session perfectly. Sometimes all that's needed is a big, singalong-ready chorus-- they're never as easy to craft as you think, yet Isbell delivers on ""Sunstroke"", the barnburning ""Good"", and especially ""Cigarettes and Wine"". The latter is just as much about faded male vitality as it is sex, drugs, and drink, and is hence destined to be a crowd-pleaser with those ruefully eyeing receding hairlines and spreading paunches. Yep, the only ""hip"" here is the aching one that's sooner or later going to need replacing.</p></div>"|12683.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12683-jason-isbell-and-the-400-unit/|7.4|Joshua Love

When Voigt's work started oozing out of electronic-music circles around the mid-1990s, the notion of German techno retained a significant aura of the exotic and the alien-- engaging with it was more difficult than simply administering a download queue.<br/><br/> Voigt's early records-- under aliases like Mike Ink, M:I:5, Gas, and Studio 1-- trafficked in variegated sounds that seemed to share a common project, most likely related to connecting the ineffable qualities of mystery to the strict constraints of structure. And then came offerings from his epochal labels Profan and Kompakt, which helped establish Voigt's hometown of Cologne as a fully functioning electronic-music lab with municipal interests. To legions of far-flung listeners reared on post-rock and curious about snatches of electronic music heard here and there (Autechre, Oval, Aphex Twin), Voigt played as a unique sort of techno ambassador. He was experimental but functionally inclined, meticulous but free, a spirited scenemaker whose singularity was hard to mistake.<br/><br/> The classic 12""s made under the name Studio 1 represent Voigt at his rigorous and minimalistic. Indeed, no history of minimal-techno could go long without acknowledging Voigt's debt. But <em>Studio 1</em> is more than a mere historical artifact, in part for the ways it continues to make the ""present"" its project.<br/><br/> One of Voigt's special touches as a producer is the way he articulates everything with a mix of delicacy and force that proves hard to pull apart. It's not far into ""Neu 1"", the first of 10 tracks collected here, when it becomes clear that very little, if anything, is going to change by track's end. (Voigt, in all his guises, is a serious maestro of repetition.) But with that realization comes the strange spectral thrill that attends paying attention to nothing beyond what is most fully and firmly in view. With no prospect of a soothing interlude or a dramatic drop in the offing, focus turns entirely to the <em>tss</em>-<em>tss</em> of the hi-hat, the roundness of a bassline, the clarity of the snare. <br/><br/> And from that follows a secondary realization that, in fact, <em>everything</em> is going to change, at least a little. ""Blau 2"" starts with the stoic sound of a warehouse party happening a couple of blocks away, before the steady accrual of minute details gives the whole thing a manic galloping energy. Tracks of that sort scan as ""techno"" in the most austere sense, but others like ""Rosa 1"" delve deep into something more like dub, with shorted-fuse sounds layered over top rhythms that lean back and stay out of the way. And then there’s something like the hyper-hectic ""Rot 2"", which follows clicky formalism to such extremes that it turns to pure abstraction without ever announcing its departure. To that end, every track on <em>Studio 1</em><span> plays like a serious study of the ways that articulation means the most when the message starts to stray.</span></p></div>"|12682.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12682-studio-1/|8.5|Andy Battaglia

After resurrecting 70s folk singer Gary Higgins and early 80s punk polymath JT IV (John Timmis IV), the Chicago-based label brings us Death, an all-black punk/hard-rock trio from Detroit (not to be confused with the 80s speed-metal band). Comprised of brothers David, Bobby, and Dannis Hackney, the band started out in 1971 playing R&amp;B but switched to rock after hearing the raucous proto punk of their neighbors the MC5 and Stooges. That incarnation lasted only a few years and seven songs, and after balking at Columbia Records' demand for a name change, the band relocated to Vermont and reinvented themselves as a gospel rock group.<br/><br/><i>...For the Whole World to See</i>, recorded in 1974, requires more ballpark adjustments than your average reissue. For one, most bands today fusing breakneck punk with arena rock bombast do so under a massive cloak of irony, and are commonly shunned (c.f. Electric Six). Making matters worse, Death espouses earnest political views while walking that tightrope. Luckily though, there's enough stylistic diversity and ahead-of-time knick-knacks on the album to prove Death more than just fanboys fawning over <i>Kick Out the Jams</i> and <i>Raw Power</i>.<br/><br/>Leaning heavily on pregnant pauses and choppy two-note melodies, opener ""Keep on Knocking"" confirms the rock+punk arithmetic of the band's mission statement. The other six tracks don't play out so predictably. ""Let the World Turn"" starts out in a Pink Floyd-style haze of reverberated guitars and detached vocals before igniting into a frenzied speed punk chorus. The ho-hum AOR verses of ""You're a Prisoner"" collide with a doomsday refrain straight out of an Ozzy Osbourne nightmare, while ""Freakin Out"" stands the test of time as the band's most innovative song here, anticipating the jittery pop punk that'd soon arrive from the UK.<br/><br/>The album falls short of a diamond-in-the-rough-caliber discovery, but considering these seven songs are the remains of an aborted 12-song full-length-from a band that reinvented itself every three or four years, <i>For the Whole World </i>holds up well alongside, say, concurrent Blue Oyster Cult or New York Dolls albums. This is the kind of reissue that re-instills faith in today's frustrated rockist, the listener whose fidelity gets tested by a rogues gallery of calculating rock revivalists every year. Armed with profound musicianship and the bona fide origin story so many less interesting bands' press kits grasp for, Death comes across as extremely likeable despite gleefully ripping off all the obvious influences.</p></div>"|12673.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12673-for-the-whole-world-to-see/|7.1|Adam Moerder

This isn't to dismiss his work behind the skins with the Advantage, but to simply point out that Seim spends the majority of this album banging away at his kit at a frenetic and maddening pace. If he can find the space squeeze in another handful of bass drum kicks, or rattle off more snare and cymbal notes, he does it, and then throws in a few more at no extra charge. Seim's percussive generosity wears out its welcome pretty damn quick, which is endemic of this one man group's debut as a whole. While sBach is now a full-fledged band, everything on this album was performed by Seim-- all the frisky fretwork, all the eight-bit power-upsmanship, and all the aforementioned Animal-esque thrashing. It's all done in the service of a record that, despite its relentless attempts to stand out and grab your attention, comes off as an underwhelming, exhausting, and (ironically) anonymous effort.</p><p>It's only fitting, then, that Seim didn't bother to name the record's 13 tracks-- if you want to make reference to a tune you like, you'll have to make like you're ordering Chinese take-out. And instead of describing the album's lead-off bait-and-switch with easy-to-use song titles, I have to write the following: The first 30 or so seconds of the album's first track are actually from the start of Track 8. So instead of getting the devil-horned payoff promised by the intro's gradual cymbal-laden crescendo, Track 1 takes a sharp left and turns into a guitar plucking exhibition backed with obnoxious high-pitched ringing tones. Eventually, Track 8 comes along and gives listeners the promised payoff, but its big beat and fuzzed-out tones are undercut by Seim's need to make like the Yngwie Malmsteen of drums at every opportunity.  (Track 4's pro-forma post-rock lien is a more successful variation on this theme.)</p><p>Thankfully, Seim doesn't take the same can't-drive-55 approach when it comes to the other instrumentation-- if he mangled his guitar with the same ferocity that he uses on the drums, this record would be wholly unbearable.  Instead, he shows relative restraint when, for example, sprinkling Track 2 with a fair helping of MIDI sounds, or leavening the squealing guitar in Track 3 with some small helpings of organ.  Once in a while, Seim finds a happy middle ground for his inventiveness and his virtuosity to thrive-- Track 5's transition from loping squelches to triumphant victory march would be the perfect soundtrack for a <em>Legend of Zelda</em> speed run, and the trickling synths draped across Track 6 discreetly disguise Seim's bass-pedal orgy.  But for those minor victories, there are plenty crash-and-burn moments like the album's first song, or Track 10, where extra lives and Koopas run full-bore into a severely thorough soundcheck.  These sorts of song-length missteps, coupled with the little stylistic hiccups that frequently crop up, undercut any sort of momentum <em>sBach</em> tries to maintain, and turns this one-man labor of love into a chore for the listener.</p></div>"|12678.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12678-sbach/|4.8|David Raposa

Ward|['Rock']|0.0|0.0|0.0|['Merge']|2009-02-17 00:00:00|2009|2016-06-11 19:08:09.391426|"<div class=""contents dropcap"" data-reactid="".66hywpem0w.1.6:0.1.0.$12681/=1$12681.0.3.2.0.1.0.1""><p>Matt Ward is no longer at the point in his career where you devote an entire album to the memory of an obscure folk guitar hero. The Portland-based singer, songwriter, and accomplished guitar player is enjoying his highest level of mainstream recognition yet, thanks in no small part to a fine, comfortingly nostalgic collaboration with actress Zooey Deschanel last year as She &amp; Him. He has shared stages with Norah Jones, Jenny Lewis, Bright Eyes, and My Morning Jacket. During the presidential primary season, he played a benefit show for Barack Obama.</p>
<p>On <i>Hold Time</i>, Ward loses himself to find himself. With increasingly expansive production and broader lyrical themes, Ward's sixth studio album polishes away a little bit more of the individual character that makes his best recordings so human and rewarding. Paradoxically, that mostly just reinforces Ward's defining trait: a conviction that simple songs can transcend time, and that categorizing music by era can be just as artificial as categorizing music by genre. Ward argues his case pretty convincingly for much of the album, if not quite as eloquently as he has in the past.</p>
<p><i>Hold Time</i> is <i>not</i> an album-length diatribe about your cable company's understaffed customer-service call centers. ""If only I could hold time,"" Ward's winningly cracked voice sighs wistfully on the title track, a strings-and-piano ballad that sounds like ""The Long and Winding Road"" and name-checks the Beach Boys compilation <i>Endless Summer</i>. Where 2003's <i>Transfiguration of Vincent</i> was inspired by a memorial service for folk legend John Fahey, 2005's <i>Transistor Radio</i> had the golden age of radio, and 2006's <i>Post-War</i> had wars, <i>Hold Time</i> is conceptually similar to Ward's underrated sophomore album, 2001's <i>End of Amnesia</i>. Back then Ward was helping us remember. Now he's making time stand still, with old sounds, a few old songs, and age-old subjects: love, god, old songs. He also has some indie-famous guest stars.</p>
<p>Bigger arrangements; same folk, rock'n'roll, and Americana roots. With mixing and assistance from Saddle Creek mainstay Mike Mogis, plus strings by Peter Broderick (Horse Feathers, Efterklang), Ward keeps his voice sounding lo-fi even when the production is Phil Spector-sized. ""Never Had Nobody Like You"" alludes to <i>The Dark Side of the Moon</i> while basically rewriting <i>The Music Man</i>'s ""Till There Was You"" as a stomping glam-rock duet with Deschanel. Ward could've stopped writing ""Stars of Leo"" early and called it ""I Get So High"", but to his credit he keeps going; the cascading guitars, vivid verses, and multi-layered percussion make it one of the album's best tracks (though it's not actually ""above"" the name-checked ""Sea of Love""). However, orchestration and vocal overdubs aren't enough to save acoustic strummer ""Jailbird"" from dying in its cage, despite some twangy, lyrical lead guitar work.</p>
<p>God is the perfect subject for a songwriter of Ward's aspirations toward timelessness. Shuffling guitar hoedown ""Fisher of Men"" extends one of Jesus' favorite metaphors, while the organ-kissed surfer-folk wisdom of stripped-down ""Blake's View"" is touching and beautifully phrased, its potentially grating reference to Blake perhaps a way for Ward to distance himself from the song's reassuring sentiments even while offering us comfort in them (pretty close to <i>Transfiguration</i>'s ""Dead Man"", though). ""If you're trying to sing an old song/ You're getting all the words wrong,"" he sings, crediting Paul, whether the Apostle or the Beatle, on strings plus banjo acid-rocker ""Epistemology"". Grandaddy's Jason Lytle fits well enough into the Wall of Sound on bouncy, clever ""To Save Me"". Suggested alternate title: ""He's Got the Whole World in His Hands (So Would It Kill the Motherfucker to Answer a Guy's Prayers?)"".</p>
<p>Covers are another way Ward sets <i>Hold Time</i> out of time. One of them sure goes on forever, anyway: a ponderous rendition of country classic ""Oh Lonesome Me"" with awkward call and response vocals featuring an out-of-place Lucinda Williams. Buddy Holly's ""Rave On"" matches up nicely with Ward's simple-is-good philosophy, and this laid-back remake is sonically detailed enough (another Deschanel guest spot) to justify itself-- it has nothing on <i>Transfiguration</i>'s irony-free cover of David Bowie's ""Let's Dance"", though. Meanwhile, Ward's instrumental take on Billie Holiday-sung jazz standard ""I'm a Fool to Want You"" is a smoldering guitar showcase recalling Neil Young's <i>Dead Man</i> soundtrack work or the solos of Giant Sand's Howe Gelb, who released Ward's debut a decade ago.</p>
<p>Memory is the world's greatest liar. So it's possible that Ward's past albums seem a cut or two above <i>Hold Time</i> only through the rose-tinted lens of hindsight-- sort of like how we've come to romanticize the Old West, say, or previous eras of rock'n'roll. But the new one, although steeped in American music tradition, could use some more of the pioneering spirit that got us here. <i>Hold Time</i> is an enjoyable, well-constructed album, and as good a place as any for newcomers to start-- it just doesn't hold many surprises. If it all seems too familiar to you, too impersonal, try the back catalog. As memory turns to myth, some myths are worth remembering. Not only John Henry, but Prometheus, too.</p></div>"|12681.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12681-hold-time/|6.8|Marc Hogan

In 2003, a name that loosely translates to ""casual sex"" and a J-Pop-inspired album cover certainly didn't add up in my mind to ""passable c. 1996 Lush pastiche."" Three years hence, after I'd forgotten about them, they go and drop <em>Citrus</em>, either a feat of reinvention or maturation, depending on who you ask, but a minor miracle either way. I still find myself listening to the gauzy, slo-mo bubble-gum of ""Thursday"" once or twice a week: a John Hughes film-ending, ""Kim &amp; Jessie""-style jam, it retains the power to make a simple walk down the street intensely melodramatic (and is by itself better than anything Lush ever did). Now, another three years have passed, <em>Citrus</em> made me look forward to <em>Hush</em>, and here I am again, a bit perplexed. And not just because I can't figure out what those mysterious woodland creatures are surrounding Yuki Chikudate on the cover.</p><p>The last two album titles are instructive: <em>Citrus</em> was lively and sharp, while <em>Hush</em> too often refuses to rise above its inside voice. Now whittled down to the duo of Chikudate and James Hanna, Asobi Seksu have moved to the middle of <em>Citrus</em>' broad tonal palette rather than expanding upon its quietly experimental tendencies. ""Me and Mary"", for some reason buried at the end of the album like it's playing under the closing credits, is the most chipper tune they've ever recorded. It's also the most satisfying track on <em>Hush</em> because it doesn't simply suggest something without delivering; it's all bridge-chorus indulgence, something that the band is good at, and which the music itself suggests might be part of its DNA. Earlier, ""In the Sky"" and ""Meh No Mae""-- essentially low-key rewrites of ""Thursday""s gossamer, multiple-crescendo approach-- acquire much of their distinctiveness from being surrounded by opalescent mood pieces. And that's the thing: <em>Hush</em> uses the same tools as <em>Citrus</em>-- treated guitar arpeggios, wobbly organ drones, rumbling drums and Chikudate's piercing high soprano-- but recombines them in ways that don't add up to much that sticks.</p><p>Like Blonde Redhead and School of Seven Bells (and the Cocteau Twins before them), Asobi Seksu are studio-rat dream-pop conjurers, crafting sophisticated sky-castles designed to whisk us alight. Over the past two years, however, the first two groups have made glimmering, propulsive variations on essentially the same aesthetic template as <em>Hush</em>, yet one based around what felt like an M.O. of songs first, style second. The paint-by-numbers preciousness of ""Gliss"" and queasy Brit-Pop of ""I Can't See"", while pleasant enough on their own terms, don't bring it enough for Chikudate and Hanna to keep up with their most recognizable contemporaries. None of this is to say that <em>Hush</em> is a bad album-- far from it. It is a work that shows a band still struggling to come to terms with itself, discovering on record the music it wants to make, and settling for a safe middle ground in the end. On ""Familiar Light"", an early track that again teases toward something grand but stops mid-bloom, Chikudate seems to hint at her current creative methodology: ""I stared at the ceiling/ To regain some feeling."" Question: Was the ceiling stark white, perhaps with a stucco texture, maybe with occasional jagged cracks breaking up the uniformity? Hmm. Perhaps for album four, looking out the window again might be a better idea.</p></div>"|12685.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12685-hush/|5.5|Eric Harvey

On their covers album <em>Thing of the Past </em>and the supplemental EP <em>More of the Past</em>, Vetiver paid faithful homage to a very specific brand of dazed Americana, covering songs by Townes Van Zandt, Norman Greenbaum, and Michael Hurley, as well reviving several long-lost obscurities by such lesser-known songwriters as Garland Jeffreys and Elyse Weinberg. All of the source material for these covers can be roughly dated to 1969-73 time period, and throughout their performances Vetiver showed a virtually effortless affinity for the playing and production styles of that era's folk-rock and cosmic country.</p><p>Now Vetiver make their Sub Pop debut with <em>Tight Knit</em>, their first album of original material since 2006's <em>To Find Me Gone </em>and fourth album overall. Though the songs are all written by Cabic, he has learned well the lessons of <em>Thing of the Past</em>, and his new work remains very much in that same early-70s headspace. Produced by longtime Vetiver associate Thom Monahan, <em>Tight Knit </em>is built with a keen ear for detail, be it a subtle dose of pedal steel or a gently rippling guitar effect, and it features Cabic's most consistently engaging batch of songs to date.</p><p>As has been the case in the past, Vetiver's roster on this album straddles the line between a full band and a Cabic solo project. On several tracks here Cabic plays all the instruments himself, while others feature the touring group that includes well-traveled drummer Otto Hauser and Currituck Co.'s guitarist Kevin Barker. To Cabic and Monahan's credit, however, these shifts in personnel are largely invisible, and the songs all hang easily together as a coherent whole.</p>
<p>In what seems a show of Cabic's genial self-assurance, he kicks off <em>Tight Knit </em>with ""Rolling Sea"", a sun-dappled country ballad that wouldn't have startled a soul if it had drifted out of an AM radio 35 years ago. Elsewhere Cabic takes greater chances, such as on the standout ""Another Reason to Go"", which adds Clavinet and horns to a well-turned hippie groove that seems a distant cousin to the Grateful Dead's ""Estimated Prophet."" Equally memorable is the melodic ""On the Other Side"", whose easy gait is measured by the steady clip-clop of a drum machine, and on which Cabic issues what could be his mission statement, gently decrying those unmellow types who ""get nervous and act uptight"" or otherwise ""fuss and fight"" before he helpfully points out ""that just ain't my speed.""</p>
<p>Nice and midtempo-- that's more Cabic's speed. And even at its most innovative, <em>Tight Knit </em>still finds Vetiver returning time and again to the familiar shores of West Coast country-rock and the untroubled pace of their <em>Thing of the Past</em> forefathers. Yet in the face of Cabic's relentless positive vibrations it feels somehow unacceptably churlish to say harsh words against either the driving, Gene Clark rhythms of ""Everyday"" and ""More of This"" or the dreamy, pastoral folk of the closing ""At Forest Edge"". With their boundaries and ambitions by now well established, on <em>Tight Knit </em>Cabic and company largely succeed in luring the listener hazily back in time and into Vetiver's comfort zone.</p></div>"|12674.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12674-tight-knit/|7.2|Matthew Murphy

I love it when bands make it easy for me: Though the concept of ""growth"" can border on illusory, the shady, gnarled <em>Black Forest </em>comes on less strong than <em>Pale Young Gentlemen, </em>but is ultimately a lot harder to shake than its charming, if slightly hammy predecessor. </p><p>Similar to fellow Wisconsinites Violet Femmes, PYG essentially render a normally bombastic framework in acoustic terms: For the former, it was punk; for the latter, it's orchestral pop. ""We could talk for hours/ Or maybe not at all"" doesn't read like much of a mission statement, but sunk within album centerpiece ""Kettle Drum (I Left a Note)"", it's indicative of a band learning to leave more to the imagination. Despite massive turnover amidst its ranks and less than a year removed from <em>Pale Young Gentlemen, </em>what distinguishes <em>Black Forest </em>is the patience of confident survivors, not just of their first tour, but the easy comparisons to more maudlin and forthright old world-influenced acts like Beirut.   </p><p>And it's tough record to initially get a hold of with all of its novel textures-- like their self-titled, <em>Black Forest </em>begins with a stuttering acoustic riff suggesting hip-hop as much as folk, but ""Coal/Ivory"" morphs into something more expansive and majestic, replete with the keenest coal lyric this side of ""Oxford Comma"".  Nearly every track is built off a new string instrument, from the stumbling, thumbed arpeggios that give ""I Wasn't Worried"" a subtle charm to the washed-out harp of ""We Will Meet"" to the pizzicato, agreeably bumbling chorus of ""Wedding Guest"". Throughout, Michael Reisenauer's maundering vocals holds the disparate arrangements together like putty, though his lyrics are just shy of scrutability for the most part, overcast invocations of women and wine. </p>
<p>The light touch might still be a turnoff to some, since they're occasionally boxed in by their commitment to a sort of pop music that more archaic than Arcade-ish. ""The Crook of My Good Arm"" is the most obvious ""rock"" moment, with a vigorous tempo and a cello riff simulating the bass-- a trick also used by A.C. Newman. More surprising is how the violin jabs of ""Our History"" recall ""Sunday Bloody Sunday"" and its martial stridency: Reisenauer's cry ""I was like a child/ You can't touch me!"" is more of a well-earned moment of release than a cheap joke. Which is not to call these guys prudes-- it's a testament to their mastery of subtle suggestion that a line like ""Bodies twist and hips crash/ Kissing thighs in between"" can blend in without triggering a gag reflex.</p></div>"|12676.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12676-black-forest-tra-la-la/|7.3|Ian Cohen

On <em>Emerald Eyes</em>, their self-released debut, they spackle a hazy wash of Leanne Macomber's wispy, French-pop-star voice over molasses-slow keyboard drones and icily removed synthesized beats. The result is somewhat akin to the sexy somnambulance of Beach House or the eerie ambiance of Julee Cruise, and thus Fight Bite join other members of the freshman class of 2008 (see also: Vivian Girls, Crystal Stilts) who are obsessed with Phil Spector's girl-group pop and aloof shoegazer effects. Unlike their classmates, however, they are neither from Brooklyn nor are they interested in garage-rock throttle, so their dreamy, dense songs are infused with a suburban innocence and drained of anything resembling aggression or rebellion.</p><p>Fight Bite first made a name for themselves in 2008 with their blog-beloved single ""Swissex Lover"", and that gossamer duet is still the standout: Macomber's whispery voice leaks into the shimmering keyboards, whose drowsy calliope tones are almost indistinguishable from Jeff Louis' faraway backing vocals. Most of the nine other tracks on the collection follow a similar formula: slow, haunting keyboard chords fill up the track leaving little room for the tinny percussion or watery, remote singing that spills into a wash of diaphanous melody. Specific lyrics are, therefore, hard to identify, but clearly these are bruised love songs, as the ache is palpable.</p><p>There are few tracks that rise above the album's purposely laconic pace, but those that do are among the collection's best. ""Age of Faith"", with its percolating ""ba ba ba""s and Macomber's Shangri-Las-indebted spoken-word patter, is a welcome moment of levity, even if much of its bright coloring is buried behind a thick cloud of foggy reverb. ""Widow's Peak"" is a stinging tune built on a buzzing keyboard foundation that begins as videogame bleeps and evolves into a gothic carousel stomp. And ""Small Wonder"" raises the pulse of the rhythmically mannered record with almost-dancefloor-worthy beats and a melody that, despite being delivered in a glossy coo and cocooned in lovely harmony, can't help but remind you of the chorus to Rick Springfield's ""I've Done Everything For You"".</p>
<p>The main problem, however, with this charming album it's that it is too one-note. With not enough dynamic difference between them, the gauzy songs start to bleed together. But that's a rookie mistake. Fight Bite definitely have more songs in them like ""Swissex Lover"", and their moderately up-tempo numbers show a lot of promise. Perhaps on their next outing they will have developed enough confidence in their sound to stray outside its strict parameters. In the meantime, we have the analog warmth of <em>Emerald Eyes</em>-- a perfect hibernation soundtrack-- to keep us cozy during this chilly season.</p></div>"|12672.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12672-emerald-eyes/|6.7|Rebecca Raber

Every complaint people harbor against so-called ""hipster rap"" today had its genesis in that debut album nearly 23 years ago-- a bunch of upper-middle-class, never-been-battled punk rockers in leather jackets and skinny jeans bellowing knowingly obnoxious, semi-ironic lyrics-- and it only escalated once the question of the inevitable follow-up came around. The only thing that would piss purists off more than the notion of three clownish white Jewish kids accidentally inventing frat-rap is the fact that they wound up ditching a beloved hip-hop label in Def Jam for the corporate juggernaut of Capitol Records. Not to mention jetting their asses to Los Angeles to cut records with the dudes who produced Tone Lōc's ""Wild Thing"". When <em>Paul's Boutique</em> famously tanked upon release-- peaking at #14 on a pre-Soundscan Billboard 200 and, even more damningly, only #24 on the R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Top Albums chart-- the haters triumphantly chortled along with 3rd Bass: ""Screamin' 'Hey Ladies,' Why bother?""</p><p>Twenty years later, nobody's asking that question. <em>Paul's Boutique</em> is a landmark in the art of sampling, a reinvention of a group that looked like it was heading for a gimmicky, early dead-end, and a harbinger of the pop-culture obsessions and referential touchstones that would come to define the ensuing decades' postmodern identity as sure as ""The Simpsons"" and Quentin Tarantino did. It's an album so packed with lyrical and musical asides, namedrops, and quotations that you could lose an entire day going through its Wikipedia page and looking up all the references; ""The Sounds of Science"" alone redirects you to the entries for Cheech Wizard, Shea Stadium, condoms, Robotron: 2084, Galileo, and Jesus Christ. That density, sprawl, and information-overload structure was one of the reasons some fans were reluctant to climb on board. But by extending Steinski's rapid-fire sound-bite hip-hop aesthetic over the course of an entire album, the Beastie Boys and the Dust Brothers more than assured that a generally positive first impression would eventually lead to a listener's dedicated, zealous headlong dive into the record's endlessly-quotable deep end.</p><p>There's a lot that's already been said about the daring eclecticism and arguably irreproducible anything-goes technique with which the Dust Brothers assembled the album's beats. The music is a big, shameless love letter to the 1970s filled with a conceptual bookend (the Idris Muhammad-sampling, ladies-man ether frolic ""To All the Girls""), numerous line-completing lyrical interjections from Johnny Cash, Chuck D, Pato Banton and Sweet, and, just for kicks, nine truncated songs spliced together and stuck in at the end as a staggering 12 and 1/2-minute suite. If the sonics on <em>It Takes A Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back</em> evoked a sleep-shattering wake-up call and <em>3 Feet High and Rising</em> a chilled-out, sunny afternoon, the personality of <em>Paul's Boutique</em> completed the trinity by perfectly capturing the vibe of a late-night alcohol and one-hitter-fueled shit-talk session. Even now, after being exposed to successively brilliant sample-slayers from the RZA to the Avalanches to J Dilla, it's still bracing just how meticulous the beats are here. These aren't just well-crafted loops, they're self-contained little breakbeat universes filled with weird asides, clever segues, and miniature samples-as-punchlines.</p>
<p>There's dozens of clever touches and big, ambitious ideas that still sound inspired: a cameo appearance by the opening drumbeats of Mountain's ""Mississippi Queen"" in ""Looking Down the Barrel of a Gun""; the manic yet seamless percussion rolls and the giddy tour through the <em>Car Wash</em> soundtrack on ""Shake Your Rump""; the two-part slow-to-fast tweaking of late-period Beatles on ""The Sounds of Science""; a sparingly-used Alice Cooper guitar riff adding a mockingly pseudo-badass counter to the whimsical Gene Harris-based soul jazz backbone of ""What Comes Around"". It all gets writ large in ""B-Boy Bouillabaisse"", the aforementioned album-closing suite, which careens through turntablist striptease, a not-yet-throwback 808/beatboxing showcase, funk grooves of every conceivable tempo, and a Jeep-beat bass monster so massive and all-consuming that Jay-Z and Lil Wayne 2.0'd it in late 2007. Even the less-frenetic moments are sonically inventive; there's only two acknowledged and minimally-tinkered-with samples in ""3-Minute Rule"", augmented with a starkly simple bassline from MCA himself, but it's one of the finest examples of deep, cavernous dub-style production on any golden age rap record.</p>
<p>And, of course, there's Ad-Rock and MCA and Mike D themselves. Where the aesthetic of <em>Licensed to Ill</em> could have permanently placed them in the crass dirtbag-shtick company of ""Married With Children"" and Andrew Dice Clay if they'd kept it up, <em>Paul's Boutique</em> pushed them into a new direction as renaissance men of punchline lyricism. They were still happily at home affecting low-class behaviors: hucking eggs at people on ""Egg Man""; going on cross-country crime sprees on ""High Plains Drifter""; smackin' girlies on the booty with something called a ""plank bee"" in ""Car Thief""; claiming to have been ""makin' records when you were suckin' your mother's dick"" on ""3-Minute Rule"". But they'd also mastered quick-witted acrobatic rhymes to augment their countless pop-culture references and adolescent hijinks. ""Long distance from my girl and I'm talkin' on the cellular/ She said that she was sorry and I said 'Yeah, the hell you were'""-- we're a long way from ""Cookie Puss"" here.</p>
<p>While each member has their spotlight moments-- MCA's pedal-down tour de force fast-rap exhibition in ""Year and a Day"", Mike D having too much to drink at the Red Lobster on ""Mike on the Mic"", and Ad-Rock's charmingly venomous tirade against coke-snorting Hollywood faux-ingénues in ""3-Minute Rule""-- <em>Paul's Boutique</em> is where their back-and-forth patter really reached its peak. At the start of their career, they built off the tag-team style popularized by Run-DMC, but by '89 they'd developed it to such an extent and to such manic, screwball ends that they might as well have been drawing off the Marx Brothers as well. It's impossible to hear the vast majority of this album as anything other than a locked-tight group effort, with its overlapping lyrics and shouted three-man one-liners, and it's maybe best displayed in the classic single ""Shadrach"". After years of post-Def Jam limbo and attempts to escape out from under the weight of a fratboy parody that got out of hand, they put together a defiant, iconographic statement of purpose that combined giddy braggadocio with weeded-out soul-searching. It's the tightest highlight on an album full of them, a quick-volleying, line-swapping 100-yard dash capped off with the most confident possible delivery of the line ""They tell us what to do? Hell no!""</p>
<p>As reissues go, the 20th Anniversary re-release of <em>Paul's Boutique</em> is relatively bare-bones. There's a richer, cleaner audio mix remastered by the band, a tracklisting that splits ""B-Boy Bouillabaisse"" into its separate parts, and a sharp mini-gatefold package highlighting the iconic cover photo. That so little has been changed is more of a relief than a problem; between the Beatles, Led Zeppelin, and Pink Floyd samples, you'd think the clearance issues would be prohibitive. Just the fact that this album's being reissued with all this care and attention should be enough. After <em>Paul's Boutique</em> failed to move units, it wasn't entirely out of the realm of possibility that the Beasties would wind up like the protagonist of ""Johnny Ryall""-- with ""a platinum voice/ But only gold records,"" reduced to obscurity while their most ambitious work faded into cutout-bin purgatory. As it turned out, they created an album we'll probably never hear the likes of again-- good thing it's deep enough to live in forever.</p></div>"|12671.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12671-pauls-boutique/|10.0|Nate Patrin

After the Byrds-influenced post-psychedelic jangle of the Soft Boys came to a grinding halt in 1981, Hitchcock went on to establish a solo career with nearly 20 erratic albums of varying standards, all of which are harnessed by his proclivity for sharp, surreal lyrics and experimental yet accessible song structures.<em> Goodnight Oslo</em>, the second album Hitchcock has recorded with the Venus 3 (a cast of rock veterans including Peter Buck and fellow R.E.M contributors Scott McCaughey and drummer Bill Rieflin) falls in the center of the discography pack, nipping at the heels of Hitchcock's better moments from the last three decades, such as <em>Fegmania! </em>(1985) and <em>Olé! Tarantula</em> (2006). <br/><br/>Never shy of incorporating a wide range of styles into his music, Hitchcock mirrors his influences with thoughtful enthusiasm while throwing his characteristic sardonic humor into the mix. As usual, echoes of Syd Barrett, the Beatles, and Television Personalities are heard frequently. Yet <em>Goodnight Oslo</em> is a capricious affair, veering from big band grandiosity to quirky pop and rollicking country ballads. Just as the content darts around stylistically, so does the overall quality of the songs. ""Your Head Here"", for example, is a wonderfully dynamic combination of Fall-esque half-spoken/half-sung monologues, driving beats, and vague guitar chords which provide an ideal platform for Hitchcock's wry lyricism. After such a magnetic highlight, the disappointment of the following track, ""Saturday Groovers"", comes as a stiff blow. Suddenly we've gone from solid, enigmatic, and well-developed songwriting to a kitschy singalong in the style of Herman's Hermits!  <br/><br/>It's a shame these rough patches rear up from time to time, because there is plenty of great material on <em>Goodnight Oslo</em>. The common problem with musical prolificacy on the scale of an artist such as Robyn Hitchcock is that the musician is in danger of forgetting to pluck the weeds from a field full of flowers. Strong tracks such as ""Up to Our Nex"" or ""Sixteen Years"", which has a beautiful, spiraling guitar line and pensive harmonica interlude, tends to upstage rather than compliment the tepidity of ""TLC"" or the pub rock sounding jam of opening track ""What You Is"".  <br/><br/>Hitchcock has a vibrant, accommodating and well-explored musical aesthetic, and it's always reassuring to hear more mature artists continuing to experiment and develop throughout an ever-expanding canon. However, one gets the feeling that with a little more ruthlessness about what makes the final cut, <em>Goodnight Oslo</em> could offer more hits than misses. As it is, it falls just a little short.</p></div>"|12667.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12667-goodnight-oslo/|6.5|Mia Clarke

Because of that sentence alone, I'd wager that some of you are aiming for your browser's back arrow. Spoken word gets a bad rap in part because of a hoary yet persistent caricature: the finger-snapping, beret-wearing, boho poet who declaims jive over noodly jazz or po-faced folk. This straw man is so pervasive in popular culture-- it gave us Maynard G. Krebs, Cool Cat, and Shaggy from ""Scooby-Doo""-- that it's easy to forget the beatnik way isn't the only way.</p><p><em>Recitement</em>, which features Emmer's music supporting poems and stories of different eras, some of which are read by their original authors, does occasionally flirt with stereotype. Sometimes the results are enchanting anyway-- you can practically smell the clove smoke wafting through the smooth horns of ""Mondo Sparito"", which features Andrea Piovan reading from Alessandro Baricco's novel <em>City</em>-- and sometimes they're off-putting. Emmer courts pigeonholing when he backs a reading by Beat archetype Allen Ginsberg with bombastic folk-rock on ""Disconnected"", and Michael Parkinson hams up a lovely Thomas Hardy poem on ""Invergence of the Twain"".</p><p>These few missteps emphasize how admirably Emmer succeeds in avoiding cliché on most of the tracks, which are mainly arranged and played by the composer himself (with a bit of help from auxiliary musicians), and bolstered by Tony Visconti's limpid production. Emmer's miscellaneous musical career, which encompasses free jazz, rock, electronic noise (he was a member of the Factory-signed band Minny Pops), and points outlying, is reflected in the startlingly diverse music on <em>Recitement</em>. This breadth of capability allows him to achieve the most difficult trick of spoken word music: symmetry of form and content, with neither feeling subordinate to the other.</p>
<p>So Yoko Ono's ""Listen, the Snow is Falling"" (sung by Blonde Redhead's Kazu Makino) gets arctic drone-rock that accentuates its stateliness; Lou Reed's humble rendition of an excerpt from Paul Theroux's travelogue <em>The Great Railway Bazaar</em> gets elegiac piano and strings that conjure stations streaming across train windows; Kurt Schwitters's seminal sound poem ""Ursonate"" gets syncopated avant-jazz that draws out his nonsense language's decorative, expressive quality. Elsewhere, Emmer avails himself of hip-hop, ambient, chamber music, and techno influences, always keeping his sights on the twin goals of sounding good and drawing out the resonance of his selected texts and voices.</p>
<p>The best compositions create harmonious interplay between the various tiers that spoken word music contains: The sound of the voice, the sound of the words, the images the words embody, and the images the music embodies all dissolve into one boundless mass. On ""The Leaden Echo"", the late Welsh actor Richard Burton draws out the fleet rhythms of a stunning poem by the experimental Victorian poet Gerard Manley Hopkins; Burton's crisp, theatrical diction blends into a haze of swirling strings with a few subtle voice manipulations at certain enjambments. On ""Absolutely Grey"", jazz wordsmith Ken Nordine's rich baritone echoes itself in whispers amid camera whirs, sonar blips, and shifting percussion that helps him hover or surge without changing his inflection.</p>
<p>The balance of poppy, purely musical tracks and esoteric, more sculptural ones keeps the record lively, and it has considerable archival value as well: For book lovers, the drowsy lounge-music strains of ""Everness"" are almost beside the point; to hear the great Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges reading in his native tongue is sufficient. Song lyrics are not poetry and poems are not songs, but that doesn't mean poetry and music can't agreeably coexist-- even, in the right hands, enhance each other-- as Emmer so convincingly asserts on <em>Recitement.</em></p></div>"|12625.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12625-recitement/|6.5|Brian Howe

Former Smart Went Crazy band members Devin Ocampo and Jeff Boswell formed a math-rockin' power trio with Chad Molter in 1997, released various singles and a split before stepping up with their only full-length, <em>The View From This Tower</em>, in 2000. In 2001, Faraquet disbanded, and Ocampo and Molter went on to play in Medications.</p><p>To generalize: former members of forgotten, underrated post-punk band coalesce into a second forgotten, underrated post-punk band that yields an unknown, presumably underrated post-punk band, most of this occurring on, where else, Dischord Records. This progression is D.C. punk's version of ""growing up and getting a real job."" <em>Anthology 1997-98</em> is a collection of the scattered tracks that Faraquet recorded in and after the dying months of Smart Went Crazy, before the release of their debut album; what it lacks in crucial insight it makes up for with nostalgia and completeness.</p><p>The ""Why?"" alarm in your head is surely sound sounding: Collections like this don't need any Herculean purpose, but neither should the primary reason to anthologize a band's material be ""just because,"" especially when said anthology more than doubles the number of songs available. The best reason may be this: <em>The View From This Tower</em> stands as perhaps the best representation of ""the Dischord sound"" this decade, what with Fugazi mostly on hiatus, Q and Not U weirding out, and Lungfish being and sounding like Lungfish. <em>Anthology</em> is the rollup to <em>View</em>, 10 tracks of Ocampo's boiling guitar and Molter's creatively nervous drumming that contain whiffs of scene-y righteousness mostly overpowered by the group's meticulous anti-jams. For the official ledger, the whole of Faraquet is now available, with these recordings lovingly remixed and remastered.</p>
<p>The list of journalistically approved adjectives for groups of Faraquet's ilk goes like this: precise, angular, frenetic, and shout-y. Apply those liberally to <em>Anthology</em> but also realize that even as Faraquet mimicked the hoary guitars of Fugazi and the controlled rush of Nation of Ulysses, they were (conservatively) incorporating synthesizers, horns, and string sections into their arrangements. The band's truest influence on Dischord, thematically at least, is probably Jawbox, another declarative, hot-city combo. Not showy instrumentally, Faraquet's feeling-out process led to indefinable song structures on tracks like ""Yo-Yo"" and ""Study in Movement"", both of which might provide tidy sub-headlines for any discussion of Faraquet's melodic ideas.</p>
<p>Not that all of this is apparent from ""Parakeet"" and ""Um Die Ecke"", together the competing sides of Faraquet's first single, the former building momentum from an aggressively lapping riff and the latter winding tightly with syncopated rhythms and Ocampo's still-evolving growl. Ocampo's vocals are the surest barometer of the group's progress; on early songs they echoed the frustration and gnash of his guitar, but by 1998's split with Akarso, they were contemplative and considered, even as he hovered too long on consonants and clipped lines short. Ocampo at times seems conflicted about whether to express his ideas vocally or via guitar, resulting in verses and choruses that appear in odd intervals. On ""Rex"" and ""Sea Song"" (an alternate take on a <em>View</em> track) Ocampo augments his band's strident, mid-tempo vamps with a young man's regrets: ""I'm drunk again.""</p>
<p>It remains difficult to recommend to anyone not already a convert a 10-song odds-and-sods collection of a not-seminal band that released one nine-song album most of a decade ago. <em>Anthology</em> provides ample reason to reevaluate <em>View</em>, but it does not improve or expand upon it. Faraquet re-formed in 2007 to play several shows; hope that those performances and this documentation remind the band of the creativity and excitement they had just begun exploring on the recordings contained here.</p></div>"|12665.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12665-anthology-1997-98/|6.3|Andrew Gaerig

Singer-guitarist Dan Auerbach and drummer Patrick Carney have managed to forge a career and five albums out of variations-on-a-theme riffs and stripped-for-parts grooves, outliving almost all of those peers. They lack the audacity of Jack White (in fact, their blues-rock extends more from Midwestern modesty than from self-aware showboating), and the Reigning Sound's Greg Cartwright has a stronger melodic sensibility and more potent lyrical venom. Their limited range, however, stands in inverse proportion to their sturdy longevity, which always seemed built into their conceptual underpinning, as if the sheer quantity of songs legitimizes their Spartan approach.</p>
<p>But last year's <i>Attack &amp; Release</i> saw the Black Keys' resolve weakening: Auerbach and Carney collaborated with Danger Mouse and wrangled additional players-- including Jessica Lea Mayfield and Carney's uncle Ralph. That the additions of a high-profile producer and programmed beats only augmented rather than expanded their sound was both a bit comical and strangely commendable. You take the Keys out of their basement studio, but you can't take the basement studio out of the Keys. Now Auerbach has made a solo album, and in retrospect, this turn of events seems inevitable: Ostensibly he wanted to escape even momentarily his band's self-imposed restrictions and give vent to his wildest ideas, like having a bass player.</p>
<p>Like <i>Attack &amp; Release</i>, <i>Keep It Hid</i> takes only a few baby steps up the basement stairs. There are plenty of new song shapes and sound textures here, from the softly strummed opener ""Trouble Weighs a Ton"" to the brief din of ""Because I Should"" to the Smithsy guitar on ""Heartbroken, in Disrepair"". A sacred organ drenches ""Real Desire"" like profane sweat, and ""Whispered Words (Pretty Lies)"" struts on a Stax rhythm section and a nifty descending melody. ""When the Night Comes"" ends Side 1 on a quiet note, with soft keyboards and piano decorating some of Auerbach's most tender lyrics to date. Side 2 loses some of Side 1's urgency, as ""Mean Monsoon"" and especially ""When I Left the Room"" sound uncharacteristically unfocused.</p>
<p>Nothing here, however, would sound at all out of place if ""Black Keys"" were written on the jewel case spine. Whether Auerbach should be criticized or credited for his consistency could be debated, but the approach, the mission, and the music here all sound pretty close to what we've heard before from his day-job band. As a Black Keys album, <i>Keep It Hid</i> sounds less detached and distracted than the Danger Mouse collaboration, but lacks the thickfreak sound of their earliest releases and the sharp songwriting of <i>Rubber Factory</i>. Auerbach has written horndog riffs like ""I Want Some More"" and ""Street Walkin'"" many times before, and neither is the best of his lot. And no offense to the dependable drumming of Bob Cesare, but these songs lack Carney's crafty, unhinged beats, which work overtime to fill in Keys' songs as much as possible.</p>
<p>The biggest change here might be Auerbach himself, whose vocals have loosened up somewhat since <i>The Big Come Up</i> in 2002. On ""Whispered Words (Pretty Lies)"" and ""My Last Mistake"" he actually sounds indistinguishable from John Fogerty-- and the swampy drumbeat on the latter suggests he's aware of it. Rather than put him at the head of a small studio band like this, one wonders how he would sound either as a player in a more democratic unit (much like White in the Raconteurs) or backed by a pre-existing group like Drive-By Truckers, where he might have to work outside of himself to adapt to a communal sound. As it is, the more Auerbach changes things, the more they stay the same.</p></div>"|12669.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12669-keep-it-hid/|6.2|Stephen M. Deusner

Over the last few years, the wine-swilling, Rollie Fingers-looking keyboardist for the greatest rock'n'roll band going-- that'd be the Hold Steady-- and charter World/Inferno Friendship Society member has proven himself to be his band's not-so-secret weapon. Still, Nicolay manages to largely hide in plain sight where the Hold Steady's concerned, deferring to the outsized stage presence and unmatched lyricism of one Craig Finn.</p><p>You'll forgive me for dropping this particular bomb on you: Franz is not, as it turns out, the premier songwriter in his more famous coterie. In some ways, it ain't even close-- the competition's stiff, after all-- but on <em>Major General</em>, Nicolay's proper solo debut following a 2007 collection of demos, proves him a surprisingly close second. Eclectic and ambitious but unshowy, <em>Major General</em> is about as satisfying as any solo effort from a member of an established band still killing it themselves as I can think of. If Franz didn't spent most of his nights in the enviable position to the right of Finn and the rest of the Hold Steady, with songs like these it's not hard imagine him having an awfully good go of it on his own.</p><p><em>Major General</em> moves a fair piece between the Hüsker Dü-like urgency of opener ""Jeff Penalty"" to the loungey, languid closer ""I'm Done Singing"", hitting mid-1990s alt-rock, tipsy Billy Joel balladry, Sunday afternoon swing, and Eastern European folk-tinged rave-ups along the way. I can't quite tell if ""Jeff Penalty"" is a highlight or the highlight, but it's certainly a winner, spinning a note-perfect yarn of seeing the Jello Biafra-less Dead Kennedys revue. In Nicolay's tale, the crowd reluctantly accepts ""Jeff Whatisname"" and refuses to stop believin'. It's as good a song about navigating aging in the scene-- never selling out, after all, just turns you into the old guy in the room-- as any on the Hold Steady's <em>Stay Positive</em>, and if they were to slip it into a setlist sometime soon, they wouldn't miss a step.</p>
<p>From there, Nicolay moves all over the place, heading into the boisterous, almost Tom Waitsian ""Hey Dad!"" to the lovely (if unfortunately titled) ""World/Inferno vs. the End of the Evening"" and the almost operatic stomp of ""Dead Sailors"". The sound largely vacillates between the rockers, the ballads, and the spindly gypsy-folk numbers. Because Nicolay's got some opera in his throat and some unusual stuff in his arrangements, something like Frog Eyes might be the best reference point for these. But however you care to call 'em, they're the most compositionally assured things here, and also the least effective. Nicolay's fondness for unorthodox rock instrumentation-- the guy does play both the banjo and the accordion quite a bit on this set, as he does with ""World/Inferno""-- is nice to hear. But the songs he writes with a lot of pickin' and-a-squeezin' don't hit the gut like the rest, favoring lyrical flights of fancy and big bursts of sound over the acutely rendered observations of the more traditionally rocky stuff here.</p>
<p>Apart from those and the relatively slight ""Do We Not Live in Dreams?"", though, <em>Major General</em> hits some massive highs and nary a single crushing low. ""Jeff Penalty"" is a monster and ""Confessions of an Ineffective Casanova"", despite another lousy title, might be even better, finding Nicolay spitting game about a strange relationship over a freewheeling guitar chug that would've fit nicely on a playlist next to the Gin Blossoms and, oh, Sugar. It's just as easy to imagine ""Jeff Penalty"" inspiring the most meta mosh pit ever, as it is to see legions of grown folks raising a glass to the wine-drunk ""End of the Evening"", and Nicolay's skill at playing punk sage on one song and slightly troubled troubadour on the next is really something special.</p>
<p>Of course, a record that flirts with this many genres can feel a bit unfocused, and the slight sag to the back half-- and either one too many klezmery tunes or one too few punkers, I can't quite decide-- keeps <em>Major General</em> from feeling like an album rather than a baker's dozen songs in sequence. But if the old adage is true and the first LP really is a lifetime of ideas on wax, Nicolay's laid out an awful lot here. Let's just hope he doesn't feel compelled to say quite so much if he ever gets around to making another one.</p></div>"|12670.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12670-major-general/|7.3|Paul Thompson

I say this reticent to fuel any notion that Pitchfork grades are assigned according to something as random as the weather, or to suggest that certain sounds and constructions are only ""appropriate"" in certain climates. But there they were, Windsurf's resolutely optimistic slow-disco grooves and <em>Coastlines</em>' sunkissed cover art contrasting with the week's slow drizzles.<br/><br/>This is where your average glass-half-full Windsurf fan would jump in and say, ""But at least the drizzles were <em>slow</em>,"" punctuating ""slow"" with a swoop of his pointer finger. Fair: Windsurf trade in a laconic, beachside brand of electronic music inexactly referred to as ""Balearic."" Comprised of San Franciscans Dan Judd and Sam Grawe, Windsurf built their presence last year through an EP and remixes for bands like Low Motion Disco and the Tough Alliance, and <em>Coastlines</em> exists partly in thanks to ubiquitous Norwegian Prins Thomas, who released the record on his recently created Internasjonal label.<br/><br/>Windsurf create music lighter and less bulbous than that of their peers. <em>Coastlines</em> is seemingly composed of sets of cleanly drawn lines. Listening to ""Moonlightsun"" progress is not unlike watching someone draw with a new pack of thin-line Magic Markers: wires intersect, bold and un-muddied by each other's presence. Percussive echoes are undisturbed by a quickened bassline, which sits idly beside organ patches and an ascending synth line. The first chord change doesn't arrive for nearly two and a half minutes, and when it does it serves as a release valve for any lingering discord, however slight. Even when a track carries on a bit long-- the extremely pleasant ""Future Warriors"" probably doesn't need its full six minutes-- <em>Coastlines</em>' clean, balanced mix is a blessing: training your ear on one of those many weaving lines can unlock new perspectives.<br/><br/>Such is the way the synthesizers, drum machines, guitars, and occasionally vocals on <em>Coastlines</em> interact with one another. Windsurf's languorous grooves develop naturally, less a product of exacting composition than carefully cultivated vibes. Instruments and melodies rarely seem out of place, but neither is any individual element essential. The big-sky chords that populate the band's namesake track are almost orchestral in their warmth and breadth, but they don't distract from the track's jaunty snares. The confluence of bass sequencers and hardy synth lines in ""White Soweto"" sound almost like Boards of Canada (to whom Windsurf owe a partial debt for their 1970s seaside sprawl) remixed skyward. The whittling funk of ""Light as Daylight""'s guitars are the home-y side of predictable.<br/><br/>The duo might not get a pass on their questionable vocals. ""Light as Daylight"" skates by because its mumble-mouthed couplets exist only during the song's tremulous budding (the moment when the voice drops and the song's hammy, clean-struck piano chords fall is one of <em>Coastlines</em>' most strident). ""Bird of Paradise"", though short, doesn't fare as well, its evenly plucked nylon-string guitar drowned by the singer's mundane drawl. <em><br/><br/>Coastlines</em> remains likeable even during the placid, 12-minute fadeout of ""Crystal Neon"", but Windsurf's easy-going stroll does have trouble supporting the album's 70-minute runtime. Some vacations do last too long, etc. Windsurf prove themselves careful guides, however, never letting the relaxed pacing and sonics of Coastlines slacken their careful details. Just try to keep it off of the turntable when the sky goes gray.</p></div>"|12666.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12666-coastlines/|6.6|Andrew Gaerig

Theoretically, anyone with a guitar is free to play any way he or she feels like playing. The same holds true for any other instrument, or combinations of instruments. But rare is the act that doesn't sound like the sum of their instrumentation. It's pretty inescapable: no matter what they do, no matter what they try, no matter what they aspire to, a guy with a guitar and a guy playing drums will more often than not sound like guys playing guitars and drums.</p><p>Where the California duo of Chris Schlarb and Tom Steck find freedom as I Heart Lung is not in their sound, per se, but in flexing the boundaries of all the potential sounds they can make. They shift, they stretch, they bend, they change form, they break rules, all in search of what feels right. And when they find what they're looking for, they move on to the next thing. If that implies restlessness, it shouldn't. I Heart Lung is experimental but still methodic, process music akin to watching the fluffy fractals of storm clouds shift and transform across the sky, or the tide rolling fresh waves in from who knows where, like clockwork but still different every single time.</p><p>It's no coincidence, then, that I Heart Lung have called their latest opus <em>Interoceans</em>. A four-song suite, of sorts, each long piece boasts an appropriately aquatic subtitle of ""Upwelling"", ""Overturning"", ""Undercurrent"", and ""Outspreading"". The disc aims less for the galvanizing effect of, say, such distant ""free"" predecessors as John Coltrane and Rashid Ali's <em>Interstellar Space </em>than it does for something more pastoral, even oddly blissful. It's also, despite the band's billing, only technically the work of a duo playing without a net. Schlarb and Steck reportedly recorded the disc's basic tracks together, but over the course of several months steadily layered and altered those improvisations with a series of overdubs and studio manipulations, occasionally enlisting ringers such as Nels Cline and trumpeter Kris Tiner to add their respective stamps.</p>
<p>While the general flow of the four extended movements clearly stems from improvisation, each is layered with more consciously composed embellishments. The results are a little like an artist switching palates halfway through a painting, reusing the canvas but leaving plenty of the original piece peeking through. It's been said that composition is just very slow improvisation, and <em>Interoceans</em> finds that line being continually blurred.</p>
<p>""Interoceans I (Upwelling),"" for example, begins with a wash of feedback and rolling drums before shifting to folky acoustic strums embellished by what may be nature sounds-- rain, chirping bugs. ""Interoceans II (Overturning)"" features humming, buzzing guitar leads and trumpet over a meditative drone. ""Interoceans III (Undercurrent)"" nods to Asia, a theme continued in ""Interoceans III (Outspreading)"", at least until the feedback returns to redirect the music closer to where the suite started.</p>
<p>It's an impressive bit of sleight of hand, pointing the way one direction before pulling you right back to where you came from. But if the journey ends close to where it began, there's still a sense of distance traveled. And when the final notes of the disc's dim cacophony fade to silence, you're pleasantly primed for all the unexplored places this duo has left to go on future trips.</p></div>"|12663.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12663-interoceans/|7.5|Joshua Klein

He spent much of the past 30 years crossing border after border and culture with culture, with sometimes striking results. His was the rare name linking disparate Western avant-pop luminaries (such as Björk, Peter Gabriel, David Sylvian, John Cale, Laurie Anderson, Brian Eno, and many, many more) with a host of similarly diverse fellow composers and performers gathered from around the globe. He often dealt in concept albums, with inspiration drawn from the Arctic, Africa, and all points in between.</p><p>In the House of Mirrors, released just a few weeks after Zazou's death, features the composer's final fusion, bringing together four primary players from India and Uzbekistan-- Toir Kuziyev on tambur and oud, Milind Raykar on violin, Ronu Majumdar on flute, and Manish Pingle on slide guitar-- to record in Mumbai compositions envisioned as modern updates of Indian classic music. But for a man who loved his concept albums, Zazou here keeps the focus woozy and blurry. It's like a Ry Cooder record by way of Fripp &amp; Eno, all over-lapping notes and drones, the melodies often entrancing but also tantalizingly open-ended and prone to meandering</p><p>Like similar-minded projects from Cooder (among other well-intentioned culture-vultures) the curiosity factor is one of the primary attractions of In the House of Mirrors, though the link between Uzbekistan and India is less than obvious. The musical traditions of the Central Asia country and the Indian subcontinent may overlap somewhere down the Silk Road, and one way or another the pan-Asian quartet (who call themselves Swara) wound up in Mumbai as eager collaborators. But their roots have less to bear on the results than the way they individually and collectively lend a tactile exoticism to what might have ended up just another mushy of electro-acoustic project à la Bill Laswell.</p>
<p>Which isn't to say tracks such as ""Wanna Mako"" don't flirt dangerously with new age, like the aural equivalent of burning incense. Or that the nearly 12-minute ""Darbari (With Soul Without Rules)"" doesn't sound like a film score wandering about in search of some visuals to. But Zazou, like many of his more ambitious fellow travelers, at least understood the importance of discord and darkness to his music, with mystery and ambiguity undercutting the more smoothed over surfaces. Certainly ""Sisyphe"" hums with a spooky sense of dread, while ""Twice as Good as We Are"" mines the collision of jazz, traditional Asian music, and the evocative echo of empty space with results worthy of the best of the ECM label.</p>
<p>Taken as a whole, however, Zazou's swan song is ironically hurt by one of its most prominent attributes. Zazou is such a seamless synthesist that he neglected to leave more of those aforementioned rough edges intact. For all its shadowy turns, <em>In the House of Mirrors </em>still remains simply too placid to make the most of its various and varied ingredients. After all, one of the most exciting things about fusion of this sort is the sense of recognition, parsing where all the pieces of the musical puzzle meet and how they may have mutated. <em>In the House of Mirrors</em>, on the other hand, is tour-brochure slick. While the collision of centuries old traditions with contemporary sounds has produced countless curiosities in the past, this particular one is ultimately missing the dirt and feet-on-the-ground grit needed to help it transcend the sterile bounds of the studio and achieve something more affecting rather than merely effective.</p></div>"|12664.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12664-in-the-house-of-mirrors/|5.8|Joshua Klein

The thing to do is not take yourself so seriously. The moment when you sort of start to believe all that stuff is when you get in trouble."" That's Lily Allen talking to this website in November 2006. At that point, her MySpace clarion of a debut, <i>Alright, Still</i>, was four months into what would become a 17-month stint on the UK's album chart. With her bluntly nonchalant, blog-like songwriting about dudes with small dicks, breezy beats worthy of a terrible <i>Ska-lright, Still</i> joke, and link-happy marketing campaign from the web up, Allen offered the music industry a way forward if not fiscally, at least artistically. She was the New Pop Star-- slight voice, bawdy, prom dress 'n' trainers, self-sufficient. The Anti-Idol. ""Refreshing"" followed her; ""candid"" was her friend. And, more than anything, Lily Allen was funny, excelling in the droll British humor of someone who had sold drugs in Ibiza at age 15 <i>and</i> realized the absurdity of a 15-year-old selling drugs in Ibiza.</p>
<p>So it seems odd for this chart guerrilla to fall into so many trad-pop trappings on sophomore album <i>It's Not Me, It's You</i>. There's the sound: <i>Alright, Still</i>'s hissy, homey samples are booted for decidedly more streamlined and schizophrenic backdrops. The voice: Allen's conversational and unpredictable flow is replaced with broad, upfront lines. The words: Since she's the story day after day now, the singer's journalistic wisecracks have turned inward-- and this time Lily's taking on biggies like religion, family strife, and drug abuse. The publicity: photo shoots for every wheezing print mag left, including brooding black and whites for <i>Interview</i> and <i>Blender</i>. She's taking herself a bit more seriously, in other words. It's troublesome.</p>
<p>But there is such a thing as good trouble. The push-pull between Lily's sober side and the side that slurred about how she'd ""still fuck"" 82-year-old Tony Bennett at an awards show last year can make for some appealing and slippery social commentary. Take first single ""The Fear"", part admission, part brag, part apocalyptic vision. ""I want to be rich and I want lots of money/ I don't care about clever, I don't care about funny,"" she starts, ""I want loads of clothes and fuckloads of diamonds/ I heard people die while they're trying to find them."" For almost any other artist, the lines would be barbed, sarcastic, and, ultimately, uppity and bland indictments. But not for the loudmouth who recently told <i>Spin</i> about how she hopes to marry a multi-millionaire and admitted to <i>The New York Times</i> that she spent $143,000 on clothes and jewelry in 2008 alone. She's part of the problem and is plagued by an overwhelming sense of collapse; she has her cake, throws it around the restored dining room and then feels a tinge of panic while observing the mess. This is perceptive pop for a consumer culture OD'ing on consumer culture and Houdini investments. ""I don't know what's right and what's real anymore,"" she confesses, sounding like the world's loneliest <i>Real World</i> alum.</p>
<p>When she turns her nose up at easy targets-- W., faith, hypocritical druggies-- this typically beyond-her-years 23-year-old can seem naïve. Futuristic Justice-meets-Care Bears synths flit by as Allen condemns cracked-out teens and their prescription parents on ""Everyone's At It"", but such revelations come off about as insightful as one of those ""but Dad, I learned it from <i>you</i>"" PSA's. Righty-baiting ""Fuck You"" utilizes ""Sesame Street"" piano plinks to serve its too-goofy hook-- and makes it clear just how easily Allen's winsome brattiness can turn into grating novelty. In her <i>Spin</i> cover story, she talked about her penchant for older men, complaining how 25-year-olds ""think they know everything and they're just fucking idiots."" Given songs like ""Fuck You""-- and considering her usually savvy self-awareness-- the quote is particularly unfortunate.</p>
<p>Aside from a couple <i>Alright, Still</i>-type kiss-offs-- the quotable country lark ""Not Fair"" about an underwhelming bedmate and oom-pah circus lark ""Never Gonna Happen""-- Sincere Lily takes grip on the rest of the LP. Family-minded tracks ""Back to the Start"" and ""He Wasn't There"" attempt (and fail) to hide rote therapy maxims behind maddening electro and faux-jazz, respectively. Britney/Kylie/Nelly producer Greg Kurstin works like a radio-ready Jon Brion, tossing out disparate styles with ease, but the stunt arrangements sometimes sound entirely divorced from Lily's accompanying sentiments. But form meets function well on two mid-tempo love songs, ""I Could Say"" and especially ""Who'd Have Known"". An airy, angst-less rewrite of Kelly Clarkson's ""Since U Been Gone"", ""I Could Say"" is snarkless and lovely-- <i>Kid Icarus</i> theme music via bulletproof Europop. ""Who'd Have Known"" is prime Lily 2.0, growing up without the heavy-handed, 2D ""maturity""; it's a knowing ode to early love and all the uncertainty, excitement and irrationality that goes along with it.</p>
<p>""I don't have anything that I'm really passionate about. Maybe I just haven't found what it is yet. But it's not music, which is a shame, because it would be good if it was."" That's Lily Allen talking to the <i>New York Times</i> last week. After the quick-hit success of her offhand debut, such a blasé attitude toward international success would be understandable, if a bit nuts. But, given the more considered <i>It's Not Me, It's You</i>, the quote comes off more like hedging; there will always be someone for vultures to photograph, but she's wise enough to know it might not always be her. Even if the new album can be cheaply on-the-nose and opportunistic at times, it's hard to root against Lily Allen. Her plight-- bare, self-conscious, petty, fearful-- is familiar. You see me; I see you.</p></div>"|12662.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12662-its-not-me-its-you/|6.6|Ryan Dombal

In 1969, while others were paring back and amping up, the Gibb brothers were building a wall of sound that owed more to Edward Elgar than Phil Spector, let alone Muddy Waters.</p><p><em>Odessa</em> was the sprawling result, a 2xLP in a luxuriant red velour sleeve-- there was no doubt this was an Important Statement from a group considered, up to this point, to be purveyors of sweet, harmless orch-pop. Barry Gibb was a pin-up and, as far as the serious press was concerned that slotted these guys alongside the Monkees. It meant little that ""I've Gotta Get a Message to You"" (a UK No.1 from the previous year) was about a convicted killer's dying request, or that their first three albums had featured thrilling psychedelic pop that trumped since-fetishized British acts like July or Blossom Toes.</p><p>The only hit single on <em>Odessa</em> was ""First of May"", a ballad that goes for world-weary significance (""Don't ask me why, but time has passed us by/ Someone else moved in from far away"") without making much sense-- this is a recurring Bee Gees lyrical trait, and an endearing one. ""First"" also boasted a melancholy music box arrangement and one of Barry Gibb's more sonorous croons. It is extremely pretty. It also caused a rupture in the group that would lead them to split up for the better part of two years. When Barry's ""First of May"" consigned Robin's ""Lamplight"" to the B-side, the festering jealousy between the brothers was made very public. Robin quit, made one odd solo album (<em>Robin's Reign</em>), and an even odder unreleased one (<em>Sing Slowly Sisters</em>) before the three were reconciled at the end of 1970.</p>
<p>""Lamplight"" doesn't sound like a hit, truthfully. No matter. From its heavily thrummed acoustic intro and unintelligible echo-ridden opening verse to the massed harps and a storyline that alludes to lost love and candlelit Victoriana, it seems Robin is unsure of what he wants to say, yet knows exactly how to say it: loudly and tearfully. You get the feeling he wished he'd been born 50 years earlier. Both songs are ambitious, then, but you can understand the younger brother's pique.</p>
<p>Rubbing salt into Robin's wounds, the title track had been given a catalogue number but was withdrawn in favor of ""First of May"". This would have been a brave and extraordinary single, the kind-- like ""Good Vibrations"" or ""Left to My Own Devices""-- that can prove almost impossible to follow. ""Odessa (City on the Black Sea)"" is about the sinking of the (fictitious) ship Veronica on Valentines Day, 1899. Over nearly eight minutes, it takes the form of a letter written by a shipwrecked sailor to his sweetheart, and careers between surreal music-hall observations (""You love the vicar more than words can say""), Flamenco flourishes, and the most dolorous, vast chords; on the final chorus Robin Gibb is reduced to a wordless wail that sounds rather a lot like the baring of his soul.</p>
<p>It seems cheap to claim a single album would have doubled <em>Odessa</em>'s strength, but nevertheless there are a clutch of weaker tracks, some of which include lyrics that sound tetchy and petulant (""You'll Never See My Face Again"", the draggy ""I Laugh in Your Face"") when you know the familial back story. None of them is ""How Do You Sleep?"". Still, you'd miss Barry's straighter pop cuts (the sunny ""Melody Fair"", a No. 1 single in Japan, the oboe-led ""Suddenly"") if Robin had got everything his own way. This reissued edition expands the release even further. Both the mono and stereo mixes are included, along with a bunch of intriguing demos (a rough version of ""Odessa"" itself with a cod-American spoken intro, a vocal version of the comically pompous ""With All Nations"") and the previously unheard ""Nobody's Someone"", a real gem that anticipates the early-1970s country-soul direction of ""How Can You Mend a Broken Heart"".</p>
<p>It seems that the flock sleeve and the fact it's a double has-- as the group doubtless intended in 1969-- led critics to lend <em>Odessa</em> a status some way above the other Bee Gees albums of the period. If it kept up the level of intensity on the title track, ""Lamplight"", and ""Black Diamond"" (another high-seas adventure of a song) it would merit the legend. As it is, <em>Odessa</em> is a feast that's hard to fault for ambition but too rich and occasionally too stodgy to take in one sitting.</p></div>"|12655.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12655-odessa/|7.2|Bob Stanley

While the cleanlier output of groups like Guided by Voices, Pavement, and Sebadoh lend credence to this belief, I hesitate to greet a spiffed-up Iran album with open arms. With two arcane, challenging, and beautiful albums released in the beginning of the decade, the San Francisco trio reveled in its enigma status, aided by a spectral production (or lack thereof) that rendered many riffs and melodies indecipherable, let alone lyrics.</p><p>Nearly seven years after the stunning <em>The Moon Boys</em>, <em>Dissolver</em>'s first surprise is the crisp, direct songwriting chops of frontman Aaron Aites. With an assist from TV on the Radio guitarist Kyp Malone, Aites trades cloak-and-dagger garbling for fist-pumping ""come on's"" and ""woo-hoo's,"" cutting a straight up guitar album indebted to bowl cuts and flannel. On twangy opener ""I Can See the Future"" we find Aites' vocals still slouching, but their clarity recalls David Berman or, as one Pitchfork staffer noted, one of Ween's drawling indie rock parodies. For better or worse, Iran's adopted a meaty rock swagger at the cost of their mystique, and they're not looking back.</p><p>For all the ballyhoo surrounding Malone's contributions and fellow TVOTR member Dave Sitek's co-production credit, the true highlights occur when Aites' hooks are at their sharpest, and he often struggles to integrate the hi-tech gadgets into his material. A couple of tracks-- most notably the sprawling ""Airport '79""-- smother ho-hum folk ditties with space-age guitar effects and busy overdubs, seemingly to make Iran compatible with 00s indie 2.0. The window dressing's most egregious on ambient instrumental ""Digital Clock and Phone"", a nod to Iran's tUMULt-era sound collages that's plopped between the album's tidy, organized songs. Not surprisingly, ""Where I'm Going"" and ""Can I Feel What?"", two brooding ballads with distorted vocals, stand out. Nicely layered guitars do the heavy lifting, allowing Aites' pretty melodies to remain as stubbornly low-key as on past highlights ""Four-Armed Star"" or ""Fading Out"".</p>
<p>While it's gutsy stepping out from behind the lo-fi curtain, you have to wonder to what extent Iran considers <em>Dissolver</em> their coming-out party. Alongside the signature slacker pathos there's a faint yearning for bombast, whether in the ""Buddy"" reprise (replete with stadium cheers and a drunken howl of a performance by Aites) or the power pop escapism of stompers like ""Evil Summer"". Yet the album's also bogged down by too much garden variety bar rock that's obliquely produced to masquerade as forward-thinking indie. It's certainly not an infuriating or even annoying direction for the band to go-- and considering their obscurity I can't imagine hoards of people up in arms over <em>Dissolver</em>-- but Iran's M.O. has pulled a complete 180. Once producing dense, complex music that rewards each additional listen, <em>Dissolver</em>'s content as comfort food for rockists, too quickly sating the listener.</p></div>"|12659.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12659-dissolver/|6.2|Adam Moerder

Though not until after sweat, skronk, drugs, sex, cowbells, toms, cello, saxophone, shrieks, falsetto, and an Obama shout-out. At the start of 12""s compilation <em>The Singles</em>, the Brooklyn duo of erstwhile !!! singer/drummer John Pugh and fashion designer Madeline Davy makes more like Free Beer. Downtown no wave takes the L train to Brooklyn dance punk, buys pills instead of that Polish beer, and basement-punk hedonism warps into a studio-funhouse manifesto. Comedown's a doozy, though: remix after interminable remix working buzz into buzzkill and ending up too drunk to screw. Like Jimmy Buffett fans.</p><p><em>The Singles</em>' six originals would make for a disconnected night out, and no doubt an energetic live show, but they're a wild ride in headphones. The unpredictable twists and turns-- the Jack Johnson acoustic-guitar shambling at the end of bass-centered ode to excess ""Never Hear Surf Music Again"", or the ear-splitting TV on the Radio soulful-rock futurism of ""Weekend Condition""-- don't leave much to hold onto, but they're varied and relatively fun. Most of the time, though, Free Blood are closer to the dub-chamber of Gang Gang Dance or the rangey punk-funk of Pugh's prior band, getting kinky with the piano-plinking rhythmic clatter of ""Royal Family"" or lost in the layered percussion of ""Parangatang"". Weird contrasts abound: On ""Surf Music"", Pugh and Davy chant ""I'm high"" until it sounds like the name of the Buckeye State. On the suggestively undulating ""Grumpy"", Pugh exclaims, ""Obama!"" Maybe Ludacris knows what it all means.</p><p>The five remixes drag out Free Blood's free-loving freakout without boosting the booty-shaking factor; it's as if <em>The Singles</em> is taking the new President's ""set aside childish things"" and getting stultifyingly adult with it. ""I'm not playing silly games,"" Pugh sings on ""Quick and Painful"", still a nice bacchanalian pastiche, but the Hot Chip remix is painfully absent here. Barfly's ""Surf Music"" remix separates out the instruments and emphasizes a bit of a rock feel with a bass hook that's part the Troggs' ""Wild Thing"" and part the Breeders' ""Cannonball"". Scotty Coats and Wes the Mes recognize the expressiveness of Pugh's ""Weekend Condition"" vocal, then make a screechy version of Jose Feliciano's ""Light My Fire"" with it. Brothers' ""Royal Family"" revamp fares best, frosting militaristic house beats with radioactive synths; ""Grumpy (Greg Wilson Version)"" is serviceable but sleepy space-disco, and ""Parangatang (Tim 'Love' Lee Mix)"" sounds like your alarm clock or the guy jackhammering outside. Party too long and it gets tedious (I'm told!). Wake up and it gets worse.</p></div>"|12657.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12657-the-singles/|5.9|Marc Hogan

Cresting on the ""O.C.""-pop wave churned up by the likes of Phantom Planet and Rooney, the Athens, Ga., band's guileless hummability went a long way towards overcoming its lack of originality.<br/> <br/>The Skirts of 2005 were a tuneful act for sure, though not exactly one you'd take all that seriously, even in their frequent melancholy moments. It seems likely this presumption of mop-toppery got under the band's skin in the intervening years, because its follow-up, <em>All of Us in Our Night</em>, is noticeably darker and less immediately accessible than its predecessor. It's also not as good, falling into the familiar trap of a young band striving for substance and consequently getting in its own way, unnecessarily upping the degree of difficulty and undermining many of the elements that made its music enjoyable in the first place.<br/><br/>That's not to suggest these guys became free jazz dadaists overnight or anything, yet many of the more easily abused traits of maturing artistry show up here-- oblique lyrics, a more sober vocal delivery, songs that seem to go in circles rather than a straight line. Too much of the album feels bloodless and hermetic. It starts with ""Chanel"", a worrying laggard of an opener with weird wordless background vocals that sound borrowed from TV on the Radio's cover of Pixies' ""Mr. Grieves"". The sex-and-drugs reverie ""Soft Pedals"" at least has lyrical specificity on its side, icky as those lyrics may be (""You got on top and we both got off again""). Still, it does little to pick up the tempo, which can also be said of the following track, the spaciously puzzling ""Chokehold"".<br/> <br/>Things don't really get moving until ""Radio Breaks"", and even then this heavily piano-dependent band is only maintaining a roughly Ben Folds-ian pace. ""Face Down"" boasts a nicely rippling riff, but it introduces another tendency that frequently hamstrings sophomore efforts, namely the urge to write about pop life and the road, manifested here in the backhanded plaudit (perhaps self-inflicted), ""you're famous in a small room."" Such tunnel vision seems also to inform ""Coversational"", the Third Eye Blind-ish (not necessarily an insult) ""Eveready"", and especially the Mike Mills-produced ""Motorcade"", with its invocations of money and amphetamines. ""Mrs."" (who ""misses a good thing"") feels like the most intriguing lyrical sketch, but at a slight three minutes that's all it has a chance to be: a sketch.<br/> <br/>Athens has a proud history of disparate bands-- from R.E.M. to Olivia Tremor Control-- who challenged lyrical and structural conventions in interesting ways while still managing to deliver pleasurable pop. Were the Modern Skirts content to replicate their debut and continue making sad-sweet tunes to soothe the bum trips of Bulldog fratties after watching Matthew Stafford throw another laser-guided interception, they'd already be in fine shape. <em>All of Us</em> seems instead to suggest a desire to transcend this modest scope, which is admirable for sure, though it's also clear the band will need some time to grow into the role.</p></div>"|12654.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12654-all-of-us-in-our-night/|4.8|Joshua Love

As you might expect, it can't do the job painlessly. Factory's magnificent, quixotic approach to branding-- catalogue numbers for buildings! Record sleeves that lost money on every purchase!-- helped build its legend, but also acted as a smokescreen for its erratic quality control. Almost every label makes duff signings, but Factory's were somehow excusable because of the mystique surrounding the organization-- founder Tony Wilson's charm, patter, and heroic whim giving the impression that allowing Crispy Ambulance to make awful records was part of the grand plan as surely as the menstrual egg-timer (FAC 8) was. Take away the aura the label cultivated, and a lot of the music on the box set feels awkwardly exposed.</p><p>What saves it is Factory's uniquely local quality. Born out of Wilson's enthusiasm for the Manchester arts beat he covered for a regional TV show, Factory had a close relationship with the city's music scene from the start, which became positively symbiotic when the label opened a club there. ""The Haçienda must be built"" was the situationist slogan that gave the venue its name: ""The Haçienda must be <em>filled</em>"" was the more pragmatic principle guiding much of the Factory aesthetic from the second disc of this box set onwards. The club provides one (literally) concrete reason for Factory's status as the UK indie label that engaged first and fiercest with dance music, and tracks here from Quando Quango's bubbly ""Genius"" to Happy Mondays' threatening ""Hallelujah"" were designed for its dancefloors. And though the Haçienda never funded Factory, its legal and financial struggles amid the decline into violence of Manchester's club scene formed one backdrop for the label's collapse.</p><p>Being the center of a local scene has a big impact on the kind of bands a label works with. If you're a Manchester group in 1979 and you idolize Joy Division, who are you going to send your demo tapes to? Wilson may have been the presiding artistic spirit at Factory, but the musical agenda was set by whichever band was making the running and the headlines in the city-- Joy Division, then New Order, then Happy Mondays. Not only is each group well represented on this box set, so are several acts who sound roughly like them. This has the unfortunate effect that the most famous music here is almost by definition the best.</p>
<p>Luckily, each formula was rich enough to allow a few kinks, and time has often been kind to acts who were crucified as copyists in their day. Tunnel Vision's ""Watching the Hydroplanes"", a rant against 1950s Britain and its legacy set to monotonous hand-me-down post-punk, received across-the-board pans back in 1981: Free of that context you can better appreciate its odd, venomous intensity. There's also a sense in which the most generic, trend-chasing music can be more sharply evocative of a time and place than its innovators are-- the clumsy, defiant lilt of Northside's ""Take 5"" tells you more about British indie's response to dance music than the Mondays' far superior ""Kinky Afro"".</p>
<p>So by telling a story, <em>Communications</em> manages to make its mediocre tracks more interesting than they actually are. Luckily, there's also plenty of purely musical intrigue. The songs you already know are great sound greater still in the context of what they inspired, and there's also fun to be had tracing the careers of Factory stalwarts like A Certain Ratio from the primitive gloom of ""All Night Party"" through the rippling unease of ""Knife Slits Water"" and ""Flight"" to the slick, stiff funk they ended up playing (their whistles-and-tracksuits Latin dance incarnation is mercifully absent).</p>
<p>More than this, the label's parade of non-hits and fleeting pleasures brings out a few gems. It's hard not to like John Dowie's comical ""It's Hard to Be an Egg"", especially coming in the midst of the grey-raincoated first disc. OMD and James appear in early, rough-draft versions-- bands working in very different styles, but both giddy with ideas they're not quite up to realizing yet. Miaow's ""When it All Comes Down"" is a delicious piece of tweepop, Marcel King's ""Reach for Love"" is yearning digital soul, and Cath Carroll's elegant ""Moves Like You"" had the misfortune to be cool and thoughtful at a time when what the press wanted from Factory was libidinous lads.</p>
<p>And through it all runs the beat. ""Blue Monday"" and the Happy Monday's ""W.F.L."" may have kickstarted different phases of the label's relationship with dance music, but Factory was always ahead of the pack when it came to exploring the possibilities of space and groove: Martin Hannett's experiments in rhythm and dread helping set an agenda that the label never backed away from. Tony Wilson's death in 2007 makes it tempting to view this box set as a testament to one man's vision, ear, and dreadful business sense, and it's true that you'd probably have to be Tony Wilson to enjoy everything here. But what Factory achieved was greater than that-- it helped build a city's idea of itself, and, in the wider community of British independent music, it kept the door open for eclecticism and idealism. The strength of this set is that you can hear that in the bad stuff as well as the good.</p></div>"|12661.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12661-factory-records-communications-1978-92/|6.8|Tom Ewing

Yet Matthew Houck, aka Phosphorescent, isn't interested merely in demonstrating the depths of his scholarship and reverence for the forerunners of his craft with his all-covers tribute to the Red Headed Stranger, <em>To Willie</em>. He wants, as Hot Chip might put it, to half nelson full nelson Willie Nelson, to wrestle intimately with the man's songs and what they're capable of communicating. In doing so, Houck proves himself an adept interpreter of Willie's piercing Christian grace, while indirectly revealing by the limitations of his scope-- the true remarkable human breadth of Nelson's artistry.</p><p>Houck does a couple of things extremely well, and to his immense credit he spends most of <em>To Willie</em> working in those veins. As he's demonstrated over the course of Phosphorescent's three very fine LPs of original songs, Houck is a master at conveying weariness, desolation, and spiritual hunger, often through a cracked, warbling bleat. That open-throated yelp is absent here, but Houck's keen understanding of fallenness and deliverance suffuses almost all of the album's best efforts. The opening ""Reasons to Quit"" is an addict's lament Nelson recorded as a duet with Merle Haggard (and was penned by Hag, actually), and while the original may have flashed a perverse resilience towards self-destructive behavior, Houck burrows into the numbing futility contained in a line like ""coke and booze don't do me like before."" It's followed, powerfully, by ""Too Sick to Pray"", an overlooked gem from Nelson's 1996 album <em>Spirit</em> that epitomizes spiritual exhaustion, with Houck sadly and perfectly putting across its overwhelming loneliness. Likewise, on ""It's Not Supposed to Be That Way"", desperation again cracks all of Houck's surfaces, his tremulous uncertainty echoed in the out-of-tune-sounding guitars.</p><p>The music of the church has informed Houck's own work for some time, and at his best here he treats Nelson's songs like precious, fragile hymns. ""Walkin',"" ""The Party's Over"", and ""Can I Sleep In Your Arms"" are all undergirded with solemnity, with the third a revelation. It might sound like heresy considering <em>Red Headed Stranger</em>'s<em> </em>""Can I Sleep"" is perhaps the most revered song of the collection, yet Houck arguably improves it, adding a heartbreakingly delicate lilt to the end of each verse's penultimate line that wasn't there before.</p>
<p>Talented and sympathetic though he may be, Houck is still working with a far more muted palette than Nelson, a fact most evident when he tackles jauntier, more clever material like ""I Gotta Get Drunk"", ""Pick Up the Tempo"", and ""The Last Thing I Needed (First Thing This Morning)"". Certainly it's admirable Houck didn't just pick 11 of Willie's most woebegone efforts to best suit his own forlorn MO, yet it's plain he lacks the wry humor and restless humanity of his interpretive object. Houck's impressive effort nonetheless inevitably sends you back to Nelson's originals, only illuminating their brilliance-- the sly threat of ""It's Not Supposed to Be That Way""; the proud, tight-lipped terseness of ""Too Sick to Pray""; the bitter wisdom of ""Permanently Lonely"" (which Houck does a nice job recontextualizing with spacey, narcotized synths). And, of course, there's Nelson's comic facility, which often cloaked his most devastating revelations, like how the accumulation of everyday bullshit on ""The Last Thing"" (""I opened the door on my knee"") gives way to overwhelming loss and grief. It's simply more proof that Nelson's matchless command of so many song styles and emotional states poses a daunting challenge to any presumptive handler of his canon. Houck still deserves plenty of plaudits for nailing the ones he knows.</p></div>"|12656.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12656-to-willie/|7.6|Joshua Love

A concern this monumental makes even the glut of books and albums about death seem paltry. So while maybe ""welcome"" isn't the right word, Benjy Ferree's second album, <em>Come Back to the Five and Dime, Bobby Dee Bobby Dee</em>, which is about the tragic life and lonely death of Disney child actor Bobby Driscoll, mines an inexhaustible subject. His album serves as a tribute to the child star, as well as a meditation on youth, fame, and death. But Driscoll's story never fully transitions into the realm of universalizable metaphor. The way Ferree approaches his life, from personal relationships, to Disney ephemera and 1950s doom, is slightly overwhelming, but it never quite passes beyond the specific constraints of its story. It's hard to see yourself in Driscoll's story, or to live inside these songs. You can't even die in them.</p><p>Driscoll's story plucks at the heartstrings, for sure. He acted and did voices for several Disney hits, starring in films like <em>Song of the South</em>, <em>Pecos Bill</em>, and <em>Treasure Island</em>. He voiced Peter Pan in the 1953 animated Disney production. Then Driscoll grew up, and, after a bad case of acne, was dropped from his Disney contract. The subsequent details of his life are bizarre and heartbreaking: he went on to do bit parts on network TV dramas, got married as a teenager, had three kids, got addicted to heroin, went to jail, got paroled, moved to New York, became part of Warhol's factory, became disillusioned, and finally disappeared. When his mother came looking for him she found out he had died 19 months earlier of a drug-related heart attack in an East Village tenement. He was buried in a mass grave in a New York's potter's field on Hart Island. Ferree's obsession with Peter Pan led him to Driscoll's story. It's thematic gold: the child who played Peter Pan grew up and lost his innocence, was manipulated by both Hollywood and the avant-garde, and died alone.</p><p>Ferree trades in whistles, four-part harmonies, falsetto, and big guitars. His music is quirky, drawing from both Americana and British rock: doo-wop and folk next to Queen bombast and blues stomp. In that sense he's come into his own with Bobby Dee; the sinister side of Disney's glee machine sits well with Ferree's dark cheer. That makes songs like ""Fear"", a doo-wop ballad where Ferree harmonizes beautifully on lines like ""When a mailman wears a mask and brings a ticking box"" and ""it pours blood into every dream,"" worth listening to. He lets children take over the ""yeah yeahs"" on the chorus of ""Blown Out (Gold Doubloons and Pcs of 8)"", as if the contrast of eternal youth and eternal death wasn't explicit enough. Driscoll's story isn't vague inspiration. Ferree uses specific names, places, and references throughout. ""What Would Pecos Do?"", for example, references the Pecos Bill character. If you watched the movie a ton, you'll recognize pieces from its story in lines like ""Drink up all the water/ What was a lake is now a crater."" If you didn't, then you're kind of screwed here.</p>
<p>Three years ago Ferree released his debut album,<em> Leaving the Nest</em>.<em> Bobby Dee</em> is a better record in many ways: Ferree obviously loves his source material, and the way he weaves in the references throughout is ingenious. But something about the pleasure he takes in his obsession cloisters it away - he can't quite make his subject <em>matter </em>in a way that transcends Bobby Driscoll's life and death. His interest in and empathy for Driscoll means he could give a shit about yours. This is Driscoll's and Ferree's album. ""This is my memory/ Yet it's your eyes that swell"" Ferree sings on ""Pisstopher Chrisstopher."" We're not that ""you.""</p></div>"|12660.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12660-come-back-to-the-five-and-dime-bobby-dee-bobby-dee/|6.5|Jessica Suarez

An enigmatic bunch, all: Jens Lekman signs off one of his best songs ""yours truly,"" but he's an entertainer pure and gifted enough to make fictions ring true when he ""reconstructs and remodels the past."" The Tough Alliance named their label Sincerely Yours, but they're as apt to hear sincerity in a Paris Hilton single as in a cult classic. What's more, both ""Information"" and ""Sincerely Yours"" turn out to be the titles of tunes by fellow Gothenburg pop impresarios the Embassy... who have shared a label with each of the aforementioned Swedes, at least at some point.<br/><br/>What these musically broad-ranging townsfolk have in common are 1) Unpolished vocals of the Bernard Sumner/Shaun Ryder school, and 2) An interest in the freedom of expression supposedly allowed by indie rock, only 3) Without indie's other typical, readily cooptable aesthetic conventions. So Lekman croons romantically over easy-listening samples, while Sincerely Yours signee Joel Alme bangs the piano to within an inch of Billy Joel's life. For their part, Studio split time between mesmerizing instrumentals and emotive new-wave pop. Their story so far has been one of addition, building from early 7""s and EPs to two 2006 vinyl-only releases and, finally, full-fledged 2007 debut CD <em>Yearbook 1</em>; last year's remix-based <em>Yearbook 2</em> added outside singers' vocals. Studio half Dan Lissvik also produced the latest Embassy single, irie Peter Bjorn and John-esque pop gem ""State '08"".<br/><br/>Lissvik goes without bandmate Rasmus Hägg on <em>7 Trx + Intermission</em>, unveiled amid little fanfare last November. If less isn't quite more here, it's often still enough. Despite the name, <em>7 Trx + Intermission</em> has nine tracks, titled only by number and spread out over almost 45 minutes. Studio ""half"" was right: Gone are the synths, vocals, and most of the Spanish guitar flourishes. Instead, Lissvik's electric guitar rambles across Mideast-at-midnight dune-grooves. Joining the usual Nordic mix of krautrock repetition and Vini Reilly's resplendent lyricism is every percussion instrument that ever clattered-- bongos, castanets, the clock from ""60 Minutes"". Those rich bass sounds unifying Studio's proper albums are back, reverberating across the syncopated spaces at tempos just too slow for dancing. Remember ""Regulate"" with Warren G? On track seven (aka ""B3"" if you're spinning vinyl), birds squawk over a groove that's almost its drowsy, staccato cousin.<br/><br/>As a set of cerebral <em>Arabian Nights</em> bedroom jams, <em>Aladdin</em> to 2007's <em>The Lion King</em>, <em>7 Trx + Intermission</em> works best when it stretches out. Listeners should probably do the same. You don't need a hookah to enjoy the dune-whistling woodwinds on track five or the undulating reverbations on track six, but I imagine it would help. At nearly 11 minutes, the third track's neatly interwoven guitars have plenty of room to turn hazily distorted, the meditative poolside listen you never thought you'd need in January. If <em>7 Trx + Intermission</em> eventually starts to blur together and wear me down on focused, repeat listens more than Studio's celestial drifts ever do, that's probably to be expected from an album more about surreptitiously effecting a certain mental state than keeping us glued to the edge of our seats. One of the original English meanings for ""information""? Giving form or shape to the mind.</p></div>"|12653.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12653-7-trx-intermission/|6.4|Marc Hogan

As a lovingly silly metal side project from Rob Crow (Pinback, Heavy Vegetable), Goblin Cock's first record had had a certain air of expectation: If you were going to put the offending titular member on the front cover of your record (pierced and poking out from the robes of a magisterial goblin), you had to deliver something that sounds like metal. On that end, Crow and co. acquitted themselves with fervor, but it was a novelty in any sense of the term. Now, because no one asked for it, they're back with a second record, and the cover isn't even dirty. This time there's nothing left to do but write songs, and the ones on <em>Come With Me If You Want to Live</em> seem more likely to be played more than once.<br/><br/>To those who are concerned about false, dilettantish, or ""hipster"" metal, know that there are many things Goblin Cock are not: punishing, uncompromising, extreme, dour, and most of all, hip. But they are often a lot of fun. There's less metal posturing here than before, and the songs have taken on a slower and sludgier bent. Much like Crow's other projects, there are numerous little melodies, counter-rhythms, and unexpected earworms tucked into the songs. With Goblin Cock, gleeful boneheadedness meets melodic restlessness. ""We Got a Bleeder"" should gain steam from the relentless repetition of its one-note chug, but Crow can't help but have the song fold back on itself with a vocal harmony. Thundering bass lays out a melodic anchor to the slow churn of ""Big Up Your Willies"", which closes with a glassy, alien instrument tapping out new rhythms, all while Crow sings ""raise our willies high up"" on the key-changing chorus (if I've deciphered the lyric sheet correctly; it's written in runes).<br/><br/>As the riffs get slower and the guitar tone soggier, some of it starts to sound more grunge than metal, like the marble-mouthed vocals on the sludge-pop of ""Loch"" or the languid low-end riff and disaffected singing of ""Haint"". And of course, some of it sounds a lot like Pinback, but less fussy and with more palm-muted rapid downstrokes and more general swagger, none of which is really a bad thing. Slow, melodic riffs and pristine harmonies dominate ""Ode to Billy Jack"", and in place of the joke-metal filler from the first record, we get tracks like ""Tom's Song (T.O.F.)"", a double-tracked duel between acoustic and electric guitar, with a slow-burning chorus and clean, concise hook.<br/><br/>If the record seems like a bit of an anachronism, maybe it's not just the cover art or the hopelessly outdated reference of the title. You're more likely to see a metal band sporting a grin than many indie acts with guitars these days, and there used to be bands that had a sense of humor without being a joke themselves.

But you didn't need to actually see the Forest Whitaker movie to know the record knocked something serious. Due to RZA never really breaking character when choosing alter-egos/side projects, I expected something similar from <i>Afro Samurai Resurrection</i>, the follow-up to 2007's manga soundtrack <i>Afro Samurai</i>. However, if I'm to take the music as face value indicative of its inspiration, the two things I'd figure about Afro is that 1) He derives his power from some sort of headband, and 2) He was a lot better at doing what he does about 15 years ago.</p>
<p>This whole ""return of the 90s!"" thing could be mashed into a fine paste before it reaches<i> </i>outside of internet writing circles, but the main problem hip-hop isn't sharing with, say, Slumberland and noise-pop redos is that most of the artists trying to revive Clinton-era styles actually recorded during that time. And really, RZA's too busy chopping it up at Guitar Center tech displays and on set with Russell Crowe to realistically compete with his past.  Sonically, it's not far from anything he did on <i>Digi Snacks </i>or <i>Birth of a Prince</i>-- simultaneously too slick and digital to work towards his strengths, but not plush enough to suggest he could have anything but a Rik Cordero video treatment without <i>Afro's </i>attendant Kill Bill meets Boondocks animation.</p>
<p>We've heard these elements before-- Shaolin hand-block snare, steamy funk guitar, bass that hits like a depth charge of <i>The Chronic</i>. But where RZA would weave each together into backdrops as bloody and vibrant as a freshly opened vein, here he's content to chop a sample and let it repeat every four bars, if not even more often than that, and it's hard to imagine anyone fighting to get the first crack. There are a couple of ripe exceptions, notably ""Dead Birds"", which has System of a Down (well, the bassist at least) helping conjure an El-P-style dystopia, but you just spend three minutes wishing it was an actual El-P track. ""Girl Samurai Lullaby"" could pass for some touristy Reggae Sunsplash shit from the softest day in Shabba Ranks' 1992; ""Nappy Afro"" is a throwback to a time when trying to rip off She'kspeare was the quickest way to radio rotation.</p>
<p>Things really aren't that much better on the mic-- god bless RZA, but at this point, he's all but ignoring meter completely, flowing like a three-legged race. Sixteen years after Method Man expounded on the genesis of Inspectah Deck's name, we can only sit back and watch him play himself: ""I'm looking for some get back/ I'm quick to push your wig back/ You shouldn't have did that."" Fortunately, we get some much-needed career resuscitation from Rah Digga (though neither beat does her justice) and ""Whar"", the strongest track and the one that has the least to do with the plot. And yet, even as Kool G Rap (sounding a lot like Jim Jones now that he's ad-libbing) and Ghostface kick nice punchlines about Al Capone's syphilis and Abe Lincoln's beard, it's still somewhat by-the-numbers.</p>
<p>But after the initial burst of brand recognition, we're left with the same Wu affiliate filler that most of us have been wisely ignoring for the better part of two decades. Killah Bees don't die, they multiply and spit martial raps full of discipline and bereft of any iota of personality that could distinguish between Wu-Tang Name Generator figments like Prodigal Sunn, Rugged Monk, and Moe Roc. The Black Knights stand out by matter of (relative) familiarity, and if you happen to be a blood relative of someone on ""Take The Sword Pt. III"", you might be able to make it through all 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Look, it's no fun either way-- to plow through <i>Afro Samurai Resurrection, </i>or to bitch and moan about back in the day, a fate that befalls something like 99% of all mainstream releases. But at least the video game looks tight, which is something you can't say about Wu's output in <i>that </i>market back in the rec-room era. In this economy, that's just choosing your battles wisely.</p></div>"|12651.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12651-afro-samurai-resurrection/|4.2|Ian Cohen

After all, in 2009 all bets are off, and logic can basically go fuck itself: Hot Chip recently recorded with Robert Wyatt; Chris Cornell with Timbaland (although this makes a weird kind of sense for Cornell-- too pretty for Grungetown, too grungy for Prettytown, he's always been stuck between worlds). And now, this.<br/><br/>In fact, the Andy Moor in question is the Netherlands-based guitarist from such revered anarcho-punk bands as Dog Faced Hermans and the Ex. <em>Patches</em> consists of live, improvised tracks the duo recorded while touring together-- Moor on guitar, Rupture on turntables. In some ways, it's the opposite of <em>Uproot</em>: guitar-centric, spontaneous, and brittle. It sounds like an odd match, but if any punk guitarist is equipped for this sort of thing, it's Moor. Like Rupture, the Ex is known for incorporating a broad variety of non-Western styles into its music. Moor also has improv chops, as evidenced by the Ex's extemporaneous double-LP <em>Instant</em> and <em>In the Fishtank </em>collaborations with Sonic Youth and ICP. Rupture and Moor use different media, but their curatorial interests are alike.<br/><br/>Together, they've forged an often-delirious concoction of post-punk serration, dubstep duskiness, hip-hop swagger, and free-jazz texture. As a general tendency, Moor vamps on arid, precise riffs, around which Rupture weaves loose nets of manhandled breaks. Then he tightens the net as the riffs become more assertive, as if to keep them from galloping away. Some of Rupture's samples are glaringly obvious-- another shift from the arcane selections of <em>Uproot</em>. On the dubby ""Ella Speed"", Moor plays spidery figures as Rupture flips the wolf whistle from Juelz Santana's ""There It Go (The Whistle Song)""; on ""One Hundred Month Bloom"" toneless guitar meets a tweaky version of the famous overture from Smashing Pumpkins' ""Today"". On ""Jimmy Rogers"", Diana Ross sings ""My World Is Empty Without You"" over disembodied vocals, shrieking pitches, and subliminal chords. Tracy Chapman shows up on ""Tracy"", its time-bomb riff ticking down to an echoing excerpt from ""Behind the Wall"". These moments feel like an unusually arty Girl Talk set, and are balanced by a ton of stealthy samples I'm helpless to identify.<br/><br/>The vibe is persistently chilly, the terrain merciless-- even when Moor sets controls for the heart of the sun, as on the riff-heavy ""The Sheep Look Up"", he can't thaw Rupture's unforgiving tundra. Some tracks are spectral and nebulous, like the watery, de-tuned ""Tidal"". The riddim-oriented ones are better-- on ""Chisanga"", Moor's string-bent squiggles gradually flatten out into a hitching riff, which Rupture surrounds with a phalanx of strafing drums. But the ones where they truly mind-meld, rather than Rupture chasing after Moor's riffs with periphery-bound FX, are best. On ""Hot Pink Orleans"", mercury-slick sonar blips, pinging whammy-barred guitars, and scudding bass amass into a well-balanced dubstep apparatus. On ""Sometimes It Can Be Difficult To"", nervous guitar skitters, nervous scratches, and reverbed snares build into something resembling a terrible car crash. ""Our Enemies Have Watches But We Have Time"" astonishes with its violent drum breaks, which make Moor's snarling riff sound meek by comparison.<br/><br/>True to its circumscribed nature, <em>Patches</em> lacks the awesome diversity of <em>Uproot</em>. But it's impressive that this improvised work packs a clandestine socio-political payload, which usually resolves in some latent irony between samples and song titles (although Tracy Chapman's lament of police uselessness is politically loaded from the start). If you know that ""Ella Speed"" is the title of a blues song about a man who becomes obsessed with a prostitute and shoots her to death, those Juelz whistles become less of a ""hey I recognize that"" gimmick, and more of an astringent comment on predatory male lust. The machine-gun drums and land-mine chords of ""Our Enemies Have Watches But We Have Time"" are a bit chilling if you know the title is a Taliban slogan. ""The Sheep Look Up"" takes its title from a dystopian sci-fi novel by John Brunner, which deals with environmental degradation in the U.S., making its party vibe rather sardonic. Careful listeners will discover other secret polemics, buried so deeply as not to disturb those who simply want to marvel at the killer instincts and catlike reflexes of Moor and Rupture live.</p></div>"|12652.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12652-patches/|7.2|Brian Howe

Technology's sporadic cycle has taken us now from foot to sea to wires to air to wireless, so that what I'm typing this instant could be read by someone in many of the world's countries the next. Whatever it is you want, your computer can probably give it to you right now. With that progression, our attention span has regressed dramatically: We text as we eat, watch funny videos as we lounge, and use the internet as the television blares. With music, shuffling and skipping have compromised the most fundamental units of consumption, the album and the song. In several interviews for last year's <em>Songs in A&amp;E</em>, Jason Pierce-- who's explored hour-long drones in Spacemen 3 and escalating ecstasy in Spiritualized-- said, ""People aren't taking albums. They're taking tracks. I'm waiting for when they just want the chorus."" He wondered if people will only need the notes-- the A and the E-- soon enough. Maybe he's onto something: In a world where anything can be here any second, will we want something that takes any longer?</p><p>It's a bit too convenient to reduce <em>Pantheon of the Lesser-</em>- the monolithic sophomore album from Portland, Maine's long-and-heavy metal quartet Ocean-- into an act of defiance to this speeding, shrinking world. But the 36- and 23-minute tracks that comprise <em>Pantheo</em>n do feel a bit like revolt. They crawl through big riffs, rewarding the attentive with method and nuance, an achievement that recalls the subtle payoffs of classical composers Arvo Pärt and Philip Glass. Expectations and options become exits and entrances, trapdoors that allow the band to keep its familiar guitar-drum-bass space churning and fresh. For this, Ocean never feels selfish or ungrateful with its audience's time. And the payoffs? Imagine the climax of your favorite post-rock explosion lasting longer and gilded with the heavy elements and themes of desperation. Indeed, among the relatively crowded field of viscous, torpid metal (doom, drone, sludge or otherwise), <em>Pantheon of the Lesser </em>feels like a new benchmark.</p><p>Check opener ""The Beacon"": A colossal drum hit blows the album open, only to be trailed by a slow riff that fingers through scrims of its own feedback note by note. The drums keep coming, directing the action and scattering the riffs like cannonballs, everything marching in unison alongside vocalist Candy's subterranean, super-serrated growls. The track moves in and out of that mold until it all collapses, leaving only a martial drumbeat above washes of feedback. And just when the climax hits, the band breaks into a sublime haze of guitar glow and drum decay. ""Of the Lesser,"" the second and final track, opens like ""The Beacon"" in reverse, a minute of silence punctuated by lonely guitar chords that hover in the air. The familiar march begins, but this time, the guitars pull away from the beat, lunging back from its forward progress. The guitars eventually charge ahead, and the drums even race into a double-time pound. <br/><br/>During the first half of <em>Pantheon</em> and most of 2005's <em>Here Where Nothing Grows</em>, Ocean often alluded to one central riff, a low-slung chord progression that's always been stunted or subverted at the last second. But about 16 minutes into ""Of the Lesser"", they launch directly into it, stating it and repeating it three times. They begin the riff again, but sustain one note, returning to march formation. After those riffs, the last six minutes become but a blissful afterglow. ""Salt"", the second track from <em>Here Where Nothing Grows</em>, was an exercise in writing into and out of that riff; much of that album's third track, ""The Fall"", employed the same maneuvers. <em>Pantheon</em>, then, is an arrival, delivering on a three-year-old promise. That's a long time to wait for a riff to be resolved, but-- no hyperbole intended-- it's made every bad MP3 shuffle or bland slow-metal album I've heard since <em>Here Where Nothing Grows</em> worth it.</p></div>"|12648.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12648-pantheon-of-the-lesser/|8.4|Grayson Currin

After spending the past five years laying down riffs on hits by Lil' Kim, Nelly Furtado, and Black Eyed Peas, he now has a legit radio staple of his own in ""Let It Rock"". He's got the kind of connections that can land laudatory guest spots from Lil' Wayne, Nas, and Rick Ross. By an ungodly measure, he's already the best guitarist that will ever be signed to his record label. While this might initially read like a welcome relief amidst working the conveyor belt of crusty dudes with a bedraggled acoustic and Bon Iver champagne wishes, none of the above matters because <em>In the City</em> envisions an alternate dystopia of rock music where Rudolf's Kurt Cobain, Shop Boyz are the Pixies, and I suppose N.E.R.D. are the Beatles.</p><p>But whereas ""Party Like a Rockstar"" was t-t-t-totally aware of its oncoming obsolescence, <em>In the City </em>is proof that you can co-opt the most retarded aspects of 80s corporate rock and still not be any fun. Or maybe Andrew W.K. and the Darkness made it look too easy-- Rudolf instead honors everything synthetic and awful about his two homebases (Miami and New York) by consolidating Jani Lane's cherry-poppin' misogyny, Jon Bon Jovi's bleached-out street tales (first lines: ""Every day I'm a star in the city/ Walk the streets like a wanted man""), and Jefferson Starship's staunch belief in the redemptive power of rawk in the face of urban decay. </p><p>As expected from a rock record released on Ca$h Money, this the kind of thing you might hear in a body spray ad-- there is little indication it was constructed by real people in real time. Then again, considering ""No Way Out"" is an honest-to-god <em>Wizard of Oz</em> metaphor writ large, I can't imagine Rudolf himself is familiar with a lot of rock music. I will admit that undersells Rudolf's range a bit: <em>In the City </em>spans dead ringers for that acoustic Incubus song to tracks that could soundtrack the montage where the picked-on kid finally preps to push it to the limit with Billy Zabka (""Welcome To The World"").</p>
<p>And then...Rick Ross shows up to Leon Lett all over a beat that's about 30 bpms faster than anything he should rap on. It's best to fast forward to just about any other point on the record, where chances are that Rudolf is going on about the City and its many Lights. Paul Banks can no longer boast the most lyrically awkward song called ""NYC"", not after Rudolf boasts a cynicism that far outstrips his celebrity: ""In the city of dreams/ You get caught in the schemes/ And fall apart in the seams."" And then Nas manages to namedrop Mayor Bloomberg and Scatman Crothers, which admittedly is sort of surprising to hear outside the context of an MF Doom record.</p>
<p>Look, it's no secret that rappers have pretty suspect taste in rock music: John Mayer, just about any of the source material for <em>Diplomatic Immunity</em>, Kanye including Lenny Kravitz in any discussion of Prince and Hendrix. Which means <em>In the City </em>makes a lot of sense, existing in some sort of triangulation of these coordinates and somehow missing all consumer markets outside the most stubborn poptimists and/or Ca$h Money completists who didn't give up after Turk's <em>Young &amp; Thuggin. </em>Judging from what we've heard in his rock forays thus far, Lil' Wayne thinks <em>In the City </em>is the shit (or maybe his kids do), and in these days you could probably find less compelling reasons to rush a record out into the public.  But just in case you're taking a half-full approach to <em>Rebirth</em>, you might want to hear this first.</p></div>"|12649.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12649-in-the-city/|2.7|Ian Cohen

A few other twee/noise-pop revivalists arguably pulled off that same trick last year, but Pains of Being Pure at Heart are likely to appeal to listeners beyond online name-droppers and Brooklyn scenesters.</p>
<p>That these second-wavers are getting first-rate attention shouldn't be a worry unless you're into dick-measuring contests about the late-1980s (<i>but I was there</i>) or still holding a grudge against Vivian Girls and Crystal Stilts. Despite being such a streamlined listen, <i>The</i> <i>Pains of Being Pure at Heart</i> acts as something of an indie Rorschach: Once our staff got a hold of the fuzzy, major-chord fizz of ""Come Saturday"" or ""Stay Alive"", it raised comparisons to everything from Sleepyhead to Black Tambourine to even Peter Bjorn and John (at their most shoegazy) and Ride (at their most heavy-lidded). In other words, you'll dig this record as long as you're a fan of trebly, melancholy pop music. Which is quite a lot of people reading this review.</p>
<p>What distinguishes <i>POBPAH</i> from the rest of their modern peers is a sense of craft located in the sweet spot between wilfull amateurism masking incompetence and not gumming things up with bells and whistles. It's immediate and substantial, but initially, it can seem distracting that the band is built more for speed than muscle. Yet these aren't songs that need anchors-- as much as Alex Naidus' bass plays an integral role in pushing everything forward, he's more likely to contribute melodic counterpoint than low end. Kip Berman's voice is appropriately unaffected, working in melodies that almost feel like 45-degree angles-- exact, acute, and just right. Keyboardist Peggy Wang-East doesn't harmonize in a traditional sense with Berman very often, but particularly on ""Young Adult Friction"", her vocals are a hook in themselves, taking an already strong chorus to a higher plateau.</p>
<p>So yeah, they've got the sound figured out, but what ensures that this will be something that'll make it past the point where the indie cycle of life goes on and bands are inevitably starting to cop the sounds of, say, Archers of Loaf? Regardless of the b&amp;w cover art, there's more gray matter than initially appears. The title alone of ""This Love Is Fucking Right!"" is enough to set off the sugar shock factor (it's a nod to the Field Mice), and that's before the chorus which renders the f-bomb ""feckin!,"" but the invocation of ""you're my sister"" before the title is as dark as you want it to be.</p>
<p>""Stay Alive"" is the record's centerpiece, boasting the most anthemic chorus; initially, it could pass for cloyingly optimistic, with bell-like keyboard pinches accenting thumbs-up signifiers like ""shoot at the sky"" and ""you'll stay alive."" But once again, after closer listens it takes a darker tone, possibly talking down a suicidal friend. Most tellingly, ""Come Saturday"" sets the stage for the rest of the record with a promise of ignoring parties for a summer wasting and spent indoors. It's every bit as heartfelt as the later lyrical nod to Another Sunny Day.</p>
<p>But then again, sincerity never made me turn up the volume. The Pains of Being Pure at Heart simply made a slyly confident debut that mixes sparkling melodies with an undercurrent of sad bastard mopery, and you're just being a dick if you think the past has some kind of patent on that.

Who else but the overgenerous ex-Guided by Voices tunesmith could benefit more from a device that merely needs a vocal melody to cough up a song? Forget the album-a-month pace Pollard's seemingly been keeping these days, with his recent work from his Boston Spaceships, Circus Devils, and his latest solo effort <em>The Crawling Distance</em>; we'd be getting an album-a-day from Bob and his imaginary backing band. Part of me thinks that sort of thing's not so far off for Mr. Pollard already.<br/><br/>Guided by Voices were once a fairly centralized recording concern, but Bob's long been fond of rock-by-correspondence. And he's found quite a pen pal in Todd Tobias, a late-era GBV associate and the strongman to Pollard's bearded lady in the Circus Devils. Pollard and Tobias have been working in this manner for some time now, and the arrangement, I gather, goes like this: Pollard writes the songs, crafts some vocal demos with rudimentary instrumentation, shoots them off to Tobias for fleshing out, and sits around writing the next one while waiting for the results. It's an arrangement with its share of successes-- 2006's <em>From a Compound Eye</em> and last year's <em>Robert Pollard Is Off to Business</em> spring to mind-- but it's also one that's made for some awkward fits; Pollard's the dude responsible for the gloriously crappy-sounding pastiche of <em>Bee Thousand</em> and <em>Propeller</em>, whereas Tobias' workmanlike efforts never sound that far from the backdrop of a ""Dawson's Creek"" episode. Never has that rift between Pollard the songwriter and Tobias the arranger been more transparent-- and more problematic-- than on the formless, often dull <em>The Crawling Distance</em>, a particularly blank batch of Pollard tunes dressed to the nines in Tobias' perfunctory sheen. <br/><br/>Pollard's always best when he's tossed a little grit in the arrangements and kept the song lengths down to a minimum. There are almost certainly some crappy hooks on, say, Guided by Voices' <em>Alien Lanes</em>, but you have a much harder time picking them out when they're buzzing by your head at such a pace. The last several GBV records and Pollard's recent solo work are chock full of songs that approach the five-minute mark, and almost without fail, they tend to plod. So when <em>Crawling Distance</em> kicks off with the characterless piano-led four-minute rocker ""Faking My Harlequin"", it's a stumble the album never quite recovers from. ""Harlequin"" sounds a bit like a modern-era Sonic Youth song before the inevitable noise freakout, but here the tension builds but is never released. Instead, the record moves into the earwormy but stupid swagger of ""Cave Zone"". ""Red Cross Vegas Night"" is nothing more than your standard-issue Pollard-style slow starter-turned-fist pumper, ""The Butler Stands for All of Us"" rides a nice little rolling mod-pop melody and a sneaky guitar line into mediocrity, and the strummy dirge of ""It's Easy""-- though a bit like <em>Mag Earwhig!</em>'s ""I Am Produced"" in tone-- really only has the one thing going for it: the line ""tax exempt with Touchdown Jesus.""  <br/><br/>The second half fares a bit better, with the curious circular melody and Sebadoh-like downstrum of ""No Island"" and exciting post-punker ""By Silence Be Destroyed"". Alas, then there's ""Imaginary Queen Anne"", a nice enough slow jam sung with feeling that Pollard could-- and, hell, maybe does-- knock out on trip to the fridge at this point. ""On Shortwave"" is one of those maudlin but intense things Pollard's been brooding over since at least the <em>Universal Truths</em> days. Finally, there's ""Too Much Fun (Is Too Much Fun)"", on which Pollard wastes a killer verse melody with some truly dumbass lyrics then progs up the place at every other point in the song with entirely too much riffage. Hey rockers, wanna end your records on a weird note? Write one about whimsy that is in almost no way enjoyable. Works every time. <br/><br/>Though his vocals are fairly strong throughout, Pollard sounds a bit out of gas while pushing the pen, and these songs by and large aren't much on either structure or substance. But enduring a few lousy Pollard songs in a row is pretty much par for the course for fans of the man these days, so placing the blame for <em>Crawling Distance</em>'s failure on Pollard's shoulders would be grossly unfair. It'd all be easier to take if Tobias were doing anything at all interesting with the melodies he's crafting around Bob's tunes. But apart from piling a few extra effects onto the plodding ""Harlequin"", he's giving each and every song its most baseline pop-rock arrangement. Hell, if Tobias is producing most of the stuff Pollard's putting out these days, he's a busy character, and that may go some way to explaining why all these songs were given this unimaginative treatment. And perhaps this is what Pollard wants; more records, more often, with passable sound and enough new tunes to get him through the next all-too-rare tour. But, weak as these tunes appear in their current form, one can't help but wonder how they might've sounded chopped into morsels and fleshed out with a bit more fervor. Or, hell, through Songsmith. Just about anything but how they are right now.</p></div>"|12637.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12637-the-crawling-distance/|2.8|Paul Thompson

They were also one of the best. An innovative group that developed its own distinctive style of hard-driving funk but still found time to record in just about every style imaginable, from highlife, Afrobeat, and rumba to rock, jazz, soul, and folk. And yet, as of today, they don't even have a Wikipedia page. That peers of Bembeya Jazz National, Orchestra Baobab, Rail Band, OK Jazz, Fela's Africa 70, and every other great African band of the 1950s-70s has managed to remain this obscure and unheard is frankly baffling-- and attributable more to the capricious nature of fame than any other single factor.</p>
<p>The band's geographic location probably didn't help. Their home country of Benin, a relatively small nation bordering Nigeria, is often overshadowed in the eyes of the rest of the world by its neighbors, and because the former French colony and its even smaller neighbor Togo are surrounded by the Anglophone giants Ghana and Nigeria, their recordings sometimes found it difficult to travel far outside their borders. (Though they did tour much of Africa and even France during their 1969-1982 heyday.) Still, Poly-Rythmo and its most prominent members are household names in their homeland.</p>
<p>Compiled by Analog Africa's Samy Ben Redjeb, <i>The Vodoun Effect</i> gathers 14 of the band's rawest, funkiest cuts into a thrilling hours-plus album. The generous, 44-page liner notes inform us that while the band did most of its recording, and certainly its most prominent recording, for the Albarika Store label, it also cut dozens of sides for smaller labels of more modest means. This compilation focuses on those releases. Many of these tracks were recorded with a microphone or two plugged into a Nagra reel-to-reel machine, but you'd never guess the setup was that simple from the incredible depth and fidelity of the sound. Pressings of these 45s rarely exceeded 500 copies, and distribution scarcely ever reached outside the coastal cities of Cotonou and Porto Novo, so this is the first any of these songs save one have ever been available outside Benin. (There's no overlap at all between this and the other two Poly-Rythmo comps available in the West, Sound Way's excellent, funk-focused <i>Kings of Benin Urban Groove</i> and Popular African Music's highlife-centric and also great <i>Reminiscin' in Tempo</i>.)</p>
<p>The engine of the band was its rhythm section: drummer Yehouessi Leopold, lead guitarist Bernard ""Papillon"" Zoundegnon, and bassist Gustave Bentho. Leopold was a master of the polyrhythmic foundations the band was named for, effortlessly playing three against four to give the band's songs a swaying, unstoppable feel and adapting the Vodoun (aka voodoo) ceremonial rhythms <i>sato</i> and <i>sakpata</i> into unique funk that drove the band at a frenetic pace. Just as the sound is stripped down on these recordings, so too is the band, with the horns frequently absent, leaving just the core of drums, bass, and two guitars, with some buzzing organ and a singer or two. The immense rhythmic power of the music is the primary attraction, but the compositions are also quite sophisticated, setting contrasting sections against each other, hinging on memorable refrains and still leaving space for the band to stretch out and strut its stuff.</p>
<p>The telepathic tightness of the band is a strength: The group latches onto the relatively slow sakpato beat of ""Mi Ni Non Kpo"", entwining the guitars around the sturdy bassline and crackling percussion to create a psychedelic whirlwind of intertwining rhythm. Elsewhere, ""Se Tche We Djo Mon"" simply rides a pulsating, non-stop groove, slathering it with Papillon's weightless lead guitar, which carries one of the disc's most memorable riffs. Papillon's solo on ""Assibavi"" is jaw-dropping, deploying rippling waves of notes soaked in heavy reverb to create a shimmering soundscape above the din of the band. ""Mi Homlan Dadale"" features a dramatic rhythmic shift to a majestic organ and guitar phrase between its verses, then jumps back into pocket again while the vocalist hangs on for the ride. There's not a single track that doesn't have a groove worth talking about, and there's not a single groove whose power can be adequately translated into words.</p>
<p>Papillon and Yehouessi Leopold both died within a year of each other in the early 1980s, just as mainstream artists and listeners around the world were finally getting clued in to African sounds, and it's tough not to think what might have been had the classic rhythm section been able to carry them into that era. At the very least, those outside Benin are finally getting to hear this music, delivered in a beautiful, informative package stuffed with photos and even a small-label 45 discography, and for that we should be grateful.</p></div>"|12635.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12635-volume-one-the-vodoun-effect-funk-sato-from-benins-obscure-labels-1973-1975/|8.7|Joe Tangari

For a distribution gimmick primarily focused on generating internet buzz, even complaining about the length of the compilation misses the point. And if you <em>do</em> find one track that isn't worth your time-- say, the sub-par feature with James Blunt-- then you can always wait until tomorrow, or hit forward on your iPod, and there's a good chance there will be a track you dig. <em>Month of Madness</em> has a lot going for it-- consistency, quality, and the bottomless hard drive space of the iPod age-- but 32 straight bangers can also be an artist's own worst enemy. <br/><br/>Freeway is a great rapper; he's never lazy, writes detailed, interesting verses, and spits them with unique, frantic urgency. He has great taste in beats, using producers that hew closely to the 2000s' Roc-A-Fella soul-sampling blueprint; newcomer Blunt, who produces the bulk of the tracks, and 2008 It Producer Jake One both have great emotive moments. There are even a few outside-the-box tracks for needed diversity, with assists from Erick Sermon and the Alchemist. Don Cannon takes a break from looping classic soul to drop spinning chainsaws on ""Bank Rollz"". These are welcome changes from the <em>de rigeur</em> soul sampled banger for which Freeway is known, although they're also safe variations within the same narrow template. <br/><br/>And this is how <em>Month of Madness</em> proves that ""quality"" doesn't always supersede tedium. It's as if Free has decided that he's foreman at a street rap factory, churning out endless iterations of the same basic structure. Contrary to critical consensus, one of the standout tracks on <em>Free At Last</em> was ""Take It to the Top"", where a 50 Cent hook helped Free transcend this one-note production with a little bit of pop dimension. Not topical dimension-- Freeway has always managed to spit on a variety of subjects with perspective and intelligence-- but some stylistic flexibility. As a performer, Freeway raps one way and does it very, very well. If you already love the ""typical Freeway banger,"" then you have no complaints. But it does suggest Free's not interested in expanding his audience beyond the converted, in building street buzz like Gucci Mane, or bothering Kanye on <em>Billboard</em>. <br/><br/>Freeway has never really seemed bothered by this. And to criticize him for it is typically hypocritical, since I've been a big fan of DJ Premier's ability to churn out endless variations on the same motif for the past decade. But if the best he can get is fifteen minutes of internet buzz, then maybe consistency isn't what we're really looking for after all. This revolutionary method of distribution has provided Freeway with a niche, to build the kind of fanbase he wants by saturating the same channels as inferior blog-hype rappers. He's very good at what he does, but two hours of great music still draws attention to what he doesn't.</p></div>"|12633.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12633-month-of-madness/|7.6|David Drake

We last heard from them in 2006 when the band released <em>Dins</em>, which garnered moderate praise for combining drone-y elements with loosely structured melodies. In other words, there were enough quote-unquote songs buried in the album's murk to keep folks interested. With <em>Mirror Eye</em>, though, the group has decided to fully indulge their abstract tendencies, eschewing all traditional means of songcraft for a record that is almost wholly improvised. <br/><br/>Sound like a bad idea? It is. Neither a well-thought-out conceptual piece nor an attempt at instrumental ambience, <em>Mirror Eye</em> plays like a meandering, impromptu practice session recorded just for kicks. It seems designed only to please its creators and the band wastes no time pushing listeners away: They open the record with ""Mantis"", a tedious 11-minute drone sketch built around a continuous synth loop encircling a simple hand drum. Intrepid souls who don't give up there will find ""Sub Synth"" equally off-putting: Two aggravating minutes of hearing your dad's power tools in the garage through the walls of your living room. <br/><br/>Not everything here fails in such catastrophic fashion, but because the band noodles its way through <em>Mirror Eye</em>'s druggy, sitar-laced exercises without any thought towards coherence (or completion), even its few promising tracks feel slapdash and unfinished. There's no reason that the blurry, vocal-treated ""Meta"", for instance, couldn't be fleshed out into something far more complex and hypnotic. (""Fingernail Tea"" might also be rendered halfway decent with some extra TLC.) So it's hard not to question Psychic Ills' commitment to this improvisational technique, not only because it doesn't work, but also because we're watching their peers (have you heard Animal Collective have a new album out?) succeed at this very moment by doing the exact opposite: toning down oddball inclinations in favor of pop structures and greater accessibility. <br/><br/>Perhaps most frustrating about the group's failure is that, for all of <em>Mirror Eye</em>'s drones, for all of its half-baked attempts to lull you into some psychogenic state, the record never enchants its listener and never intoxicates. (""I Take You as My Wife Again"" probably comes closest, before abruptly deteriorating into background noise halfway through.) Which is unfortunate, because when music like this is done right (see Kranky acts such as Valet and White Rainbow) it can be not only seductive but also beautiful and grand in scale. In order to achieve those qualities, though, it's necessary to approach the work with much greater care than Psychic Ills have done here. If the band wants to be known for this sort of atmospheric rock (or any other type, for that matter), they're ignoring a crucial component to success: effort.</p></div>"|12646.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12646-mirror-eye/|1.4|Joe Colly

The first time I saw Deerhoof play, at an all-ages venue in Arizona, there were less than 10 people there. Despite this, Deerhoof played as if the house was packed: drummer Greg Saunier smiled widely and singer Satomi Matsuzaki kept her gaze focused and intimidating. The interaction between the two already seemed almost psychic. I've seen them several times since; every time they've sounded like a new band, but their enthusiasm for playing in front of people was the same. You knew how good they were-- the records told you that. But you understood how fun they were by watching them play.<br/><br/>Like the iTunes My Morning Jacket EP, Deerhoof's live exclusive iTunes EP features the band recorded live, inside a studio. Without an audience to reflect back at the band (a feature you either love or hate in a live recording), there isn't much live-ness to the EP. And unless you've got the original queued up (or have the every detail committed to memory), the live arrangements here won't sound drastically different from their studio counterparts. If it were a game of EroticPhotohunt, you'd be counting nipple hairs.  <br/><br/>Part of the trouble is that Deerhoof chose three songs from their latest, and more controlled LP, <em>Offend Maggie</em>, to re-record here. It's difficult to breathe new life into songs that are this airtight. The biggest change on opener ""The Tears of Music and Love"" lies in its slightly softer finish. The EP's languorous take on ""Buck and Judy"" attenuates the album version's bass punctuations, while ""Basket Ball Get Your Groove Back"" is just as nutty, though live it shimmers and widens, but again, just slightly. <br/><br/>The two older tracks, <em>Milk Man</em>'s title track and <em>Apple O</em>'s ""Blue Cash"", undergo slight makeovers. The live version of ""Blue Cash"" reflects its namesake, countrifying the original with a slide guitar doubling the vocal and a sparse beat propelling it from behind. ""Makko Shobu"" is the EP's sole new song (though even it was released previously as the B-side to 2007's ""Matchbook Seeks Maniac"" 7""). Saunier abandons his kit for the piano while Matsuzaki sings in Japanese. These are the only two instruments on the song. As on many other Deerhoof tracks, Matsuzaki's voice follows the lead melody, while Saunier's chords unfurl in all directions. <br/><br/>Since this is an iTunes-only EP, you can buy individual tracks. ""Makko Shobu"" and ""Blue Cash"" are the surest bets. But with the glut of readily available Deerhoof live videos, with from-the-board recordings or from-the-audience crowd noise, it might make more sense to download those. Because, again, the compelling thing about live Deerhoof is, well, live Deerhoof: The way Saunier keeps his arms close to his sides, Matsuzaki's personal sign language, how John Dieterich's and Ed Rodriguez's guitars respond to each other. No record can recreate the physicality of that (or, indeed, any) live performance, but this EP is at least responsible for some decent flashbacks.</p></div>"|12645.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12645-live-session-ep/|6.3|Jessica Suarez

For less than two years during the late 1950s, he helped revolutionize rock'n'roll with his hiccupping vocal style, inventive arrangements, tenderly exuberant songwriting, and gut-wringing guitar-slinging. He has been exalted in the dead-rock-star pantheon and overly romanticized in the process, but his music still encourages starry-eyed wonder. For a catalog so deeply entrenched in the rock canon, it sounds unusual even today: stripped down but with mind-boggling range, at once sweetly romantic yet revved and horny. Recording most of his best-known songs in a small dive studio in Clovis, New Mexico, he embodies the DIY spirit. Although anyone could play these chords and follow these riffs, who else could make them sound so lively? The list of artists Holly has influenced includes-- directly and indirectly-- just about anyone who has picked up a guitar in the last half-century. He's been covered by everyone from the Rolling Stones to M. Ward; Elvis Costello wouldn't have worn those nerd-punk specs without Holly's example; and a million twee bands wouldn't exist without ""Everyday"". <br/><br/>But does the world need another Buddy Holly collection? That's a trickier question. The single-disc, 20-track <i>From the Master Tapes</i> is his most persuasive collection from start to finish, and the 2xCD, 50-track <i>Buddy Holly Collection</i> dilutes the quality only minimally. Statistically speaking, the new, 3xCD, 60-track <i>Memorial Collection</i>-- released to correspond, somewhat morbidly, with the 50th anniversary of Holly's death, or, as the boomers call it, the Day the Music Died-- must be the least of the three. It includes all the likely songs and encompasses all of <i>Master Tapes</i> and most of the <i>Buddy Holly Collection</i>: hits like ""Oh Boy!"" and ""Maybe Baby""; covers like ""Brown Eyed Handsome Man"" and ""Ready Teddy"", which is more ferocious than even Elvis' version; and ""Not Fade Away"", which provided a career roadmap for a generation of musicians. Like any Holly comp, the <i>Memorial Collection</i> showcases his talent for minimalist and intimate arrangements. Especially with the original line-up of the Crickets (bass player Joe B. Mauldin and drummer Jerry Allison), he constantly looked for new sounds, either employing new instruments-- like the celesta on ""Everyday""-- or eliciting new sounds from old instruments. Allison, one of rock's unsung drummers, is crucial: he uses mallets to soften the beat on ""Words of Love"", slaps his knees on ""Everyday"", and switches to what sounds like a boxtop on ""Not Fade Away"", forming a playful patter against Holly's jumpy guitar. <br/><br/><i>The Memorial Collection</i>, however, also culls from the margins of Holly's career, starting with his earliest recordings. In Lubbock, Texas, he joined a ""Western and bop"" band with his junior high friend Bob Montgomery, and the three tracks, all previously unreleased in the U.S., are all originals, showcasing Montgomery's songwriting and the duo's rollicking dynamic. These three tracks, especially the staticky ""Soft Place in My Heart"", bear the crackle and warp of years in storage, but the duo's energy comes through nevertheless, creating a context for the music that follows.<br/><br/>Buddy &amp; Bob formed and disbanded in 1955; two years later, Holly would start notching a few hits; two years after that, he would be dead. He left a deep vault of recordings, including alternate takes of popular hits, unfinished demos, undubbed instrumentals, and assorted potential B-sides. The Clovis label continued releasing new Holly material for the next tent years, often piecing together vocal and instrumental tracks to create ""finished"" versions of ""Peggy Sue Got Married"", ""Crying, Waiting, Hoping"", and others. <i>The Memorial Collection</i> includes several of the raw, undubbed tracks: intimate takes featuring Holly singing and playing an acoustic guitar. They're skeletons of songs he intended to flesh out, and as such, they nicely showcase his inimitable vocals, which could move effortlessly from a staccato whoop to a velvety croon. Still, it seems odd to include these rough cuts without the final releases. On one hand, it highlights the person above the legend, quarantining his output from others' influence, yet those versions are part of his biography now, as indispensible as any of his other hits. <br/><br/>Those undubbed songs might be better relegated to <i>Down the Line</i>, a 2xCD, 59-track rarities collection that gathers similarly unfinished tracks from every phase of Holly's brief career. It opens with a home recording of Hank Snow's ""My Two-Timin' Woman"" that Holly made when he was just 13 years old. It's barely intelligible, but shows his grounding in country music. You can hear the point when he saw Elvis perform in Lubbock, an event that had a profound impact on the Texas teen: I'd put it right between the loping ""You and I Are Through"" and the revved-up ""Down the Line"". His music sounds newly energized, more dependent on his harmonies with Bob Montgomery than on uncorked rock-and-roll energy.<br/><br/>That newfound bravado is on full display throughout the Garage Tapes, which Holly recorded in the family garage with drummer Jerry Allison and an unknown bass player. They're mostly covers: Holly's Bo Diddley is anemic, his Clarence ""Frogman"" Henry is hilarious, his Chuck Berry and Carl Perkins more than respectable, and his Elvis nearly out-Elvises Elvis on ""Good Rockin' Tonight"". Compare them with the mostly acoustic Apartment Tapes, which Holly recorded shortly before his death in the Manhattan apartment he shared with his new bride, Maria Elena. They're intimate settings for these casual demos. You can hear what sounds like a sink running during the opening chords of ""Love Is Strange"" and what could be a breeze through an open window on most other songs.</p>
<p>At times it's too intimate-- the three minutes of ""Buddy &amp; Elena Maria talking in apartment"" makes you an eavesdropper-- but recordings like ""Learning the Game"" and ""Crying, Waiting, Hoping"" display his light interpretive touch, and the tremolo-laden ""Untitled Instrumental"" shows an interesting direction he might have pursued. While it's important to have both the Garage and Apartment tapes in print, <i>Down the Line </i>nevertheless feels like an addendum to the <i>Memorial Collection</i> rather than a stand-alone release, a fans-only collection that will likely fatigue newcomers with its repeated songs and fluctuating sound quality. Ultimately, these two releases might have sounded better compressed into one enormous chronological tracklist, as they need each other for context and comparison. As is, neither feels especially definitive, but both are certainly welcome.</p></div>"|12642.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12642-the-memorial-collection-down-the-line-rarities/|7.7|Stephen M.

Ward; Elvis Costello wouldn't have worn those nerd-punk specs without Holly's example; and a million twee bands wouldn't exist without ""Everyday"". <br/><br/>But does the world need another Buddy Holly collection? That's a trickier question. The single-disc, 20-track <i>From the Master Tapes</i> is his most persuasive collection from start to finish, and the 2xCD, 50-track <i>Buddy Holly Collection</i> dilutes the quality only minimally. Statistically speaking, the new, 3xCD, 60-track <i>Memorial Collection</i>-- released to correspond, somewhat morbidly, with the 50th anniversary of Holly's death, or, as the boomers call it, the Day the Music Died-- must be the least of the three. It includes all the likely songs and encompasses all of <i>Master Tapes</i> and most of the <i>Buddy Holly Collection</i>: hits like ""Oh Boy!"" and ""Maybe Baby""; covers like ""Brown Eyed Handsome Man"" and ""Ready Teddy"", which is more ferocious than even Elvis' version; and ""Not Fade Away"", which provided a career roadmap for a generation of musicians. Like any Holly comp, the <i>Memorial Collection</i> showcases his talent for minimalist and intimate arrangements. Especially with the original line-up of the Crickets (bass player Joe B. Mauldin and drummer Jerry Allison), he constantly looked for new sounds, either employing new instruments-- like the celesta on ""Everyday""-- or eliciting new sounds from old instruments. Allison, one of rock's unsung drummers, is crucial: he uses mallets to soften the beat on ""Words of Love"", slaps his knees on ""Everyday"", and switches to what sounds like a boxtop on ""Not Fade Away"", forming a playful patter against Holly's jumpy guitar. <br/><br/><i>The Memorial Collection</i>, however, also culls from the margins of Holly's career, starting with his earliest recordings. In Lubbock, Texas, he joined a ""Western and bop"" band with his junior high friend Bob Montgomery, and the three tracks, all previously unreleased in the U.S., are all originals, showcasing Montgomery's songwriting and the duo's rollicking dynamic. These three tracks, especially the staticky ""Soft Place in My Heart"", bear the crackle and warp of years in storage, but the duo's energy comes through nevertheless, creating a context for the music that follows.<br/><br/>Buddy &amp; Bob formed and disbanded in 1955; two years later, Holly would start notching a few hits; two years after that, he would be dead. He left a deep vault of recordings, including alternate takes of popular hits, unfinished demos, undubbed instrumentals, and assorted potential B-sides. The Clovis label continued releasing new Holly material for the next tent years, often piecing together vocal and instrumental tracks to create ""finished"" versions of ""Peggy Sue Got Married"", ""Crying, Waiting, Hoping"", and others. <i>The Memorial Collection</i> includes several of the raw, undubbed tracks: intimate takes featuring Holly singing and playing an acoustic guitar. They're skeletons of songs he intended to flesh out, and as such, they nicely showcase his inimitable vocals, which could move effortlessly from a staccato whoop to a velvety croon. Still, it seems odd to include these rough cuts without the final releases. On one hand, it highlights the person above the legend, quarantining his output from others' influence, yet those versions are part of his biography now, as indispensible as any of his other hits. <br/><br/>Those undubbed songs might be better relegated to <i>Down the Line</i>, a 2xCD, 59-track rarities collection that gathers similarly unfinished tracks from every phase of Holly's brief career. It opens with a home recording of Hank Snow's ""My Two-Timin' Woman"" that Holly made when he was just 13 years old. It's barely intelligible, but shows his grounding in country music. You can hear the point when he saw Elvis perform in Lubbock, an event that had a profound impact on the Texas teen: I'd put it right between the loping ""You and I Are Through"" and the revved-up ""Down the Line"". His music sounds newly energized, more dependent on his harmonies with Bob Montgomery than on uncorked rock-and-roll energy.<br/><br/>That newfound bravado is on full display throughout the Garage Tapes, which Holly recorded in the family garage with drummer Jerry Allison and an unknown bass player. They're mostly covers: Holly's Bo Diddley is anemic, his Clarence ""Frogman"" Henry is hilarious, his Chuck Berry and Carl Perkins more than respectable, and his Elvis nearly out-Elvises Elvis on ""Good Rockin' Tonight"". Compare them with the mostly acoustic Apartment Tapes, which Holly recorded shortly before his death in the Manhattan apartment he shared with his new bride, Maria Elena. They're intimate settings for these casual demos. You can hear what sounds like a sink running during the opening chords of ""Love Is Strange"" and what could be a breeze through an open window on most other songs.</p>
<p>At times it's too intimate-- the three minutes of ""Buddy &amp; Elena Maria talking in apartment"" makes you an eavesdropper-- but recordings like ""Learning the Game"" and ""Crying, Waiting, Hoping"" display his light interpretive touch, and the tremolo-laden ""Untitled Instrumental"" shows an interesting direction he might have pursued. While it's important to have both the Garage and Apartment tapes in print, <i>Down the Line </i>nevertheless feels like an addendum to the <i>Memorial Collection</i> rather than a stand-alone release, a fans-only collection that will likely fatigue newcomers with its repeated songs and fluctuating sound quality. Ultimately, these two releases might have sounded better compressed into one enormous chronological tracklist, as they need each other for context and comparison. As is, neither feels especially definitive, but both are certainly welcome.</p></div>"|12642.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12642-the-memorial-collection-down-the-line-rarities/|7.0|Stephen M.

And yet, one bum line from Phonte still threatens to derail it with every listen-- ""Applied for the job of rap nigga/ But I was overqualified."" For better or (mostly) worse, this sort of mindset has boxed in just about everything he's done since with Little Brother, his project with rapper Big Pooh. Though obviously in pursuit of commercial adulation and positioning himself as a vanguard of thinking man's hip-hop, Phonte too often casts those who are more successful in simple and condescending terms while offering a one-step solution to all hip-hop's ills-- increased sales of Little Brother records. A slew of missed opportunities and disillusion with the game have resulted in a whole lot of disappointing Phonte projects. But knowing this can't prepare you for just how closely <em>Leave It All Behind </em>hews to its title, as Phonte opts out of hip-hop with a nearly full-on R&amp;B record with exactly two rapped verses. And there's really no way of preparing for how good it actually turned out.</p><p>I mean, Phonte's never shied away from doing hooks, but who knew he wanted to go all-out like this? But go straight long enough from the grid of the mainstream and you'll end up where you were-- word is that rapper-ternt-sanger is a pretty big with the kids these days. But while <em>Leave It All Behind </em>can certainly be judged in a different light post-<em>808s and Heartbreak</em>, it actually has more in common with Yo La Tengo's <em>And Then Nothing Turned Itself Inside-</em><em>Out</em>, a similarly muted, lovely, and humane take on adult relationships worth working for (which makes it the complete opposite of the often embarrassingly juvenile petulance of <em>808s</em>). Grown and maybe not-so sexy, but certainly lived-in. ""All or Nothing/Coming Home to You"" begins with the always-charming intro where its narrator arguing with a woman you can't see or hear. But when Phonte mutters, ""That's cool-- I wanted to play Xbox on the big TV anyways"" after being shuttled off to the couch, it's reminiscent of the kind of knowing detail Mike Skinner used to master in before coke and zen fucked up his brain. </p><p>Phonte's voice isn't really suited for heavy lifting, but he's hardly alone on <em>Leave It All Behind, </em>getting contributions from Nicolay's more unheralded collaborators and making it rightfully feel like a conversation. Darien Brockington's easygoing lilt raises ""Take Off Your Blues"" out of a dangerously <em>Love Below</em> sentiment, while Musinah and Yahzarah give earthy counterpoint to the siesta soundscapes of ""Daykeeper"" and ""If She Breaks Your Heart.""</p>
<p>And musically, Nicolay's in his comfort zone, making the sort of album he'd been more or less heading towards since <em>Connected</em>, an album that, while certainly rooted in hip-hop, knocked like a pillow fight. It's characteristically consistent, melodic, but rarely cloying, owing its dominant sound to ghost-white sheets of Rhodes and Stevie Wonder chord leaps that terms like ""milky"" do no justice. Opening track ""Daykeeper"" successfully applies the opaque synths of ""Kid A"" to a completely opposite exploration of bedsit contentment. Likewise, it's tempting to see the title of ""House of Cards"" as bait for curious Radiohead fans, but the liftoff it achieves during its hook is stunning on its own terms, live drums and guitar glimmers twisting in the wind.</p>
<p>Wisely, Nicolay manages to steer clear of boilerplate neo-soul, or at least the interesting parts do. <em>Leave It All Behind</em> is mostly butter, but occasionally lapses into cheese. After ""If This Is Love"" pleasingly recalls Total's ""Trippin'"" with a simple but effective late-90's electronica touch, ""Something to Behold"" is the sort of crossover loverman rap that Little Brother would probably limply parody on <em>The Minstrel Show</em>. Meanwhile, some pretty terrible lyrics are hiding in plain sight amidst borderline easy listening. The closing title track tucks the kids in to bed while hoping they ""dream of lullabies and clowns,"" and I dunno-- clowns singing lullabies tend to freak most discerning kids the fuck out.  </p>
<p>And above all, there's the possibility that it can be tagged as a great R&amp;B album that spans the late hours and early morning...<em>if you're into that sort of thing</em>. And really, as with <em>Connected</em>, it would be a shame if <em>Leave It All Behind </em>were merely lauded for how it stood in opposition to more commercially dominant hip-hop trends or derided for the same reason. It's difficult to figure how to address these qualms without the whole Foreign Exchange franchise folding altogether. For guys who haven't spent a whole lot of time together, Phonte and Nicolay get lots of mileage out of the idea of their music being handcrafted as if they were actually were hanging out in the studio. Would <em>Leave It All Behind </em>be a <em>better </em>album if Phonte didn't admittedly sound something like Maxwell with weaker lungs so often? Would it be better if Phonte rapped more? Probably not-- these sorts of projects too often inspire catcalls to keep a day job, but the Foreign Exchange may have just earned an unexpected promotion.  </p></div>"|12630.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12630-leave-it-all-behind/|7.5|Ian Cohen

And if their early, career-boosting friendship with the White Stripes had already soured (following an infamous December 2003 altercation at a Detroit nightclub between Jack White and Stollsteimer), <em>Pawn Shoppe</em>'s release was fortuitously timed to capitalize on the sensationalist attention. <br/><br/>Of course, in the five years since, the Killers would go on to sell several million albums while the Von Bondies were practically on life support, losing bassist Carrie Smith and guitarist Marcie Bolen, effecting a nasty split with Sire and surviving largely by the use of ""C'mon C'mon"" as the opening theme to F/X series ""Rescue Me"". Compared to the buzz that greeted <em>Pawn Shoppe Heart</em>, the release of the Von Bondies' new third album, <em>Love, Hate, and Then There's You</em> has been beyond low-key-- after the band first announced its release over a year ago, it arrives now on fledgling Shout Factory offshoot Majordomo Records. <br/><br/>But despite all this upheaval and tumult, <em>Love, Hate, and Then There's You</em> sounds like it could've come out five months after <em>Pawn Shoppe Heart</em>, never mind five years. On that last album, the Von Bondies were already initiating a spiritual break from the Detroit garage-rock scene that birthed them, tempering their blues-punk swing with bubblegum-sweet choruses; <em>Love, Hate</em> shifts that process into overdrive, enlisting producers Butch Walker and Rick Parker (Black Rebel Motorcycle Club) to gloss over the last vestiges of the grease. On opening track ""This Is Our Perfect Crime"", Stollsteimer welcomes his band back into indie-dom by declaring ""we are the underground,"" but the song around him has other designs: armed with a crisp, clipped riff, melodramatic mid-song breakdown/build-up, and group-chorus-as-manifesto, the new Von Bondies reemerge with all the stern-faced intent and self-belief of, well, the Killers.</p><p>For those who remember the Von Bondies as trashy maximum-R&amp;B revivalists on Sympathy for the Record Industry, it'll be hard to get back onboard-- in the absence of their fuzzbox boogie, the band's doomed-romance laments (""Only to Haunt You"", ""Pale Bride"") could be the product of any number of <em>NME</em>-mugging modern-rock acts adopting new-wave affectations. And like any rock band trying to survive in the post-Arcade Fire era, the Von Bondies succumb to the obligatory bout of U2/Springsteen stadium-baiting, building a slow-percolating synth intro into a typically blustery finale on ""Modern Saints"", which climaxes with a martyr-ready cry of ""Take my heart away/ Forevermore!"" The Von Bondies don't embarass themselves with these grandstanding gestures-- Stollsteimer's got the voice for the job-- but they don't distinguish themselves either. Where their earlier records thrived on the tension between Stollsteimer's gut-spilling confessions and the band's raucous, raw-powered attack, on <em>Love, Hate and Then There's You</em>, we get all the pleading, but without the violent, cathartic release. <br/><br/>But Stollsteimer is nothing if not self-aware of his polarizing capabilities, and he spends about half of ""Shut Your Mouth"" taunting the skeptics by repeatedly asking, ""Can you say a good word about us?"" Most certainly-- when Stollsteimer eases up on the chest-beating dramatics, the Von Bondies can be a pretty great and very fun power-pop band: The glam-slammed ""Accidents Will Happen"" is the sort of bouncing-beat rocker you wish the Strokes would get back to writing, while ""21st Birthday"" and ""Chancer"" are Cheap Trickeriffic three-minute kiss-offs, with new guitarist Christy Hunt and bassist Leann Banks ably replacing Bolen and Smith as Stollsteimer’s cool-chick vocal foils. ""You don't look so cool but you look so alive,"" Stollsteimer sings on ""Chancer"", and for the new Von Bondies, the latter point matters more than the former.</p></div>"|12643.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12643-love-hate-and-then-theres-you/|5.8|Stuart Berman

In Kweller's case the mid-stream leap is being made from polite, mannered 1960s-influenced indie-pop to polite, mannered 1970s influenced alt-country. It's a clear shift but not a terribly shocking or risky one; in fact, it's practically a rite of passage at this point for an articulate, prodigious young indie songwriter (Conor Oberst, Jenny Lewis) to eventually confuse an acceptance of artistic adulthood with a need to embrace maturity through old Hag records and lots of pedal steel guitar.</p><p>Of course, for a college radio staple like Kweller, goin' country doesn't necessarily entail digging deep into the genre's roots or taking cues from any of its more successful modern practitioners. Instead, its sources are typically secondary rather than primary, rockers who themselves leaned, dabbled, or dove headlong into country like Bob Dylan, the Band, Gram Parsons, and Tom Petty. Lazy and timorous as this kind of borrowing may seem, it's probably the best route for an artist of Kweller's genial modesty and perpetually adolescent vocal stylings to take.</p><p>When he ventures out into country's deeper waters, the results can be disastrous, as evidenced by the embarrassing ""Fight"", in which Kweller goofily rhapsodizes a long-haul trucker and exhorts ""you've got to set your sight on the Lord in your life"" with a unearned casualness that's downright insulting (the song lacks the kind of parodic conviviality that could have at least put it in the vein of the Stones' ""Far Away Eyes""). Similarly, some of Kweller's more overtly whole-hog immersions in twang end up feeling like strategies for papering over go-nowhere material, particularly on ""Wantin' Her Again"" and the poky opener ""Gypsy Rose"". The tough, Petty-ish ""On Her Own"", meanwhile, has plenty to recommend itself from a structural standpoint, yet as a performer the winsome Kweller can't come close to mustering the easy swagger necessary to pull it off.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Kweller is at his best here when churning out his patented nervously peppy indie pop and simply coloring it with something a bit down-home. The empathetic, just-plain-agreeable likes of ""Hurtin' You"", ""Ballad of Wendy Baker"", and ""Things I Like to Do"" (full of endearing asides such as ""I like talking at the diner 'stead of screaming in the noisy bar"") sit far more comfortably in Kweller's wheelhouse, and outshine any full-on retro pastiche like the late-Beatles rip ""Sawdust Man"". (Seriously, leave that stuff for Dr. Dog). Remember, even though Kweller's self-titled 2006 album was too 60s beholden, he possesses a fine, almost entirely self-sustaining album to his credit, 2004's affecting rocker <em>On My Way</em>. While I certainly can't hold it against Kweller for trying something different and playing dress-up with a Nudie suit, <em>Changing Horses </em>nonetheless finds his half-assed over-countrification and half-assed under-countrification to be equally ineffectual.</p></div>"|12647.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12647-changing-horses/|5.3|Joshua Love

Yet as the band stuck around that bond of brotherhood seemed to weaken, eventually turning into an ongoing hiatus. Inevitably, band memebers peeled off and formed side projects: First came Albert Hammond Jr.'s solo career; next came Little Joy (featuring Fabrizio Moretti); now here's Nickel Eye, led by bassist Nikolai (get it?) Fraiture. <br/><br/>Fraiture recently went on record hinting the Strokes were ready to head back into the studio, which, if you believe him, only further emphasizes Nickel Eye's side-project status, if not diminishes expectations outright for Nickel Eye's debut <em>The Time of the Assassins</em>. The disc hasn't exactly been pressing on Fraiture-- he only dove into the project when the Strokes hiatus stretched on longer than expected. Yet Fraiture has also claimed inspiration for the disc stems from a road trip he took when he was 19. Fraiture is now 30. That's one long incubation.<br/><br/>Well, maybe it was the lack of pressure and the entirely casual nature of Nickel Eye, but <em>Time of the Assassins</em> actually turned out OK. Recorded with some help called up from Fraiture's Rolodex roster, including Regina Spektor, Yeah Yeah Yeahs guitarist Nick Zinner, and members of the London outfit South, <em>Time</em> provides 35 minutes of disaffected, country-inflected post-punk, rock that comes close enough to the Strokes that people might recognize the family resemblance but not so close that anyone would confuse this for a carbon copy. <br/><br/>The most immediate difference between <em>Time of the Assassins</em> and the output of Fraiture's main gig is the generally acoustic approach of the disc, not in the coffee house sense but in its shuffling, laid-back vibe. Even when the rhythms bounce off one another in tight, tricky lockstep, songs such as ""You and Everyone Else"", ""Back From Exile"", and the ska-tinged ""Brandy of the Damned"" are in fact willfully mellow. Fraiture dampens things down even further on tracks like ""Where the Cold Wind Blows"", ""Fountain Avenue"", and the whistle-led ""This is the End""-- cowboy songs for people walking concrete streets. On ""Another Sunny Afternoon"", Fraiture even dusts off the harmonica. <br/><br/>Alas, the disc would have been better off had Fraiture stuck to the harp, since as a singer he's a heck of bassist. Each track bathes Fraiture's nasally vocals beneath a ton of echo at odds with the otherwise dry recording, but the self-conscious disguise still isn't enough to hide his modest abilities. As if to emphasize his inadequacies, the album's final track is a cover of Leonard Cohen's ""Hey, That's No Way to Say Goodbye""-- it's lovely, but in comparison even Cohen's famously limited voice makes more of an impression than Fraiture's own distracted mumble. <em>Time of the Assassins</em> could have used a few more trips to the Rolodex to bring in a ringer of a singer or two, since Fraiture doesn't seem up to the task, or necessarily even into it.</p></div>"|12639.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12639-the-time-of-the-assassins/|5.2|Joshua Klein

Hip-hop traditionally lives and dies by skills, and it widely rejects the idea that anyone can pick up a mic and rock a stage without putting in hard work and sweat and dedication to their craft. Any artist that tries to fuse those two worlds has to be more than aware of how tricky a dichotomy that has to be; Minneapolis punk-rap artist P.O.S. alludes to this by claiming that his performing name stands for both ""Promise of Skill"" and ""Piece of Shit."" If that's too confusing, ""Pissed Off Stef"" works fine; it's Stefon Alexander's biggest unifying factor.</p><p>It could also be the biggest barrier to enjoying his work, even though <em>Never Better</em>-- the third solo album from the member of the nine-person Doomtree collective-- is P.O.S.' tightest album yet. Everybody's supposed to be high on hope right now, however guarded and pragmatic a hope that it is. But with a lead-off track (""Let It Rattle"") that scoffs via repurposed Nas lyrics that ""They out for presidents to represent them/ You think a president could represent you?"", <em>Never Better</em> sets a confrontational tone that makes the album a potentially rough listen. But that bristling anger is subtly infused with a smart-assed insight and a thing for folding pop culture touchstones into unrecognizable shapes.</p><p>P.O.S.' lyrics have more in common with allusive free-spitters like Aesop Rock and Rob Sonic than, say, Gym Class Heroes-- giving you the gist of an idea while leaving you to try and calculate the deeper meaning in all the supposedly disjointed phrases ricocheting off each other. Some of the more intense lyrical moments, like ""Grave Shovel Let's Go"" (""They turning in they grave/ We dig 'em up and rearrange, aim/ Take 'em out the way they came"") and ""The Brave and the Snake"" (""Slip through the sidewalk/ Skip to the hard part/ Tip to the card shark/ Rip through the rampart""), seem to run almost entirely on the fumes of some random-thought anxiety, threatening to drown out any first-listen comprehension with a barrage of aggressive internal rhymes and his meter-defying flow.</p>
<p>But the further you sink into it, the more sense it makes, and you're able to more clearly pick out the themes-- the recession rhetoric of ""Low Light Low Life""; the post-trauma love story of ""Been Afraid""; the fuck-what-they-think defiance in ""Purexed"". Worn ground, maybe, but the language makes it spark. And all that abstraction makes the matter-of-fact details in the autobiographical ""Out of Category""-- which takes its titular hook from Lil Wayne's verse on Birdman's ""Neck of the Woods""-- stand out a lot more starkly. When P.O.S. reminisces over his coming of age as a black punk rock kid, he captures the identity crisis vividly: ""Found his kin, brothers at school think he tryin' to rewrite skin/ Others are fools, never seen some shit like him.""</p>
<p>As far as the aforementioned punk/rap contradictions, you might wind up forgetting that there are any in the first place. There's still some nods to punk rock, lyrically (a quote of Fugazi's ""Five Corporations"" in ""Savion Glover"") as well as in the guest personnel (None More Black's Jason Shevchuk shows up to yowl all over the end of ""Terrorish""). And ""Drumroll (We're All Thirsty)"", the most immediate, throat-grabbing track on the album, is some straight-up hardcore get-in-the-pit business that lives up to its percussive title. But the majority of the album fits a wider array of rockish hip-hop beats and hip-hop-influenced rock rhythms: ""Savion Glover"" rides on an uptempo combination of minimalist electronic percussion, splintered guitar chords, and rapidfire scratching, and there's a slick, borderline-pop sound to lead single ""Goodbye"" and deep cut ""Low Light Low Life""-- produced by Doomtree members Lazerbeak and Paper Tiger, respectively-- that pushes it to the level of college radio's most crowd-pleasing indie-rap offerings.</p>
<p>From front to back, the album's an acquired taste, and even if it's not the big paradox that an album mixing punk ethics with rap virtuosity might risk becoming, it doesn't have a universal appeal, especially for heads leery of anything that might approach the misnomer of ""emo rap."" But P.O.S. knows this, and he's apparently come to terms with it: ""We make our own and if they don't feel it, then we are not for them,"" he sings in ""Optimist (We Are Not For Them)"". And then, almost as an aside, he adds: ""And that's cool."" He could be all things to all people, but he succeeds when he remembers who he is to himself.</p></div>"|12636.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12636-never-better/|7.0|Nate Patrin

In nurturing the careers of Will Oldham, Jim O'Rourke, and Bill Callahan, the label helped lay the foundation in the 1990s for what has come to be known as the New Weird America, yet it has upheld an equally fervent desire-- from Royal Trux to the Fucking Champs to Monotonix-- to r-o-c-k in the U.S.A. Likewise, Chasny's three albums for Drag City since his 2005 signing have displayed a similar balance of these twin affinities, infusing his meditative acoustic excursions with a magma-thick electric guitar squall imported from his sideline gig with San Fran acid-rockers Comets on Fire.</p><p>What's more, after a steady stream of releases on various micro-indies, trading up to Drag City affords Chasny the opportunity to illuminate the more neglected corners of his dense discography. But the 2xCD/triple-vinyl set <em>RTZ</em> is no straight-forward career retrospective. Rather than present a linear overview of Chasny's pre-Drag City progression, its side-long movements are seemingly sequenced according to their degree of obscurity: four pieces (average length: 18 minutes) pulled variously from split-12"" releases, subscription-only CDs, and Chasny's personal tape stash, followed by a reissue of 1999's <em>Nightly Trembling</em> album, whose original release (as legend has it) was limited to 33 copies.</p><p><em>RTZ</em> (aka Return to Zero) is named for the reset button found on Tascam four-track recorders, the device that documented these recordings and, in light of the more singer/songwriterly nature of Chasny's recent albums, the collection is a timely, if at times exhaustive, introduction to the Six Organs origin myth. Chasny, of course, was not the only psychedelically minded artist in the late 1990s enamored with cheap home-recording technology, but where the likes of Guided by Voices and the Elephant 6 collective often used four-tracks as a means to recapture a certain AM-radio innocence, Chasny's early Six Organs recordings emphasize the medium's corrosive, claustrophobic qualities.</p>
<p>The opening five-part suite, ""Resurrection"" (taken from a 2000 split EP with Charalambides) establishes the various modes-- a perpetual drift between lunacy and ludicity-- and fascination with Eastern mysticism that play out on the rest of <em>RTZ</em> (and throughout the entire Six Organs discography, for that matter). An intense, introductory flurry of acoustic plucks-- approximating the sound of a sitar being ripped apart with a screwdriver-- yields to the melancholic folk hymnal ""Bury Dreams"", which mutates into a passage of furiously strummed repetition and ghostly drones dubbed ""Resurrection Song""; ""The Gardener (For Ryan Hildebrand)"" then reestablishes the opening theme but interlaces it with squeaky high-pitched frequencies, which dissolve into the mournful, slow-picked melody of ""Her Breath, A Prayer"". As scattershot as all that may read, the piece is unified by the tactility of Chasny's acoustic guitar tones, which never fail to remind you that you're listening to human flesh scraping across steel wires coiled to a piece of wood.</p>
<p><em>RTZ</em>'s other movements aren't quite so overwhelming and abrupt in their multi-sectional maneuvers: ""Warm Earth, Which I've Been Told"" (from a 2003 split CD with Vibracathedral Orchestra and Magic Carpithans) is an accelerated psych-rock raga that fades into a deservedly soothing church-organ hum for a good seven minutes. But the real prize here the is the 2002 Three Lobed Recordings subscription-CD track ""You Can Always See the Sun"", which forges a blessed union between Chasny's excitable acoustic finger-picking, electric-guitar feedback shards and mantric vocal harmonies, resulting in a slowly swelling set piece that eventually erupts into a surge of Boredoms-style psych-noise splendor.</p>
<p>Comparatively, <em>RTZ</em>'s lone previously unreleased work, ""Punish the Chasm With Wings""-- an alternating succession of ambient drones and guitar wig-outs-- is far less involving, and serves more as a palate-cleanser for the three-act thriller <em>Nightly Trembling</em> (which sports the prog-as-fuck subtitle of ""Redefinition of Being Featuring Creation Aspects Earth, Air, Water""). The piece's recurring, chanted melody relates closely to the one heard previously in ""Bury Dreams"" from the ""Ressurection"" suite, but here it accrues all the dread of a death-cult procession, with Chasny fashioning a guttural, almost campy, vocal rarely heard from him since. The middle section's chilling, scorched-earth desolation is answered by an equally disturbing third act where Chasny's strangulated vocals and squealing guitar make it sound like he's being burned alive. In one of <em>Nightly Trembling</em>'s few discernible lyrics, Chasny is heard to ask, ""Do you know me?"" It's a testament to <em>RTZ</em>'s enduringly enigmatic material that, over the course of two hours and six album sides, you're never really sure if you know the answer to that question.</p></div>"|12638.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12638-rtz/|7.7|Stuart Berman

They've found a home at the Fat Wreck Chords label and-- based on their newest, the oft-delayed <em>Civil War</em>, which comes six years after their last studio full-length-- they seem to have ""gone political."" Dillinger Four have been together for almost 15 years, so it makes sense that they'd start to show some signs of maturity. To that end, there's even a song here that starts slow and stays that way for almost two whole minutes. Point being, Dillinger Four are still unmistakably pop-punk, from the songs built with a few overdriven power chords to every squeaky pick scrape and ""Hey!"" or ""Whoa-oh."" And they've also managed to keep the little things that have made them distinctive over the years, from their pithy song titles and wry lyrics down to the extraneous pre-recorded intros. So if their boisterous edge has tempered somewhat, it's only a trade-off for more assured songs and lyrics about lost time that feel all the more trenchant now.</p><p>The band still banks on frequent change-ups in rhythm and melody to pull in and surprise listeners. From the very first track, ""A Jingle for the Product"", there are hooks for at least four different songs shoved into under four minutes, from galloping verses to some of those aforementioned rapid-fire ""Whoa""'s and the descending twin-guitar lines of its half-time outro. While the lyrics are more politically conscious in a vague, occasionally clumsy way, they're often overshadowed those shout-along lines the band always uses as punctuation. There are songs tailor-made for lifting a beer to (""Fruity Pebbles"") mixed in with a few potshots at the rich and famous, from the obviously titled ""Parishiltonisametaphor"" to the less-so ""The Art of Whore"". And the politics are sometimes fused with something more personal: ""Minimum Wage is Gateway Drug"" is a major-key hand-to-mouth anthem that sounds unflappable and genuinely, justifiably pissed off all at once.</p><p><em>Civil War</em> shows a band that's matured in some typical ways-- as if anyone was clamoring for ""broadened perspective"" from these guys-- and some unexpected and not unwelcome ones. Songs like ""Gainesville"" show the advantages of slowing down and letting the hooks sink for more than a fleeting moment, from its nostalgic lyrics to the call-and-response between vocals and bass on a muted, simmering rhythmic shift. There's yet to be a good answer on how irreverent punk bands are supposed to grow up. While this kind of cautious refinement may not be the most exciting or innovative approach, coming from the Dillinger Four, it does at least seem honest.</p></div>"|12632.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12632-civil-war/|6.4|Jason Crock

Hunter-- singer, songwriter and lead guitarist-- is the voice behind these shouts and promises, and as such a lighthouse for all the thematic, compositional, and tonal colors of <em>Devastator</em>, the band's second full-length. Seemingly every moment lives and dies on his voice, such as when he dashes through durable 4/4 roadhouse stomps and roars, ""I've been handed to the dogs before / Make my bed on someone else's floor"" on ""Are You Ready"". Hunter's bronzed, baritone howl is so vivid, and hearkens back to so many classic rock voices, to listen to him is to submerge yourself in nostalgia: Joe Cocker's flecked grit, Billy Gibbons' spelunking caterwaul, even John Fogerty's emotional grace through vocal tails, valleys and peaks.</p><p>Bassist Miguel Castillo and drummer Ryan Farnham aren't weak, nor unsatisfactory, just handcuffed. <em>Devastator</em> expands the band's sound beyond their previous set up, introducing saxophone, keyboards, backing vocals, harmonica and banjo, and, frankly, Castillo and Farnham have less to do. Basslines are kept simple, kicks and fills are tamped down. It's the new toys that draw attention. ""Buying My Time"" revisits a harmonica riff before each chorus as Farnham just dutifully (and monochromatically) works a snare. The title track's coda weaves in blustery saxophone whines, leaving only itself and Hunter's guitar crashes to soak up all the acoustic space. After a while, the album begins to sound more like a studio playground for Hunter and his new tools than the traditional set up it so clearly wants to ape. It is, after all, Hunter's show. He put it bluntly in a 2006 interview: ""I feel like this is my barbershop quartet. Everyone has their part. We don't have another songwriter in the band and I'll never have another songwriter in my band.""</p><p>The band's matte durability, its strong suit, loses a bit of its independence in Hunter's lyrics. He turns a sharp phrase-- ""I got my shiny coin and I'm getting to the vanishing point""-- but he gives so much of his lyrical content up to naked tips of the hat to other songwriters that his songs can veer from effective nostalgia into the plainly derivative. He waters down the Lizard King's imagism and fatal imperatives (""Don't try to run and hide/ There is no other side"") parrots Stax croons (""Baby doll, you can have it all / A diamond ring or a shiny car"") and swoons with forgettable mystic love (""Wrapped in white/ First I saw your eyes/ Then I saw your smile""). It's ironic that Hunter's voice gains so much from its ""classic"" richness, its hearkening back to rock giants of the past, while his lyrics often lose their way retracing the same history.</p>
<p>And history is what is at stake here. Catfish Haven and <em>Devastator</em> are so counter ""post-modern,"" counter ""indie,"" deliberately and confidently well-worn, that when the sketches of American rock history lose their way, the band and its songs sounds like supporting players to gorgeous voice and a shared passion for what was.</p></div>"|12631.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12631-devastator/|5.7|Evan McGarvey

Neither proposition seemed watertight: His 2000s return to action had been welcome but rarely spectacular, and the man looked set on a twilit career of gently diminishing returns. So <em>Years of Refusal</em> comes as a gratifying shock: It's his most vital, entertaining, and savage record since 1994's <em>Vauxhall and I</em>. <br/><br/>What's surprising is that so little seems different. The personnel are largely unchanged: backing band the Tormentors and co-writers including old hands Boz Boorer and Alain Whyte. The approach is unchanged: muscular rock with plenty of room for Morrissey to roam and gesture and half an ear on live performance. Even some of the songs are unchanged: the new tracks from <em>Greatest Hits s</em>how up again, though ""All You Need Is Me"" is transformed by context-- surrounded by fine new songs, you notice its snarl, flamboyance, and garage rock grind. Rather than try and reinvent himself, Morrissey has rediscovered himself, finding new potency in his familiar arsenal. <br/><br/>Morrissey's rejuvenation's most obvious in the renewed strength of his vocals. On the barnstorming opener, ""Something Is Squeezing My Skull"", he switches from fruity to fierce with impeccable timing-- the ringing leaps up the scale on ""skull,"" the matter-of-fact checklist of drugs and mental treatments, and then the break into anger and desperation: ""How long must I stay on this stuff?"" On his old album sleeves, Morrissey would sometimes capitalize stray phrases for particular emphasis-- these days, when he wants to make a point, you hear those capitals. <br/><br/>By ""Skull""'s ferocious closing he should have won stray fans back, and he keeps the energy levels high across most of the record. Much of the album was tracked live in the studio, and their leader's vigor seems to have rubbed off on the band. Not only do the songs have a snappy ferocity, they're full of unexpected touches in the arrangement-- the discordant keyboards on ""Mama Lay Softly on the Riverbed"", or the cod-mariachi flourishes on ""One Day Goodbye Will Be Farewell"". This makes <em>Years of Refusal</em> a rarity-- a Morrissey record you can dig into without caring much about the man's lyrics. <br/><br/>When you do pay attention to the words, Morrissey is on typically quotable form. He long ago got into the habit of paring his lyrics down into aphorisms-- ""You don't like me but you love me/ Either way you're wrong""-- which run the risk of sounding too pat and polished: The source of much of the ""self-parody"" flak that flies his way. There's plenty of sigfile fodder here, but it's balanced by more startling imagery: ""I've hammered a smile across this pasty face of mine""; ""I was a small fat child in a welfare house""; and perhaps his most eyebrow-raising couplet ever: ""The motion of taxis excites me when you peel it back and bite me."" <br/><br/>For much of <em>Years of Refusal</em> Morrissey is turning his fire outwards-- taking on lovers, enemies, wannabes, or some combination of all three. On ""The Last Time I Saw Carol"", his younger admirer winds up dead and Morrissey responds with detached regret. On ""You Were Good in Your Time"" he paints a mournful and wandering picture of a dwindled hero-- he knows and you know he's self-aware enough to be singing partly about himself. But only partly: This is Morrissey's most venomous, score-settling album, and in a perverse way that makes it his most engaging. <br/><br/>Fitting then that <em>Years of Refusal</em>'s peak is its angriest track: ""It's Not Your Birthday Anymore"" starts tender, but something callous is stewing beneath its padding drums and gentle croon. ""Did you really think we meant all those syrupy sentimental things that we said?"" sings Morrissey, before the song takes a still darker turn into grudgeful, violent sexuality. In its cruelty and intensity, it's a cousin to Pulp's ""This Is Hardcore"", and it's the most disturbing, gripping Morrissey track since 1994's ""Speedway"". Even though the album dies away after ""Birthday"", it and its more raucous predecessors suggest an artist as pugnacious, confident, and necessary as he's ever been.</p></div>"|12640.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12640-years-of-refusal/|8.1|Tom Ewing

Fans have no doubt snapped these tracks up via promo MP3s, mixtapes, or their parent albums. But one day even non-fans may pull out <em>Decent Work for Decent Pay</em> with bemused historical interest; it's generic enough make a handy snapshot of the ongoing, internet-fueled glut of quickie rock/rave/rap remixes.<br/><br/>Take Diplo's remix of Daft Punk's ""Harder Better Faster Stronger"". He loops and stutters a snatch of the original's robot rock, adding an off-the-rack Baltimore club beat. That's it. It's as simple, and as uninspired, as it sounds. There's no spark that suggests why it needed to be enshrined on CD rather than forgotten with last week's MP3 mixtape. Bloc Party's ""Where Is Home?"" gets fitted with the same clattering snares and acidic Ed Banger keyboards heard on dozens of similar dance rock do-overs during the past five years. If you're looking for any glimmer of surprise left in rock sonics rubbing against electronic textures at club tempos, well...sorry.<br/><br/>Now those remixes ""work."" They're well-produced, sonically. They're generic, but not awkward. But some of the other tracks on <em>Decent Work</em> are evidence of a more serious handicap. Namely that, for a guy who works with so many rappers, Diplo's got an occasionally wonky handle on how to frame the human voice. On Kano's ""Reload It"", neither Kano's sluggish flow nor D Double E's double-time rhymes ever harmonize with Diplo's house-tempo breakbeat. The friction is irritating, rather than engaging, and similar mismatches pepper the disc. For instance Lovefoxxx likewise sounds either draggy (the chorus) or rushed (the verses) to fit the moody new electro beat Diplo gives CSS' ""Let's Make Love and Listen to Death from Above"".<br/><br/>So along with a handful of cuts like (duh) M.I.A.'s ""Paper Planes"" and the bubbleheaded Brazilian bounce of Bonde Do Role's ""Solta O Frango"", the instrumentals work best. Samim's ""Heater"" and Claude VonStroke's ""The Whistlerz"" were already blessed with hooks that verged on the annoying, but at least they're not competing with out-of-place vocals. And surprisingly, at least since I haven't listened to his 2004 debut album <em>Florida</em> since its year of release, it was the instrumentals bearing only Diplo's name that I actually replayed for pleasure rather than duty.<br/><br/>""200"", a grime-esque vignette of clonking drums and sour synth flutters, is as beguiling as Gang Gang Dance's similar London-to-America experiments. And ""Way More Brazil"" weaves together multiple layers of percussion as deftly as the most ornate classic UK garage cut or turn-of-the-millennium dancehall track. (And far nimbler than any actual Baile funk I've heard.) Like most remix comps, <em>Decent Work</em> is ultimately a grab-bag. But these solo tracks suggest a return to Diplo's Ninja Tune roots might not be such a bad move between the globetrotting.</p></div>"|12634.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12634-decent-work-for-decent-pay/|5.2|Jess Harvell

They were at the height of their powers, a devastating live act with a string of hits that showed no sign of abating. They also had a star who was barely recording with them while he chased a badly misunderstood crossover ideal in an attempt to reposition himself as a Frank Sinatra type, and whose vacillations about what to release made Hamlet look like John Wayne. The sixth volume of Hip-O's mail-order-only retrospective of Brown's singles and scheduled-but-unreleased singles opens with ""You Got to Have a Mother for Me"", a surefire hit with a chattering groove that broke new ground for him; it almost got pressed before he decided to scrap it, and it stayed in the can until the late 80s.  <br/><br/>In 1969, JB covered Chuck Jackson's ""Any Day Now"" with an arrangement by his new protégé Dave Matthews (not that one), scheduled it as an A-side, changed his mind about that version, re-recorded it, scrapped it in favor of an original called ""I'm Shook"", had 35,000 copies pressed, then decided he didn't want to release it after all. ""I'm Not Demanding"" was prepared as a single twice, then canceled. ""The Brother Got to Rap"" was another funk grenade cut with the touring band, prepared for rush release, then scratched before it could be pressed. (When the band fell apart a few weeks later, Brown remixed it, faded down its on-mic references to specific musicians, and released it as ""Brother Rapp"".) ""Talkin' Loud and Saying Nothin'"", a surprisingly awesome stab at acid-rock (recorded with Matthews and a Cincinnati band that also made a dubious psychedelic album under the name the Grodeck Whipperjenny), was pressed, then yanked before it could be distributed.  <br/><br/>Meanwhile, the stuff that actually did make it into circulation often seemed like bizarre choices. The instrumental hit ""The Popcorn"" was followed by a remake of ""You Got to Have a Mother for Me"" with ""Popcorn"" shoehorned into its title, then by the instrumentals ""Lowdown Popcorn"" and ""Popcorn with a Feeling"", as well as ""Let a Man Come In and Do the Popcorn"" and its follow-up-- the second half of the same take, ""Part Two (Let a Man Come In and Do the Popcorn)"". JB put a huge promotional push behind ""World"", an overwrought, funkless ""Let the Sunshine In"" ripoff (with strings), which he thought would be his big outreach to the hippies. (They preferred to dance to his good records.) The singles he actually did release with his touring band included a pair of improvised warmup jams. <br/><br/>And damned if he didn't call it more often than not. ""Mother Popcorn"", the new version of ""You Got to Have a Mother"", was one of the hottest singles he ever made-- Clyde Stubblefield's cymbal smashes are as galvanizing as funk gets. Stubblefield's prestidigitative drum break at the end of ""Funky Drummer"", one of those wait-the-tape-was-rolling? jams, became the king of all samples. Both halves of ""Let a Man Come In"" hit the R&amp;B Top 10. Even ""Talkin' Loud"" pales next to the hard funk version he released for real a few years later.  <br/><br/>Of all the volumes in this series so far, this one's actually got the fewest clinkers-- a Christmas single whose melody Soul Brother #1 evidently didn't learn before he walked into the booth, ""World"", another top-heavy ballad called ""A Man Has to Go Back to the Crossroads"". Even the throwaways (Matthews-arranged versions of ""Georgia On My Mind"" and JB's oldie ""Bewildered"", a duet with Vicki Anderson on ""Let It Be Me"", a six-minute call-and-response from an Apollo gig) are at least worthy of the man's sandpaper-and-lava voice. And the cuts with the touring band still glisten with power like sweat on a champion heavyweight: the jawdropping paean to male dominance ""It's a New Day"", the impossibly tense percolator ""Ain't It Funky Now"", and especially the two-part throwdown that replaced ""You Got to Have a Mother"" on the schedule, ""I Don't Want Nobody to Give Me Nothing (Open Up the Door, I'll Get It Myself)"". A victory strut with a three-against-four rhythmic switchup, it was one of Brown's most bluntly political statements, but it was also a personal manifesto, and a warning for anyone who tried to get too close to him. James Brown needed other people to realize his vision, but his erratic whims were just more proof that he was running the show.</p></div>"|12629.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12629-the-singles-vol-6-1969-1970/|8.4|Douglas Wolk

For classical buffs, there's Mozart's original, a popular serenade for strings. For metal heads, there's the 1986 live album by proto-black-metal band Venom. And for fans of electronic music, there's this loving krautrock homage by producer Henry Smithson, better-known as Riton. Putting aside his usual electro-house, Smithson mans up with an analog synthesizer and a sitar to get kosmiche in this mash-note to DAF, Cluster, Kraftwerk, and Wolfgang Reichmann.</p><p>Like all modern krautrock, <em>Eine Kleine Nacht Musik </em>sounds dated in some ways and contemporary in others. Dated, because Krautrock's hallmarks-- rigid motorik beats, spacey synths, and intricate FX sweeps-- are so specific and intimately bound to their era. These weren't just aesthetic choices, they were informed by the limitations of analog gear: The originators pushed their tools to the limit, while Smithson imposes limits on himself by wishing away the expanded possibilities of the digital age. But the approach turns out to be modern, too, because the tacit assumption underlying krautrock-- better living through technology-- is still very much with us today. A belief in the mechanical utopia's continual progress (or, at least, the echo of that belief) radiates through every infinite<strong> </strong>pulse and optimistic filter tweak on <em>Eine Kleine Nacht Musik</em>.</p><p>So this is clearly a nostalgic genre exercise, and it's easy to understand the appeal of this sort of regression. Limited tools whisper of infinite potential, while our broader modern capabilities seem to mock us with our own imperfections. The album is thick with longing for an era when the recipe for transcendence was simply a stark 4/4 beat and enough tape, but Smithson's enthusiasm and skill save it from being clinical or overly arch. The krautrock formula is still potent when handled with care, and here, everything's in its right place. There's plenty of contrast between taut funk and ambient space, and the non-synthesized instrumentation (including guitar, strings, xylophone, and more) adds a songwriterly dimension: ""Gotterdemmerang"" night-cruises on a boomeranging synth pattern and clipped flute-like melody, then turns weirdly organic with meandering piano and eruptive strings. Some tracks even eschew backbeats entirely, like ""Die Fontaine"", which could be arranged for solo harpsichord without much trouble.</p>
<p>Other criteria of good krautrock are ably fulfilled: From the sizzling whistles of ""Feverprobe"" to the pitch-bent breakdowns of ""Fachgeschaft"", arresting and minute details abound. And the admirably succinct progressions (no side-long odysseys here-- the longest track is five and half minutes) pay off. Sometimes they do so in an obvious but satisfying way, as on opening track ""Ertrinken"", which moves inexorably from inert fanfare to soaring momentum; sometimes it happens more craftily, as on ""Besuchen Sie Mich Einmal"", where chaotically drifting space debris gradually arranges itself into a decisive orbit. The best thing about the album is its balance of interest and ease: Despite all of its lively variation, it seems to coast on cushion of air.

All of the band's work is dominated by free-improv squiggle and spasmodic outbursts, but the troupe has managed to carve out unique sonic spaces on their studio works: Appalachian folk on <em>Sticks and Stones</em>, needling post-rock on <em>Qvaris</em>. <em>Clomeim</em> abandons those idle fascinations as the band touch on metal's sonic heft and under-surface collision. <br/><br/>To be clear<em>, Clomeim</em> doesn't sound at all like Black Sabbath, and it's fitting that its sonic similarities to metal is found only in groups-- Om, Earth, Isis-- who stripped any blues influence from their music. No surprise, certainly, but it's still worth noting NNCK's increased use of metal signifiers: prolonged, unintelligible growls, churning bass, saturated, speaker-eating distortions. These elements are folded into NNCK's eerie cawing guitars and brittle rock rhythms. ""Ministry of Voices"" opens with a discordant, fog-horn guitar chords and free-jazz horns; five minutes in, a deep, bruised scream escapes the mix, competing to the song's end with a comparatively straight-laced guitar lead. ""Walking Wind"" is a sickly raga, its clean-channel wanderings eventually replaced by a bullying rumble. ""Salai Widnalas"" layers uncomfortably treble-heavy guitar chords over a looped, descending bass riff, both of them leaving plenty of room for caged recitations.   <br/><br/>Halfway through the album, the NNCK return to more familiar territory, trading menacing for strange: ""Make Love""'s breathy whispers act as a strange, rhythmic blanket; ""La Promesse Miruco"" bubbles and blisters, its phased guitars circling funk; ""Again"" employs a silvery guitar that continuously hints at jazz phrasings.<br/><br/>No strangers to sprawl and churn, NNCK's treasure hunts don't always fascinate, however. ""Ialas Saladiw"" finds a weird pastoral-industrial purgatory that sounds like lukewarm Nurse With Wound. ""WOAIHB"" gropes at the upper reaches of an organ and doesn't find much besides whittled, piercing high-end. ""Silurist"", pieces of which bookend the album, sounds like an orchestra pit of drone artists finding pitch. <br/><br/>NNCK rarely produce discrete pieces of good or bad music, so it's no suprise that <em>Clomeim</em>'s thorny bristle pricks in random intervals, leaving you time to admire its tangles. After close examinaton, <em>Clomeim</em> reveals itself as a burly, chatty record from an often-cloaked band; that NNCK can draw any discernible themes from its knotty bulges suggest that they're still worthy of careful admiration.</p></div>"|12641.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12641-clomeim/|6.5|Andrew Gaerig

As Fatboy Slim, he finessed the idea of dance track as pop song-cum-loop, isolating the best moments of crate-dug tracks and repeating them until he hammered them into hooks; as Beats International, he roped in a crowd of vocalists to sing their own songs and a few covers and some weird but fun throwaways; in the mid-1980s, he was the bassist in the Housemartins, who were a straight-up guitar-pop band with the occasional a cappella curveball.<br/> <br/> And now he's the central figure of the BPA, or Brighton Port Authority-- a catchall for stuff Cook does with various vocalists. They have a confusing fictional backstory involving recently rediscovered tapes from the 70s, but that doesn't even make sense: you can hear the software in every chopped-and-pasted rifflet on the record. (The count-ins at the beginning of most songs are a gag.) They're also the most referential pop act this side of Girl Talk-- although, beyond the perplexing covers that bookend their debut album, they refer to <em>modes</em> more than to particular songs. Every synth setting and drum sound and vocal technique on <em>I Think We're Gonna Need a Bigger Boat</em> is a pastiche of a sort of thing you've heard before.<br/> <br/> See, for instance, ""Should I Stay or Should I Blow"", whose guest is house producer Ashley Beedle. It isn't a variation on the Clash's ""Should I Stay or Should I Go"" (or Thee Stash's ""Should I Suck or Should I Blow""); instead, it's some kind of Frankensteined-together cybernetic rocksteady creature. Its construction couldn't be simpler: a spy-surf guitar sample (or quasi-sample) that serves as its intro and bridge, a two-bar cut-and-paste job of a riff that repeats for the entire remainder of the song (with some wobbling Jamaican organ slapped on to underscore the refrain), two verses, three choruses, and a faux shortwave-radio solo. The chorus-- ""Every day it's yeah yeah yeah/ And every night it's no no no""-- is lifted from a nonexistent Jimmy Cliff record. The whole thing sounds like a party if you hear it in the background, and crumbles into flakes the moment you start paying attention.<br/> <br/> One thing an album with a different singer on every track can do is make points about singing voices and what they can mean. (See, for instance, Stephin Merritt's 6ths' albums.) <em>Bigger Boat</em> mostly blows that opportunity-- its lesser-known singers mostly deliver by-the-numbers Britpop technique. Justin Robertson's ""Island"" sounds like the David Bowie of the 90s forgetting the words and the tune to ""'Heroes'""; Jamie T's ""Local Town"" sounds like a three-sheets-to-the-wind John Lydon forgetting the words, but not the tune, to a medley of PiL's greatest hits. Cook gets it very right a few times, though: ""Spade"", the album's other Jamaican-inspired track, presents Martha Wainwright with a phased and sparkling approximation of mid-70s lovers rock, and she responds by alternately gliding over the rhythm like a Studio One pro and clipping her phrasing to try to synch up with its twitchy reggae guitar. And ""Toe Jam"", the single from last year with the boobs 'n' black bars video and David Byrne high on life and Dizzee Rascal cramming as many syllables as he can into the middle eight, is a geeky-and-proud bonbon.<br/> <br/> Cook knows how to sequence songs to work a crowd, and <em>Bigger Boat</em> flows like a mofo all the way to its floor-clearing closer, a cover of Nick Lowe's ""So It Goes"" rendered by Olly Hite as the slinky come-on it emphatically isn't. But the other cover here-- the Monochrome Set's ""He's Frank"", intoned by Iggy Pop-- exemplifies what's frustrating about the BPA. The original version of the song is one of the greatest post-punk multi-guitar cockfights, so Cook waggishly boils its cross-talk down to a dopey riff; the Monochrome Set's Bid sang it as a dry-witted portrait of a rentboy who's a little bit past his sell-by date, and Iggy sings it as an amalgamation of odd phrases that don't mean anything in particular. (It doesn't help that he blows some of the lyrics: The first line of the song is ""he's got secular joy,"" not ""circular."") It's catchy; it's got a good little beat. But, like too much of the album, there's something not just dumb but dumbed down about it.</p></div>"|12619.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12619-i-think-were-gonna-need-a-bigger-boat/|5.7|Douglas Wolk

A robot version of herself in human form, a version of herself manufactured in the minds of robots. The buildings around her might exist only in the imagination of the robots. The sound we hear, the soundtrack to her journey, might exist only inside the imagination of the robots."" This is a vision of Kylie Minogue, spied driving in the video for ""Can't Get You Out of My Head"", as she figures throughout Paul Morley's brilliant 2003 book <em>Words and Music: A History of Pop in the Shape of a City</em>. Morley was writing in the wake of Kylie's monster hit and its attendant album <em>Fever</em>, both of which established Minogue as a mesmerizing figure fit for all manner of imaginings. She could be a minx, a glamor puss, an oblivious messenger, a wizened pop emblem. She could even be, as the storied post-punk critic Morley sketched in delirious detail, a worthy hero to measure against the most lionized icons of music as serious capital-a Art.<br/><br/>Part of Minogue's pliability owes to the way she seems to recognize and understand her many various roles, but part of it owes to her voice, which is simultaneously blank and playful-- the coy coo of a character who knows that she herself matters less than what her spirit (as Morley took pains to note) ""might"" or ""could be said to"" suggest. This is the Kylie who would figure into <em>Boombox</em>, a collection of remixes from 2000 to 2008. Or so it would seem.<br/><br/>Opener ""Can't Get Blue Monday Out of My Head"", one of the older tracks here, sets Minogue's best song against the instrumental backdrop of New Order's ""Blue Monday"". Her voice sounds a bit rootless, floundering in the best suggestive way. Listen closely and it's almost like Kylie knows she's implicitly conflicted within the rub of what plays now like a throwback to a time when mash-ups consciously toyed with the tension between source material and imaginary ideals.<br/><br/>It's a rich start, but unfortunately an anomaly in a collection that leans more often on less-interesting mixes that cast Kylie as little more than a dance siren. She's a good dance siren, to be sure. The Chemical Brothers' enticingly gaudy and patient remix of ""Slow"" gains a lot from the sly sensuality in her voice as it stretches out, and she sounds defiantly human within the constraining squeeze of Fischerspooner's lithe electro mix of ""Come Into My World"".<br/><br/>But too many tracks rate as generic ""club"" mixes that relegate Kylie to a mere bit player with little to say in the midst of overly splashy electro-house beats and trance-y longueurs. She sounds like a Gwen Stefani-aping cheerleader in Death Metal Disco Scene's mix of ""Wow"", and she's barely audible at all in Kid Crème's vocal dub of ""Love at First Sight"". It's as if the remixers, with so much at their disposal, thought less about what Kylie can signify than she herself seems to when adopting her own stock strategies.</p></div>"|12621.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12621-boombox/|4.5|Andy Battaglia

The song was a pastiche of <em>New Morning</em>-era Bob Dylan, and Nau used it to flip Dylan's own c. 1970 script, shedding himself of the Christian folkie character he'd been playing since 2004. Nau's cardigan-wearing teenage boy contingent weren't exactly the type to yell ""Judas!"" on their blogs, but that didn't stop Nau from shutting down Page France's precious passion play with <em>Telephone</em>. He'd been recording on the side as the Cotton Jones Basket Ride, and <em>Paranoid Cocoon</em> marks the emergence-- minus the ""Basket Ride""-- of Nau's latest iteration of 60s psychedelia.</p><p>Cotton Jones is Nau's vehicle, but Whitney McGraw's presence is just as strong. Together, their harmonies and trade-offs, immersed in a languid surround of smoky organs, Opry earnestness, and an abundance of steel guitar, suggest a place on the spectrum for the duo somewhere between late-60s Johnny/June and Ira/Georgia c. <em>And Then Nothing Turned Itself Inside-Out</em>. Appropriately then, McGraw is a steadying presence on Cocoon, as Nau's muse predictably wanders around the constraints he's set for himself this time. On opening track ""Up A Tree (Went This Heart I Have)"", he drops low into Jim Morrison range, and the bluesy cadence of the song follows suit. Two tracks later, though he doesn't show up until well over two minutes into the song, he morphs the pleasant shuffle established by ""Some Strange Rain"" into what feels like a minor My Morning Jacket cut.</p><p>Indeed, <em>Cocoon</em>'s pleasantness and low stakes are its most recommendable traits. You know after the first 10 seconds of the record what you're in for, and while your mind's never blown, it's also never let down. ""Gone the Bells"" is indicative of the album as a whole: a narcotic stroll through a dimly sunlit park with no particular reason for anything that happens, save the faintest hints of romance and regret. As an aesthetic, it's comparable to an out-of-focus photo in an old shoebox, or the early morning sunrise viewed through a dew-covered windshield.</p>
<p>But who knows how long it'll last? The album ends with ""I Am the Changer"", where Nau reminds us that he's ""always a stranger, and a liar."" It's an obvious statement, of course, for those who've followed Page France until now, not to mention one that's bit bold on a record that works so well at the level of suggestion. It also probably means that we'll be getting something new from Nau the next time around. Switching between musical characters is obviously Nau's default setting, and for all of its pleasantness, <em>Paranoid Cocoon,</em> in the context of his career thus far, feels like transition music over a costume change.</p></div>"|12613.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12613-paranoid-cocoon/|5.8|Eric Harvey

Our ears are hyper-attuned to nuance, whether we notice it or not, and certain sounds can telegraph an avalanche of emotion. Enlisting this shorthand sometimes encourages laziness in musicians, but nobody minds when the results work. For example, ""The Birds"", the lead track from Telefon Tel Aviv's third album <em>Immolate Yourself</em>, isn't much on paper-- some sequenced synths, an insistent snare, some ghostly, hard to make out vocals-- but its six or so minutes set the stage so nicely for greater things to come it doesn't matter that there's not much there.<br/> <br/> The fact that the rest of the disc only occasionally delivers on that promise shouldn't be held too strongly against its achievements. <em>Immolate</em> is arranged and produced with almost microscopic attention to detail by the Chicago team of Joshua Eustis and Charles Cooper, who was tragically found dead the week of this album's release, and the emotions it evokes are undeniably effective-- and musically similar to Junior Boys or M83, sentimental groups that specialize in electronic music imbued with a certain elusive pop glow. Indeed, one of the pleasures and frustrations of <em>Immolate</em> is how subtly it similarly exploits the nearly invisible barrier separating song from simple synth sketch.<br/> <br/> Yet unlike the more cohesive albums from those aforementioned acts, <em>Immolate</em> is a one-step forward, one-step back proposition, marching in place to an internal setting somewhere between chilly background mood and something more melodic and engaging. It's impeccably crafted but oddly non-committal, pulling you in and out like a dream. Part of the problem stems from the practical matter of sequencing-- not in programming terms but simply how the album progresses. Following ""The Birds"", ""Your Mouth"" pulls off nearly the same sleight-of-hand trick, implying more substance than what's actually there, priming you for something bigger to happen but ultimately leaving you hanging.<br/> <br/> The payoff arrives with the next track, ""M"", which after its slow swoosh of a start develops into an honest-to-goodness song, with vocals, a hypnotic hint of a melody, and herky-jerk drums equally informed by the clubs and contemporary top 40. It's not a Technicolor <em>Wizard of Oz</em> moment, but the effect is largely the same. Something's different, something clicks, or at least clicks and connects in a better way than what came before, even more so on ""Helen of Troy"", which sounds like a great lost Depeche Mode single-- there's even an actual chorus! With the subdued but still solid ""Mostly Translucent"", it again sounds like Telefon Tel Aviv found their inner Martin Gore, and the super ""Stay Away From Being Maybe"" finds the group heeding that advice, the listening experience shifting to a more enthusiastic ""definitely.""<br/> <br/> Then, disappointingly, Telefon Tel Aviv retreat back to mood piece on the pretty but ephemeral ""Made a Tree on the World"", which once again relies too much on a few well-placed chords and the easy sentiments they suggest. ""Your Every Idol"" doesn't justify its five minutes of echoing drums, droning synths, and disembodied voices and the record closes with the relatively perfunctory title track and like riding a Mobius strip, we feel back at the beginning again. For all the pleasant stops along the way, the album hasn't come full-circle so much as spun its wheels in place.</p></div>"|12611.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12611-immolate-yourself/|6.4|Joshua Klein

In most cases, that's an ill-fitting, derisive label for today's folk revivalists. But Grimm, who was born in a Memphis commune, looks like a Dolce &amp; Gabbana model, writes lyrics so raw they'd make Peaches blush, and cultivates a pagan earth mother/witch persona, would be unlikely to argue with it. As much as her public self and acoustic guitar-based music reveal genuine eccentricity (would Michael Gira have signed her to his Young God label otherwise?), Grimm is Yale-educated, well-traveled and no feral naïf. Indeed, her reworking of folk traditions and the roles women play in them share core concerns and strategies with early academic feminists and the deconstructive fiction of Angela Carter, who famously re-injected blood/sugar/sex/magic into the fairy tales of those other, Victorian, Grimms. As with Carter's fiction, Grimm's music, particularly in her latest, <em>Parplar</em>, can be wondrous and wildly inventive, as well as self-indulgent and, well, kinda icky.</p><p><em>Parplar</em>'s lead track, ""They Were Wrong"", is one of those thrilling numbers, a spooky portrait of loss and mental disintegration in which Grimm's voice develops a subtle shake through its stark four-minute run. ""Anger in Your Liver"", one of the short tracks clustered in the album's second half, is another simple composition with an aching vocal performance reminiscent of more mainstream Americana singers like Alison Kraus or Gillian Welch. Among the more eclectically arranged songs, the title track is a charming dish of bitterness served on a plate of whimsy-- Grimm's own tenacious ""damn the man"" lyrics serenaded by Ganges-river horns, slide whistles, and bubbly synthesizer patterns, and queasy, pitch-shifting. ""How to Catch a Lizard"" is weird (in large part due to Grimm's eerie double-tracked vocals), but effective. She can interpret folk standards just fine, too-- in the case of ""Fall on Your Knees"", as a twangy, Cajun barn dance.</p><p>But the album makes just as many awkward, even confounding, moves, and Grimm frontloads it with her creepiest cuts. ""Ride That Cyclone"", with its retro Western stylings and eye-rolling double entendres, is as catchy-- and gimmicky-- as a carnival tune. ""Blond and Golden Johns"" poses as some kind of feminist re-appropriation of the old whore archetype and is stained by bon mots like ""I've been penetrated/ So I'm welcome everywhere I go"", a line one-upped only by ""Dominican Rum""'s ""The microscopic spoiled eggs inside my uterus/ Are sparkling and bursting with the greenest yellow pus."" Elsewhere, Grimm tosses off several ""Huh?"" remarks about acid rain and bus exhaust-- proving, if nothing else, that her somewhat anachronistic rhetoric isn't limited to sexual politics. </p>
<p>Sure, there's something to be said for risk-taking. Most folkies stick with the milk-safe, hoping to get by on the sweetness of their sounds, while Grimm serves sour with courageous gusto and humor. And <em>Parplar</em> is a beautiful, exciting-sounding record (coproduced by Grimm and Gira), exploding with banjo, fiddle, trumpet, accordion, dulcimer, and glockenspiel, among a score of other instruments. In fact, considering much of its lyrical content, it would be far better as an instrumental album.</p></div>"|12580.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12580-parplar/|5.2|Amy Granzin

It is what we talk about  when we talk about Times New Viking: the bullhorn shouts, the buzzsaw  guitars, the Keith Moon-meets-caveman drums. Times New Viking write killer punk  rock with a bent towards Kiwi pop, but the thick layer of scum that envelopes Times New  Viking's otherwise taut tunage is still their signature sound. Of course, it's that very racket  that keeps a lot of folks away from Times New Viking. Their records jump out  of earbuds, all but eradicate thought in slightly bigger headphones,  and keep the cats away on the turntable. Unlike,  say, Sonic Youth, who'll kick up the scuzz when the time is right, TNV  tend to just let it ride, and once you've spent enough time with these  kids way the hell out in the red, it's a little hard to imagine their music living anywhere else.</p><p>Here we have <em>Stay Awake</em>, a five-track EP that follows, almost to the year, 2008's stellar  <em>Rip It Off</em>. The songs on <em>Rip It Off</em> were, as ever, great, but more than  the two records that preceded it, the album's dry, fat-production aesthetic  seemed even more assured, more consistent, and-- again, as much as can  be expected from a three-piece punk band with the will to sound this distorted -- more nuanced. Levels of scuzz rose  and fell with the instruments, the occasional clean-sounding element  was introduced into the mix, and for the first time, what they made  felt more like a proper front-to-back record than a bunch of ripchord  jams played inside a dishwasher. <em>Stay Awake</em> sees our Vikings moving forward on that path-- if you'd told me they were from the same  sessions, I'd have believed you.</p><p><em>Stay Awake</em>'s neither a coda nor a collection of cast-offs or curios. In just over 10 minutes, the EP not only lays out five fresh TNV cuts worthy  of any of their LPs, but throws a whole lot more of that ""nuance""  business all over the place. The dirt's still very much under this band's  fingernails, of course, but if whatever they do with production seemed  intentional-- rather than a product of necessity, which it clearly isn't  for a band on Matador-- it most certainly does now. The blanket of fuzz  is just slightly more arid than the last time out, and far less encompassing,  letting in a little room between the instruments and largely forgoing  the pastiche of previous records for more sonic dynamism within the  songs themselves. Hell, you might even pick out a lyric or two.</p>
<p>Oh, god, and the songs. If ""Faces  on Fire"" and ""(My Head)"" from <em>Rip It Off</em> didn't have  you convinced that these kids know their way around a hook, peep ""Pagan  Eyes"", a Clean-like stomper rife with organ bleats and an actual shout-along  chorus. And when some of the squall dies off  at the end of ""Pagan Eyes"" and you hear Beth Murphy singing--  even if you still can't quite make out everything she's saying-- you  quickly realize these folks know precisely what they're up  to. Opener ""Call &amp; Respond"" veers a little close to the  first couple tracks on <em>Present the Paisley Reich</em> and the terrific tumult  of ""Hate Hate Hate"" doesn't last long enough to quite get  one off, so the big prize goes to ""No Sympathy"". Opening with  a quick shot of a klezmer-y sample-- uncredited, it would seem-- the  track burns slowly, rolling on into near-epic length as Beth Murphy  gives perhaps her most affecting (yes, affecting!) vocal performance  to date. <em>Stay Awake</em> plays itself out in high style on bright young punker  ""Sick &amp; Tyred"", which finds Adam Elliott and Beth Murphy  matching shouts as Jared Phillips' guitar reaches fever pitch. And then,  when it squeals to a close, well, then you turn it over and play it  again. You've still gotta get through all that fuzz to find the songs  underneath, you know. A bit of advice? Don't fight it, feel it.</p></div>"|12608.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12608-stay-awake-ep/|7.9|Paul Thompson

Given the pedigree of the two more notable names involved-- in case you missed it, former/current Swervedriver Adam Franklin and Interpol backseat steady-at-the-wheel driver Sam Fogarino (now joined by the Album Leaf's Jimmy Lavalle, among others)-- one would hope something good would come from their Wonder Twins powers activating.  What's offered on <em>A.M.</em> (just released on CD and LP after being available digitally since last fall), however, is a more elaborate reiteration of what the group, as a duo, presented on its debut.  The extra wiggle room gives Magnetic Morning more space to state their case, but it's doubtful anyone's mind will be changed by what's available here.</p><p>For those who hoped freeing Fogarino from his day job's mid-tempo morass and hooking him up with the guitar hero of 90s Britrock (non-Shields division), will result in volatile, invigorating rock, there's slim pickings.  In that vein there's the ""Roadrunner""-checking ""Motorway"" (which features a fair amount of MBVish whammy bar abuse), and the epic fuzzy thud of ""And I Wonder"".  The rest of the album takes a more stately and baroque turn.  In case you haven't gotten the memo, Franklin uses a measured cover of the Shangri-Las' ""Out in the Streets"" to make it clear-- ""he don't do the wild things that he did before.""   At least, he doesn't when he's not out on a reunion tour.  This means, instead of more tunes like ""Motorway"", listeners get subdued tracks with extra helpings of clavinet and mellotron (like ""Indian Summer""), songs on which Franklin makes like a slowhanded shoegazer (""At a Crossroads, Passive""), or a trip-hopping track that sounds like an outtake from a second-generation shoegazing conglomerate like Doves (""Come Back"").  And it also means Franklin continues to smother his smoky charisma within the mix.  More often than fans of his voice might like, he's content to let his guitar do the talking, leaving his voice to murmur sweet nothings in the background as the music glitters and shimmers around him.</p><p>Thanfully, the album's not a completely dour and listless affair.  With Fogarino, the group has a drummer who's at once both laid-back and assertive, someone that can ground and propel these songs without overwhelming or being overwhelmed by what's happening around him.  Filling out the group with more players is a definite boon, and there are enough bells and whistles on these tunes to help them stand out from each other and give <em>A.M.</em> some distinguishing textures (something lacking from the group's initial five-song bow).  Still,  there's that unmistakable ""side project"" air surrounding this record, the sense that this is just an enjoyable way to wile away time during hiatuses in other endeavors.  It's enjoyable enough in that regard, but there's enough here (especially when they cut loose) to make me wonder what would happen if this turned from a pleasant distraction into Franklin and Fogarino's main gig.</p></div>"|12617.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12617-am/|5.7|David Raposa

There were probably 50 people in attendance. Thirty seconds  into their first song, lead singer Nick Johnston-- a pouty-handsome  blond kid with wispy bangs and the lithe, compact frame of a skater-- ran into the audience. He leapt onto the bar. He jumped back onstage  and ran through every lead singer pose in  rock history in three minutes. The energy was equal parts dumbfounding and disarming, and it sent a resounding message: Cut Off Your Hands are rock stars.<br/><br/>Or rather, they will be within the year,  if they have anything to say about it. After a brief, uneventful stint  as a Dischord-style hardcore punk band in their hometown of Auckland,  New Zealand, they  moved to London, hooked up with Libertines producer and ex-Suede guitarist  Bernard Butler, and abandoned their hardcore roots. On <em>You and  I</em>, their full-length debut, they aim for a synthesis of starry-eyed Britpop with post-punk's brittle rhythms and girl-group harmonies.  On lead track ""Happy As Can Be"" it meshes incredibly well: Over  a down-from-Valhalla drum roll straight out of ""Then He Kissed Me""  and rumbling guitars, Johnston yelps a descending melody in his baby  Robert Smith tenor that recalls ""Be My Baby"" when it doesn't echo  ""Please Please Me"" while his compatriots bellow ""whoa-oh-ohs""  into the great beyond. <br/><br/>From there, Cut Off Your  Hands get more winsome (""Oh Girl"", ""Turn Cold"", ""Still Fond""),  more wry (""It Doesn't Matter""), and more confrontational (""Expectations""), but, though the journey is boppy and ingratiating, they never re-bottle  the lightning of ""Happy As Can Be"". It's certainly not for  lack of trying: Between quoting an encyclopedia's-worth of UK guitar pop  influences (Buzzcocks! The Smiths! The Jam! Collect 'em all!)  they also somehow manage to lift the melody of Weezer's ""Holiday""  wholesale for ""Heartbreak"".</p><p>In their slightly glib mastery of pop-song forms, and their apparent belief that great pop music can be forged through sheer force of will, Cut Off Your Hands sometimes recall Bloc Party. The difference, thankfully, is that Nick Johnston seems far more appraochable and grounded.  One shudders to think what Bloc Party singer Kele Okereke might do with a song title like ""In the Name of Jesus Christ""; Johnston, in a moment of pure Ray Davies,  mostly just uses it to wryly point out that his mom's best friend's  husband, the church accountant, ""stole from everyone we knew."" He flashes a similar impishness on the self-deprecating ""It Doesn't  Matter"", a sunny ode to his afternoon hangover that boasts a chorus  nearly matching first-album Killers for swagger.  Johnston might want  to keep that shit-eating grin around for the inevitable indie stardom  that surely awaits him; it's a good look.</p></div>"|12620.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12620-you-and-i/|7.1|Jayson Greene

They aren't the most sophisticated expressions of humor: What do you call someone who hangs out with musicians? A drummer! Even kindergarteners can pick up on the subtlety of the stereotype-- drummers are stupid!-- but they are a time-honored tradition that must be at least as old as rock'n'roll itself. So with the announcement that the drummer from Aloha and White Williams is releasing his second album, it's not hard to hear a punchline. (What's the last thing the drummer said to his former band mates? ""Hey guys, let's play one of my songs!"") Especially since his solo debut, 2006's brainy, ambient collection <em>Illuminated Manuscript</em>, seemed to prove so many of those jokes right. But luckily there is something different about <em>Sparklace</em>. <br/><br/>Perhaps Cale Parks is finally letting his day-job work seep into his solo career. Aloha have moved away from their vibraphone-heavy, experimental sound into sweet indie pop territory, and, on <em>Sparklace</em>, Parks fills in his chilly, sample-heavy ambiance with charming melodies that listeners can latch on to. And White Williams is a master of the kind of glassy, glammy groove that Parks now uses as the foundation for all of his aloof compositions. So the result is an album that maintains the cerebral focus of its predecessor while giving in to the hedonistic impulses that were missing from it. ""Every Week Ends"" oozes a wistful 1980s vibe similar to M83's ""Kim and Jessie"", complete with those big, fist-in-the-air, <em>Breakfast</em>-<em>Club</em> drums. And ""Two Haunt Me"", the disc's best song, feels like the emo-techno of the Postal Service's Jimmy Tamborello thanks to a repetitive, gurgling keyboard line, the addition of some ethereal female vocals, and a heavily sedated melody that drifts languidly over a muted recording of skittering, thumping dance-punk rhythms. Other songs feature even more addictive beats. ""A Long Time in the Air"", for instance, finds a nice islands-inspired groove, and spazzy ""Some Sew, Some Find"", with its krautpunk throttle and funky disco breakdown, is proof that if Parks allows his music to reflect his rhythms instead of fight against them, he can be a success.<br/><br/>Ironically, given Parks' primary role as a percussionist, there is very little dynamic diversity throughout the album, with almost every song registering a languorous, narcoticized pulse. The tape experiments that bookend the collection are superfluous. And though the organic nature of his samples slightly warms up his frosty aesthetic-- Parks is actually playing those manipulated drumbeats and vibraphone clangs, not just spinning them out of synthesizers-- it often feels too detached to fully invest in. The songs, therefore, bleed into one another without much to distinguish one from another, and <em>Sparklace</em> feels like it's been painted in a wash of pastels without much vibrancy to jump off the page (save the practically neon-hued ""Some Sew, Some Find"").  <br/><br/>Criticisms aside, this disc still represents a huge step forward from Parks' last solo outing. There's one drummer joke that goes: What's the difference between a drummer and a savings bond? The savings bond will mature and make money (ba dum bum). And while we don't know whether <em>Sparklace</em> will rake in the dough, the album is certainly concrete proof of its creator's maturity. So although listeners will inevitably suffer some fatigue from so many similar-sounding songs, Cale Parks may get the last laugh after all.</p></div>"|12606.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12606-sparklace/|6.1|Rebecca Raber

Singer Inara George is the daughter of late Little Feat singer Lowell George, while Greg Kurstin is one of those L.A. session linchpins whose name crops up in credits all over the place. If that combined background didn't earn the duo complete carte blanche, it no doubt got the group a leg up on other virtually out-of-nowhere acts.</p><p>The thing is, the Bird and the Bee didn't exactly come out of nowhere so much as evolve organically after George and Kurstin first connected when the latter was enlisted to work on the former's solo debut. The project morphed into the Bird and the Bee's eponymous 2007 bow, a generally cool (in every sense) collaboration just subversive enough to reveal the freedoms afforded by industry cachet. The unlikely success of the pair's single ""Fucking Boyfriend""-- as a remixed dance hit, no less-- and some prominent song placement only further enhanced their theoretical independence.</p><p>So what have George and Kurstin drummed up with their newfound power, prominence, and (relative) fame? On album number two <em>Ray Guns Are Not Just the Future</em>, George's winning coo remains charmingly aloof, while Kurstin's exotic space-age jazz production has stayed decidedly eccentric. In other words, it's basically more of the same. The difference, of course, is the loss of the element of surprise. Rather than spend some of that accumulated capital and go farther afield, as with most sequels the pair has instead played it safe, if always pleasantly so.</p>
<p>Yet while the results are sonically impeccable, they're also only intermittently compelling. After a brief introductory fanfare (titled ""Fanfare"", natch), the Bird and the Bee reel us in once again with the bittersweet ""My Love"", which fuses cinematic sweep with playground jump-rope beats, sort of like a more street-wise Air. ""Diamond Dave"" immediately skirts closer to novelty, but how could any tribute to the erstwhile Van Halen singer be anything but? ""What's in the Middle"" maintains the pep level, featuring skittering percussion and hypnotic monotone vocals, with George's singing overlapping almost like a harmonious synth patch.</p>
<p>By the down-tempo sigh of a (semi-) title track ""Ray Gun""-- the mix of whimsy and innocence, delivered with distracted daydream dispassion, like someone singing while staring out the window of a rocket ship-- starts to get a little cloying. And ""Love Letter to Japan"" is much sillier than it is clever, posing as a too-cute piece of international pop piffle, with the fluff polished to a sheen even as it half-seems to be taking the piss out of itself. The gleam of ""Meteor"" is equally blinding but also shockingly banal, its ""shooting star"" metaphor so neatly on the nose you keep waiting for a punchline that never comes.</p>
<p>Considering the group's breezy Brazilian leanings, it's a pleasant surprise to find that ""Baby"" is not the umpteenth version of the Tropicalia standard but an equally winsome beauty redolent of a bygone age, back when a dramatic spoken-word turn could be taken as anything other than camp. In fact, any group that would give a drum roll its own title and track number must be full of its share of rib-nudging in-jokes, so it would have be nice had the group lowered the mask for a track or two and let the rest of us in on them. Indeed, ""Polite Dance Song"" would sink under the weight of all the disaffected irony (""Would you please clap your hands?"" George politely implores) were the song not so delightfully arranged, like a meeting between Fiona Apple and the Brazilian Girls. The same could be said of the 21st century update of Dixieland jazz ""You're a Cad"", which provides a litany of anachronistic romantic putdowns-- bounder, rogue, rascal, crook, ""but still I tug at your line, I'm a fish on your hook."" It's less sly than George and Kurstin make it sound, but it could be so much more.</p>
<p>As the disc winds down, the melodramatic ""Witch"" is no match for the smooth and sweet ""Birthday"", which percolates like the best 1970s TV theme transformed into a torch song, but the album closer ""Lifespan of a Fly"" turns out to be the perfect end to an album perhaps too self-satisfied with its own chilly whimsy. Here, both George and Kurstin finally get to tone things down, with George's voice no longer utilized as a breathy special effect and Kurstin's backing spare and cabaret singer suitable. The space and more tactile heartache in the track help distinguish it from what came before, where George and Kurstin seem so overly intent on providing ear-candy that they neglect to leave much in the way of soul. Like a Mojave Desert mirage shimmering tantalizingly before disappearing, <em>Ray Guns Are Not Just the Future</em> is ultimately left little more than a string of sweet nothings, there for your fleeting pleasure. It's a pop tease.</p></div>"|12558.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12558-ray-guns-are-not-just-the-future/|5.4|Joshua Klein

Whether newsman Walter Winchell was talking about horse racers or machine operators when he invented the phrase in 1935, it's clear that the coinage emphasized a brand new skill set, specific to a particular moment in the evolution of recorded media. Winchell's subject was Martin Block, a New York radio DJ who revolutionized the medium when he began broadcasting records during downtime in the Lindbergh kidnapping trial. To keep his listeners tuned in, Block played records between dispatches, upping the drama further by insinuating that the bands were playing live in the studio.  <br><br>Block's gift to recorded music was to create a figure that was part storyteller, part snake-oil salesman.

A talent for mystery, trickery and control has been the crux of the DJ's job ever since, both on the airwaves and in nightclubs.  But if this role has remained largely the same-- the practice of the art of catching ears and moving butts-- recent technological developments are altering the task in significant ways. The DJ's burgeoning toolbox has grown from a few basic instruments-- two turntables, a mixer and (maybe) a microphone-- to include CD players, effects rigs, and computers, tools which have led to an increasing atomization of musical raw materials.

What's most striking about these mixes is that both almost entirely forsake beatmatching and blending in favor of simple sequencing-- at times, to the point of letting a track play out in its entirety, complete with a slim cushion of silence before the next selection begins. This is even more notable given that the pair's previous mixes, like <i>How to Kill the DJ (Part Two)</i> (2004), <i>Psyche Out</i> (2005) and <i>Walkabout</i> (2007), favored lickety-split cuts and teasingly seamless blends. Both mixes are less like dance parties than late-night radio broadcasts discovered in the last quarter-hour of a long drive home-- left-of-the-dial Sirens that seduce you into an extra hour of circling the suburbs, the hidden FM messages suddenly far more important than the hour or the price of gas. <br><br><i>Mx6: Twitch's 60 Minutes of Fear</i>, published by New York's RVNG, is an unorthodox survey of American and UK punk and hardcore, mostly from the early and mid 80s. It succeeds by taking the only route it possibly could: to ignore any blinkered definitions of hardcore or punk. No single style, region, or era dominates, but the mix also doesn't pretend to be a comprehensive survey. A one-two punch from UK anarchists Zounds and Crass quickly gives way to the droning ""Viva le Rock 'n' Roll"", from L.A.'s Savage Republic, a group more often canonized as post-punk; later, Mark Stewart's dub-indebted Pop Group leave an augmented guitar chord hanging in the air as SoCal's Minutemen careen into the funk-inflected ""This Ain't No Picnic"". Like some mammoth <i>un</i>-parting of the seas, the moment is a sublime meeting of the Black Atlantic and the Black Pacific.</br></br></br></br></br></br></p>
<p>Just after that, there's a delicious moment of friction as Hüsker Dü's ""Don't Wanna Know if You Are Lonely"" leads into Big Black's ""Jordan, Minnesota"". It's a cheeky move, slotting a song from the Hüskers' major-label debut-- the record that would lead hardcore's doctrinaire die-hards to brand them sold-out pariahs-- alongside a song from punk's cantankerous kingpin of anti-corporatism. And musically, it makes perfect (if counterintuitive) sense, Hüsker Dü's slow-fast cyclone of drums and guitars touching down exactly at the point where Big Black begin clear-cutting a swath of drum machines and guitars through through ""Jordan, Minnesota"", mapping a direct line between emo and automatic rage. There's a whole thesis on America's 80s underground in that juxtaposition alone. <br><br>A goodly portion of the mix is given to what might loosely be termed post-punk, as might be expected from a DJ with a documented fondness for Throbbing Gristle and Suicide. One of my favorite chunks pairs Swans' throbbing ""A Screw (Holy Money)"" with Sonic Youth's oily, droning ""Brother James"". A few years separate the songs-- the former dates back to a 1985 session, while the latter was recorded two years prior-- but what's most surprising is how two bands with such intertwined histories could take droning, detuned guitars to such different ends. ""A Screw (Holy Money)"" is proper death disco, while ""Brother James"" is punk at its melting point, extroverted anger disassembling itself into a mercurial, interior bleed. (It's all the more striking to realize that ""Brother James"" rides a steady 4/4 thump that sounds <i>almost</i> techno, in retrospect.) <br><br>If any ideology dominates Twitch's mix, it's a fealty to punk's experimental, iconoclastic spirit. You don't often hear about the <i>sound</i> of punk-- more about its fury, its breakneck tempos and its short, sharp shocks-- but leave it to a record nerd like Twitch to lend as much attention to the mutant sonics of the recording process as he does to more traditional concerns of songwriting, arrangement and style. <i>60 Minutes of Fear</i> is a gelatinous mass of warped tape and weird, glassy high end; a sound fetishist's treasure trove of the accidental glories of no-fi technology. It's a particular, highly personal, gladly revisionist take on punk-- this is no Hardcore 101-- but it could also serve as a wonderful primer for anyone that didn't grow up listening to the stuff.  <br><br>Above all, what makes <i>60 Minutes</i> a DJ mix, rather than a particularly well curated compilation, is its flow. The experience of the thing obliterates anything you could say about it, and yet, at the same time, the stories it suggests beg to be told and re-told; it's history as a living thing that demands your participation, whether it's a trip to Wikipedia or the shelf where you keep your tattered copies of <i>Flipside</i>. Minutemen's suggestion, ""Our Band Could Be Your Life"", takes on a whole new meaning when re-interpreted by a selector like JD Twitch, the distant discographies having become the raw material for disk jockey DIY. <br><br>A companion 10-inch includes Twitch's rhythm-centric edits of songs by Zounds, Honey Bane and Flux of Pink Indians, which further blur the line between punk and ""dance music"" at its most primal. I haven't laid my hands on the actual object, but from the <b><a href=""http://www.igetrvng.com/rvngi.php?a=shop&amp;b=31"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">looks of things</a></b>, the vinyl/CD package, complete with liner notes and a fold-out poster, is a thing to behold, a reminder of what it felt like to send a slim wad of grubby dollar bills to an address found in the back of <i>Maximum Rock &amp; Roll</i>, and receive something like a revelation in return. The wait was always the worst of it, in those snail-trailed, pre-Internet days; you may be shocked to realize, when you finally hear this, that <i>this</i> is exactly what you've been waiting for, all these years. Its arrival is right on time. <br><br>Optimo's <i>Sleepwalk</i> is different altogether. Where, until now, Optimo's mixes have retained at least tenuous footing on the dance floor over which the two DJs have presided, every Sunday night, since 1997, <i>Sleepwalk</i>-- the followup to 2007's <i>Walkabout</i>-- is a fever dream of ambient muckracking and fucked-up balladeering. <br><br>""Beats,"" in the debased vernacular of dance music, are few and far between; that the most uptempo cut here comes courtesy Mulatu Astatke, best known from the <i>Ethiopiques</i> series (and prime placement in Jim Jarmusch's <i>Broken Flowers</i>) should say something about the mix's profoundly narcotic vibe. This is head music, ""listening"" music, something like an alternate history of easy listening played out in uneasy selections from the likes of Nurse With Wound, Cluster, Coil, and, of course, those avant-garde stalwarts, the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. There are moments that sound like background oceanscapes for run-down spas (SPOILER ALERT: they're Chris Watson, the Touch/BBC field recording artist, and former member of Cabaret Voltaire) and there are moments that sound like Rod McKuen over Wendy Carlos. Throughout, across tempos that range from the soporific to an easygoing Codeine andante, the melodic line sticks to a wormy sort of furrow, with dated synthesizers morphing into flutes, into voice, into trombones, into guitars flying 80s telltale delay, into fiddle, into still more dated synthesizers. In love with the midrange, the mix follows a line as unstably sure as the median strip on a particularly lysergic midnight drive. <br><br>And having said all this, I'm actually loathe to explain any more about <i>Sleepwalk</i>. In fact, I'd like to propose an experiment. Buy the CD, if possible, and do what you can to avert your gaze from the tracklisting. If your habit is to immediately rip CDs into your computer, don't copy the artists or track titles. And then just live with the thing for a while. I had the good fortune to receive my review copy as a single, 73-minute MP3 with no identifying information attached, and the sheer experience of the thing, as hypnagogic as its title promised, was visceral and overwhelming, even in partial doses. Later come the reflective, intellectual surprises: this 80s throwback revealing themselves as secretive experimentalists, that Krautrock staple surely referencing magic mushrooms in their track title, and a particular (there could only be one) avant-disco figurehead dropping down in a shining beam of cello and trombone (ok, so I've given that one away-- it's Arthur Russell) at his most otherworldly and eternal and perfect. <br><br>There will be plenty of time to go back and pore over the tracklisting, Google the things you don't know, find connections cleverer than any I've made here. But all of that pales in comparison with listening to the thing and losing yourself in its invented universe. This is the Make Believe Ballroom at its most credible and all-encompassing. It's an illusion you don't ever want to end.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p></div>"|12567.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12567-mx6-twitchs-60-minutes-of-fear-sleepwalk/|8.4|Philip Sherburne

It's a cheeky move, slotting a song from the Hüskers' major-label debut-- the record that would lead hardcore's doctrinaire die-hards to brand them sold-out pariahs-- alongside a song from punk's cantankerous kingpin of anti-corporatism. And musically, it makes perfect (if counterintuitive) sense, Hüsker Dü's slow-fast cyclone of drums and guitars touching down exactly at the point where Big Black begin clear-cutting a swath of drum machines and guitars through through ""Jordan, Minnesota"", mapping a direct line between emo and automatic rage. There's a whole thesis on America's 80s underground in that juxtaposition alone. <br><br>A goodly portion of the mix is given to what might loosely be termed post-punk, as might be expected from a DJ with a documented fondness for Throbbing Gristle and Suicide. One of my favorite chunks pairs Swans' throbbing ""A Screw (Holy Money)"" with Sonic Youth's oily, droning ""Brother James"". A few years separate the songs-- the former dates back to a 1985 session, while the latter was recorded two years prior-- but what's most surprising is how two bands with such intertwined histories could take droning, detuned guitars to such different ends. ""A Screw (Holy Money)"" is proper death disco, while ""Brother James"" is punk at its melting point, extroverted anger disassembling itself into a mercurial, interior bleed. (It's all the more striking to realize that ""Brother James"" rides a steady 4/4 thump that sounds <i>almost</i> techno, in retrospect.) <br><br>If any ideology dominates Twitch's mix, it's a fealty to punk's experimental, iconoclastic spirit. You don't often hear about the <i>sound</i> of punk-- more about its fury, its breakneck tempos and its short, sharp shocks-- but leave it to a record nerd like Twitch to lend as much attention to the mutant sonics of the recording process as he does to more traditional concerns of songwriting, arrangement and style. <i>60 Minutes of Fear</i> is a gelatinous mass of warped tape and weird, glassy high end; a sound fetishist's treasure trove of the accidental glories of no-fi technology. It's a particular, highly personal, gladly revisionist take on punk-- this is no Hardcore 101-- but it could also serve as a wonderful primer for anyone that didn't grow up listening to the stuff.  <br><br>Above all, what makes <i>60 Minutes</i> a DJ mix, rather than a particularly well curated compilation, is its flow. The experience of the thing obliterates anything you could say about it, and yet, at the same time, the stories it suggests beg to be told and re-told; it's history as a living thing that demands your participation, whether it's a trip to Wikipedia or the shelf where you keep your tattered copies of <i>Flipside</i>. Minutemen's suggestion, ""Our Band Could Be Your Life"", takes on a whole new meaning when re-interpreted by a selector like JD Twitch, the distant discographies having become the raw material for disk jockey DIY. <br><br>A companion 10-inch includes Twitch's rhythm-centric edits of songs by Zounds, Honey Bane and Flux of Pink Indians, which further blur the line between punk and ""dance music"" at its most primal. I haven't laid my hands on the actual object, but from the <b><a href=""http://www.igetrvng.com/rvngi.php?a=shop&amp;b=31"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">looks of things</a></b>, the vinyl/CD package, complete with liner notes and a fold-out poster, is a thing to behold, a reminder of what it felt like to send a slim wad of grubby dollar bills to an address found in the back of <i>Maximum Rock &amp; Roll</i>, and receive something like a revelation in return. The wait was always the worst of it, in those snail-trailed, pre-Internet days; you may be shocked to realize, when you finally hear this, that <i>this</i> is exactly what you've been waiting for, all these years. Its arrival is right on time. <br><br>Optimo's <i>Sleepwalk</i> is different altogether. Where, until now, Optimo's mixes have retained at least tenuous footing on the dance floor over which the two DJs have presided, every Sunday night, since 1997, <i>Sleepwalk</i>-- the followup to 2007's <i>Walkabout</i>-- is a fever dream of ambient muckracking and fucked-up balladeering. <br><br>""Beats,"" in the debased vernacular of dance music, are few and far between; that the most uptempo cut here comes courtesy Mulatu Astatke, best known from the <i>Ethiopiques</i> series (and prime placement in Jim Jarmusch's <i>Broken Flowers</i>) should say something about the mix's profoundly narcotic vibe. This is head music, ""listening"" music, something like an alternate history of easy listening played out in uneasy selections from the likes of Nurse With Wound, Cluster, Coil, and, of course, those avant-garde stalwarts, the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. There are moments that sound like background oceanscapes for run-down spas (SPOILER ALERT: they're Chris Watson, the Touch/BBC field recording artist, and former member of Cabaret Voltaire) and there are moments that sound like Rod McKuen over Wendy Carlos. Throughout, across tempos that range from the soporific to an easygoing Codeine andante, the melodic line sticks to a wormy sort of furrow, with dated synthesizers morphing into flutes, into voice, into trombones, into guitars flying 80s telltale delay, into fiddle, into still more dated synthesizers. In love with the midrange, the mix follows a line as unstably sure as the median strip on a particularly lysergic midnight drive. <br><br>And having said all this, I'm actually loathe to explain any more about <i>Sleepwalk</i>. In fact, I'd like to propose an experiment. Buy the CD, if possible, and do what you can to avert your gaze from the tracklisting. If your habit is to immediately rip CDs into your computer, don't copy the artists or track titles. And then just live with the thing for a while. I had the good fortune to receive my review copy as a single, 73-minute MP3 with no identifying information attached, and the sheer experience of the thing, as hypnagogic as its title promised, was visceral and overwhelming, even in partial doses. Later come the reflective, intellectual surprises: this 80s throwback revealing themselves as secretive experimentalists, that Krautrock staple surely referencing magic mushrooms in their track title, and a particular (there could only be one) avant-disco figurehead dropping down in a shining beam of cello and trombone (ok, so I've given that one away-- it's Arthur Russell) at his most otherworldly and eternal and perfect. <br><br>There will be plenty of time to go back and pore over the tracklisting, Google the things you don't know, find connections cleverer than any I've made here. But all of that pales in comparison with listening to the thing and losing yourself in its invented universe. This is the Make Believe Ballroom at its most credible and all-encompassing. It's an illusion you don't ever want to end.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p></div>"|12567.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12567-mx6-twitchs-60-minutes-of-fear-sleepwalk/|8.8|Philip Sherburne

State University in Raleigh. The students were gone, and the request lines were silent. We plundered the school's music library, stacking gems in a to-play pile that grew quickly. When I found a copy of <em>Foolish</em>, the fourth LP from Superchunk, I demanded we hear ""Driveway to Driveway"", a strident march of double guitars, heavy rhythms, and Raleigh native Mac McCaughan's thin sneer. Halfway through, my friend grimaced: ""I just don't get it,"" she said, standing in a studio that's about 500 yards from a smal club where Superchunk played one of its first shows in 1989. ""I don't understand why people around here are so crazy about Superchunk still.""</p><p>I stumbled through an answer, depending more on context than an actual defense of, like, the music: Superchunk had been crucial in an indie rock uprising that took root not long after she was born. Their success and North Carolina roots served as a crucial foundation-- or, at least, a seemingly irreplaceable building block-- for the local music scene in which we both worked. After all, Superchunk bassist Laura Ballance and guitarist McCaughan co-founded Merge Records before releasing their first three LPs on Matador. Those records found them an audience, landing the band on the cover of <em>NME </em>and <em>Melody Maker</em>. They brought that success home, releasing their later records on Merge alongside Polvo, the Magnetic Fields, Arcade Fire, Destroyer, and Spoon, among others. ""Without Superchunk, where would music here be?"" I wondered, hiding behind the easy veil of revisionist history.</p><p>But hearing <em>Sur La Bouche: Live in Montreal 1993</em>-- the fourth release in Superchunk's live, limited-edition Clambake series-- hit me with the best defense for the question of Superchunk's staying power and relevance, just as the tape of any loud, 80-minute, two-encore set should: It's the songs, silly. Then as now, Superchunk remains endearingly devoid of bullshit, devoted to writing songs that barrel straight ahead, powering them with energy and volume. On record, Superchunk didn't divert to quirk or gimmick (see Pavement, Dinosaur, Sebadoh, bless 'em all). Instead, they played the songs, presenting them as best they could with a dose of treble on top. On stage, they did the same: At the start of <em>Sur La Bouche</em>, McCaughan asks a technician to kill the spotlights and dry ice. They plow through 18 tunes without much banter, delay, or artifice. They say goodnight, and they're gone.</p>
<p>The riffs and counters of McCaughan and Jim Wilbur slice through the club: ""Cast Iron"" is a staggered, snarling beast with distorted, whining electric leads as teeth. ""Untied"" finds the right note and lets its feedback wrap around the head of the melody. The march of Ballance and Wurster inspires a dance party down in front: ""Skip Steps 1 &amp; 3"" lunges forward only to pull back only to lunge forward, its rhythm both maddening and intoxicating. It's a wonder the pounding ""Punch Me Harder"" never inspired a riot.</p>
<p>Superchunk's directness is revealing, since the record captures the band at a pivotal point: They were positioned to reach non-indie rock fans. Drummer Jon Wurster had been playing with Superchunk for two years, but the tunes from <em>On the Mouth</em>-- the band's third and final record for Matador, released just a month before this show-- marked his writing and recording debut. <em>On the Mouth</em> augmented that straight-charging Superchunk sound with acoustic guitars for texture and two slow jams for dynamics. Album closer ""The Only Piece That You Get"", Superchunk's catalog equivelant to Pavement's ""Here"", did both. But live, it's aching and mean, its electric guitars creeping through Wurster's cymbal destruction.</p>
<p>Similarly, on record, ""I Guess I Remember It Wrong"" eases open with an acoustic guitar that pops into a spry jangle, somewhere between R.E.M. and Teenage Fanclub. On stage, you hear McCaughan quip ""Hit it, Laura"" just before Ballance drops a distorted bassline. The band tears through a scrim of feedback, picking up the tempo and dropping the studio's easygoing esprit. Despite making a landmark record with bigger production and more finesse, Superchunk hit the stage with the grit and grind that made their most immediate work their best. In the end, that singularity and focus-- the band's chief strengths-- will win fewer converts than, say, ""Chelsea's Little Wrists"" or ""Don't"". But there's nothing about this band to get: Just good songs about grand defiance, coupled with a spirited presentation that still surprises 15 years after one cold night in a hot Montreal club.</p></div>"|12616.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12616-sur-la-bouche-live-in-montreal-1993/|7.5|Grayson Currin

His songs are tentative, sweet, and irrepressible all at once, and they tend to gather energy as they go, bubbling over like an endearing record nerd's barely suppressed enthusiasm for his pet band. Then, at the end, they shoot skyward, spilling trumpets, oboes, flutes, and ""na-na-nas"" all over the place-- it can sometimes seem like Svanangen was engineered in a lab by movie execs to soundtrack indie films about quirky young love. His 2007 Sub Pop debut, <em>Loney, Noir, </em>was charming, slight, and egregiously misnamed: Loney Dear is about as ""noir"" as a squirming puppy.</p><p>On his new one, <em>Dear John</em>, however, he has tapped a surprising a vein of melancholy, and it suits him. The beaming, California-sunset optimism of his previous record, <em>Loney, Noir,</em> grew wearying, even over a short 10 songs: You can only hear someone skip through a field of gillyflowers so many times before you start groping for your hip flask. Here Svanangen struggles poignantly with alien emotions like ambivalence and disappointment. ""I used to make you songs so easily/ But things have turned so different from now,"" he laments on ""I Was Only Going Out"". It seems he went and got himself tangled up with an actual, flesh-and-blood woman, as opposed to an ideal sung to in a pop song. ""I bought a ticket to Hell when I met up with you,"" he sings on ""Airport Surroundings"", and his vindictiveness is jarring.</p><p>The music, too, has become considerably darker. Svanangen still layers obsessively (he can't seem to go eight bars without cueing up another synthesizer preset), but on <em>Dear John</em> he avoids stacking all these sounds into unwieldy piles. On ""Airport Surroundings"" and ""Under a Silent Sea"", two of his most sophisticated productions to date, sounds pop up briefly and then disappear into the fabric, creating a subtle, shifting environment. ""Under a Silent Sea"" begins with simple acoustic finger-picking and a mournful haze of strings before a glittering trance synth hits and the track mutates into a majestically sad piece of Euro-house. If you walked into the room in between verses, you might think you had stumbled upon some brilliant outtake from <em>808s and Heartbreaks</em>. Instead, it's Svanangen's record in miniature: It preserves what was fleetingly great about <em>Loney, Noir</em> while proving that Svanangen has more tricks in his bag than most people thought possible.</p></div>"|12618.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12618-dear-john/|6.8|Jayson Greene

There are some connections: Both groups are fond of looped hand percussion, day-glo melodies, and spirited improvisation. And recently, both camps released albums that hung on techno-conceptual conceits-- in 2007, Animal Collective's Avey Tare issued backwards-running <em>Pullhair Rubeye</em>, which magically turned into folk music when reversed. Lucky Dragons had <em>Widows</em> in 2006, an album of speedy glitch tracks that transformed into something very much like Animal Collective songs when slowed and pitched down about 50% (download Audacity and see for yourself). <em>Widows</em> was great; <em>Rubeye</em> was not, and this gets at why comparing the two groups is off-target.<br/><br/>In short, Animal Collective's project is fundamentally musical. Lucky Dragons' project is fundamentally conceptual, rooted in the broader context of the art world. Their work is better suited to galleries than nightclubs and was, in fact, included in the 2008 Whitney Biennial exhibition. To Lucky Dragons, process seems at least as important as results, and their process is heavily indebted to Pauline Oliveros' methods of turning spectators into actors. Lucky Dragons' music is inextricably bound to their other pursuits, so the album format presents obvious challenges and even seems to contradict the essentially participatory nature of their projects. Segregated from their interdisciplinary practice and audience interactions, on record their music inevitably sounds dislocated; only a fraction of the music's contextual scope is perceptible.<br/><br/><em>Dream Island Laughing Language </em>therefore sounds more like a sketchbook than an album, but it's quite rewarding if you meet it on its own terms. Lucky Dragons throw a lot of stuff at the wall here; it's remarkable how much of it sticks. The short interludes are clever and seductive-- the 36 seconds of numinous peals on ""Clipped Gongs"", the mini-madrigal ""Oh I Understand"", the minute or so of whiplash interference on ""Where's Adam"". A whole album of this might have been frustrating, although there's more than initially meets the ear-- there are secret melodies stashed in precise tangles of pitched percussion on tracks like ""Morning Ritual"", ""Typical Hippies"", and ""Desert Rose"".<br/><br/>Mysterious as they are, the set pieces work great as mortar between more realized, intelligible bricks. There are sleek beats folded in, like the vigorous <em>ostinato</em> on the Crystal Castles-esque ""I Keep Waiting for Earthquakes"". ""Free Guys by the Sea"", with its clattery percussion and sprightly flutes, is just a few vocal affectations away from bhangra. Electro-acoustic spasms full of cut-up singing, such as ""Wooden Cave Loop"" and ""Givers"", evoke the cartoon glitch-world of Dan Deacon. The overall impression is that, almost 10 years into their career, Lucky Dragons still haven't chosen a certain kind of cultural product to be. That redounds to their credit on <em>Dream Island Laughing Language</em>, where each track seems to document the group's rebirth as (to borrow from their manifesto) ""new and temporary creatures.""</p></div>"|12573.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12573-dream-island-laughing-language/|7.4|Brian Howe

First single ""Highways of Gold""-- one of the best pure punk tracks of 2008-- feels like the product of Portland-based osmosis, triggering fond memories of <i>Dig Me Out</i> via ex-Brother Johnny Whitney's shape-shifting voice, which crosses over into Corin Tucker territory at several points during the song. From there, the band-- which includes Jay Clark from PGMG and Blood Brother Cody Votolato-- pastes all-ages club punk, pop metal, prog, and classic rock into an incandescent collage spiked with furious lyrical streams-of-consciousness. Like the Blood Brothers, <i>Take Me to the Sea</i> is united by Whitney's voice, impossible to ignore as it slides between seemingly any style that could be described using the verb ""wail.""</p>
<p>Whitney's words perfectly mirror his timbre, evoking a world of post-apocalyptic post-consumer waste from which-- evidenced by the album's title-- he desperately wants to escape. ""Jaguar Pirates"" is the best example of the album's prevailing themes; it's more or less a recruitment poster for the disaffected. Consider this call-to-arms dialogue: ""Are you broke? 'Yes I'm broke!' Are you hungry? 'Yes I'm hungry!' Are you sleeping in a ditch filled with cellulite and concrete?"" You get the point, but it's nonetheless hammered home: ""Everyone take back the rad world. Join the jaguar pirates!"" Sweet, where do I sign? On ""Georgia"", the thick organ lines and slower tempo is redolent of the blown-up R&amp;B of the 1970s as much as At the Drive-In, with even a slight whiff of nostalgia threading through semi-clunker but still evocative lines like ""We'll swim so far in that ocean crammed with shopping carts."" A band like Chairlift sunk itself last year with a po-faced/nü age approach to this same sort of far-lefty anti-consumerism, but Jaguar's balls-out sensationalism makes it go down much easier.</p>
<p><i>Sea</i> is histrionic, that can't be argued, but it's also sentimental in parts: both for an age without rampant consumption as the prevailing mode of existence, and, somewhat surprisingly, for family. The hard-charging acoustic anthem ""Bats Over the Pacific Ocean"" opens with Whitney bemoaning being evicted, and having all his shit strewn across his front lawn. As he picks through his stuff, finding old family pictures sends him on a hallucinatory trip through the past, reconnecting with his mother at age 17 and brother (stationed in Afghanistan) in some alternate-universe backyard barbeque. From this angle, though, nothing beats ""The Man with the Plastic Suns"": it's the moodiest song on the record, essentially a fable told by a son about his hard-luck gambler of a father. The title refers to a casino owner, and Whitney paints him as a nefarious overlord, ""inventing diseases just for fun.""</p>
<p>Getting to these themes, rewarding as they are, requires peeling back several layers of high-octane flash and overbearing pushes toward ""revolution"" (their official website is called takebacktheradworld.com, after all). It's understandable for some to stop at the positively Judas Priest overtones of ""Vagabond Ballroom"" and ""Humans Evolve Into Skyscrapers"", or even to kvetch at another record fed up enough with late capitalism to devote several songs to its impact on society. I can't say I'm immune from either of these reactions to <i>Take Me to the Sea</i>, but at the same time, I found myself more often than not getting swept up in the sheer intensity of Jaguar Love's approach.</p></div>"|12599.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12599-take-me-to-the-sea/|6.8|Eric Harvey

The mystery isn't why Hot Chip would jump at the chance to work with Wyatt, an avant-music elder statesman since founding the seminal prog-rock band Soft Machine 40-odd years ago, but why Wyatt, who's collaborated with established titans like Brian Eno and David Gilmour, would be interested in a young and (relatively) untested electro-soul band. They even <em>look </em>odd together-- Wyatt with his wild white mane and beard, Hot Chip with their cable-knit sweaters and chunky glasses. It's as if mighty Zeus split open Cronus' stomach and released a gaggle of nerdy-chic reference librarians.</p><p>But it makes perfect sense once you hear the music. On a pragmatic note, this EP came about simply: Hot Chip remixed Wyatt's patricianly funky song ""This Summer Night"" (a collaboration with Bertrand Burgalat) as a minimal electro seether. They contacted Wyatt, who liked the remix, and asked him if he'd like to cover any of their songs. Wyatt chose four, and entered the studio with Hot Chip to record new versions of three. The fourth, ""One Pure Thought"", was remixed by Geese, which comprises two members of Elysian Quartet, who also lend imperious strings to the ""We're Looking for a Lot of Love"" cover. On the aesthetic end, Wyatt's voice (he duets with Alexis Taylor on ""Whistle for Will"" and ""We're Looking for a Lot of Love"", and provides off-kilter vocal architecture elsewhere) has a soft-bellied vulnerability to rival Taylor's, and his accessible out-music touches breathe new life into Hot Chip's arrangements.</p><p>Take ""Made in the Dark"", the first song to be released from the collaboration. It was already one of the latest Hot Chip LP's strongest tracks, and Wyatt improves it by retaining Taylor's indelible vocal melody while jettisoning the soft-rock arrangement in favor of something much livelier, something that feels organic without resorting to folksiness. It's spacious and strange, its aching chord progression dressed in melancholic horns and toothsome harmonies by Wyatt. A mouth harp responds to the lead vocals' calls, achieving the tricky feat of being amusing and sonically compelling at once. It also seems to somewhat cheekily allude to the current craze for digitally mediated vocals, positing the mouth harp as a proto-vocoder. Quirky yet approachable touches like this define the EP.</p>
<p>Wyatt is just as good at revivifying <em>Made in the Dark</em>'s slighter songs, like the sultry ""Whistle for Will"". The original had the barest intimation of a beat and an unclear melodic progression, like rain disturbing a puddle. Wyatt draws its form into sharp relief, piling on honeyed strings and rooting them to a cavernous backbeat. ""We're Looking for a Lot of Love"" recapitulates the formal inventiveness of ""Made in the Dark"", opening with a flurry of reversed sounds and clipped breaths, then resolving into a harmonious braid of independent parts-- strings bowed and pizzicato, genial whistles, cut-up vocal palimpsests. Its cacophonous conclusion is the only instance of Wyatt sacrificing clarity for obscurity on the EP, and it works well as such an isolated counterpoint. And Geese do a ground-up overhaul on ""One Pure Thought"", dropping a part of its vocal line into what sounds like a tangle of layered kalimba and halting strings. At a time when many albums contain an EP's worth of ideas, an EP containing an album's worth is a nice change of pace.</p>
<p>Collaborations between obviously comparable artists tend to be somewhat handcuffed: Listeners understandably expect a certain kind of result. The unlikelihood of the Hot Chip/Robert Wyatt connection gives this EP a sense of unfettered freedom, and of generosity-- it's a fan service for adherents of each contributor, and best of all, you can download a couple of the tracks for free from Hot Chip's website. Hot Chip gains cultural capital by working with a legend, Robert Wyatt gets a dose of youthful energy, and we're left with the feeling that popular music could be more exciting all around if more artists were willing to collaborate outside of their commercial niche, producing wonderfully inessential labors of love. Suddenly, a ""Music in 12 Parts"" mixtape (with cameos by Lil Wayne, Ludacris, and Michael Nyman) sounds almost plausible.</p></div>"|12615.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12615-hot-chip-with-robert-wyatt-and-geese/|7.7|Brian Howe

Classical phraseologies are bleated over serpentine arrangements; the results are often as confounding as they are strangely appealing. You could liken it to a very abrasive book on tape.</p><p>As Blackout Beach, Mercer retains that same attention to scope and language. That project's 2004 debut, <em>Light Brings the Putrid Dawn,</em> was an admirable albeit disorienting trip, with song contours often aimless or difficult to follow. As Mercer wrote in a note to Pitchfork a few months back, <em>Skin of Evil</em> is his attempt to stay on task. Here he's succeeded: Using minimal instrumentation-- itchy drum machine, ripples of guitar-- and sounding like Nick Cave or Scott Walker, Mercer's crafted a loose concept album about a siren named Donna and the many men left wrecked in her wake. It sounds like another academic exercise, but it's at once gloriously claustrophobic and engaging from start to finish.</p><p>Mercer introduces his subject on first single and opener ""Cloud of Evil"": ""I think there was men before me, who were too scrambled by Donna's awesome, awesome power. But did any of them ever fly?"" Moving forward, there's mention of blood-filled goblets and castration, though neither Mercer's trademark delivery nor his grand poetics ever threaten to upset the sonic universes into which he catapults them. <em>Skin of Evil</em>'s textures and rhythmic bend exist in eerie harmony with his cries, barks, and stutters, with each chapter swimming seamlessly into the next.</p>
<p>All in all, this is a remarkable feat in atmospherics. From the storms of standout ""Three Men Drown in the River"" to the crescendo of ""Nineteen, One God, One Dull Star"", Mercer's able to fill cavern-like spaces with the might of his many soliloquies. Easy listening or not at all, it's why <em>Skin of Evil</em>-- here and gone in just 30 minutes-- remains so gripping: Some turns are capable of provoking a physical reaction. Some aren't. But no matter how off-kilter the sense of theater or disturbing the image, he and his listeners remain in constant, enveloping conversation.</p></div>"|12607.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12607-skin-of-evil/|7.7|David Bevan

On 2003 debut album <em>Love, Love, Love</em>, the Portland, Ore. duo of Ida No and Johnny Jewel caught the no-wave wave; back then, they had a drummer named Ginger Peach. Since moving to Italians Do It Better and focusing on dark-alley Italo disco, they've released upwards of three dozen tracks spread out across 2007's occasionally great but overrated <em>B/E/A/T/B/O/X</em>, the same year's excellent <em>After Dark</em> compilation, a couple of killer 12""s, a few 7""s, and now ""singles, B-sides, and rarities"" disc <em>Deep Gems</em>. After you throw out alternate mixes, godawful skits, and a reworking of their 2005 reworking of ""Iko Iko"", you're left with at most 22 discrete Glass Candy songs-- only 19 originals. Even then, the quality has been mixed.</p><p>Few bands really need a rarities collection. Glass Candy aren't one of those bands. Although <em>Deep Gems</em> maintains the after-hours glide of Jewel's recent work for Glass Candy or labelmates Chromatics, along with No's heavy-lidded Debbie Harry purr, it underscores just how few essential tracks Glass Candy have made so far. A hypnotic melody, murky bassline, and echoey keyboard splash-pulse help make ""Animal Imagination"" the most interesting ""rarity,"" but the lyrics would embarrass ""Celebration of the Lizard""-era Jim Morrison, and it shows up again, in an abbreviated lo-fi version, as ""Soft Boundaries"". Also pleasant enough is ""Geto Boys"", the aforementioned ""Iko"" update, a worthwhile purchase for anyone clamoring to have Glass Candy revisit the Mardi Gras favorite over the Geto Boys' 1991 hip-hop classic ""Mind Playing Tricks on Me"" (and who hadn't already downloaded the track's widely posted free ""MySpace Demo"" version).</p><p>Belle Epoque cover ""Miss Broadway"", one of Glass Candy's best tracks alongside the 12""-only ""I Always Say Yes"" and <em>B/E/A/T/B/O/X</em>'s ""Rolling Down the Hill"", is still decent in an unnecessarily busy, demo-ish ""Ms. Broadway (Remix)"" form. ""Poison or Remedy"" is just a cheap-sounding version of <em>B/E/A/T/B/O/X</em>'s ""Beatific"". If you paid 99 cents for it on iTunes because you thought it was a new song, I'm sure Glass Candy are sorry.</p>
<p>Outside of its self-cannibalizing standouts, <em>Deep Gems</em> tends toward the sort of the sort of forgettable nu-disco synth noodlings that shouldn't make the cut for a proper album. The best of the rest: ""Feeling Without Touching"", with its chirpy ""Da Da Da""- or ""Fortress/Deer Park""-esque synth repetitions, and ""The Beat's Alive"", where No emits high-pitched squawks over uptempo handclaps. ""Theme From Deep Gems"" is a minute-and-a-half synth-orchestral piece fit for a lesser Stanley Kubrick score. Finale ""Silver Fountain"" is seven minutes of slow-motion keyboard drones, multi-layered percussion, and raygun noises, with No occasionally murmuring about and/or moaning about ""misty mountains"". Where <em>B/E/A/T/B/O/X</em> opened with a lame exercise-instructor skit, <em>Deep Gems</em> starts with the Glass Candy equivalent of a telephone error message. Glass Candy may be busy finishing up their next album, but that doesn't mean we all have to act like being put on hold is the same as having a good conversation.</p></div>"|12610.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12610-deep-gems/|5.1|Marc Hogan

The subject matter of its 11 tracks:<br> <br>1. U.S. government deception in peace dealings with Native Americans.<br>2. Separation of church and state.<br>3. Privileged liberals. <br>4. A ""terrorist"" to some is a ""freedom fighter"" to others. <br>5. Anarchist fighters of the Spanish Civil War.<br>6. Middle East occupation by Israel and the U.S. <br>7. A fantasy about uprising by the masses. <br>8. ""Work your whole life, and you die with nothing."" <br>9. Celebrity worship. <br>10. The world is going to hell.<br>11. State-sponsored torture in secret locations. <br> <br>Whole Foods this is not; Misery Index's brand of progressivism is decidedly bleak. (One song on <em>Traitors</em>, though, is almost upbeat in its defiance: ""This land is fucking your land/ And not through them defined/ By fucking flags on SUVs/ or Super Bowl halftimes."") The band began in 2001 when half of the similarly political Dying Fetus seceded. Early efforts sounded like Terrorizer covering Slayer; in recent years, the band's sound has slimmed down to a precise, melodic blend of death metal and grindcore. Unlike colleagues Brutal Truth or Napalm Death, Misery Index have grown less experimental over time. They rely on standard minor scales with occasional flatted seconds and fifths for color. The message is progressive, but the sound is conservative. <br> <br>It hits hard, though. Recording engineer Kurt Ballou dials in a sound falling somewhere between ""battering ram"" and ""machine gun."" Adam Jarvis' drumming is astonishingly athletic; he propels otherwise slow half-time passages with helicopter rotor kicks. In the title track, he rotates fluidly between thrash polka and clattering blastbeats. The riffs are streamlined and hefty. A few ornaments add texture-- stinging string rakes in ""Ghosts of Catalonia"", black metal-esque jangles in ""Partisans of Grief"". Bassist/vocalist Jason Netherton sounds like a very angry man; he pulls no punches at his political blog, <strong><a href=""http://www.demockery.org/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.demockery.org</a></strong>. <br> <br>Despite its blunt force, this record is a thought-provoking package. In the liner notes, Netherton accompanies each song with a famous quote. For example, there's Albert Einstein's ""Never do anything against conscience"" line, and Nietzsche's oft-cited saw about gazing into an abyss. Such invocations could come cheaply, but they match the songs. They also add depth to the polemics, though Netherton can turn a good line himself. (On Hollywood celebrities: ""They are ink and pixels... yet they walk the earth as gods."") Relapse graphic designer Orion Landau pairs the text with politically charged montages indebted to antiestablishment artists John Heartfield and Larry Carroll. These polarized times call for constructive discourse. But if Misery Index can destroy the opposition six ways 'til Sunday, so be it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p></div>"|12560.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12560-traitors/|7.5|Cosmo Lee

The bands in question played metallic power-sludge that teetered on the edge of insanity, yet never collapsed fully into noise. Think Tad, Halo of Flies, the Cows, Unsane, and my personal favorite, the almighty Jesus Lizard.</p><p>By the mid-90s, the sound splintered in different directions, such as the math marathons of Don Caballero, the deconstructions of U.S. Maple, or the minimalist metal of Noxagt. Excellent bands all, but less immediately accessible than their forefathers. And so the ""genre""-- noise rock? scuzz punk? garbage metal?-- faded a bit, no longer a huge attention-getter. A resurrection may be afoot via bands like Pissed Jeans and Clockcleaner, but for now the jury's still out.</p><p>All of which means that if Providence's Landed had come along in the early rather than later part of the 90s, we might see them at the next Touch and Go anniversary. Instead the band has labored mostly in obscurity, forging a grimy, drooling bluster that mixes AmRep sweat with the art-howl of Japanese bands like Boredoms and the Gerogerigegege. <em>How Little Will It Take </em>collects an out-of-print Load LP with live tracks and compilation appearances, making a convincing case that if the Jesus Lizard ever had a proper heir, Landed were it.</p>
<p>The best measure of a band playing this kind of simple slobber is how hypnotic their most primitive songs are. Landed consistently hit home runs on this count. Take ""Longest Winter"", which is essentially just one big chord repeated slowly and endlessly. As Rick Pelletier adds ascending snare and Dan St. Jacques screams blurrily, the track gets more and more transfixing without ever really changing. It might be odd to get philosophical about music this primal, but Landed's lumbering pound is not far from a Zen mantra-- devout repetition that over time reveals multiple shades of the same single truth. But Landed can get complicated too. On ""War / Us vs. Them (and You)"", they switch beats on a dime, adding a Black Sabbath-like chug. Later, on the epic ""Hit the Land"" they melt a proggy beat into churning industrial noise. Still, even at their trickiest, Landed sound more monster than human, never letting brains get in the way of flailing brawn.</p>
<p><em>How Little Will It Take </em>isn't Landed's last word-- according to Load, they've recently ""mutated into a breakcore booty crew with a mush mouthed grape ape singing."" Evidence comes here via a 2006 recording called ""Pass the Buck"". Crunchy and overloaded, it pulls Landed's mono lurch into the territory of Mouthus or Sightings. If this is their new direction, it may not win them new fans, but it'll surely hold onto any heads smart enough to already be along for the ride.</p></div>"|12561.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12561-how-little-will-it-take/|7.8|Marc Masters

First, there's that Golden Globe for ""The Wrestler"", then a performance at the We Are One concert at the Lincoln Memorial, a handful of Grammy noms for a two-year-old song, a greatest-hits package exclusive from Wal-Mart, this weekend's Super Bowl halftime show, and a just-announced reissue of <em>Darkness on the Edge of Town</em>. So that Oscar snub can't sting too much. In the middle of a pretty amazing month, Bruce Springsteen is releasing his 16th studio album, one whose title sounds more like a campaign slogan than a rock record. Maybe that's intentional: After spending much of this decade playing up to listeners' notions of post-9/11 recovery and conjuring up bleak visions of Bush-era America, the Boss settles into some sense of contentment on <em>Working on a Dream</em>, as if that Dream had already been achieved. In this regard, the album sounds like the final installment of a trilogy he began with <em>The Rising</em> in 2002 and continued with <em>Magic</em> in 2007-- ignoring <em>Devils &amp; Dust</em>, which isn't hard to do, and <em>We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions</em>, which remains his best and most freewheelin' late-career album. <br/><br/>Tracing his personal-- and, arguably, our national-- mood from wounded to outraged to somewhat contented, these albums are linked by Springsteen's ongoing collaboration with producer Brendan O'Brien, whose work has grown increasingly capable and adventurous with each release. Despite removing any trace of regional shuffle from these songs, O'Brien puts them across like the proficient bar band they are, roaring through ""My Lucky Day"" and ""What Love Can Do"" with professional abandon. O'Brien erects an impressive 1960s wall of sound on ""Surprise, Surprise"", with its carnivalesque organ and girl-group backing vocals, and in general he streamlines the E Street Band's sound to highlight one central melody or riff. Opener ""Outlaw Pete"" rides an ascending/descending theme not dissimilar to KISS' ""I Was Made for Loving You"". Strings protrude from the song at odd angles, Springsteen's vocals echo through what sounds like a deep valley, and Roy Bittan contributes a hyperactive organ as the song spins a yarn about an outlaw so vague he sounds only theoretical. The track is overstuffed with ideas, and at eight minutes, it's a strange, ineffective opener, setting a curiously detached mood for an album that is, for Springsteen, typically engaged. <br/><br/>Of his three E Street Band releases of the 00s, <em>Working on a Dream</em> is the one that most sounds like a solo album, indulging a range of ideas that reveal Springsteen as still musically curious and more than willing to play around with his sound. Another American rock saint-- Brian Wilson-- shows up in the walking bass line on the title track as well as in the <em>Pet Sound</em>s percussion and ba-ba-ba's of ""This Life"". The scribbly guitar on ""Life Itself"" recalls the Byrds on ""Eight Miles High"" more than Nils Lofgren or Steve Van Zandt, providing a tense backdrop for Springsteen's pleading lyrics. The garbled-blues ""Good Eye"", one of the album's weirdest tracks, ratchets Springsteen's distorted vocals to a yelping beat and electrified banjo, but like his recent one-off download ""A Night With the Jersey Devil"", it feels like merely a demonstration of studio technique.<br/><br/><em>Working on a Dream</em> works hard on sound, but sleeps on actual songs. ""Queen of the Supermarket"" may be the worst thing he's ever written, an overly symphonic ballad about crushing on the stock girl. It's sweet, but there's something about the high-flying strings and the intensity of the imagery (""A dream awaits in aisle number two"") that suggests parody. The checkout beeps that help the song out to its car certainly don't dispel the wink. ""At night I take my groceries and drift away,"" Springsteen sings, but here his working-class identifications sound a little condescending and inappropriate. Just as ""57 Channels (And Nothing On)"" failed to convince anyone that Springsteen watched a lot of TV, ""Queen of the Supermarket"" can't persuade listeners that he does his own grocery shopping. Now that his big dream has come true, Springsteen doesn't seem to know what to do with himself. So he's trying to do everything.</p></div>"|12614.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12614-working-on-a-dream/|5.8|Stephen M. Deusner

Forget that most of the speeches the media and political opponents of Barack Obama got hysterical over were made years ago, in 2008 Wright was your bogeyman, and news coverage ensured his ""God damn America!"" refrain will echo down through the ages. Wright caused millions of knees to jerk with those words when they were dug up and aired, but I've thought all along that he got a bum deal in a media that wants to smack you with a sensation and would prefer it if you didn't bother to think deeply. That's not to say that I think America should go straight to hell of course, but I at least think his comments come from somewhere intellectually and emotionally honest, and taken in their context-- whether you believe Wright is a raging, aging relic, a traitor, or a righteous prophet-- are a powerful exercise of the First Amendment.</p><p>The duo behind Dälek apparently agrees, as Dälek (the MC the band is named for) steps back and gives the opening verse on <em>Gutter Tactics</em> to the Reverend, playing a long excerpt of a sermon in which he enumerates a series of American atrocities against Native Americans, blacks, and others, riding a slow crescendo in which he reminds his parishioners that many of the people who die under our bombs are just ordinary folks trying to live their lives and put food on the table. Listening, I think it's not so much the content of his message that makes us shift in our seats so much as the bluntness and lack of a leavening agent, the part where he says, ""Well, America has its faults, but when you get right down to it it's a pretty great place."" He never provides the counterargument, and in that respect, he could probably join Dälek full-time, because verbal bluntness and sonic brutality are basically their stock in trade.</p><p>To Dälek and the band's producer half, Oktopus, dystopia isn't some abstract future; it's what we're living in right now, and though I'm sure that on at least some level they were happy to see a member of a minority elected President, they aren't letting on here. They say as much on ""No Question"",  Dälek rapping, ""A black president don't ensure the sunshine/ A rich president represent his own kind/ As it stands now, the blind lead the blind."" Even if you don't share their cynicism, the conviction of the delivery sells it anyway-- Dälek are as methodically effective as ever, their signature blend of simple beats, carefully sculpted noise, and straightforward flow still highly unique after more than a decade. The vocals and lyrics, as always, play a much more secondary role than in basically any other rap group, with the little bits that stand out coherently above the mix providing about all the parts of the picture you need to construct the whole.</p>
<p>""Los Macheteros/Spear of a Nation"", for instance, calmly chronicles the injustices delivered upon Nelson Mandela by the Apartheid government of South Africa amid a hellstorm of processed drums and cascading sheets of feedback, with bits of muffled dialogue and South African choral music crying out from the depths. On the other side of things, ""A Collection of Miserable Thoughts Laced With Wit"" is actually quite pretty, dappling an echoing beat with smears of backward keyboard and piano. The vocal is buried and processed, used more as a rhythmic tool than a lead or focal point. While the intensity of their earlier records is still mostly intact,  Dälek have hit on a more spacious, open method for arranging their sounds, so that even a pounding dirge like ""Who Medgar Evers Was..."" feels more inviting than assaultive. There's no ""Black Smoke Rises"" endurance test here.</p>
<p>Of course, it wouldn't be a Dälek record without at least one track decrying the state of hip-hop, and ""We Lost Sight"" provides that. Still, I've never bought the idea that  Dälek was rap for people who hate rap. Some people who aren't normally crazy for hip-hop will undoubtedly enjoy this album, but I think it's primarily for people who believe that hip-hop is a broad canvas that demands people who color in the fringes, and Dälek do that, musically and politically. The opening Wright sample is a hard look back at a year most people would already rather forget, but it's a perfect intro for <em>Gutter Tactics</em>, an album that draws much of its strength from the same well of outrage and disaffection.</p></div>"|12595.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12595-gutter-tactics/|7.6|Joe Tangari

I kind of miss it. Their early-to-mid-1990s vanguard of instrumental downtempo breakbeat peaked with DJ Shadow's <em>Endtroducing... </em>and, much like jazz fusion, their hip-hop fusion had a brief window of innovation followed by a period of watered-down stagnancy. But fond memories of <em>Headz </em>have a way of coming back to you, and the urge to listen to psych-prog noodling and ambient/illbient trip-out jazzbo riffs over heavy Class of '88 boom-bap breaks is going to need to get fulfilled sooner or later. And with Shadow gone halfway hyphy, RJD2 turned into a twee Stevie Wonder, and Diplo getting most of his artier tendencies out of his system with <em>Florida</em> over four years ago, that urge has gotten harder to sate as of late.</p><p>This, then, should tide you over fine. Aether is one of several projects from San Antonio musician and graphic designer Diego Chavez, who has a couple of backup aliases (Otic Angst; A.M. Architect) in case one of the eight other groups out there operating under the name Aether sends a cease-and-desist. And within the first 13 minutes of <em>Artifacts</em>, his first full-length release as Aether, that familiar blunted vibe you might remember from those old UNKLE tracks you bumped 12 years ago comes creeping back in. Opener ""Forgive Me"" pulses its way into melancholy, electric piano-driven life like a wintry cousin to one-beat wonder Peter Panic's production on Jay-Z's ""Regrets"", and subsequent sounds-- the head-nodding sparkle of ""Dejame Dormir"", the stomping orchestral b-boy sweep of ""To Her"", the combination of hard, skittering beats and aloof folk-pop on ""Anywhere""-- reveal a simultaneous impulse towards percussive force and delicate, occasionally baroque melodic flourishes that give <em>Artifacts </em>a high-contrast personality.</p><p>Those first 13 minutes, interestingly enough, comprise nearly a third of the entire album's length. <em>Artifacts </em>lacks the slow-build, long-drive sprawl of its mid-90s progenitors in favor of a more concise approach that shares a similar ear for the brief interlude-turned-song as Boards of Canada, moments which play out briefly between the margins of more extensive musical concepts. But while <em>Artifacts </em>throws its songs at you short and quick, they're all interlinked in an album-length ebb and flow that's smartly paced and meant to be a quickly shifting exercise in mood alteration. It's fitting enough that the only tracks that break the four-minute mark come at the album's midpoint peak (the disco-paced, borderline-Bollywood ""Orfeu Negro"") and the very end (""Makeshift Sanctuary"", which quotes lyrics from A Tribe Called Quest's ""Get a Hold"" over minimalist piano and maximalist drums). How's that for mid-90s revivalism-- an album best listened to front-to-back.</p></div>"|12569.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12569-artifacts/|7.0|Nate Patrin

Members of stalwart Chicago acts like Mahjongg, Icy Demons, and Mucca Pazza lend their talents to the group, and they manage to borrow elements from all without sounding anything like these precedents. With the mysterious echo of vibraphone, the studious pitter-pat of fluid basslines, sophisticated rhythms, and chilly and cerebral atmosphere, it's sound and feel will be familiar (especially to native Chicagoans), but this is more insistent and less heady-- Chandeliers mostly want you to dance, in your own stilted, highly disciplined way.</p><p>Mechanical chirps and machine-like bass keyboards lean on some busy but very human drum work on opener ""Mr. Electric"",  a track full of dropped beats and rhythmic twists and turns that amidst its steady momentum and progressively more layered and melodic keyboards. Watery tones play repetitive, circular themes over the stiff funk of the brief  ""Maldonado"", but ""Mango Tree"" sticks around long enough for a few different modes: hushed percussion and nearly whispered vocals before, slick Ray-Ban-ready keyboard melodies, and cartoonish day-glo funk. The electronic tones of tracks like ""Big League"" fall into place like pistons in an engine, while both muttered vocal suggestions and subtle horn accompaniment color the moderate groove of ""Gold Rush"" as it quietly builds towards its ascending melody.</p><p>The bass is deeper and the vibe darker on ""Bamboo"", while it's springy keyboard tones retain a smirk while it's echo-laden vibraphones add unexpected texture-- though by the record's end, a little guitar and junkyard percussion doesn't do much to spice up the sparse ""Graffiti"", and the loopy march of ""Body Double (UK Mix)"" only raises the record's pulse slightly. The final moments of <em>The Thrush</em> maintain a vibe and atmosphere at the cost of growing repetitive. While it's only steps away from post-rock, Chandeliers have taken these elements their own way for a more distinctive whole, and a surprisingly cohesive album. It's both moody and danceable, but far more of the former.</p></div>"|12570.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12570-the-thrush/|6.4|Jason Crock

Surely many if not most begin quite innocently, like a fan letter to a favorite act. But the implication is still that the singer or band thinks that they can bring something new to someone else's song or performance. Perhaps they feel that they can even make the song better. The fact that this rarely happens apparently deters no one. ""Playing covers... is not the same as, say, recording your favorite songs of all time,"" elaborated Norwegian singer Susanna Wallumrod when an interviewer from <em>The Guardian </em>asked about her propensity toward re-imagining the songs of others. ""That wouldn't be interesting. It is about trying to make good music of your own.""</p><p>Truth be told, Susanna's strategy to date has largely been about making someone else's good music her own. Susanna and the Magical Orchestra's first album, 2004's <em>List of Lights and Buoys</em>, featured a couple of covers, including a morphine-slow take on Dolly Parton's ""Jolene"". But 2006's <em>Melody Mountain</em> was comprised of nothing but covers, including such ringers as ""Love Will Tear Us Apart"" and the umpteenth recording of Leonard Cohen's ""Hallelujah"". These less adventurous selections were offered along with more eclectic stabs at the likes of AC/DC, Prince, and, um, KISS. And 1980s KISS, no less (though if you want to pick a song to make better, you couldn't do much better-- which is to say worse-- than ""Crazy, Crazy Nights"").</p><p>In 2007, Wallumrod-- sans former Jaga Jazzist keyboardist Morten Qvenild, aka the Magical Orchestra-- emerged with the album of originals <em>Sonata Mix Dwarf Cosmos</em>. But she's back to her old tricks with her second solo disc <em>Flower of Evil</em>, another collection of radically rearranged covers. Well, mostly covers. Susanna slips a couple of originals onto this disc, too, but ""Goodbye"" and ""Wild Is the Will"" tend to blend right in, so thoroughly does Susanna adapt each chosen song to her particularly despondent milieu of dramatic piano and spare accompaniment by pals Helge Sten and Pål Hausken.</p>
<p>Frankly, it's hard to tell what we're meant to take away from Wallumrod's introductory take on Thin Lizzy's ""Jailbreak"", no matter how heartbreaking she makes it, especially when she's backed by the master of malleable sincerity himself, Mr. Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy. Will Oldham turns up again later as duet partner on Badfinger's ""Without You"", and his own ""Joy and Jubilee"" gets the Susanna treatment, too. It's a great fit, brittle and beautiful in all the right places, getting to the heart of Oldham's song in a way that the elusive songwriter himself sometimes disallows.</p>
<p>A few other tracks prove apt fits as well, particularly Sandy Denny's ""Who Knows Where the Time Goes"", Roy Harper's ""Forever"", and Nico's ""Janitor of Lunacy"", songs you'd think couldn't get any more melancholy or morose...until they do. Black Sabbath's ballad ""Changes"" especially benefits from its new setting, not to mention Susanna's female touch, as does Tom Petty's ""Don't Come Around Here No More"", plucked from its 80s trappings and remade as a funereal hymn. Fresh readings of Prince's forgotten <em>Lovesexy</em> track ""Dance On"" and ABBA's ""Lay All Your Love on Me"" highlight the strength of lyrics too often subsumed by each respective original song's ace production, even if in the latter case, the original Eurodisco trumps Susanna's Eurodirge.</p>
<p>Yet whether you're Chan Marshall, Mark Kozelek, or Susanna, when a cover goes beyond mere interpretation to outright reinvention, it does raise a question: If you're going to radically change a song until it's virtually unrecognizable, why not go all the way, write new lyrics, and call it something else? Revisiting Lou Reed's <em>Transformer</em> nugget ""Vicious"" as a piano ballad or ""Can't Shake Loose"" (a solo hit for ABBA's Agnetha Fältskog) as chamber gloom unfortunately further amplifies the perils and pointlessness of this kind of novelty.</p>
<p>Sure, recontextualizing songs can sometimes reveal something new about the source material. At least that's what the most gifted interpreters accomplish. But in Susanna's case, more often than not, the literal meaning of the lyrics is left intact after all else has been jettisoned. With every track projected through the same spectrum of depression, sadness, and misery, the song becomes unimportant and we're left only with her affected, ultimately monochromatic approach. As morbidly effective, thoroughly gorgeous, and sometimes wrenching as the results may be, in the end Susanna simply doesn't own these songs. She smothers and snuffs them out like a candle.</p></div>"|12557.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12557-flower-of-evil/|5.5|Joshua Klein

The Glaswegian band issued its sophomore effort <em>You Could Have It So Much Better</em> some 18 months after its 2004 self-titled debut-- a narrow window considering that first record yielded three top 10 UK singles, a Mercury Prize, and a steady touring itinerary that saw them ascend from clubs to concert halls to the Grammys. But the quick turnaround and life on the road didn't affect the quality of the material so much as the band's performance of it-- sounding brawnier and brasher than on their debut, Franz Ferdinand ripped through the album's 13 songs.  <br/><br/>Franz Ferdinand must've therefore been happy to sit out the past three years. In the time since Franz released their last album, their American contemporaries the Killers have already gone Springsteen and then swung back to their synth-pop roots, while next-generation UK upstarts like the Arctic Monkeys have weathered their own cycle of hyperbole, hibernation, and orchestral side projects. During that time, Franz Ferdinand first seemed poised to reemerge as the biggest pop band in the UK-- having initially tapped Girls Aloud guru Brian Higgins (Xenomania) to produce their third album-- or the most commercially suicidal, eventually parting ways with Higgins and indulging in extended studio jams, electronic experiments, and deconstructed, Martin Hannett-like recording techniques (complete with tales of using human bones for percussion).</p><p>In his review of <em>You Could Have It So Much Better</em>, Pitchfork's Nitsuh Abebe praised Franz Ferdinand for making albums that played like compilations of discrete but equally great singles, refreshingly bereft of the conceptual heft that marked the band's indie-rock peers at the time. Here the group dial that back from the start: ""Ulysses"" is less immediately striking than the band's previous headlining singles, as well as more lean and mechanistic. But it ably asserts <em>Tonight</em>'s slow-burn methodology: If that ""la la la"" chorus sounds unremarkable at first, by the third round, it's unstoppable.</p><p>Instead, <em>Tonight</em>'s patient pacing supports Franz singer Alex Kapranos' claims that these tracks share a nocturnal theme, reinforced by a gradually arced dusk-to-dawn sequence, a wandering spirit, and surprises that spring out of the shadows: ""Send Him Away"" comes on as a cool snap-along Sly Stone strut before intensifying into an unlikely but effective Afro-psych-funk jam; ""Bite Hard"" is a piano ballad reborn as a thick-heeled glam-rock gallop; the slo-mo-disco group chant ""What You Came For"" explodes into roadhouse-metal thrashing. But seeing as many of these arrangements were extracted from improvised jams, the shifts rarely feel forced, sounding more like the inevitable climaxes to Kapranos' seedy, increasingly desperate, club-crawling narratives.</p>
<p>It's only on <em>Tonight</em>'s would-be epic ""Lucid Dreams"" that the album's exploratory approach works against the band's pop instincts. Appearing in a considerably different, elongated eight-minute version than the one that debuted on the band's website last fall, the song is now outfitted with a re-arranged, slowed-down chorus that makes it stumble where it should soar. But if the extended fade out feels overlong and anti-climactic on its own terms, in the context of <em>Tonight</em> it provides an effective, slate-cleaning set-up for the album's two sweetly serene closers: space-age bachelor-pad lullaby ""Dream Again"" and a solo acoustic-troubador turn from Kapranos on ""Katherine Kiss Me"".<br/><br/>More so than stoking the band's current commercial prospects, <em>Tonight</em> is an exciting record for what it could potentially spell for Franz Ferdinand's future-- from here, you could just as easily imagine the band further exploring electro-house productions, or stripping their sound down and making a folk record, or delving into tropical laptop-tronic pop. Or, if you just want them to keep re-writing ""Take Me Out"", well, hey, they can do that too-- see: ""No You Girls"", a standard-issue but still irresistible disco-floor stomper that imagines Bowie re-recording ""Oh You Pretty Things"" for<em> Scary Monsters</em> (and which recently assumed its natural habitat in an episode of ""Gossip Girl). As the band that provided the exclamation point to the post-punk revival of the early 00s, there was good reason to question Franz Ferdinand's current standing in the pop world, now that that trend is on the wane. However, as it turns out, their return is perfectly timed to remind us that, in a world where UK rock is so uninspired the Brits were forced to make superstars out of Kings of Leon, you really can have it so much better.</p></div>"|12609.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12609-tonight/|7.3|Stuart Berman

The slightly rearranged and edited ""First Time High (Reconstructionist Remix of An Eluardian Instance)"" sticks pretty close to the original while giving it a lusher sheen (as well what sounds like some subtle ukulele and possibly some added vocals).

""First Time High (of Chicago Acoustic Version)"" is, as billed, a version of the song stripped down to its simplest acoustic components, as provided by Brion (replete with more uke and some nice guitar embellishments).

And even if the remix doesn't accomplish that, the extended version-- featuring five extra minutes of synth madness-- does the trick, recalling no less than one of Brion's own infamous improvised and overdubbed live Largo performances.

It's how you get the battle-rap/lover-man dichotomy of vintage LL Cool J, the pseudo-bipolar lighthearted sociopathy of Eminem, and David Banner's pop-that-pussy-and-educate-yourself agenda. Los Angeles rapper Blu, meanwhile, has a split personality of his own, one that emerges on his semi-pseudonymous Johnson&amp;Jonson collaboration project with producer Mainframe, and it's one that many hip-hop fans see in themselves: the split between being a smart-ass kid and a grown-ass man.</p><p><em>Johnson&amp;Jonson</em>-- much like his standout debut, the Exile-produced <em>Below the Heavens--</em> finds Blu's lyrics filled with invocations of youthful indiscretion and coming-of-age epiphanies, some sounding like decade-old memories and others coming across like they happened last week. This is where the smart-ass kid comes in-- joking about drinking gin at age 10 on opener ""J&amp;J"", recalling classroom put-downs of Michael Jackson and proper usage of the word ""bitch"" on the two-part ""Up All Night"", catching a contact buzz off his father's blunts and aspiring towards his friends' Menace to Society status in the process of ignoring his mom's warnings in ""Mama Told Me""-- and rapping like a young-and-hungry shit-talker with something to prove on just about every track. It's not unfamiliar turf, but it's put together and delivered from the perspective of an older, wiser man who still has some lingering affection for his young-and-ignorant days, some of which might not entirely be behind him.</p><p>While the liquor-and-weed vibe and frequent pimp-hand proclamations give <em>Johnson&amp;Jonson </em>its freewheeling vibe of fun-seeking, youthful arrogance, there's moments where it comes across like grinning admissions of benign, remorseless guilt-- not self-absorbed or defensive, but with an undercurrent of relief that he somehow escaped fucking things up for himself. It's mostly implicit (if not absent) in the party/battle cuts; if there's any grown-up sentiment in ""Half a Knot""'s euphoric swagger or the disco-fied Hollywood swingin' of ""Wow"", it's mostly in the feeling that comes with showing up on your old block with more money and skills than you left it with, or the freedom of being able to play the part of a bar-hopping high-roller without worrying about getting caught with a fake ID. But this album was recorded in 2006 when Blu was 23, which is a good age to take stock of what you've done so far and where you're going from there, and here's where the grown-ass man aspect takes hold.</p>
<p>""Another joint lit without a brother I can pass it to/ Another black suit I gotta buy, and I've had two,"" he laments on the Lennon-sampling hidden track ""Hold on John"", an inventory of personal and political strife which feels like a strung-together series of realizations that you can't really go back to being an escapism-obsessed kid so easily. It's a sentiment backed up in the mournful homecoming of ""Long Time Gone"", with its wistful Hugh Masekela-fueled vibe and its lyrics reminiscing over a permanently irretrievable childhood. And he sounds like he's struggling against his (and others') old habits on ""The Only Way"", where he waxes frustrated over early 70s soul and admits that he's ""a little better by stayin' humble/ I still hear my grandpa mumble, 'stay out of trouble, boy'"".</p>
<p>All that personality, and the record sounds amazing, too. A lot of it has to do with how well Blu meshes with some unpredictable, frequently left-field beats: Mainframe's production style reveals him to be one of 2008's biggest out-of-nowhere surprises, and he delivers a dizzying conglomeration of rock, classic soul, and funk that provides some of the most densely packed and restless sonics of any rap record in 2008. The beats on <em>Johnson&amp;Jonson </em>are the most psychedelic since Edan's <em>Beauty and the Beat</em>-- only they go beyond acid-fried weirdness into all-out party-rocking breakbeat psychosis that had me thinking vintage Prince Paul with an even weirder record collection.</p>
<p>And while Blu's insights are deep, his mic control's deeper, and if the heavier meaning of this album eludes you the energetic power of his voice won't. He delivers some jewels, flashy when he needs to be and agile at a whole bunch of different tempos, yet still down-to-earth enough to make sure his words are in the service of messages that area clear and relatable. With the best of two worlds-- the supreme comedic cockiness of the youngster and the insight of a lyrical vet who's already grown up fast since he first started rhyming-- Blu should have the underground on lock for a long time to come.</p></div>"|12592.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12592-johnsonjonson/|8.4|Nate Patrin

Who will speak for Theodore Geisel? The rhyme-slinging children's author/illustrator known to millions as Dr. Seuss kept the multimedia licensing of his assorted whozits and wockets pretty well in pocket until close to his death, even hatching a Christmas classic with the animated TV adaptation of <em>How the Grinch Stole Christmas!</em>. Geisel's widow hasn't been so lucky with her licensing decisions. Although I have to admit I sort of enjoyed ""Seussical: The Musical"" when I saw it in Boston before all the critic-induced rewrites, and a CGI-animated <em>Horton Hears a Who!</em> hit theaters to solid reviews last spring, it's hard to overlook disasters like Jim Carrey's <em>Grinch</em> or Mike Myers' <em>The Cat in the Hat</em>. Graduation gifts mean the last Seuss book most people get before having kids of their own-- <em>Oh, the Places You'll Go</em>!-- is also one of his unfunniest.<br/> <br/> Good news for people who love the good Doctor: <em>Oh, the Places We'll Go</em>, LAKE's K Records debut full-length, should help ease some of the pain caused by Hollywood's Seuss-icides. Not to be confused with German prog-rockers Lake, this Olympia, Wash.-based lo-fi pop collective fill out their ramshackle boy-girl sing-alongs with enough horns, flutes, jazzy guitars, synths, and handclaps for Bartholomew Cubbins-- or at least a groovier Architecture in Helsinki (or a shoe-string budget Free Design). And they do it without lapsing into the kind of overblown naiveté that boring adults sometimes ascribe to kids, but Seuss' best characters-- and his young fans-- always knew was bullshit. Kites are fun. Growing up isn't.</p><p>They're the sort of group you'd only find on K, with a rotating lineup that ranges from from three to six members and has included labelmate Karl Blau. You get the picture: guileless vocals, modest recording setups, twee-kid sincerity. <em>Oh, the Places We'll Go</em> has stiff competition among K's recent output, including discs by Blau, Jeremy Jay, the Blow, and the promising Desolation Wilderness. It's not always strong: Despite a piercing lead guitar line and a pulsing outro, ""Counting"" isn't going to help all good children go to heaven, and speaking of Kingdom Come, you can believe in the jangly piano-pop romance of ""Heaven"" without finding the song particularly remarkable. Still, LAKE introduce themselves as pop dreamers of an unusually levelheaded kind: ""Oh, the places we'll go/ We don't actually know,"" they acknowledge on deceptively upbeat opener ""Oh, the Places"" and, a scant 25-plus minutes later, on closing track ""Oh, the Places Two"". Wherever those places are, it sounds like boy and girl are going there together, but that doesn't make those rudderless moments of early adulthood any less terrifying. LAKE coin an all-too-appropriate adverb: ""Disillusionally.""</p><p>The rest of <em>Oh, the Places We'll Go </em>is divided between faster-paced glee-club soul and trippier, jazzier reveries. The album is at its best on ""Blue Ocean Blue"", an indie-pop should-be hit that calls out those of us ""always looking to obscure the most beautiful bits"" while exploring ""unexplainable emotions"" over brass and cowbell. ""Dead Beat"" is where LAKE's two sides cohere, showing us sisterhood (not ex-husbands who don't pay child support) as instruments dart between urgent verses and dreamy, splayed-out choruses. It's not Sexy Kids' ""Sisters Are Forever"", but not everybody cooks up green eggs and ham. More interesting are the thick bass lines (see also K releases by Jeremy Jay or Atlas Sound) and psychedelic-leaning lyrics of ""Bad Dream"" and ""On the Swing"". With a South American rhythm and reedy keyboard, ""Minor Trip"" offers up a truism no one will give you as a graduation present: ""Fearing the unknown will keep you down/ But fear of death and dying will keep you trying to live."" Is it Shakespeare? Hell no. But I bet it would sound hilarious in anapestic tetrameter.</p></div>"|12584.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12584-oh-the-places-well-go/|6.5|Marc Hogan

In the era of MySpace pages and their music players, music blogs, Last.fm, and countless other way to get your music out digitally, this doesn't seem like such a big deal. But back in 1999, hardly anyone used the web that way. Though his act didn't make him famous, it established Zapruder as a guy willing to experiment and push himself to be creative. His early embrace of the web as a tool to connect people to music (and vice versa) also got him a post as Pandora's music curator, though that's a position that could cease to exist next year if SoundExchange doesn't wake up and smell the 21st century coffee of internet radio.</p><p>Counting <em>52 Songs</em>, <em>Dragon Chinese Cocktail Horoscope</em> is Zapruder's fourth album, and possibly also his most sedate and intimate. He's brought back Scott Solter, who mixed his last album, as co-producer, and the long list of collaborators is used sparingly, with less of the full-band backing and pronounced orchestration that characterized 2006's <em>New Ways of Letting Go</em>. This paring back-- let's call it de-Sufjanification-- gives the music a markedly darker feel, aided by Solter's adeptness at accenting the low-end and muzzling brighter tones. The album's opener and closer, ""Happy New Year"" and ""Experimental Film"", both benefit from minimalist rhythm beds, which are sonically antiqued by the liberal application of grainy filters that help Zapruder's merely adequate voice stand out more as a clear instrument.</p><p>Such onic juxtapositions are the album's secret weapon and ultimately its defining characteristic. The drums on ""Lucy's Handmade Paper"" are as straightforward and direct as can be, but the Moog and other keyboards that color the background give the song a ghostly edge. This edge carries over into several other songs, such as the hollow piano dirge ""Can't We Bring You Home"" and ""South Kenosha"", the latter of which sounds like it was recorded in a very cold, large room. The album's extremes are best typified by the startling, loud all-drum coda of ""Bang on a Drum"" and ""Harbor Saints"" and ""Second Sunday in Ordinary Time"", which are basic guitar-folk tunes with just a hint of ornamentation.</p>
<p>The album's greatest highlight is ""Ads for Feelings"". If Beck's ""The New Pollution"" and Joni Mitchell's ""Free Man in Paris"" conceived a child, it might sound something like this, with its great, mellow lead vocal, quick tempo, and psychedelic flute breaks. It's perhaps not a coincidence that the wildest, most heavily adorned song is the best. As much as Zapruder's new stripped-down approach can be charming and sometimes captivating, the sparest folk songs he comes up with here can also be a tad boring. With a more distinctive voice or stronger melodies they'd have more of a chance. Still, <em>Dragon</em> is another solid album, if a slight step down. </p></div>"|12562.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12562-dragon-chinese-cocktail-horoscope/|6.3|Joe Tangari

It wasn't a quality issue as much as timing-- an incredible marketing plan/album called <em>In Rainbows</em> had been set upon starving web consumers just two months before, and Radiohead fans were still in the glassy-eyed-wonder stage. At that point, Thom Yorke's <em>The Eraser</em> seemed like a harmless but necessary detour. While only a few would name <em>The Eraser</em> as their favorite Radiohead-related LP, the 2006 record gave Yorke the chance to air out his electrohead side before heading back to the band for <em>In Rainbows</em>-- the most naturalistic Radiohead album since <em>OK Computer</em>. The assumed logic seems sound: no <em>Eraser</em>, no <em>In Rainbows</em>. A little over a year ago, <em>The Eraser</em> was a tiny lily pad, so why fret about these redos courtesy of dudes from Yorkie's dubstep-heavy iPod? <br/><br/>Though there's no discernible reason for <em>The Eraser Rmxs</em> finally getting a U.S. release right now (the songs were originally sold as MP3s, then a collection of three-song EPs, then as a CD in Japan last year), it sort of makes sense. Though the original album may have caused Radiohead to <em>not</em> make a record that sounds like it, the LP has caused some guy named Kanye West to do his best impression of it. Of the influences West cites in his recent Grammy ad, <em>The Eraser </em>lies directly in his head space. And there's no denying the spare sonic similarities between the record and West's current <em>808s and Heartbreak</em>, which currently sits at No. 5 on the Billboard charts. Its current single, ""Heartless"", is No. 3. So it turns out <em>The Eraser</em> played a large part in both Radiohead's consensus return-to-form LP as well as one of the most galvanizing pop albums in recent memory. Maybe this record's more important that we originally thought.<br/><br/>And so: <em>The Rmxs</em>. Always looking out for the next weird, bassy, scatterbrained electronic thing, Yorke collects a coterie of producers that would make Aphex Twin-philes split their pants. (Alas, Afx himself could not be reached for comment.) Three of dubsteb's most notable names-- Burial, the Bug, and Various-- chip in, along with laptop gurus Four Tet, the Field, and Modeselektor. Considering the amounts of hands turning knobs both tangible and virtual, there's an impressive consistency about <em>The Rmxs</em>. While <em>The Eraser</em> saw Yorke sulking about end-times and hopeless love against a pristine backdrop of ambient loops and tiny, click-clack percussion, <em>The Rmxs</em> dirties things up considerably. This is rebel music. No longer is Yorke wailing in his bedroom; he's whispering in a basement, plotting an overthrow.<br/><br/>Burial starts it off and, in essence, ends it with the disc's best track. All the standard tics from dubstep's most enigmatic figure are apparent on his ""And It Rained All Night"" redo: sub-bass adorned with nothing but atmosphere-- Zippos flicker out and the clink of bullet shells hit the floor. Who's been shot? Nobody's saying. If this song soundtracked that awful Bacchanalia scene in <em>The Matrix Reloaded</em>, that movie would automatically be 10% more enjoyable. Unsurprisingly, Yorke's voice suits Burial's soupy concoctions just as nicely as those mysterious R&amp;B divas he's usually fond of-- if this team ever decided to meet on an LP level, few would oppose. Cristian Vogel contributes two remixes, one of them the token overlong vamp that largely deletes Yorke's voice entirely, which is just silly. The Bug's ""Harrowdown Hill"" takes the singer's seething political indictment and turns it downright deranged-- it's almost Tricky-esque. The Field and Four Tet offer the only moments of relative hope with tracks that lift more than pummel. Four Tet even makes that ""artichoke heart"" line go down easy, with xylophones and pillowed drums sliding into a future with fewer head-scratching surprises, fewer reasons to throw things at the television. <br/><br/>And, of course, <em>In Rainbows</em>' secret weapon was the H word our current president is so fond of. <em>The Eraser</em> is relevant now, but-- specifically at this moment, days away from that crowded Mall-- it also sounds like a relic. Even Kanye made sure to graft the record's sonics onto something-- searing, thoughtless emotion-- more evergreen than dystopian riddles. Economic crash withstanding, Radiohead turned out to be quite prescient, coupling their most openhearted LP with a new era of genuine compassion (maybe?). <em>The Eraser Rmxs</em> is an insulated, paranoid, technically proficient reminder of a time when it seemed like there was no way out. ""This is fucked up,"" repeats a pitch-shifted Yorke on Vogel's Bonus Beat ""Black Swan"" mix. And it is. But not as much as before.</p></div>"|12612.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12612-the-eraser-rmxs/|6.7|Ryan Dombal

Tillman joined Fleet Foxes last summer, after their <em>Sun Giant</em> EP had already converted many listeners into fans. Before that, he had been a solo artist for nearly five years, developing his own sound and identity on four limited-release albums. His voice blends so well with his bandmates and his drumming has just the right restraint that despite his absence from the liner credits, it's not difficult to imagine he's been with the band all along, lurking just outside the studio and harmonizing through the walls. From the first richly harmonized notes, <em>Vacilando Territory Blues</em>, Tillman's fifth album and first for Western Vinyl, only confirms that impression: Featuring two Foxes and a similarly deep-woods sound, the album may bring to mind the glacial songs of Damien Jurado, the subdued shimmer of Mark Kozelek's solo material, or the outdoorsy languor of Great Lake Swimmers, but it ultimately proves a strong, quiet complement to <em>Fleet Foxes</em> and, more crucially, the band's rougher, looser sound. <br/><br/>The only constants on these songs are Tillman's wounded vocals and acoustic guitar, which he alternately strums with percussive force or patient restraint. Other instruments come and go, other voices join his, but each of these songs sounds like it was written on and for a lone guitar. This is no surprise, but it is important: Even as <em>Vacilando</em> adds new styles and instruments to Tillman's sound, it draws a straight line to his previous output, which is sparer and starker. Compared to <em>Long May You Run, J. Tillman</em> and <em>Cancer and Delirium</em> (both from 2007 and both reissued digitally last year on Autumn Tone Records), <em>Vacilando</em> sounds positively bombastic, but then again, those albums would make Nick Drake sound like Marc Bolan. <br/><br/>Tillman continues to make virtues of slow and quiet, but here he finds new avenues to explore, using volume more liberally and enlarging his musical palette without losing the brooding, late-night post-buzz vibe. ""Steel on Steel"", a standout about the aftermath of a car crash, bolsters the crisp imagery and economical lyrics with mournful horns that give the sense of loss and regret an almost gravitational pull. Marimba and mellotron add tints of color to ""No Occasion"", and a mandolin and piano take turns with the central ascending theme of ""First Born"", as Tillman sings like a less granular Will Johnson. Beginning with a blast of discordant reed instruments that interrupts the album's brooding tone, ""New Imperial Grand Blues"" makes explicit the classic-rock influences that underlie all of his arrangements even as it suggests an experimental streak. The song rumbles menacingly, darker and crunchier than anything his day-job band has yet mustered. Sequenced immediately afterwards, the nearly lo-fi ""Master's House"", with its casual strums and blueslike structure, sounds all the more austere, revealing new contrasts and territories in his sound.<br/><br/>Between these two poles lie Tillman's stock-in-trade folk songs, which sound solemnly intense and subtly melodic. Neil Young set the template, but Tillman puts his stamp on every note, wringing bare-bones poetry from evocative couplets. Occasionally, he stumbles, as on the overlong, overbaked ""Barter Blues"", whose soundtrack ambience can't sustain its seven-minute length, but more often, he writes toward a type of epiphany most often found in midcentury short stories: ""James Blues"", about a lovelorn character haunted by bad dreams, ends with the observation ""The universe makes more sense without a purpose,"" which sounds both gloomy and hopeful. ""Laborless Land"" makes an affecting chorus by repeated the word ""daylight,"" which sounds all the more poignant following his ominous hints of ""what I saw that blood-red morning."" He never specifies just what he saw, and that lack of disclosure gives the song a dark, almost gothic flavor. Tillman's stories sound as elliptical as his music, as if the lyrics demand such sparse arrangements. ""Everything moves so fast,"" he sings on ""Steel on Steel"", ""leave no time to ask, does nothing last? Do all things pass, just ash to ash?"" These songs whisper loudly to slow the world down, to preserve a moment and all its emotions, whether they're pleasant or-- more likely-- painful.</p></div>"|12603.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12603-vacilando-territory-blues/|7.6|Stephen M.

Together, their repertoire is a mixture of classic string pieces, modern compositions, and originals composed by one of the group's violinists, Colin Jacobsen, and fleshed out by a talented bunch, equally comfortable improvising and playing complex arrangements as they are performing in concert halls and small rock clubs.<br/><br/>Kalhor and Brooklyn Rider met as members of Yo-Yo Ma's ambitious Silk Road Ensemble, a project seeking to unite the vast range of musical traditions along the historic trade route in a way that preserves each one but casts it in the context of something broad and modern. They continue in that spirit on <em>Silent City</em>, finding common ground between Persian folk and modern minimalism. The album's two short pieces, ""Ascending Bird"" and ""Parvaz"", bridge those genres directly, the former by adapting a piece of folk music, and the latter by retelling the same legend with a new composition by Kalhor. ""Ascending Bird"" balances slow and deliberate phrases from the quartet, with Kalhor's warm, searching kamancheh and frenzied santur (Persian hammer dulcimer) from guest Siamak Aghaei. Percussionist Mark Suter and double bassist Jeff Beecher are also on hand to widen the aural palette.<br/><br/>Colin Jacobsen's ""Beloved, Do Not Let Me Be Discouraged"" fuses a passage inspired by the Central-Asian Romeo &amp; Juliet story Layla &amp; Majnun with a 14th-century Italian song, beginning with a long, solemn meditation on the latter before swelling and finally bursting into its rhythmic second half. Engineer Jody Elff has brilliantly captured the detail and dynamic depth of the group, and this is most apparent on the half-hour centerpiece, Kalhor's magnificent composition ""Silent City"". It begins nearly inaudible, with a slow improvisation that gradually grows to a heaving, jaw-dropping climax around the 17-minute mark, only to break back down to an aching, kamancheh-led passage. Where the first climax comes with a sudden shift from dissonance to gorgeous consonance, the second is a cathartic, celebratory dance movement, with Suter returning to percussion.<br/><br/><em>Silent City</em> has something for nearly everyone-- classical music fans will appreciate the fine quality of the playing, world music aficionados will enjoy the cross-cultural currents, and it's very easy to see kids reared on post-rock and miminalist electronic music feeling at home here (if you've ever liked anything released on Kranky, you're almost certain to enjoy this). Experimentalism is always more rewarding when it leads to resounding emotional depth, and this is as good an example as you'll find of a group of musicians achieving that ideal balance.</p></div>"|12579.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12579-silent-city/|7.6|Joe Tangari

The daughter of the Little Feat frontman, Lowell George, she rebelled against the idea that her career was foreordained by her genes. Apparently, and luckily, she cottoned to the fact that music was in her blood, as half of lounge-nouveau duo the Bird and the Bee and solo and with her confessional debut <em>All Rise</em>. Her newest album <em>An Invitation</em> carries this eerie sense of destiny further: The genius behind the record's meandering baroque, Van Dyke Parks, met Inara shortly after she was born.</p><p>Parks was friends with George's father and, of course, a collaborator. Years earlier, he wrote the words to Brian Wilson's ""teenage symphonies to God"" on the once famously ""lost"" <em>Smile</em>. Parks has more recently worked with Joanna Newsom on the epic <em>Ys</em> and Rufus Wainwright. After George watched the Edith Piaf documentary <em>La Vie en Rose</em>, she asked Parks to help recreate that sense of the solitary songstress, unencumbered and alone at the microphone, the music magically radiating from offstage. Handed a demo tape, Parks obliged. Soon he returned with arrangements that tracked the path of George's vocals-- every twist and turn-- with a painstaking, almost nanoscale precision. </p><p>A 28-piece orchestra, heavy on strings, evokes both the Technicolor wonderlands of the Sherman Brothers and the rambling urbanity of Kurt Weill. And, for songs that touch on yearning and love's blindness (""Tell Me That You Love Me"", ""Rough Design""), the large orchestral sound strangely suits the intimate, introspective words: they match the size of the emotions. Recorded in two days at LA's Sunset Sound studio -- the room where Parks and Lowell George first worked together-- the album was produced by Mike Andrews, who considers <em>An Invitation</em> the father-daughter record the Georges never got to make. Lowell died of a heart attack when she was five.</p>
<p>Parks takes an approach to composition that feels nearer to film (a holdover from his child-actor days, perhaps) and fiction than music. He views his pieces as connected by their characters and scenes. Married to a director, raised on Shakespeare, and briefly an actress, George was a perfect companion for this philosophy. It's no wonder the record betrays not only the drama of storytelling, but the sweep, color, and motion of the theatrical. They share the same multimedia creativity.</p>
<p>With her steady, crystalline voice, the only voice heard, George sounds like the still center of a swirling one-woman musical. In ""Idaho"", she tells the story of people running away to the Potato State, sounding a bit like Keren Ann over the sharp-edged strings, a moody piano, and Parks's accordion. ""Drink the same drink, think the same thing,"" she says elsewhere, about either a post-breakup refuge in ritual, or the descent into lonely monotony. Everyone here is trying to work something out with themselves. ""We're on our way to what we are,"" George sings on ""Rough Design"", describing not only her characters' complex interior lives, but her own thrilling growth as an artist. <em>An Invitation </em>adds a new chapter to that story, told in an unmistakably American idiom fusing Broadway and Tin Pan Alley and Copland, spotlighting Inara George as a sophisticated new voice and confirming Van Dyke Parks, at 68, as an inexhaustibly vital national treasure.</p></div>"|12586.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12586-an-invitation/|7.5|Roque Strew

Four albums on three different labels is one sure way to stifle momentum. And now a fifth release, <em>Swimmer</em>, has appeared on yet another label (this time self-released) following no small amount of wrangling when the label originally set to release it (V2) went under and the band was forced to make other arrangements. While the Standard have been busy label hopping, their gradual evolution and improvement have been somewhat lost in the shuffle.</p><p>Granted, a nearly Google-proof name hasn't helped, but going by <em>Swimmer</em>, it's safe to assume that obscurity is not one of the group's objectives. The disc's aim-for-the-stars effort makes abundantly clear. Equally arty, anthemic, and fashionably agitated, the album is the kind of big statement one might expect from an act ill at ease with the world around it and compelled to translate those anxieties into something as banal as rock music. Indeed, Tim Putnam's world-weary vocals quiver and quake like he's bearing the weight of the universe on his shoulders, while the songs themselves are awash with evocative piano, spooky guitars, and the occasional taste of chilly keyboards, all intended to convey maximum menace with minimal muss.</p><p>Yet also absent is some necessary muscle. For all the ominous sound and fury, there's not much here to actually bite into, and each rave-up is ultimately rather unremarkable. Further, while songs such as ""Through the Walls"", ""Lines"", and ""Hotel"" hit all the right notes, that isn't the same thing as hitting your own. The familiar tension and release arrangements belie too much button-pushing shorthand. It's as if the Standard spent some of their studio-bound downtime analyzing such bigger acts as, say, Muse, trying to figure out how to port a similarly atmospheric alt-pop-prog sound to an indie band on a budget.</p>
<p>While every last minute of <em>Swimmer</em> screams ""major,"" its reach ultimately exceeds its grasp, leaving it yet another minor-key and melancholy reminder that moodiness is no substitute for meaning. Indeed, with so many other bands aiming for similar art-rock uneasiness, the album's problem is familiar: it's hindered by a sort of 21st century ennui fatigue, its grey-day grandiosity a dime a dozen when woe-is-me is the default expression.</p></div>"|12572.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12572-swimmer/|4.7|Joshua Klein

He's been wandering that path since 2003's <em>Weather Systems</em>, when he retired his former band, the Bowl of Fire, and moved to Western Illinois to live with his thoughts on an old farm. On his new album, <em>Noble Beast</em>, Bird can sometimes seem <em>too</em> far inside his own head. And he also appears aware of it, addressing that solitude on ""Effigy"": ""When one has spent too much time alone..."" He doesn't answer with another lyric-- perhaps he doesn't have an answer. Instead, he lets you fill in the blank while he reels off a pretty, rustic violin figure.</p><p><em>Noble Beast</em> is, in many ways, a record that asks you to forget the way you currently approach the album. It didn't click for me on early listens. The sometimes drifting song structures, frequent tonal shifts, odd lyrics, and interludes presented a stuffed canvas full of interesting sounds that didn't seem to have a focal point, didn't seem to have a place where you were supposed to enter the composition. Eventually, however, everything fell into place. Marinating in an album in this way is old-fashioned in the overloaded peer-to-peer era, but it's a fitting approach from Bird, a guy who often wrestles with the implications of modern technology and communications.</p><p>The sound of the album is as important as the notes Bird plays, and this extends to the lyrics, where he's gradually gone from word-play to syllable-play, often choosing lines for their sounds and tonal quality more than for their meaning. Nevertheless, Bird's music is still emotionally powerful-- he gives uncommon weight to odd phrases, sometimes backing off pronouncing a word fully. His diction comes and goes similar to the way Thom Yorke's does. Some of the phrases don't mean anything; others jump out oddly, like the way he follows a free-association game on ""Masterswarm"" with the startlingly cogent, even harrowing line, ""They took me to the hospital and they put me through a scan."" Bird injects the music with similar contrasts, opening ""Effigy"" with a spooky bed of looping, processed violins before shifting into one of the album's most traditional-sounding moments, with finger-picked acoustic guitar playing a simple, straightforward melody.</p>
<p>Despite early listens, I quickly found myself returning to the record even as I corresponded about it with some nonplussed colleagues. And it revealed itself to be fantastically detailed, from the woodwinds that spice the electronic pulse of ""Not a Robot, But a Ghost"" to the bassline that comes out of nowhere at the finale of ""The Privateers"". More broadly, it takes you even further into the canyons of Bird's mind, and it does so with an organic, unhurried flow that's ultimately an improvement on 2007's <em>Armchair Apochrypha</em>, a record I felt was sometimes too fussy and mannered. Even the bonus disc that comes with the deluxe edition, <em>Useless Creatures</em>, has a captivating looseness that finally brings some of the high-wire energy of his unpredictable live shows into the studio.<em></em></p>
<p><em>Noble Beast</em> is has its weak spots-- ""Nomenclature"" in particular takes the repurposing of language purely for its sound a step too far, not least of which because Bird chose a cumbersome, ugly word-- but one of the benefits of working so far in your own sphere is that your mistakes will always be interesting, and better than that, you get to learn from them. I have no idea what Bird will learn from making this record, but he seems to have taught himself plenty about what his music can be during his time alone-- and now he's reminding us about the value of patiently engaging with music as well.</p></div>"|12605.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12605-noble-beast/|7.5|Joe Tangari

Jenkinson's virtuosic bass work and his jazz training, however, just as often forge a path between breakbeats and fusion. Such live-band musings, even if largely theoretical, have set him apart from his more austere dancefloor cohorts.<br/><br/>On his new record, Jenkinson has adopted a relatively new trait: brevity. <em>Just a Souvenir</em> clocked in at just under 45 minutes, and <em>Numbers</em> is one of Jenkinson's few recent standalone EPs-- and one of his strongest. The EP streamlines Squarepusher's rave genesis in six shortish tracks. ""Illegal Dustbin"", for instance, presents breakcore salvos with a rough edge. It opens with a stock Amen break before continually upping the stakes, first letting loose glitchy, fuzzed-out synths and guitars then climaxing with double-speed axe work, as if he's apologizing for the rock-band dynamics of his last record.<em><br/><br/>Numbers</em>, admittedly a collection of ""textbook"" Squarepusher works, comes only a few months after the dramatic left turn of <em>Souvenir</em>, which is for all intents and purposes <em>Squarepusher Unplugged</em>. Despite their differences, Jenkinson seems to link the two thematically, and not only with similar album art: <em>Souvenir</em> is more psychedelic dream; <em>Numbers Lucent</em> perhaps delivers the rude awakening. ""Star Time 1"" riffs on the same funky theme as <em>Souvenir</em> opener ""Star Time 2""-- and it's the record's most melodic moment-- yet even it's full of acid-tinged synth lines and frantic bass runs. (Intriguingly, if the numbers refer to a chronology, it's possible the rave throwback cuts on <em>Numbers</em> were the original path trod for Squarepusher's 2008 LP.)<br/><br/>In the end, <em>Numbers Lucent </em>feels, oddly for a rave record (though fittingly for a Squarepusher release), academic. Even compared to the existential sighs of 2004's <em>Ultravisitor</em> or the blissouts of <em>Hard Normal Daddy</em>, <em>Numbers</em>' grooves look like palimpsests recalling livelier days. <em>Numbers</em> instead reads best as a contrast piece to <em>Just a Souvenir</em>. While <em>Souvenir</em> re-casts Jenkinson as an artist of immediate payoffs, it's also way off the decades-long course he's plotted. <em>Numbers </em>provides the compass pointing the way back to Jenkinson's roots, a reminder that his sonic psychosis stems from the madness of the dance floor.</p></div>"|12604.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12604-numbers-lucent-ep/|6.5|Mike Orme

Or so you'd gather from the heady account of her new EP as a ""love letter to France, French music, and the French language."" Called <em>Luniculaire</em>, a whimsical name that suggests a train to the moon, you might expect these five songs to assume a dreamlike continental elegance that caresses the senses. You'd be wrong. Each of these songs, out of three covers and two originals, are rendered in a shaky French and touched with a spirit of curious experimentalism.</p><p>All this might surprise admirers of <em>Phylactery Factory</em>, her comparatively traditional, and solidly English second album, the debut under her White Hinterland moniker. That gorgeous production drifted between nightclub sophistication and swaying, swinging folk. Sure enough, bits of this aesthetic do endure in <em>Luniculaire</em>. This is an elegant affair from any angle. But Dienel has ambitiously left much of the last record's refinement behind for a less forthright, at times abrasive, style of production: partial to broken rhythms, freeform meanderings, and atonality.</p><p>""Requiem Pour Un Con"", originally sung by Serge Gainsbourg in the 1968 Jean Gabin flop <em>Le Pacha</em>, crumbles a bit during White Hinterland's rowdy process of interpretation. Where the original vibrated with Gainsbourg's fusion of erotic confidence and bohemian suavity, the cover comes off as partly unhinged, even a little spastic. Blame lies with the chaos of squelches behind her, courtesy of guitarist Alexis Gideon: a wayward blurting that chips away at the chic edifice built up by all the spunky metallic breakbeats and restless vocals. Thanks to Gideon, we get the impression of a rudely interrupted dinner party. Too messy to be called a complete triumph, much of Gainsbourg's clattering minimalism and creepy-cool tension nevertheless survives in this daring recasting. (And extra points must be given to the brave woman who tackles this testosterone-drenched revenge ballad, which drops the Gallic c-bomb in the title, a more explosive term then: in 1968, the title was printed as ""Requiem Pour Un C..."")</p>
<p>Gainsbourg was the éminence grise (and Humbert Humbert) behind yé-yé music, but it was Françoise Hardy who most thoroughly embodied this uniquely French species of pop, which joined innocence and romance in the body of the nymphet chanteuse. Hardy's classic ""Mon Amie La Rose"" poetically captured the dark truth behind the brightly flirtatious yé-yé, massaging the theme of beauty's impermanence by tracing the life of a rose in the garden. Gainsbourg all but lived by the girl-as-flower analogy, but Hardy dives deeper here, musing on mortality, not romance, in a silken voice that seems both existential and optimistic. Dienel's languorous update is less convincing, botching the Blochian final words: ""Believe, those who can believe/ Me, I need hope/ Or else I am nothing."" When the original's pathos-laden ballad edged dangerously close to cheesy sentimentalism, the clear-headed vocals, pillowy harmonies, and tender troubadour guitars pulled it back. The mopey, clumsy violins on the cover nudge it over the top.</p>
<p>More adventurous is her fresh vision of ""J'ai 26 Ans"" from Brigitte Fontaine's criminally unsung <em>Comme à la Radio</em>, a record that houses the startling combination of yé-yé ingenue and free jazz wizards the Art Ensemble of Chicago. ""In the original Brigitte Fontaine song, there's a lot of implied drone, with the middle Eastern timbres in the bass lines that're being played,"" Dienel has explained. The fact is that the song was nearly all bassline. No surprise that, over a sea of delay, feral howls, and tribal percussion, the implied drone turns explicit, into a fiery dirge from the Fertile Crescent. A far cry from the haunting, artsy sparseness done by Fontaine, the busy maximalism still works as a clever interpretation.</p>
<p>Dienel's own two compositions are impressive, and wildly different. Fans of <em>Phylactery Factory</em> will welcome the genteel swing of ""Lunirascible"", which restores the piano-- and that feathery voice-- to the fore. Alike in mood, but a radical departure in methodology, ""Chant de Grillon"" glides along like a Krautrock layered-guitar epic. It sails on a motorik groove over glistening, spacy effects, rising steadily into a Caribou-style frenzy of percussion.</p>
<p><em>Luniculaire</em> uncovers a surprising side of Casey Dienel. We knew her as the deviser of jazzy, brightly melodic, and somehow disarmingly childlike tunes. This EP introduces an artist willing to embrace the ugly sound, to forgo indie-pop politesse for art-rock attitude, to sing in a language she can't flawlessly speak. The missed opportunities and the overreaches here point nevertheless to that rare thing, a true and thoughtful risk taker, whose gutsy, thoroughly imagined songs signal new directions for an indie auteur in the making.</p></div>"|12594.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12594-luniculaire-ep/|6.9|Roque Strew

While they may not sound like other bands in their local scene, Micah Rabwin and Sean Ogilvie's collective is clearly an integral part of it. Witness their delicate, affecting debut, <em>Hold This Ghost</em>, which features contributions from fine hometown musicians like Laura Gibson and Norfolk &amp; Western's Rachel Blumberg.</p><p>Despite what their band name may imply, the Northwestern group isn't remotely French, taking their moniker, instead, from a California museum of old-fashioned coin-operated music boxes. The name fits them, as the ambiance they've created on <em>Ghost</em> is, at once, haunted, ornate, wistful for the past, and not of its time. Though almost every song is built on a foundation of gentle guitars, it is the baroque orchestrations of poignant strings, weeping accordions, and flickering organs that give this collection its hazy soul and hypnotic core. Album closer ""Our Changing Skins"" adds flourishes of the singing saw to its dulcet chamber orchestra and chirping-bird samples to temper its sweetness, tinting the tune with a nostalgic sepia tone. And ""The Propellors"" layers a similarly haunting saw swoon over its gauzy melody, illustrating its historical lyrics (""December 17th, 1903/ Propellers turn to wings/ The age of air at hand"") with its otherworldly ambience. The fact that Musée Mécanique choose to tell the story of the Wright Brothers' first flight, not as a celebratory pop song, but as a drowsy, ghostly apparition of one, tells you a lot about their aesthetic.</p><p>Even their more straightforward acoustic folk songs use subtle, imaginative arrangements to imbue an antique patina to their goosebump-inducing melodies. ""The Things That I Know"", the album's most direct folk song, is built on a fingerpicked base that feels like a whispery Iron &amp; Wine accompaniment, but its fairy-tale glockenspiels add a shimmering weightlessness to the heavy introspection. And ""Somehow Bound"" is the kind of aching, love-lost ballad that Elliott Smith mastered, complete with nakedly depressive lyrics-- ""I hear you laughing through the wall/ It's been two hours, just one call/ Talking on the phone with some guy that I might know/ I hope I don't know."" But by tweaking Smith's acoustic formula with a brooding keyboard drone in the background and twinkling glockenspiels adding a light-at-the-end-of-the-tunnel brightness, Musée Mécanique artfully side-step the rote strumming and self-indulgent woe-is-me-ism that plagues many Smiths wannabes.</p>
<p>Though their instrumental experimentalism is key to their overall sound, Musée Mécanique owe a great deal of their evocative power to Rabwin's emotive tenor. Like Sufjan Stevens without cheerleaders (or, frankly, cheer), Rabwin has an elegant clarity and regal sadness to his tone and, because he enunciates each word, listeners will not only understand every lyric he sings, but also feel them too. It is that ability to viscerally effect an audience that make Musée Mécanique such a powerful, if unusual, folk force. Their shy yet florid debut is tinged with sadness, like a painted carousel sitting empty in winter, mourning for a time they-- or we-- never even knew.</p></div>"|12564.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12564-hold-this-ghost/|7.2|Rebecca Raber

Alongside guitarist Mark Mallman, bassist and vocoder handler Dan Geller pumps enough synth patches into their debut album to keep a solid power hour going. Their individual histories help explain their brand of relentless dance-rock: Geller founded Kindercore and electropop duo I Am the World Trade Center, and Mallman once performed a 52.4 hour-long rock song aptly titled ""Marathon 2"" (the first ""Marathon"" lasted half the time) a few years ago.</p><p>What Ruby Isle lack in lyrical dexterity (""Hey hey hey, that kid's okay/ He's just another sucker with bills to pay""), they make up for with presence. Hearing their electro-fied cover of Peter Gabriel's ""Solsbury Hill"", which features Geller's IATWTC counterpart Amy Dykes, will probably make most who hear it bristle and think, ""Why?"" But, admittedly, if I was harboring a lucid buzz and heard those staccato synths, I would probably grab the nearest party peon's lapel and exclaim, ""Do you hear that?! That's Gabriel!"" All covers cause an initial familiarity-effect joy, which can either fade into disdain or booze-fueled bopping. Ruby Isle will probably spur the latter-- not that they really give a shit. And that's why the best places to hear <em>Night Shot</em> are like those scenes in <em>Can't Hardly Wait</em> and every other teen-seeking-tail movie where kids are hanging off the stairs and puking into the pool.</p><p>That's not to say Geller, Mallman, and drummer Aaron LeMay can't get you moving. They can, especially with pep-squad songs like ""Atom Bombs '09"". Even YouTube superstar Tay Zonday contributes guest vocals to the title track, sometimes sounding like his ""Chocolate Rain"" self, sometimes like the invisible ""Mortal Kombat"" referee indicating that you should probably start fighting.  It's goofy party rock done more or less right, with programmed handclaps and unyielding (and borderline irksome) energy.</p>
<p>The first pressing of <em>Night Shot</em> includes a bonus EP with songs from Ruby Isle's covers project. For a time, the band recorded a version of whatever song made the weekly top spot on music blog aggregator Elbo.ws; along the way, they managed to remove most of the whimsy and allure. Beach House's gorgeous ""Gila"" is wire-stripped into a cheerleader anthem, and the sound effects that propelled M.I.A.'s ""Paper Planes"" onto radio waves are replaced with vocal imitations. The only version of these that doesn't sting too much is ""Cherry Tulips"" by Headlights, which always needed a slight makeover. In the end, though Ruby Isle are hit-and-miss with both their originals and their covers, there is a certain spunk here that's infectious; it's easy to admire their audacity, if not necessarily their sound.</p></div>"|12559.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12559-night-shot/|5.5|Kasia Galazka

But concentrating on simplicity and force alone unfairly deflects attention from the nuance of Newman's approach-- in his lyrics, arrangements, and delivery, there's always much more going on than can be viewed at a distance. Because of the power pop tag, the emergence of Newman's ""quieter"" side-- best represented by 2004 solo album <em>The Slow Wonder</em> and the Pornographers' overlooked 2007 LP <em>Challengers</em>-- led many to question if, absent the effusive energy, his music was still worthwhile. Wonder's follow-up <em>Get Guilty</em> isn't going to satiate those looking for another <em>Twin Cinema</em>, but it helps solidify the fact-- known to fans for a while now-- that Newman's singularity as a songwriter lies in more than histrionics.</p><p>Like Wonder, <em>Guilty</em> has its share of up-tempo tracks, yet its real pleasures are idiosyncratic, revealing themselves the more attentively and often you listen. Newman has himself compared (with tongue at least partially in cheek) late-album cut ""The Collected Works"" to Queen's ""Fat Bottomed Girls"", yet that bit of self-deprecation elides what happens after the first verse, when the bottom drops out of the song, leaving a piano to briefly dialogue with what sounds like a tiny, dying violin. ""Like a Hitman, Like a Dancer"" is an acoustic rocker with a recognizably whooped-up chorus, but those two titular characters, in Newman's world, are connected by virtue of the fact that they're ""all muscle."" During the verses of ""Elemental"", the harmonies of Nicole Atkins (along with Mates of State's Kori Gardner, <em>Guilty</em>'s female vocal ringer) provide a subtle, high-register hum behind Newman. Gentle, swirling organs subtly enter the frame to signal that song's slight shift to a refrain, recalling the stately psychedelia of Elvis Costello's <em>Imperial Bedroom</em>.</p><p>Like some of Costello's music, much of <em>Guilty</em> feels like a gambit-- a playful way of unsettling expectations with a fun-house mirror approach to musical structure and a fondness for meta-narratives. Newman, like buddy and collaborator Dan Bejar, has always turned his (and our) attention back toward the process of creating (see also: ""The Fake Headlines"", ""Twin Cinema""). The title <em>Get Guilty</em> is a deliberate wink toward postmodern author Donald Barthelme, and ""The Palace at 4 AM"" is a meta-romantic homage to the act of writing, nestled inside a life-on-the-road tale. On the stately, cascading album-opener ""There Are Maybe Ten or Twelve"", after singing the song's first lyric, Newman throws us off his path: ""That wasn't the opening line, it was the tenth or the twelfth. Make of that what you will.""</p>
<p>Because he knows how to imbue them with purpose and drive, Newman's narrative fragments and impressionistic lyrics can work just as well without self-reflexivity. On ""The Heartbreak Rides"", one of his dozen or so best compositions to date, he sings, in his irresistibly nerdy falsetto: ""She led the modern sunset to your window, gestured with a plain-Jane hand, she said 'Let's go.'"" We don't get a direct sense of what the adventure entails, but the suggestion alone, like the song, is invigorating, like an unplanned road trip or the anxious rush of a romantic relationship.</p>
<p>Always his own biggest critic, Newman remembers his youthful capriciousness on the string-flecked, nostalgic ""Thunderbolts"", singing ""We played it too green to start, to play it with any art,"" as the song pushes toward a crescendo that never comes. Perhaps he's remembering the time when it seemed only natural to substitute verse-chorus-verse with the much more satisfying ""chorus-CHORUS-CHORUS!!!"" and describe his group as mass romantics and new pornographers. Yet like ""Thunderbolts"", those ironic descriptors-- suggesting that his music inspired awe by appealing to sensations more than emotions-- indicate Newman's modesty more than they define his art. Revisit his earlier records with an ear toward refinement instead of sheer voltage, and the roots of <em>Get Guilty</em> will clearly reveal themselves amidst the clamor.</p></div>"|12590.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12590-get-guilty/|7.5|Eric Harvey

Over the past four years, the Brooklyn-based duo made its name from a joyously amateurish EP, a cheerily sloppy debut full-length, and an energetic live show that left a string of sweaty, satisfied audiences in its wake. Matt Johnson and Kim Schifino took Mates of State's spare, co-ed, drum'n'keys set-up and bled it of anything mannered or pretty, leaving just raw, bleeting synthesizers, shouty singing, and relentless drumming. So the last thing we'd expect from this spazzy synth-punk band is a slowed down, gussied-up sophomore effort, but Matt &amp; Kim wear their newfound growth surprisingly well.<br/><br/>Their previous recorded material was more like their propulsive stage show, so the first thing you'll notice about <em>Grand</em> is the band explores new textures and diverse dynamics. More than half of the 11-song album lives in the mid- downtempo range, making <em>Grand</em> feel more wistful and intimate than its predecessors-- likely the result of recording in Johnson's childhood bedroom in Vermont. ""Don't Slow Down"", despite its title and ""Just Can't Get Enough""-like staccato melody, proves an insistent kick drum and repeated keyboard stabs can sound reflective and poignant. ""Spare Change"" buoys its droning, buried organ with handclaps and foot stomps but still manages to sound vulnerable and lonely amid the raucous percussion. And ""Turn This Boat Around"", a drum-free ballad built on a charming calliope-like keyboard melody, is almost reverent in its relative stillness. <br/><br/>Such changes are welcome-- a good band needs to evolve to continue to stay interesting-- but Matt &amp; Kim are still at their best when they are at their fastest. ""I Wanna"" takes a cue from earlier tracks ""5K"" and ""Yea Yeah"", but even that track measures its breakneck pace with a slow section, settling its demanding verses into a more deliberate, looser groove. Instrumental ""Cinders"" features a melody so happily jerky and rhythms so dangerously spastic that you can practically hear paroxysmal crowds pogo-ing madly. <br/><br/>With glossy (by Matt &amp; Kim's DIY standards) production-- double-tracked vocals, synthesizer effects (check that violin-like sound on ""Good Ol' Fashion Nightmare""), and more clarity of sound-- a newfound emphasis is placed on Matt &amp; Kim's words. Luckily, <em>Grand</em> features not only some of the band's most personal lyrics, but also some of its most universal. Though made in a more pastoral setting than these outer-borough denizens are used to, the album's subject matter is still decidedly urban. ""Don't Slow Down"", one of two tracks that namechecks the LP's titular Brooklyn street, is like a hipster ""We Didn't Start The Fire"", listing all of the tiny details of life in the creative underclass. ""Lock knees, no keys/ Brooklyn, Grand Street/ Four flights, late nights/ Black socks, white tights"", sings Johnson, and thousands of other kids in his zip code (and others like it around the country) feel like he's describing their Saturday nights-- even if this album is less of a party than their previous recordings.</p></div>"|12593.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12593-grand/|7.3|Rebecca Raber
