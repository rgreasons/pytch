    liked because they sounded not unlike the Velvet Underground and wrote sad,
    lovely songs about being sad and lovely and having fairly ambitious beards.
    Further, one of the band's auteurs was named Bubba Kadane, which certainly
    set them apart from many of their peers and made their aficionados like them
    more. (If it's any measure of fan loyalty, the profusion of websites and
    mailing lists available online shocked even this longtime fan.) But then
    Bedhead broke up, which was sad and not very lovely.  Now <i>les freres</i>
    Kadane have started a new band called the New Year, whose first LP is called
    <i>Newness Ends</i>, which isn't particularly sad. Thankfully, it's still
    pretty damned lovely.</p><p>
    
    Everything surrounding the New Year's debut screams ""break with the past.""
    Seeing as the guys elect to use the word ""new"" in both album title and band
    name, someone might get the idea that these guys have something to prove.
    After all, Bedhead's sinuous, country-inflected sorrow and chimy guitar lines
    could be argued as one of the Ground Zeroes for the current slow-core
    renaissance, making theirs one of '90s-vintage indie rock's most distinctive,
    influential sounds. The obvious question for the band that now contains the
    braintrust of such a blockbuster act is whether to follow down the same path
    of their previous triumphs or to light out for new territory.</p><p>
<i>Newness Ends</i> cannily splits the difference between innovation and
    nostalgia. The New Year features Chris Brokaw on drums, where he follows
    roughly the same steps he did behind the kit for Codeine, another seminal
    drowsy-rock combo.  His tempos here are a little juicier than they were in
    his Codeine days, as if his other occasional work as axeman for vicious
    avant-bluesers Come has led him to understand the virtues of amping up a
    bit.</p><p>
    
    Not uncoincidentally, the New Year seem more willing to rock than their
    immediate antecedents ever were. ""Reconstruction"" builds from a quiet,
    circular guitar figure into a roiling jam, signaling the band's development
    from a frail, occasionally silent rock band into an edgier, more rock-and-roll
    outfit. Similarly, ""Gasoline"" hurtles forward, propelled by skittery drumming
    and endlessly inventive soloing. Though no one's going to mistake the New Year
    for the Donnas, someone involved here has connected with their inner Angus
    Young.</p><p>
    
    Or, at any rate, their inner Albini. Mr. Shellac committed this LP to tape,
    and though it's hardly the grot-rock he's become known for, his less-is-more
    approach certainly aids <i>Newness Ends</i>. Now that the boys in the band
    are playing harder, with more propulsive riffs and structures, the bare-bones
    effects of the recording make them sound even leaner and, god forbid, meaner.
    Where music of this variety can often disappear into its own navel without
    warning, the New Year sound hale, healthy and ready to rock.</p><p>
    
    Bear in mind, though, that on their swansong collaboration with compatriots
    Macha, Matt and Bubba Kadane managed to make Cher's ""Believe"" into a somber
    dirge, and their sedated side doesn't go neglected here, either. ""One Plus
    One Minus One Equals One"" is the sort of mumbled hymn that marmoset-looking
    character from Bright Eyes would give important teeth for: Nashville-esque
    lead guitar co-exists peaceably with subtle washes of feedback, and the band's
    rhythm section patiently anchors the track. ""Alter Ego"" is endearing, strummy
    pop that builds to a complex instrumental climax without ever turning into
    abstraction or sludge.</p><p>
    
    So much of the Kadanes' new effort indicates a self-consciousness about their
    place in the cosmos. <i>Newness Ends</i>, from its title on down, seems
    conscious of the ways in which it looks to Bedhead's accomplishments while
    plotting the future.  At the same time, the band's name bespeaks a certain
    hope for change and possibility.  Let's hope both prophecies turn out to be
    true.</p></div>"|5782.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5782-newness-ends/|7.9|Sam Eccleston

Okay, so frontman James Bertram     may be the ex-bassist for 764-HERO. And yes, 1999's <i>Life in a Bubble Can     Be Beautiful</i> may have defined the Red Stars Theory as the premier purveyors     of indie dream-rock, complete with lingering effects, languid guitars,     laid-back grooves and a full-time violinist. But damned if it won't be a long     time before respected indie kit-rocker Jeremiah Green isn't mentioned within     seconds of the band's name.</p>
<p>Now that all that's out of the way, let's talk about their second, and latest,     self-titled EP.  It's comprised of two out-of-print releases-- a Deluxe Records     10"" and a 7"" from RxRemedy-- both recorded by Calvin Johnson way back in the     group's infancy in 1995.  It represents the earlier sound that followed through     the band's 1997 debut, <i>But Sleep Came Slowly</i>, if more guitar-based and     less dynamic than the stratospheric tones introduced on their sophomore effort.     While not new by any means, newborn Theory-heads everywhere can solace in the     fact that these long-unavailable tracks are finally seeing the light of day     again.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this release seems as if it could be suitable only for those     completists.  The EP opens with the original recording of ""Broken Neck,"" the     final version of which can be found on <i>But Sleep Came Slowly</i>. Granted,     it's a pretty good song, as the version on the LP proves with a much fuller     sound and tighter instrumentation. But like the rest of the tracks here, it     sounds thin and flat; although not lo-fi enough to warrant pigeonholing, it     nonetheless comes across as muddled and lifeless, utilizing only the dead     center of the EQ spectrum.</p>
<p>The following three tracks from the 10"" drudge along at a similar slow,     middling pace. Bertram's vocals whine just a little more than usual, sometimes     crossing the thin line between endearingly nasal and intolerable.  It's hard     to recommend something when the only moment that truly gets your attention is     a brutally incompetent and mercifully brief guitar ""solo"" in the middle of the     instrumental ""Think Piece."" Not even Green's drumming is particularly     noteworthy.</p>
<p>The record closes with the two tracks from the 7"", distinguishable in sound     from the previous four only by slightly increased tempo and slightly harsher     guitars. ""Castle Rock"" contains the best moment thus far, a brief passage     with a snare cadence, whispered vocals, and slick lead guitar, which appears     to save it from being a clone of the preceding song. But then it segues into     its final minute-long segment, which begins dissonantly and gradually becomes     increasingly more so, ending the EP on a painful note.</p>
<p>Currently, Red Stars Theory's best release is <i>Life in a Bubble</i>. Bertram     stays off the microphone more than usual, letting the subdued, harmonizing     guitars, lilting violins, and Green's masterful beats speak for themselves.     This EP is not a good introduction to their work for the uninitiated, and     hardly essential for fans of their later output. Hardcore completists, if they     indeed exist, will buy it no matter what. For the rest... hell, just listen     to your Modest Mouse records.</p></div>"|6726.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6726-ep-2001/|4.6|Spencer Owen

    amounts to at least a half century in dance-pop artist years.  The myriad
    foxy chanteuse/keyboardist/producer collectives perform in a sphere that's
    so reliant on trends, they're practically tattooed with expiration dates (as
    per their contracts).  And when they fade, these radio-friendly ""club"" artists
    take their tunes with them.  Try, for example, to hum a Black Box song.  Shit,
    try to remember the name of a Black Box song.  It's hard, you know?</p><p>
    Saint Etienne have deftly escaped the clutches of obscurity.  Mainmen Bob
    Stanley and Pete Wiggs have nipped and tucked their once dancefloor-tailored
    sound over the years.  The band's first distinct departure came with 1998's
    <i>Good Humor</i>, a relatively organic, charming pop record.  And though
    further departures were expected, <i>The Sound of Water</i> was a mini-ambush.
    Their lavishly orchestrated stomps were distilled into fairly minimal
    compositions founded on the joy derived from the pitter-patter of little
    beats.  With their 60's lounge-pop heroes beaming through their songwriting
    as clearly as ever, <i>The Sound of Water</i> looked like expensive plastic
    surgery.</p><p>
    Now, as a belated follow-up, Saint Etienne offer <i>Interlude</i>, a
    compilation of b-sides, rarities and outtakes recorded during the <i>Water</i>
    sessions.  And, if <i>Water</i> was a Beverly Hills facelift, <i>Interlude</i>,
    is the band deservedly basking in the success of aesthetic revision.  Its best
    moments come with the one-off experiments that propel the band further from
    traditional dance music.</p><p>
    There was no place on <i>The Sound of Water</i> for
    the comparatively dense ""Red Setter,"" a shame since it would have stood out
    as one of the album's finest moments.  There's an impossible lack of tension
    between the song's rhythm (a laconic guitar riff, buried beats, and tentative
    bass), whirling electronic effects, and an astinato three-note piano cluster.
    The ambience is further augmented by vocalist Sarah Cracknell, who can be
    found alternately purring and humming a gorgeously sleepy melody somewhere in
    the middle of the song's thick layers.</p><p>
    The minimal 5 A.M. house of ""Northwestern,"" the deliberate, piano-based torch
    ballad, ""Thank You,"" and the virtually solo acoustic ""Mountain Rain"" are all
    perfect examples of Saint Etienne's success in restraint.  But songs this
    sparse give Cracknell's thin and occasionally flat voice more responsibility
    than it carried on pre-<i>Water</i> releases.  Though she doesn't compensate
    with overwhelming personality like, say, Deborah Harry, her airy vapidity is
    a fine fit for the music's dreamy tone.</p><p>
    Because <i>Interlude</i> is assembled from previously tossed-out material, a
    few scabs slip in.  The French-sung ""Le Ballade de Saint Etienne"" features a
    churning beat so reminiscent of Enigma, it could as easily have been titled
    ""Dullness, Pt. 1.""  The remixes tacked on to the end of the disc are far too
    beat-happy and uncreative to feel at home anywhere without a liquor license;
    <i>Sound of Water</i>'s ""Boy is Crying"" is revamped as an inane, pumped-up,
    beat-heavy romp, and Trouser Enthusiast's eight-minute tech-house remix of
    <i>Good Humor</i>'s ""Lose That Girl"" comes off as little more than pulsating
    regression.</p><p>
    With each release, Saint Etienne seem more eager to prove that they're more
    than just a dance act that digs the 60's.  They've almost completed work on
    their sixth proper album that Wiggs reveals will be ""seven times better"" in
    <i>Interlude</i>'s liner notes.  Yeah, this kind of cockiness is irritating,
    but it shows that Saint Etienne's members realize they have a lot to live
    up to.  Really, the next record could be only 1\xBD times as good as <i>Interlude</i>,
    and would still be momentous.</p></div>"|6972.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6972-interlude/|7.8|Richard M. Juzwiak

The Wilsons, the Jacksons,
    the Osmonds-- all have reached high enough levels of scandal and interest to
    warrant poorly-acted TV miniseries.  Now, I'm not privy to the inner workings
    of the Oldham musical clan, but I doubt we can expect to see part one of <i>The
    Oldhams</i> on ABC any time soon.  Sure, brother Will sings songs about drugs,
    screwed up relationships, and sodomizing everything under the sun.  But those
    are just songs.  To meet the publicity requirements necessary for a six-hour
    block on primetime, you need a genuinely screwed up family dynamic. And, in
    terms of outward appearances, the Oldhams seem a surprisingly functional unit.
    Brothers Will, Paul, and Ned tour together, record together, and produce each
    other's records.  It's all very Disney, aside from the songs about cocks.</p><p>
    
    Whether or not the Oldham family are ""Seventh Heaven"" material, they sure have
    managed to turn out a bunch of kickass records over the past decade, due in no
    small part to the laidback, familial tone that's practically become a trademark.
    This, the first full-length from Ned Oldham's Anomoanon project that doesn't
    center around the interpretation of children's classics, is another fine record
    in the Oldham tradition of slightly country-inflected folk-rock. All those
    Oldham signatures-- shaky vocal harmonies, sloppy lead guitar, persistent
    mid-tempos-- are here in abundance.</p><p>
    
    ""Going to the Sea"" opens <i>The Anomoanon</i> on a pleasant, sing along-y note.
    Ned Oldham's voice, which will be familiar to those of you with any old Palace
    Brothers records, has all the quiver of Neil Young with none of the nasal whine,
    making it both expressive and listenable.  This track, like the rest of the
    album's better tracks, achieves an instantly likable laid-back groove, like a
    porchfront family jam session with flawless, crisp production.</p><p>
    
    Sadly, the sheer goodness of ""Going to the Sea"" is not to be frequently matched.
    The next track, ""Flock,"" sees the band indulging too greatly in their loose
    approach to writing and recording.  Aram Stith does his best to keep the song
    afloat with twangy lead guitar, but when the Oldhams lose track of the song
    itself and slip into an aimless jam session, it's more akin to a Phish concert
    than authentic backwoods Appalachian folk.</p><p>
    
    Since <i>The Anomoanon</i> is a fairly coherent album, the primary elements
    separating each track come down to subtle songwriting elements. ""Window (I
    Can't See Past The),"" the record's best track, pairs a sufficiently diverse
    song structure with a hauntingly beautiful melody, ranking among the better
    tracks in the Palace catalog.  Sadly, the rest of <i>The Anomoanon</i> has
    trouble finding such focus.</p><p>
    
    When all is said and done, <i>The Anomoanon</i> is a damned solid folk-rock
    record. But unlike past offerings from the Brothers Palace, it ends the minute
    the music stops.  There's no ethereal murmur, no haunting whisper to stay with
    you and extend the album's reach beyond five inches of plastic.  Still, it's
    clear that <i>The Anomoanon</i> isn't meant to be the kind of intense listening
    experience we've come to expect from these guys. Instead, it's the sound of
    friends and brothers loosening up, knocking a couple back, and enjoying what
    they do best. Not exactly miniseries material, but certainly the makings of a
    good record.</p></div>"|202.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/202-the-anomoanon/|7.7|Matt LeMay

    to be known as ""post-rock."" In order for music to be considered anthemic, it
    has to work in big, sweeping gestures. Big, pounding rhythms, soaring melodies,
    powerful arrangements-- these are the things of American anthems. Up until now,
    most post-rock has featured none of these elements. The melodies-- when there
    are coherent melodies-- are usually sparse and minimalist, and far from
    hummable.  Rhythms are complex and jerky, and difficult to tap out with only
    two feet.  Vocals, which are rare, are generally languid; try to imagine Brian
    McMahan singing ""The Star Spangled Banner"" without lulling 10,000 grunting
    sports fans into a deep sleep.</p><p>
    It seems remarkably appropriate that Tortoise, perhaps the most vital architects
    of the post-rock genre, would be responsible for its greatest advancement
    since its inception. <i>Standards</i>, the group's fourth full-length, takes
    their already adventurous sound into brave new terrain, exploring previously
    unknown dimensions of sonic depth and expressiveness.  Not only is it the most
    acoustically enthralling album they've released, it's also without a doubt the
    most playful, dynamic, and anthemic post-rock album that has been released to
    date.</p><p>
    I credit much of the increased fun factor on <i>Standards</i> to the more
    dominant role of guitarist Jeff Parker, whose work with Isotope 217 has proven
    that he's not only startlingly proficient, but also funny-- and funky. Though
    Parker's presence was a welcome addition to the band on <i>TNT</i>, he seems
    to have really come into his own as a band member on <i>Standards</i>, and his
    versatile guitar stylings not only breathe new life into Tortoise's sound, they
    also provide the kind of melodic centerpiece that previous recordings have at
    times lacked.</p><p>
    But to give Parker the preponderance of the credit for the more playful,
    exploratory nature of <i>Standards</i> would be unfair; <i>Standards</i> is
    the sound of a whole band fully embracing their influences. Over the course
    of the album, one can hear echoes of such diverse sources as Miles Davis, Tom
    Zé, Jimi Hendrix, Philip Glass, Suicide, Brian Eno, Parliament, and spaghetti
    westerns and sci-fi flicks alike.  But what makes this album truly impressive
    is the depth with which the five members of Tortoise approach the amalgamation
    of these complex sources.  Rather than simply cutting and pasting superficial
    elements from a variety of genres, <i>Standards</i> sees the band truly
    reveling in the sounds of their influences. As the fucked up American flag on
    the record's cover suggests, Tortoise has taken this record as an opportunity
    to revisit an entire history of American music-- from jazz through dance and
    electronica-- and reshape it into an permutation of their own.</p><p>
    Appropriately, <i>Standards</i> kicks off with a bang: the unrestrained,
    gorgeous blast of noise that opens its first track, ""Seneca."" As John McEntire
    wails on his drumkit even more aggressively than he did in his wild Bastro
    days, Jeff Parker's guitar intones a simple, highly melodic riff. The phrasing,
    and the explosive energy of McEntire's playing, leaves these few simple notes
    sounding utterly huge. After this pattern repeats, ""Seneca"" metamorphoses into
    a more complex, but equally dynamic track, that combines all the tenets of the
    traditional post-rock sound with some tasty new extras. As the beautiful chaos
    of the song's intro fades away, McEntire chimes in with what is perhaps the
    single most compelling beat he has produced over the course of his career,
    every bit as primal as it is astoundingly complex.</p><p>
    With such diverse sonic elements as handclaps, backwards distorted guitars and,
    yes, vibraphones, ""Seneca,"" like many other tracks on <i>Standards</i>,
    succeeds in expanding the traditional post-rock sound. ""Eros"" follows, building
    upon a foundation of Latin-tinged percussion and a thick bass groove with
    intermittent sonar blips, spastic, squelching analog synth, and wah-wah
    guitar. As with the best of Tortoise, these tracks can be enjoyed on many
    levels, but when listened to carefully, they reveal seemingly infinite sonic
    treasures.</p><p>
    The latter half of <i>Standards</i> sees Tortoise breaking even farther away
    from the trappings of traditional post-rock. ""Blackjack,"" one of the album's
    many high points, combines a guitar melody that could have been lifted directly
    off of a '60s Morricone score with high-pitched dance synthesizers and a
    straightforward, commanding beat. Whereas most of the tracks on <i>TNT</i>
    were written in the studio, and often fell victim to a high aimless noodling
    factor, the band composed most of <i>Standards</i> ahead of time, and as a
    result, ""Blackjack,"" along with the other nine songs on the album, are
    beautifully structured, and develop flawlessly from beginning to end.</p><p>
    Tortoise has always been a band that thrives on subtlety.  With <i>Standards</i>,
    they've finally managed to arrange those subtleties to form broad, bold sonic
    outlines.  As a result, this record is by far the most intense, compelling,
    and memorable Tortoise has released to date.  With its potent combination of
    the powerhouse wallop of rock and roll and the aural intricacy of jazz,
    minimalism, and electronica, <i>Standards</i> serves as the first Tortoise
    album that's every bit as exciting as it is intriguing.</p></div>"|8114.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8114-standards/|9.2|Matt LeMay

    class conditions, there are a few intriguing similarities between America's
    folk music tradition and Britain's folk music tradition. American folk music
    traditionally addresses death, violence, poverty, and sex. British folk music
    traditionally addresses death, violence, royalty and sex (with cool accents).</p><p>
    
    Appendix Out frontman Alasdair ""Ali"" Roberts is frequently referred to as the
    ""British Will Oldham."" Taking into account the parallels between the musical
    traditions upon which Oldham is building and the musical traditions upon which
    Roberts is building, this statement seems markedly accurate. Lyrically,
    American folk music is a decidedly rougher affair than a good deal of English
    folk music. Will Oldham sings about cocks; Alasdair Roberts sings about
    ""nightshade.""  And yet, musically and lyrically, one gets a sense that both
    Oldham and Roberts are lovers of their respective countries' musical
    histories.</p><p>
    
    Further comparisons between the two singers can be drawn simply because the
    two have very similar voices. Alasdair Roberts never attempts the kind of
    loud, high-pitched yelps that Oldham has been known to let loose. Indeed,
    Appendix Out seems to rely much more heavily on subdued, meditative beauty
    than on pure, raw emotion.  Thankfully, the comparison is completely valid
    where it matters most-- <i>The Night is Advancing</i> is an excellent,
    stirring, and deeply affecting album.</p><p>
    
    ""A Path to Our Beds"" sets the tone for the record, with acoustic guitars
    swirling in stereo, a lilting bassline, and a constant, hypnotic drumbeat.
    Ali Roberts' voice is warm and appealing, but quavers with a hint of
    awkwardness. It stays at a near-mumble throughout <i>The Night is Advancing</i>,
    adding to the overall spare and lovely tone of the record.</p><p>
    
    Many songs on <i>The Night is Advancing</i> are obviously deeply rooted in the
    British folk tradition. ""The Groves of Lebanon,"" one of the most stunningly
    gorgeous tracks on the album, contains highly folk-inflected lines like,
    ""Your hair is like a royal tapestry/ Fragrant as the groves of Lebanon.""
    Again, the backing is provided largely by acoustic guitar and muffled drums
    and bass. But while the album is highly steeped in the folk music tradition,
    it doesn't limit itself to the conventional instruments of folk. Throughout
    the album, faint flourishes of electronics and keyboards can be heard. These
    elements remain slightly buried within the songs themselves, allowing them to
    enhance without ever intruding.</p><p>
    
    Perhaps the most impressive track on <i>The Night is Advancing</i> is one of
    its most uncharacteristic, the 7+ minute ""Fortified Jackdaw Grove,"" a haunting
    epic built upon oft-dissonant, jazzy piano, and an extended bass drone. Horns
    squeal almost agonizingly, mimicking the uncertainty of Roberts' voice. As the
    track nears its fifth minute, a strange drumbeat enters the mix, contrasting
    the still-present piano, and completely altering the feel of the track. It's
    a moment of musical near-perfection, and certainly suggests that Appendix Out
    are often at their best when they incorporate some pretty out-there song
    structures into their largely traditional music.</p><p>
    
    So perhaps the Oldham comparison isn't entirely accurate-- <i>The Night is
    Advancing</i> is a much more meditative, deliberate affair than something
    Oldham would release. Thus, <i>The Night is Advancing</i> is an album that
    won't necessarily knock your socks off, but will certainly leave you feeling
    cozy and warm in them.</p></div>"|245.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/245-the-night-is-advancing/|8.3|Matt LeMay

    addiction. Since the beginning of the 7th grade, cup after cup of piping-hot
    coffee has allowed me to pull all-nighters while retaining a moderate degree
    of awareness, maintain a degree of sociability at late-night events, and
    overcome general lethargy in nearly all cases.</p><p>
    
    So, I figured, what better way to prep myself up for the new release from the
    Japancakes than a coffee binge? After all, I was certainly expecting the
    record to be dull-- perhaps a few hundred milligrams of sweet, sweet caffeine
    would make it go by faster.</p><p>
    
    A good three to four heaping cups of brown gold later, I set about listening
    to <i>The Sleepy Strange</i>, ready to take in whatever the band had lined up
    for me. I wasn't expecting much, though-- their recent EP, <i>Down the
    Elements</i> proved once and for all that when your goal boils down to being
    as boring as possible, success equals failure. But I was willing to give the
    group a chance.  After all, the idea of a ""subtle jam music"" is at least
    slightly intriguing. Combining this with the fact that I'd just consumed a
    large quantity of coffee, I was even-- dare I say-- optimistic?</p><p>
    
    Within the opening ten seconds of <i>The Sleepy Strange</i>, however, all the
    awful memories of <i>Down the Elements</i>, which had been conveniently
    crammed into my subconscious, came pouring back.  And there still were 49
    minutes ahead.</p><p>
    
    For the lucky individuals who have never heard Japancakes, let me offer a
    brief synopsis: Basically, the band grew out of an impromptu, unrehearsed
    jam session in which ""mistakes"" became ""melody."" Apparently, though, none of
    the band members are particularly prone to mistakes; my greatest gripe with
    Japancakes is that there's no discernible melody at all.  This isn't
    necessarily a bad thing.  I listen to plenty of music which could be called
    ""non-melodic."" But the ultimate failure of Japancakes is that their music
    just begs for a melody.  I mean, repetitive instrumentals can be excellent if
    crammed with enough variety to keep you guessing, or even with just enough
    subtlety to keep you entranced.  But Japancakes have none of those qualities.</p><p>
    
    They do, however, have what sounds like a lap steel, and they're not afraid
    to use it. The awkward, faux-twang does add a more organic feel to an album
    suffering from cheap, synthesized quasi-melodies, but even that winds up
    being bogged down in the drony crap stew that is <i>The Sleepy Strange</i>.</p><p>
    
    While it is by no means a good album, <i>The Sleepy Strange</i> is a small
    step up from its brain atrophy-inducing predecessor. On the album's closer,
    ""Vinyl Fever,"" the band almost attains a tight, Tortoise-esque instrumental
    groove. But after over 40 minutes of boredom and frustration, odds are the
    album will most likely be occupying a precious spot in your septic tank before
    you get there.</p><p>
    
    Another cautionary warning: never, ever listen to Japancakes when you're
    hopped up on coffee or other stimulants. As this album went on, the caffeinated
    blood running through my veins began to boil in anticipation of something,
    <i>anything</i> interesting to happen. After just a few songs, I was felt a
    bit like a fox caught in a trap, ready to gnaw my own ears off if I could.</p><p>
    
    Luckily, I avoided the severe neck trauma of attempted ear-biting, and just
    turned off the album. After about an hour of relaxation, with intermittent
    listens to Max Tundra's <i>Some Best Friend You Turned Out to Be</i> to
    remind me just how exhilarating music can be, I gave the album a few more
    listens. And while I no longer found myself fighting off self-destructive
    urges, <i>The Sleepy Strange</i> was still every bit as frustrating and
    monotonous. Once again, Japancakes have lived up to their name: as accessible
    as Japan, and flat as a pancake.</p></div>"|4205.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4205-the-sleepy-strange/|4.9|Matt LeMay

    performance intrigued me. I watched him hunch over his mic and breathe his
    raspy, smoke-stained vocals. His vocal partner in crime Martina Topley Bird
    crooned seductively, and his band rhapsodized his unique take on trip-hop.
    I watched astounded, enveloped by the layers of sound emanating from my small
    television speakers.  I immediately scrambled to pick up <i>Maxinquaye</i>,
    his 1995 debut.</p><p>
    
    It soon became one of my all-time favorites. <i>Maxinquaye</i> was a strong,
    cohesive, brilliant, unpaved road of a record, filled with clattering,
    arrhythmic beats, haunting vocal interplay, and a dark and dismal atmosphere
    that still gives me goosebumps with every listen. In 1998, I got a copy of
    <i>Angels with Dirty Faces</i> during my internship at a now-defunct
    alternative radio station here in Los Angeles. While not as groundbreaking as
    <i>Maxinquaye</i>, it was certainly more focused than 1996's somewhat
    scattershot <i>Pre-Millennium Tension</i>.  Far from a let-down, the album
    left me hope for the future of Tricky's musical landscape.</p><p>
    
    But 1999's <i>Juxtapose</i> was a significant step down.  While probably
    worthwhile record for those that prefer Tricky's hip-hop material, it seemed
    largely inessential for a fan of his more creative output.  Even at its best,
    <i>Juxtapose</i> played like straightforward rap/hip-hop incorporating a more
    watered-down <i>Angels</i> backdrop and uninspired rhymes.  It didn't help
    that Martina, such an essential element in Tricky's earlier, better work,
    was nowhere to be found on the album.  I hoped this would only be a brief,
    <i>Pre-Millennium</i>-style detour.</p><p>
    
    Fortunately, I was half right.  But only half.  I was optimistic that his new
    EP could signal a return to the creativity of <i>Maxinquaye</i>, or at least
    to that of <i>Angels with Dirty Faces</i>. The four-song <i>Mission
    Accomplished</i> EP, however, took this naive assumption of mine, threw it to
    the ground, and kicked it with steel-toed boots while shouting degrading
    insults at it.  As exaggerated as I may sound right now, I need only describe
    the unoriginality of the record's opening title track to back my claims.</p><p>
    
    Tricky utilizes (read: rips off) the main riff of the <i>Mission: Impossible</i>
    theme-- a song which has already been retooled to fit 4/4 rock/pop formats at
    least twice on a mainstream level over the past four years-- and retools it to
    fit a 4/4 rock/pop format. He then whispers nearly unintelligibly along with
    this for just over three minutes. Some of the vocals make cliches out of his
    past work (he even says ""brand new, retro,"" as in ""Brand New You're Retro""
    from <i>Maxinquaye</i>), though the majority simply consists of a repetition
    of the chorus of Peter Gabriel's ""Big Time."" Word for word, note for note.
    And with no hope for relief until it finally and mercifully ends.</p><p>
    
    The next two tracks feature rapper Lynx, who rhymes about, well, probably sex,
    and some other things I can't possibly make out through his abominable,
    incoherent stylings. And to continue Tricky's newfound tradition of
    carbon-copying the already prosaic and mundane, he even reuses one of the
    drum loops from ""Mission Accomplished"" as the primary beat for ""Crazy Claws.""</p><p>
    
    The only track out of the bunch worth half a listen-- at best-- is ""Divine
    Comedy,"" an alternate version of ""Money Greedy,"" one of <i>Angels with Dirty
    Faces</i>' strongest tracks.  Here, Tricky and his cohorts endlessly rip on
    his former record company, repeating ""Polygram!/ Fucking niggers..."" quite a
    few times. This may or may not seem amusing initially; either way, it quickly
    becomes pointless and monotonous.</p><p>
    
    I've listened to this EP twice; that's once more than I would have ever liked
    to have heard it, give or take one listen.  <i>Mission Accomplished</i> nearly
    destroys all hopes I once held for Tricky's future. I could dream about the
    next <i>Maxinquaye</i>, or even the next <i>Angels</i>.  But sadly, my hopeful,
    innocent wishes have already been beaten senseless. Alas, Tricky, I hardly
    knew ye.</p></div>"|8154.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8154-mission-accomplished-ep/|2.0|Spencer Owen

    desired object. If you want a piece of iron that looks like a human
    foot, you need a mold with empty space shaped like a human foot. It's
    obvious-- as the material is cast, matter becomes space and space
    becomes matter. This image comes to mind as I listen to Jan Jelinek's
    <i>Loop-finding-jazz-records</i>; this album is like hearing the mold
    used to cast proper pop. It's a perfect inversion of conventional music,
    a sonic negative. Everything that would typically be foreground is moved
    back or pushed off the screen altogether, and the flecks of sonic debris
    that would normally be covered by other sounds are left to carry the
    melody and rhythm.</p><p>
    
    These thoughts came to me the first time I heard ""Do Dekor,"" which I
    would swear is the negative image used to imprint the ""AFX Fast Mix"" of
    Seefeel's ""Time to Find Me."" The rhythm is just as relentless (and
    nearly identical, beat-wise), but Jelinek's percussion of choice is not
    drums or even a drum machine, but tiny rips of static pasted into place.
    Taking the same idea even further is ""Them, Their"" which uses a single
    microscopic click as a substitute for a snare drum, as the full bass
    outlines a funky rhythm a half tick from hip-hop, and dreamy out-of-tune
    keyboards seem lifted from some distant memory. It's so computerized it
    hurts.  And yes, it's fucking gorgeous.</p><p>
    
    The title here is meaningless, a joke coming from a guy who named a
    track on one of his records (under his Farben alias) ""Live at the Hollywood
    Bowl."" Some of the noises here may well have been sourced from jazz records,
    but you'd never know it. Besides, the palette here is similar to Jelinek's
    last album as Gramm, even though the goals are quite different. Gramm's
    <i>personal_rock</i> (which you should definitely check out if this record
    interests you) was more intent on exploring Jelinek's microsound ideas
    in the context of 4/4 dance rhythms-- something <i>Loop-finding-jazz-records</i>
    only touches on with ""Rock in the Video Age"" and ""Tendency."" With these
    tracks, Jelinek works territory similar to Wolfgang Voight's Gas project,
    anchoring his amorphous textures with the familiar house groove. The bulk
    of <i>Loop-finding-jazz-records</i> is given over to a more idiosyncratic
    pulse, which sheds more light on what Jelinek is doing with his peculiar
    mixing ideas.</p><p>
    
    That Jelinek would create his deep anti-pop for Stefan Betke's ~scape
    label makes sense, as Pole is definitely the most apparent reference
    point. Though his ideas are similar to a degree, Jelinek has far surpassed
    Betke in terms of expressiveness. Among the current spate of glitch artists,
    Germany's Jelinek designs his tracks with an ear for emotion. Part of this
    comes from the textures he chooses, which veer toward the liquid and
    organic, and part of it has to do with the manner in which Jelinek operates.
    The natural inclination with music this minute and detailed is to pay very
    close attention to the individual sounds, and a palpable intimacy emerges
    from the listener's proximity. Call me what you will, but I find this album
    to be incredibly sensual. It's like lying naked in a bed of freshly washed
    flannel sheets, rolling back and forth, feeling massaged by every strand of
    cotton. This is the real digital love, baby.</p></div>"|4234.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4234-loop-finding-jazz-records/|9.3|Mark Richard-San

The Beatles, the Sex Pistols, the
    Velvet Underground, the Replacements, Television, the Stooges, and Eddie
    and the Cruisers all acknowledged their own death knells and instinctively
    grasped when to pack it in.</p><p>
    
    Of course, we all know what happens to the bands that linger on in the face
    of old age: these human relics become live nostalgia acts sharing double
    bills with Dylan's kids, or hobbling into the studio every two years leaking
    geezer-drool like <i>Pop</i>, <i>Voodoo Lounge</i> and <i>Two Against Nature</i>.
    Then again, there are always more demented geriatric tendencies: inexplicably
    befriending Burt Bacharach, hiring underfunded symphony orchestras, or even
    teaching adult education courses such as ""How to Make It in the Rock Biz.""</p><p>
    
    Sadly, Luna seems like just another once-great, now-aging band enduring a
    slow disintegration, and thus sorely in need of the proverbial ""bitter
    break-up."" After being dropped by Elektra subsequent to 1997's non-million
    selling <i>Pup Tent</i>, they've been floating in artistic limbo without
    even a permanent label to call home.</p><p>
    
    Original drummer Stanley Demeski is long gone, as is bassist Justin Harwood.
    Dean Wareham is trying his hand at acting. Sean Eden has a side project
    called the Weeds of Eden. And unfortunately, Luna live shows are simply not
    as thrilling as they once were. Besides, Dean just isn't all that funny
    anymore. Where's all the witty between-song chatter? Is it really enough to
    say, ""Thanks!"" and ""Are you guys French?"" Not to mention that the band's
    cover of the iconic 80's white-trash anthem, ""Sweet Child O' Mine,"" only
    retains its knee-slapping Ivy League irony for one listen, if that.</p><p>
    
    In the mid-90's just after the release of the critically lauded <i>Penthouse</i>,
    Luna were at their peak, both as a live unit and studio band.  After having
    spent years on the road opening for everyone from the briefly reunited Velvet
    Underground to the Cocteau Twins, Wareham and Eden's inspired guitar synergy
    began to achieve a surprising intensity in concert.  In fact, the band often
    achieved a rare quality musicologists often refer to as ""rocking.""</p><p>
    
    Lately, Luna's been touring incessantly without writing much new material. I
    guess they figured, hey, why not play live in support of a live album?
    Logical.  So, Luna released this no-big-deal live affair on the Brooklyn-based
    Arena Rock Records, as a partial justification of their continued existence as
    semi-functional band. Sadly, the album is a few years too late in coming. As
    an example, the guys, while opening for Lou Reed sometime back in 1996, pulled
    off an amazing rendition of the Velvets' ""Ride into the Sun"" with Reed and
    Wareham handling the vocals together.  Where were all the tape recorders back
    then?</p><p>
    
    On <i>Live</i>, Dean sings with a tired and less charming sort of
    ""let's get this over with"" detachment. Sean Eden's guitar lacks the creative
    spark it once had, as he now plays second-fiddle to Wareham as a soloist--
    although Eden does manage to gets away with rambling Tom Verlaine mimicry
    during the endless guitar break in ""23 Minutes in Brussels.""</p><p>
    
    Oddly though, Wareham seems to be in top form as a lead guitarist.  He turns
    in some great scratch-acid wah-wah playing and other effects-enhanced
    psychedelic fuzz-outs.  The understated lines on ""Tiger Lily,"" and the loose,
    extended workouts on ""Friendly Advice"" channel the ghost of Sterling Morrison.
    He even gives a little history lesson to Luna fans with a rare Galaxie 500
    live cut, ""4th of July.""  But-- speaking of friendly advice-- you might want
    to do yourself a favor and ignore the newer songs included here: ""Hello Little
    One,"" and ""4000 Days.""  They only serve to suggest that Wareham will probably
    never write another ""Slash Your Tires.""</p><p>
    
    New bassist Britta Phillips doesn't play with the authority that Justin
    Harwood did, but she's easier to look at. And hearing her speak French during
    the band's sexy cover of Serge Gainsbourg's ""Bonnie and Clyde"" just may be
    the only known aural cure for erectile dysfunction.</p><p>
    
    Still, don't expect some stratospheric <i>Live at Leeds</i>-evoking
    performance.  Then again, <i>Live</i> isn't as dismal a live affair as
    many of the historic failed live albums of the last thirty years: the Stones'
    criminal <i>Flashpoint</i>, the notorious 1971 <i>Chicago IV</i> recorded at
    Carnegie Hall, and 1976's <i>Wings over America</i>.</p><p>
    
    So, if you're already in the habit of buying Luna albums, may as well add this
    to your collection.  If you reside in Greenland or Antarctica, and don't get
    to see the band play much, <i>Live</i> is adequately representative of
    what the band sounds like onstage in front of an animate audience.  I guess
    it's at least worth pinching from your local multimedia megamart.</p></div>"|4916.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4916-live/|5.8|Michael Sandlin

    Malkovich</i> entitled <i>Being Stephen Malkmus</i>-- that credit goes to
    weblogger Adam Kempa, although he neglected to take the concept to its
    logical extreme and consider the ramifications of Malkmus going through
    his own portal. Of course, one would expect there'd be a lot of ""Malkmus
    Malkmus Malkmus. Malkmus? Malkmus, Malkmus!""-type carrying on, but the
    punchline would have to be that he'd actually <i>enjoy</i> the experience,
    so much so that he'd abandon Pavement and the rest of the outside world to
    stay in there, maybe form a band with other himselves, and record an album
    called, oh, I don't know, <i>Stephen Malkmus</i>.</p><p>
    
    I won't presume to be able to gauge how much influence Malkmus' new bandmates
    (Portland gadabouts Joanna Bolme and John Moen) had on this, his eponymous
    solo debut; anyway, it's his name and mug plastered on the album's cover, so
    he's going to get the majority of praise and blame.</p><p>
    
    There are two immediately apparent differences between <i>Stephen Malkmus</i>
    and Pavement's catalog: First and least surprisingly, there's less of a group
    dynamic. It definitely has the sonic hallmarks of a ""solo"" album-- the
    songs are less jammy and spontaneous, more rigidly structured. Second, it's a
    lot more fun-sounding than Pavement was near the end of its shelf-life. Let's
    face it, Pavement hadn't really sounded ""fun"" since <i>Wowee Zowee</i>--
    <i>Brighten the Corners</i> and <i>Terror Twilight</i> had occasional moments
    of playfulness, but on the whole they were considerably more sober, bordering
    on ponderous.</p><p>
    
    As Malkmus has noted in interviews, this increasing lack of fun was one
    important factor in Pavement's dissolution; now having escaped from the
    handcuffs of ""band""-dom, the solo Malkmus is savoring his freedom, the spring
    back in his step.  He's not indulging in that freedom to the extent that he
    would confound all expectations and, say, record an album of Swedish reggae;
    <i>Stephen Malkmus</i> is Stephen Malkmus as Stephen Malkmus, splitting time
    (as always) between smirky loopiness and wistful melancholy. The whimsy
    factor may have been turned way up, but Malkmus spends his time on the album
    learning how to focus that whimsy towards specific ends, not just for its own
    sake.</p><p>
    
    If Pavement fans were grinding their teeth over the prospect of <i>Stephen
    Malkmus</i> being a flop, the first single, ""Discretion Grove"", didn't help
    matters much. It's about as MOR a song as he's ever written (with the exception
    of, perhaps, ""Major Leagues""), chugging along mindlessly when it should be
    building toward a more satisfying climax. Also in the less-than-desirable
    category is ""Jo Jo's Jacket"", a prime example of Malkmus at his least
    appealing. In what is ostensibly a song about Yul Brynner, he doesn't do much
    beyond tack a sample of a Brynner interview at the beginning and namecheck
    <i>Westworld</i>, abandoning the subject matter entirely by the second verse
    and freestyling his way to the end. Let's be clear about something: songs about
    nothing in particular are fine if done right, as are songs about specific
    subjects, but switching between the two formats doesn't speak well of properly
    realized intentions.</p><p>
    
    Fortunately, Malkmus doesn't let his whimsy get the better of him elsewhere on
    the album; ""Phantasies"" is so unremittingly goony with its annoying samples,
    rubbery guitar and gratuitous falsettos that I can't help but love it.
    Likewise, ""Troubbble""'s farting keyboards and guitar spasms make it a quick
    spurt of inspired head-bobbery.  Ever since ""Zurich is Stained"" and ""Here"",
    I've always preferred Malkmus' achier, laid-back songs, of which this album
    has an abundance: ""Church on White"" is a lush, tender tribute to a deceased
    friend, and ""Deado"" and ""Trojan Curfew"" balance sublime, shimmery beauty with
    gentle humor.</p><p>
    
    Malkmus' biggest departure from his work with Pavement, however, lies in ""The
    Hook"" and ""Jenny and the Ess-Dog"", where he puts his gift for non-sequitur
    detail in the employ of an actual storyline. I've heard some people describe
    ""The Hook"" as Malkmus' ""Lou Reed song,"" which seems sort of appropriate given
    his speak-sing delivery and deceptively simple, classic-sounding guitar solo.
    Naturally, it's a song about pirates, and an unromantic one at that: ""We had
    no wooden legs or steel hooks/ We had no black eyepatches or a starving cook/
    We were just killers with the cold eyes of a sailor."" ""Jenny and the Ess-Dog""
    unrolls a relationship between a young rich girl and an older slacker; the
    song's resolution initially feels like a shrug, with the things between them
    sputtering out when she goes off to college.  But it speaks to something
    deeper about relationships as a temporary escape from the expectations of
    real life, and the eventual obligation to face ""real life"" again, albeit with
    a slightly different perspective.</p><p>
<i>Stephen Malkmus</i> is a more coherent album than any one Pavement release,
    which can be seen as both a good and bad quality. There's less variation
    between the songs in terms of structure, but it's the minor tweaks to the
    sound that are the things to savor-- the ghostly sample that ties together
    ""Deado"", the silly but completely apropos steel drum bit on ""Vague Space"",
    the flute that swoops through the snarling trudge of ""Black Book"".  Malkmus
    has regained his songwriting stride, and he sounds more confident than he's
    been in a long time. There aren't as many extremes or chances taken as some
    Pavement fans might like; it's not ""important"" or ""groundbreaking,"" and it

    voices while reviewing. There's the simple, straightforward, credulous
    voice of the listener, who takes bands, songs and packages at face value.
    As a counter check, there's a savvier, hipper voice that considers music
    a constructed, made-up thing, sold to us by bands and manufacturers through
    advertising, press buzz and the ever-enticing promise of press photos.
    And, finally, there's a purely contrarian voice that plays devil's advocate,
    finding the easy path and countering it at every turn.</p><p>
 This kind of intrapersonal debating occurs with every release, but rages
    almost uncontrollably in the instance of a talked-up offering. Because in
    such a case, it becomes so important to keep oneself from being swept up
    in embarrassing critical groundswell without dismissing a record that might
    be good just because someone else likes it. Case in point: Doves'
 <i>
  Lost
    Souls
 </i>
 , an album currently coasting on tons of buzz. Follow us as we
    take a look at three different approaches to reviewing the record, while
    revealing the secret tricks of the reviewer's game:</p><p>

   Step One: Snappy, Superficial Introduction
  </i>
</b>
</p><p>
<b>
  Straightforward:
 </b>
 While, in the United States, electronic music is
    considered a new, arty, futuristic medium, it's been a part of the European
    palette for years. While Underworld seem spacy and abstract on these shores,
    they're a legit commercial force for our friends across the sea. What's more,
    techno's such a known quantity across the Atlantic that it's become strictly
    pro forma for any self-respecting rock band to incorporate a little 808 thud
    into their rock and roll mix.
</p>
<p>
<b>
  Cynical:
 </b>
 After the ""electronica"" ""boom"" rose and fell like Keith Flint's
    spiky haircut, all the big fancy record companies-- and the attendant
    faux-raver acts to whom they'd promised the world-- had to find a way to
    shore up their losses. Thus, the awkward shotgun marriage of rock to drum
    machines, resulting in efforts ranging from lovely (Radiohead) to dull
    (Smash Mouth) to bizarre (Rolling Stones produced by the Dust Brothers).
    All in all, the experiment can be deemed a bust.

   Step Two: Introduce the Band
  </i>
</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>
  Straightforward:
 </b>
 A good, if somewhat surprising, example of the Euro
    tech-rock fusion is the debut LP from Doves,
 <i>
  Lost Souls
 </i>
 . Where
    most of the fusing has gone on in the rock camp as aging amp-powered
    dinos struggled for relevance, Doves' effort provides a rare example
    of techno-schooled musicians digging in the crates for inspiration.
    Having made their first splash as a straight-ahead club act called Sub
    Sub, this trio of blokes woodshedded for a long time, started playing
    anachronistic instruments you strummed, plucked and hit, and ended up
    with a collection of damn-near-normal rock songs. Of course, the
    tincture of their throbbing house-kid past lurks in the shadows all
    the same.

 The latest group of cred-hungry beat monsters to cross
    this writer's desk are Doves, a frustratingly non-capitalized or articled
    threesome from the UK. Their record's got everything written in lowercase,
    there's a lot of noiry photos of a boxer, and the damn thing is called
 <i>
  Lost Souls
 </i>
 , all of which reeks of art (or, perhaps more aptly,
    ""ahhht""). Scowling in front of a cityscape, clad in flannel, and sporting
    ridiculous stubblefields on their faces, Doves look like they're running
    as hard as they can from their bow as Sub Sub.  There's a reason the single
    they released under that moniker never made it stateside, and I'm sure it
    had everything to do with the description ""M People-esque,"" which appeared
    in the press kit.

 is nothing if not a sprawling,
    ambitious effort. Padded for U.S. arrival with three bonus tracks, the disc
    stretches out to more than 72 minutes, and I'll be damned if it isn't a solid,
    engaging effort throughout. Where the increased running time of a CD is
    usually more beast than beauty, the breathing room allows Doves to stretch
    out. Few of these tracks weigh in under the five-minute mark, and most of
    their durations are given over to jangling acoustic guitars and mid-tempo
    rhythms that, in places, resemble Mogwai's moments of plaintive contemplation.
</p>
<p>
 Tonally,
 <i>
  Lost Souls
 </i>
 reflects the after-after-midnight hours, as if
    the boys felt the need to document the hung over and blissed-out aftermath
    of the dancing-hours frenzy their Sub Sub days offered listeners years ago.
    That rarest of animals, a singing drummer named Andy Williams, wails
    discontentedly and virtually wordlessly over swelling and receding musical
    themes, while atmospheric keyboards and ominous samplework provide texture
    the barebones acoustic arrangements wouldn't achieve on their own.
</p>
<p>
<b>
  Cynical:
 </b>
 The heart of the problem on
 <i>
  Lost Souls
 </i>
 is its
    overreaching ambition. Naming the first track-- the virtually instrumental
    ""Firesuite""-- after the famous four-song suite from the Beach Boys'
 <i>
  Smile
 </i>
 sessions gives it away instantly. Doves are, in both their tilting and endlessly
    sculpted sounds, after the same instrumental evocations Brian Wilson made and
    destroyed at the peak of his compositional powers. In most principle respects,
    this album is straight, rockist Brit-pop.  But the samples and keyboards serve
    only to dress up fairly conventional songs, as if to conceal their pedestrian
    nature.

 , despite its reach and ambition,
    works best in its most conventionally melodic moments. The aptly named
    ""Melody Calls"" juxtaposes a typically languid vocal against an
    uncharacteristically jaunty guitar riff, and the result is a little
    radio-ready wonder.  Similarly, the title cut's deep, throbbing chords
    work as this melancholy work's catalytic center, distilling the band's
    mixture of atmosphere and song down to a kind of essence.
</p>
<p>
 Among the more adventurous tracks, ""Firesuite"" and ""Break Me Gently"" work
    best because of their carefully planned development and the skillful use
    of heavily effected vocals, which flesh out what could have been almost Dave
    Matthews-sized swaths of dull 'jamming.' But the stately ballad at the end
    of the album proper, ""A House,"" accentuates the songiness of this effort.
    These boys are interested in beauty, power, emotion and feeling. Not idle
    wanking.

    A few women's voices can be heard, stumbling over words, grappling for an
    answer.  The nervous giggles, uh's and um's are then sampled into a lo-fi
    electro sound collage to create the composition Le Tigre call, ""They Want Us
    to Make a Symphony Out of the Sound of Women Swallowing Their Own Tongues.""
    The track, previously heard on last year's <i>Hot Topic</i> UK-only single,
    is the beguiling centerpiece to the band's new EP, <i>From the Desk of Mr.
    Lady</i>.</p><p>
    
    Because Kathleen Hanna has quite admirably never been one to mince words, the
    track's message is a puzzle.  What exactly are ex-Riot Grrl Hanna, videomaker
    Sadie Benning, and zinester Johanna Fateman trying to accomplish with ""Symphony?""
    Is it an attack on the insensitive males who ask stupid questions?  An assault
    on the girls who betray their more noble sisters with stupid answers?  A
    simple reclaiming of voice?</p><p>
    
    The answer to the question is as unclear who the titular ""they"" pertains to.
    The word ""they,"" or ""them,"" frequently has a vilifying connotation, and in
    this respect, it seems like it's the corporate, white, conservative man in
    charge-- we'll call him The Man-- who wants such a track.  But The Man doesn't
    listen to Le Tigre.  If he's heard them, he hates them.  Le Tigre's audience
    is primarily comprised of like-minded, liberal individuals who most likely
    have been listening to Hanna for a while.</p><p>
    
    Of course, it's not without reason that Hanna's audience has stuck with her.
    When fronting Bikini Kill, she aggressively showed off her considerable
    brainpower and a voice as vital as it was abrasive.  Her solo project, Julie
    Ruin, proved her a self-sufficient mastermind of lo-fi electronic bedroom
    recording.  Hell, even last year's debut from Le Tigre, while markedly more
    accessible, was a gem-- a testament to the unlikely fun that can come of
    ""message music.""</p><p>
    
    But it's because of Hanna's sterling past that the new Le Tigre EP seems a
    disappointment.  Previously, Hanna balanced indignant self-righteousness with
    irony and intellect, throwing foul-mouthed temper tantrums laced with wit. She
    took anti-female slurs, wrote them on her stomach and made them her own.  Now,
    she's reclaiming the notoriously anti-feminist comic strip character Cathy,
    who's pictured on the CD shouting, ""In seeking specific technical information,
    we discover that behind the hysteria of male expertise lies the magic world of
    our unmade art.""  It's cute and ironic, but feels like a half-hearted slap
    when compared to the punch in the face that once jumped around the stage in a
    midriff with ""Slut"" inked across her stomach.</p><p>
    
    It should be explained, I feel, why the focus is on Hanna.  Simply, it has to
    be.  Hanna's such a commanding frontwoman, obviously capable of autonomy, that
    it's often hard to tell, or even care, where the other members fit in, save for
    sporadic vocals. Hanna appears the navigator of whatever her musical vehicle
    happens to be at the moment, and when she's not in top form, the whole operation
    is threatened.  And on <i>From the Desk of Mr. Lady</i>, Hanna is simply not in
    top form.</p><p>
    
    The EP opens with ""Get Off the Internet,"" a lo-fi dose of old school hip-hop
    beats and Motown riffs that, like most of the music on the record, trods a
    similar path to the one Le Tigre paved on their debut.  Hanna hollers, ""Destroy
    the right wing,"" preaching to an already-converted-years-and-years-ago set.
    Though the lyrics are dabbed with self-awareness in the mix (""This is
    repetitive/ But nothing has changed""), it doesn't make up for the broken-record
    effect of the song.</p><p>
    
    As always, Hanna deserves props for saying what few others bother to explore.
    ""Bang!  Bang!"" decries the NYPD for the murders of Patrick Dorismund and Amadou
    Diallo.  The song doesn't necessarily add anything to the liberal outlook on
    police shootings of unarmed men, but does distill the widespread beliefs
    admirably and simply into a pop song.  At the end of the track, the members of
    Le Tigre count in unison to 41, a number for every bullet Diallo received.
    It's resounding, stirring, and as effective as Hanna gets.  And that's saying
    a lot.</p><p>
    
    But that's about it when it comes to notable messages that Hanna brings to the
    table. ""Gone B4 Yr Home"" has the bounce of ""Girlfriend in a Coma,"" the
    pseudo-Caribbean schmaltz of ""Kokomo,"" the electronic-Casio feel of an early
    Nintendo game, and lyrics that criticize clueless men.  ""Mediocrity Rules"" is
    the musical high point, propelled by an insatiable new wave riff.  Still, its
    lyrics are a bit too similar in theme to ""Home.""  The most harshness Hanna
    achieves here is contained in the line, ""Nothing scares you like a real idea.""
    This is lame when compared to the exemplary brashness Hanna wreaked when she
    wailed, ""I'm so sorry that I think/ White boys/ Don't laugh/ Don't cry/ Just
    die!"" in the early days of Bikini Kill.  It's that brand of chafing fury that's
    absent from <i>Desk</i>, and not surprisingly, sorely missed.</p><p>
    
    Mostly, <i>From the Desk of Mr. Lady</i> comes off like sub-standard material
    that didn't make it on to last year's full-length.  Even so, bonus material or
    not, Hanna has set her standard so high that there's potential for catastrophe
    in the event that she slips.  <i>From the Desk of Mr. Lady</i> marks the first
    time in over a decade that Hanna's cursive letters don't feel like knives.</p></div>"|4704.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4704-from-the-desk-of-mr-lady-ep/|5.0|Richard M. Juzwiak

    of Christian label, too.  Okay, so ""hate"" is a bit strong. How about ""it makes
    me really uneasy."" Well, except for their cover art; I <i>do</i> hate that. Of
    course, you're probably a lot more sophisticated and mature than I am.  You own
    Jeremy Enigk records. His born-again-ness doesn't faze you a bit.  Good for
    you. I, however, came at this band with a fair amount of prejudice and cynicism.
    I was expecting Stryper meets Amy Grant, only alternafied. So, it's to Jason
    Martin's credit that the better material on these two discs was able to win me
    over thoroughly. In fact, I like it so much that right now I'm dancing the
    Pentecostal version of the ""running man"" with a rattlesnake between around my
    neck while speaking in tongues and listening to the octogenarian rock gospel
    quartet from Tulsa that I've hired for the occasion.</p><p>
    
    Sorry, just joking. These guys aren't overt bible thumpers. They're apparently
    just ordinary California guys that have mastered a few Britpop tricks and made
    some great music out of it. This two-disc release attempts to compile the best
    of Starflyer 59's career, with the added bonus of b-sides, rarities, and live
    recordings. What ordinarily would be thought of as the afterthought, the second
    disc is a viable album in and of itself, not just a mess of odds and ends.</p><p>
    
    So, okay, we've established that <i>Easy Come Easy Go</i> isn't the modern
    equivalent of <i>To Hell with the Devil</i>.  But what do they sound like?
    Well, they're slow and dreamy, and they really dig reverb, phaser and delay.
    Martin sounds like he's nodding off in that breathy, super-sensitive way and
    the drumming is understated but more than adequate. Sound familiar? It should.
    Starflyer don't exactly have Our Lady of Divine Innovation on their side,
    unless she's providing just enough originality to keep this Christian band
    from sucking.</p><p>
    
    Basically, Starflyer 59 play shoegazery, Britpoppy, atmospheric wimp-rock
    in the sensitivo vein.  You wouldn't know it from the first few tracks on
    disc one, though. The mysteriously much-beloved ""Blue Collar Love"" sounds
    like slightly less terrible Alice in Chains. ""Monterey,"" another of the
    band's early ""hits,"" is likewise heavily derivative while offering little in
    the way of sing-along-ability.</p><p>
    
    It's not until the fifth track, the dark yet delicate ""Duel Overhead Cam,""
    that things stabilize.   The My Bloody Valentine infused pop of ""You're Mean""
    follows, showering layers of jangle and hissy vocals through which Martin's
    crooning and melodic guitar shine. ""The Voyager"" is the most egregious radio
    oversight of all the best-of tracks, though, due largely to the fantastic
    bluesy guitar riff in the chorus. ""The Hearttaker"" adds a touch of spaced-out
    dreaminess to the mix with a Moog synth bit.  So, great.  Martin proves he's a
    versatile songwriter, and his soul is saved.  Which is more than you can say
    for most musicians.</p><p>
    
    Things generally follow at an even keel until ""We're the Ordinary."" Here, an
    already much-better-than-solid collection of songs gets a shot of vitamin B12
    in the ass, and things get downright cash-worthy.  The dancy, criminally
    hummable second-to-last track, ""No New Kinda Story,"" features some beautiful
    keyboard details. Think New Order meets James.</p><p>
    
    Disc two, as I stated before, consists of rarities, b-sides, and live versions
    of fan favorites.  It's just as, if not more cohesive than the first disc, and
    packed tight with brain-thistle melodies.  You could dig through their five
    studio albums-- <i>Silver</i>, <i>Gold</i>, <i>Americana</i>, <i>The Fashion
    Focus</i>, and <i>Everybody Makes Mistakes</i>-- or you could just hit <i>Easy
    Come Easy Go</i>. For those of you already in possession of the Starflyer 59
    back catalog, this could make a worthy addendum, with almost an entire album's
    worth of rare material included. Take it from this reluctant proselyte. Don't
    make me start leaving Gideon's bibles on your nightstand.</p></div>"|7462.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7462-easy-come-easy-go-1994-2000/|7.8|Camilo Arturo Leslie

    debut, <i>I Could Live in Hope</i>, their trudging funeral marches, sparse
    instrumentation, and Royal Albert Hall production values were strikingly fresh.
    Though they were preceded in the slowcore movement by earlier innovators like
    Galaxie 500 and Codeine, it was Low that defined the genre's sound.</p><p>
    
    Of course, by their third album, 1996's <i>The Curtain Hits the Cast</i>,
    the formula began to wear thin.  New producer Steve Fisk brought little to
    the trio's sound, which remained virtually unchanged.  While Low turned out
    a few great songs on the record-- namely, ""Anon,"" ""Over the Ocean,"" and
    ""Lust""-- the near-Canadians failed to branch out, save for the 15-minute
    jam session ""Do You Know How to Waltz?""</p><p>
    
    Low began loosely experimenting on 1998's <i>Songs for a Dead Pilot</i> EP,
    but returned to less adventurous songwriting the following year with the
    full-length <i>Secret Name</i>.  The album sported crisper, less dramatic
    production, but failed to deviate from the concept the band had begun with
    five years earlier.  Regardless, the songs were of a similar caliber to those
    on previous outings, and a whole legion of new fans sprung up.</p><p>
    
    Most newcomers haven't grown tired of Low's penchant for lethargy, since, to
    this day, few bands have attempted what the three have already perfected. The
    closest runners-up may be New York's Ida; the two bands are often considered
    contemporaries within the same genre.  But this comparison belies one simple
    backbone fact: Low rarely force themselves to sound beautiful.  Instead, they
    focus on building tension and atmosphere around sloth-paced pop songs, while
    Ida witlessly water down their own country/folk influences with syrupy strings
    and gaudy ""prettiness.""  Vanity has never been Low's concern, and on <i>Things
    We Lost in the Fire</i>, their humility has never been so affecting.</p><p>
    
    The opening track features a double-timed, pounding snare, a basic descending
    chord structure, and the gratingly ""nice"" refrain, ""You bought some sweet/
    Sweet/ Sweet/ Sweet Sunflowers.""  But a more attentive listen reveals a new
    lyrical direction.  They've toned down the ambiguity and opted for creepy
    surrealism: ""When they found your body/ Giant x's on your eyes/ And with your
    half of the ransom/ You bought some sweet sunflowers/ And gave in to the
    night.""</p><p>
    
    Even if the British EP hadn't been available since last year, ""Dinosaur Act""
    would stand out as the obvious single.  Mimi Parker's tiny snare drum is
    squashed beneath pummeling tympani like the song's prehistoric namesake, as
    frontman Alan Sparhawk closes the song's final chorus with a shouted ""Dinosaur!""</p><p>
    
    But <i>Things We Lost in the Fire</i>'s finest moments come just as the album
    draws to a close.  On ""Like a Forest,"" the band dig themselves out of their somber
    rut to briefly uplift; the track is paced at nearly twice the speed of their other
    pieces, and seems generally optimistic, if lyrically vague.  ""Like a Forest""
    is filled out with an economy-size string section produced to sound incredibly
    dense.  But rather than overwhelming the song with soaring drama, the strings
    are incorporated conservatively low in the mix, and generate a warm hum for
    the sake of ambience.  Meanwhile, a lone plinking piano note keeps pace
    alongside Parker's snapping percussion.  Were ""Like a Forest"" the only Low
    song you'd ever heard, it's unlikely you'd suspect its somewhat psychedelic
    chord structure and absolutely engaging, see-sawing vocals were the product
    of the progenitors of slowcore.</p><p>
    
    ""In Metal"" is a simply crushing Parker-sung ode to she and Sparhawk's new
    baby, Hollis.  Parker's chilling voice, as she confesses her hopeless longing
    for the child to stay small forever, simultaneously attains both heartbreakingly
    desperation and jubilance: ""Partly hate to see you grow/ And just like your baby
    shoes/ Wish I could keep your little body/ In metal.""  There's a bizarre David
    Lynch quality to the concept of immortalizing a baby in some kind of Han Solo
    freeze that prevents the song from crossing over into blatant sentimentalism.
    But Parker's affection for the child, who can be heard squeaking at low levels
    during the song's first verse, is not feigned.  The song serves as a flawless
    finale, to the point that it can alter your view of the album as a whole.</p><p>
    
    In truth, the whole of <i>Things We Lost in the Fire</i> rarely equals the
    impact of ""In Metal,"" and at many points, even floats out of immediate
    consciousness to dwell in pits of mediocrity. ""Whitetail,"" despite spectacular
    brushed cymbal loops and effects, flounders aimlessly for more than five
    dragging minutes; ""Laser Beam"" is beyond minimal, with just Parker singing
    quietly over pausing guitar; ""Embrace"" is painfully melodramatic as Parker
    spouts such ridiculousness as ""I fell down the stairs/ I wished I were dead"";
    and the 49 second-long untitled track that precedes ""In Metal"" plays like a
    manufacturing error that accidentally caught a portion of labelmates Windy &amp;
    Carl's <i>Consciousness</i>.</p><p>
    
    Still, <i>Things We Lost in the Fire</i>'s high points are, without question,
    the best they've done.  An endless list of studio guests-- including ex-Soul
    Cougher Mark D'Gli Antoni on piano and sampler, trumpeting by Bob Weston, and
    impeccable production by one Steve Albini-- certainly add to the enjoyment.
    But above all else, it's Low's willingness to finally live up to their Kranky
    cohorts by experimenting with ambient textures, eerie tension, and advanced
    songwriting methods that saves this from being yet another <i>I Could Live in
    Hope</i>.  Here's hoping they get even weirder.</p></div>"|4892.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4892-things-we-lost-in-the-fire/|8.7|Ryan Schreiber

Annie Proulx's
    National Book Award- and Pulitzer Prize-winning novel of the same name; and,
    considering that guitarist Jeff Mueller, of the now-defunct June of 44, and
    bassist Jason Noble, of Rachel's-- who previously collaborated in Rodan--
    decided to form the band while composing and recording music for the NPR
    program ""This American Life,"" I would venture that, individually, they're
    more literate than the entire lineup of a band like, say, Buckcherry.</p><p>
    Thus, I'd also presume that the three members of the Shipping News-- which
    also includes Rachel's drummer Kyle Crabtree-- see through the generally
    shallow lexicon of music criticism. For sometimes reviews, mine included,
    seem to be comprised of the same common-- that is, stale and overused-- words
    and phrases. As both critics and entertainers, we try and keep our language
    fresh, but there are only so many relevant words to describe a drum, a
    bassline, a guitar riff, or an overall aesthetic.  Thus, I freely admit to
    occasionally consulting J.I. Rodale's semantic tome, <i>The Synonym Finder</i>.
    (Fuck Roget's!)</p><p>
    And then there are times when a critic relies instead on common words and
    phrases, if only to better communicate with an audience that, in being
    familiar with these popular words, understands their contextual meanings
    within music reviews. (William Safire, for instance, might take issue with
    an ""angular"" guitar.)</p><p>
    Take the description ""critically acclaimed."" Because there's no standard for
    this, critics-- not, er, <i>Pitchfork</i> critics, mind you-- will slap this
    tag onto any album that garnered one positive major review, and sometimes
    they'll do so just to legitimize their positive review of the follow-up. This
    term has been used in reference to the Shipping News' debut effort, 1997's
    <i>Save Everything</i>, but for good reason: it retained the raw aspect of
    Rodan's southern post-rock, but refined the sound by replacing the chugging
    metal riffs with dynamic guitar and bass interplay (a la June of 44). It
    sounded like the third album Slint should have made.</p><p>
    Did I say ""post-rock?"" Well, I'm not touching that, except to say that, other
    than the consistent vocal accompaniment, this term is still largely apt in
    regards to the Shipping News. Ah, yes: ""apt."" As in, the ""aptly titled""
    opener, ""The March Song.""  Dulled, repetitive guitar strumming and consistently
    off-kilter drums set the marching pace over which Mueller speaks truncated
    vocals like, ""Wish for air/ Cocoon man/ Smothered in soil/ Deep in the earth
    again."" The groove exits halfway through, though, as Noble's propulsive bass
    and Mueller's distorted guitar lend a genuine rock-ness to the track.</p><p>
    One might even call ""The March Song"" ""explosive."" Likewise for the 8\xBD-minute
    ""Quiet Victories,"" which opens with dramatic drums and heavy guitar delay
    before settling down to sparse percussion and Noble's faint, fragile voice.
    Later on, a guitar cracks into the song like an ax to wood.  And even deeper
    into the track, the band nicely employs a pause without the reward of an
    ""explosion,"" and follows it with a crescendo of cymbals, throbbing bass and
    soaring guitars.</p><p>
    But that's about it for ""crescendo."" With its, yes, ""angular"" bassline, ""Nine
    Bodies, Nine States"" might be called ""energized"" or ""driving""-- at least
    relatively speaking-- but it never materializes into anything more than
    repetitive three-chord arrangements.  The remaining songs could be described
    as ""mood pieces"" or ""drifts."" ""Actual blood"" offers brushed cymbals and a
    spare kickdrum and snare, as well as Noble's hurt voice managing lines such
    as, ""The words you use spill actual blood."" Beneath the surface of ""Simple
    Halo"" lurk scratchings, clickings, and a distorted organ, but when the surface
    contains (literally) tired vocals and the same old drum pace, what good are
    those intricacies?  And ""Contents of a Landfill,"" with its lightly-swirling
    guitar notes and percussive crashing waves, is more Rachel's than Rodan.</p><p>
    The closer, ""How to Draw Horses,"" would be called ""deliberate"" or ""disciplined""--
    or perhaps, since the Shipping News are often referred to as math-rock,
    ""calculated.""  In other words, what they're playing is probably complex in
    a music theory sort of way, but translates into unemotional noodling. Aside
    from the occasional noise drudges in the background and the dual vocals, the
    song comes across as an exercise in musical pedantry.</p><p>
<i>Very Soon, and in Pleasant Company</i> represents what some reviewers might
    call ""a period of transition.""  And given the device I'm using in this review,
    I'll do the same. They've... let's see... ""eschewed"" the bursting emotion that
    marked <i>Save Everything</i> (as well as Rodan), but have kept its skill,
    thus creating graceful record without a core. Which is why, in describing
    <i>Very Soon</i>, I've used the very words I've singled out as being overused:
    this album isn't innovative or moving enough to warrant a fresh vocabulary.</p></div>"|7122.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7122-very-soon-and-in-pleasant-company/|6.9|Ryan Kearney

    now, and for the most part, he's not been just another stoner stinking up
    post-production studios with antique Adidas purchased online from a
    Shibuya-based retro-chic boutique.  Since his 1995 remix of Mr Scruff's ""Sea
    Mammal,"" Votel has achieved acclaim for turning Badly Drawn Boy from a
    thrift-store Jamiroquai into an award-winning George Harrison substitute.</p><p>
    
    Setting aside the arrogance of the title, the seven tracks on this EP offer no
    great leaps in form, no turning of the tables of the money changers, no brave
    new vistas for the rest of us cloth-eared schlubs to follow on wide-eyed. The
    blunted beats here have long since made their way into the vernacular of
    TRL-pop and high-cost consumer durable commercials.</p><p>
    
    After a brooding start, the rinky-dink Rosemary's Baby melody of ""Urbanite
    Rocks"" rides through a devastated cityscape where malformed infants cruise
    around in leper-pushed carriages in search of parents, sources of nourishment,
    and sunlight. ""Girl on a GoPed"" renews Votel's partnership with Jane Weaver
    in a Pram-for-Dido-fans style. Weaver kittenishly purrs about a ""slinky little
    number"" while Votel frames her in chiming glockenspiels, the revving sounds
    of Vespas, and dollar-store organ lines.</p><p>
    
    The conservatoire-trained, romantically swollen pianist who drops in and out
    of ""Return of the Spooky Driver"" is stubborn against the blasting surf guitar
    punks that intend to rid the planet of such academic prettiness. Can the two
    reconcile their differences? Is this track big enough for both styles? Votel
    fades the song out with the punks. Who knows where the pianist's body has been
    dumped?</p><p>
    
    If the Coen Brothers feel like following up the bluegrass adventures of
    Ulysses Everett McGill, what better theme song could they wish for than the
    jaunty banjo twang and xylophone clank of ""Pickpocket?""  And the ostentatious
    production of ""Diode"" allows us a glimpse of what Tortoise might sound like if
    they recorded for Grand Central.  Along identical lines, ""Doe-Eyed"" is the
    fuzzy gamelan of Macha packaged for the sneaker-conscious. <i>Styles</i> then
    closes with Lee Gorton's world-weary, work-shy, cello-accompanied vocals on
    the oddly constricted ""RiderBrow.""</p><p>
<i>Styles of the Unexpected</i> does little to rid me of the notion that
    Votel's sole intent behind it was to release something-- anything-- on
    10-inch vinyl.  Having been recently discovered as God's preferred format
    for the storage of musical information, Votel likely thought he'd give the
    Old Man something new to stroke his gray beard to.  Knowing that Speaka's far
    more worthy <i>Bespoke</i> album couldn't be fit on anything less than a 12"",
    Votel felt as though these seven tunes would ring out as sound as a pound. I
    don't want to speak for God in this matter-- after all, he has his own unique
    ways of displaying favor or annoyance-- but I'll keep <i>Bespoke</i> spinning
    long after the so-called <i>Styles of the Unexpected</i> have worn out their
    meager novelty.</p></div>"|8500.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8500-styles-of-the-unexpected-ep/|5.6|Paul Cooper

    under ""avant"" in loftier music stores.  Not quite rock, not quite post-rock,
    it was a fuzz-caked affair described by luminaries like <i>Alternative Press</i>
    as, ""Quiet tension without release and music without boundaries.""  Truth be
    told, with its vocals mixed super-low, screeching guitars, and nearly formless
    songwriting, <i>Calla</i> was inaccessible and came off as almost absurdly
    pretentious.</p><p>
    
    The group's second LP, then, is a sweetly stinging smack in the face.  From
    the start, with the stellar ""Fear of Fireflies,"" it's clear that the
    Brooklyn-by-way-of-Texas trio is shedding more skin than the snakes they grew
    up around.  With tinny percussion, folky acoustic strumming, melodic basslines,
    and vocals way up front, it seems that singer/guitarist Aurelio Valle,
    occasional Bowery Electric cohort drummer Wayne B. Magruder, and
    bassist/keyboardist Sean Donovan have ditched the obtuse atmospheric
    electronics that made their debut so impenetrable.  The biggest shock, though,
    comes not from more straight-ahead instrumentation, but from the quality of
    songwriting.  The opener slinks along a brooding line during the verses, until
    an undeniably infectious, image-laden chorus, in which Valle sings, ""See your
    fireflies hover at the dark/ Following tracers scattered in the park/ Following
    me.""</p><p>
    
    And much of <i>Scavengers</i> finds Calla on similarly melodic and gorgeous
    ground.  The album's greatest strength is its consistent moodiness-- the
    brooding air of desperation and paranoia that looms but never wallows in
    self-importance.  It's evident in the twangy ""Hover over Nowhere,"" which is
    framed by sluggish slow-core drums washed away by a (slightly) brighter chorus
    with a lamenting guitar packed with reverb.  The claustrophobic ""Traffic Sound""
    sports a low-end pulse and ominous guitar riff similar to the one in
    Portishead's ""Sour Times.""  ""Love of Ivah"" is a sparse guitar and bass ballad
    in which Valle remarks, ""I hope I never see you in another life/ I just might
    try seeking shelter underneath my skin.""</p><p>
    
    If the music and lyrics create the mood of <i>Scavengers</i>, Valle's vocals
    realize and perfect it.  His breathy, sometimes whispered delivery sounds
    alternately affected and apathetic, as though he's fatally wounded and using
    his waning strength to attempt to shrug it off.  Though his approach is
    potentially disastrous, he sounds utterly genuine, like when he sings,
    ""Sorry for the inconvenience/ It's only 'cause I'm losing patience,"" after
    the song has just rapidly built up to dynamic cacophony.</p><p>
    
    Calla temporarily revert back to the ways of their debut on two <i>Scavengers</i>
    tracks, ""Mayzelle"" and ""A Fondness for Crawling.""  While neither song seems out
    of place, both serve as the record's low points.  When a band is as adroit as
    Calla at more or less ""conventional"" songwriting, atmospheric compositions
    consisting of polyrhythmic tablas, atonal hums, and harsh scraping sounds
    simply feel like unnecessary experiments.</p><p>
    
    But for the most part, Calla bypass revisiting their difficult debut and
    instead reinvent themselves as a brooding, masterfully melodic pack.  And
    <i>Scavengers</i> is testament to the success that comes when a band turns
    its back on self-written exposition, and expertly comes out of its shell.</p></div>"|1252.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1252-scavengers/|8.3|Richard M. Juzwiak

Accidents, misfortunes,
    and catastrophes seem to present themselves to us with alarming regularity,
    and oftentimes, we're completely unaware that they exist.  Such is the case
    with the career of jazz pianist Matthew Shipp. At the cusp of a new millennium,
    Shipp was ready to go on what could be described as an indefinite hiatus-- a
    break from recording to determine exactly what he wanted to get out of his
    career. It was unclear if another Matthew Shipp record would be released in
    the near future, if ever again. Shipp's body of work previous to his breather
    was certainly impressive, but a recess, whether temporary or otherwise, seemed
    far from tragic.</p><p>
    
    But be it through divine inspiration, meditative thought, or just a flash of
    brilliance, Shipp has come back stronger than ever, releasing what could be
    the two greatest albums of his career. Last year's excellent <i>Pastoral
    Composure</i>, Shipp's first record since announcing his possible lull in
    recording, hinted at a level of excellence his previous work had yet to
    approach.  Experimenting with jazz and traditional standards, Shipp constructed
    what is without a doubt the most accessible album of his career thus far. But
    if there was any fault to be found with <i>Pastoral Composure</i>, it was that
    it at times adhered too strictly to standard jazz rhythms and textures.  With
    <i>New Orbit</i>, Matthew Shipp has crafted an album that manages to merge the
    accessibility and raw appeal of <i>Pastoral Composure</i> with adventurous new
    textures that go beyond anything he has produced in the past.</p><p>
<i>New Orbit</i> centers around four ""Orbits,"" spread across the record. The
    first, second, and fourth Orbits focus on a beautiful piano theme that combines
    the emotional pull of a descending chromatic scale with the complex,
    ever-changing melodies and rhythms Shipp is known for. The third Orbit brings
    the central piano melody to the bass guitar, with frequent Shipp collaborator
    William Parker extracting remarkably human sounds from his instrument.</p><p>
    
    The rest of <i>New Orbit</i> complements the central pieces perfectly. In
    ""Paradox X,"" Shipp's amorphous melodies echo sheer treble, as drummer Gerald
    Cleaver and bassist Parker rumble beneath. But many of the album's high points
    come with the work of revered trumpet player Wadada Leo Smith, whose articulate
    and lively playing lifts the album's sonic palette to even greater heights.</p><p>
    
    It's kind of startling to think that Matthew Shipp came so close to possibly
    not recording this amazing album.  After 10 years and 17 releases, he's finally
    released an album that would be as at home in space as it would in a smoky
    jazz club.</p></div>"|7117.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7117-new-orbit/|8.8|Matt LeMay

This fact is inescapable.  All forms of
    music, regardless of national origin or temporal placement, have in some way
    reflected the struggle and separation, the spaces in which artistic expression
    is allowed, as well as the spaces between those spaces, of the particular
    societies that bore them.  In America, politics are mostly, if not entirely,
    about economics; oddly, we often make much of the emotional content of a
    particular piece of music, but rarely, especially in what is known as the
    ""indie"" community, examine its economic context.</p><p>
    Antibalas want to destroy capitalism.  Really.  They say so right in their
    liner notes: ""Time to destroy capitalism before it destroys us.""  A holy
    imperative.  And they have the beginnings of an army to back it up: fourteen
    people contributed musically to this record.  Based out of Brooklyn,
    Antibalas Afrobeat Orchestra is a collective of like-minded revolutionaries
    bent on liberating minds from the bounds of a free-market economy through the
    performance of mostly instrumental funk in the tradition of Fela Kuti.
    Failing that, they hope to create a space beyond in which they and others are
    not held down by ""corrupt institutions like governments, armies, and banks,""
    and can start anew, cooperatively rather than competitively.  As they state
    in the less Mumia-esque-than-<i>Metaphysical Graffiti</i>-ish spoken-word
    intro to the album closer, ""World War IV,"" this struggle is just that: a war.
    <i>Liberation Afro Beat Vol. 1</i> is their first missile.</p><p>
    So where's the explosion?  Certainly not in that ultimate track, recorded
    live at the Jazz Café in London.  In an unexpected turn, both the live tracks
    on the record emphasize how much stronger Antibalas is in the studio.
    Thankfully, it's not the rhythm section that falters in performance
    situations (what would a funk band be without a rock-solid beat?), but the
    horns.  While the brassists and reeders do manage to piece together some nice
    soloing when they're in the glass booth, they end up faltering mightily when
    playing out live, letting their lines trail off into unexciting sighs.  Or, at
    least, that's what happened during the Jazz Café show.  In any case, the live
    recordings are about the least explosive thing on <i>Liberation Afro Beat Vol.
    1</i>, which is a bit like saying sparklers are the least explosive things in
    a box full of caps.</p><p>
    The album begins with a noise that sounds a bit like a distant bomb going
    off; an organ enters, then screams, then a rhythm.  And it's a very good
    rhythm, but not an explosive one; it does not fulfill the promise of the
    bomb-noise.  The song itself, a nearly ten-minute workout titled ""Si, Se
    Puede,"" goes a little somewhere, eventually, but not very far into that
    somewhere.  There's a funky groove, that's true; there's some nice horn
    solos, yes; but is there any fire?  The answer there would have to be a
    resounding maybe.</p><p>
    The truth is, for a band that makes so much noise about being political
    revolutionaries, they end up coming off, musically, rather boring.  This is
    not to say that the music itself is tepid; played for a party full of
    open-minded friends, it would cause more than one head to bob.  It's just
    that <i>Liberation Afro Beat Vol. 1</i> should be so much more than
    head-bobbing music.  It should grab you by the heart and the loins, lift you
    out of your chair, and force you to fuck with the world.  Songs like
    ""N.E.S.T.A. (Never Ever Submit to Authority)"" promise, in their titles, that
    kind of experience; in their execution, however, they become seven-minute
    exercises in Fela Kuti/James Brown worship.  And these two artists, at their
    pinnacles, could achieve this kind of affective artistry by translating a
    type of music that was, in itself and its time, politically incendiary,
    into an even more radically politicized context.  All Antibalas do is take
    the gestures of afro-funk and graft them onto the current political climate;
    in doing so, they end up speaking for no one.</p><p>
    Hip-hop is the music of the politically oppressed now; Jay-Z has more to say
    than Antibalas about the dangers of complacency in a corporate-ruled world,
    and he does it by acting as a case study.  We can't forget, of course, that
    rap has its roots in funk, dating back to the first Kool Herc James Brown
    breakbeat; however, it would be truly something for a group like Antibalas to
    capture some of the emotional heat generated by hip-hop and ""sample"" it,
    integrating a real magma flow into their currently dormant volcanoes.  Then
    maybe they could live up to their liner-note goals.</p><p>
    Antibalas is a band that, in their concept and through their words, makes you
    want to be revolutionized.  There is so much promise, so much possibility in
    their music, and in music in general; they could not only make a statement
    about the world as it is, but also be a trigger-force for change.  It's
    regrettable, then, that Antibalas do not fulfill this promise, nor take this
    possibility and turn it into a weapon.  I really wanted them to.</p></div>"|213.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/213-liberation-afro-beat-vol-1/|6.0|Jonny Pietin

Sure enough,
    this term seems appropriate enough for the genre it usually represents, but
    something tells me there's other music that begs for the genre name that
    doesn't recall sipping martinis under a slowly rotating disco ball, leaning
    on a bar in your leisure suit, and chatting it up with the dark-haired,
    pseudo-intellectual, all-too-stylish chick with the sequined dress. No,
    perhaps the word ""lounge"" can be transferred from the noun to the verb. As
    in, the type of music you put on when you want to lounge around the house,
    reclining in your La-Z-Boy by the window on a sunny day. Or maybe out in the
    yard in the hammock on that same day, if you're lucky enough to have a
    hammock.  Or a yard.</p><p>
    
    Clearly, this has to do with the Caribbean's first full-length release,
    <i>Verse by Verse</i>.  The songs are crafted with pop chord progressions,
    and certainly, a couple of songs, like ""Have You Thought about Turning
    Pro?,"" feature a somewhat vigorous pop leaning.  But more often than not,
    <i>Verse by Verse</i> drifts lazily through your ears and reverberates
    through your mind, although it may take a few listens to notice. And even if
    the tempo is upbeat, Don Zientara's versatile production style helps each
    instrument hover just off the ground, subdued and with clarity, rather than
    settling them in busy rhythmic excitement.</p><p>
    
    The ex-Townies sect of the Caribbean includes Michael Kentoff and Matthew
    Byars. Kentoff's nasal, restrained vocals pervade the group's sound. And
    they also bring Townies' knack for interesting titles to the mix as well,
    with tracks like ""Help Would Only Confuse Me"" and ""I Am the Mosque.""
    Ex-Smart Went Crazy drummer Tony Dennison shows off his skills by including
    the announcement of ""Tony's drum part, take one"" at the beginning of the
    closing track, ""Girl at Fairgrounds,"" to prove that he can do a one-off just
    as well as anyone.</p><p>
    
    That being said, these musicians in this ""new lounge"" trio are not
    virtuosos. In fact, they proclaim that, as a consequence of visiting guest
    musicians who handle certain parts in the studio and on stage, the three
    members of the band are ""the three least talented people"" present at any
    live or studio session. This fact is hard to deny, although perhaps almost
    as hard to accept, since their record proves their chops to be quite
    competent. Kentoff, Byars and Dennison are a studio group, and as such, they
    exchange instruments based on individual ideas, which are then put together
    to create a seamless collaboration on each song.</p><p>
    
    Comparisons to other artists are occasionally notable; a fraction of the
    wide range of Beatles influences are detectable, and the guys sometimes
    sound not unlike their polar-coastal indie ""new lounge"" counterparts, Death
    Cab for Cutie.  At times, both comparisons can be made in the same song,
    such as the opener, ""I'll Simplify My Life (In Fremont),"" featuring Ringo's
    beat, Lennon's piano, and Benjamin Gibbard's boyish croon. Meanwhile, ""To
    Call Your Very Own"" resembles a lost Loud Family song. But the tone of
    <i>Verse by Verse</i>'s entirety comes off as something entirely their own--
    one of those mixes of influences and familiar sounds that ends up surviving
    any likenesses and, consequently, creating originality.</p><p>
    
    Now, me, I'm listening to <i>Verse by Verse</i> in my computer chair,
    occasionally partaking of my mug of caffeine-free Diet Coke ahd trying to
    ignore the ever-increasing carpal tunnel symptoms, as always. Yet I imagine
    that the recliner/window or hammock/yard scenarios-- the ""new lounge""--
    would be perfect for the bulk of a record like this. When I have a chance, I
    expect I'll try it out. And you should, too, friends, for you have witnessed
    the coining of a phrase that will be widely acceptable in our elite musical
    lexicon in no time at all. Whoever said this gig wouldn't influence people,
    anyway? Oh, and thanks to the Caribbean for being the effective catalyst.
    Nice album you got there.</p></div>"|1307.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1307-verse-by-verse/|7.8|Spencer Owen

Over the course of four years and six albums in
    the '90s, the Red House Painters frontman penned enough slow, open-hearted
    tunes to satiate even the most severely-afflicted melancholic patient. But
    they were so pleasant that most of us were willing to overlook Kozelek's
    numbing consistency-- or, at least, we couldn't bring ourselves to criticize
    such an apparently delicate man. Kozelek, after all, was addicted to drugs by
    the age of ten. <i>Ten</i>, people! I think he has the right to bleed onto
    every record, if he so desires.</p><p>
    
    Of course, Kozelek kicked his drug habit before forming the Red House Painters,
    and in 1992 he began a new love/hate relationship: with London's respected 4AD
    imprint. The ""hate"" part came in 1996, when label head Ivo-Watts Russell wanted
    to edit the long guitar jams on <i>Songs for a Blue Guitar</i>. Kozelek didn't
    yield, and took the record to Supreme Recordings, which released the album as
    it was. Unfortunately, not everything was resolved by this maneuver. In 1998,
    Red House Painters recorded <i>Old Ramon</i>, which will finally see release
    in late April through Sub Pop after years of being tied to contractual
    obligations with the now-defunct Supreme.</p><p>
    
    So Kozelek needed a change. He split off from his band, recorded an acoustic
    potpourri of covers (John Denver, AC/DC) and original material, and released
    the album through the Badman Recording Co. in 2000. But <i>Rock 'N' Roll
    Singer</i> hardly sounded like a change. And while the covers may seem unusual
    to some fans, they're no surprise to those aware of Kozelek's history with odd
    remakes; in the past, he's refashioned the likes of Kiss, the Cars, and Yes,
    to name a few. But something must have really hit home with those three AC/DC
    covers, because now they've appeared on a whole album's worth of acoustic
    interpretations of Bon Scott-era AC/DC. Cock rock, meet your new partner: wuss
    folk.</p><p>
    
    Admittedly, I've never been a big fan of AC/DC, but I have heard enough of
    their '70s output-- capped off by 1979's <i>Highway to Hell</i>-- to know
    that this is a strange marriage. Surprisingly, though, Kozelek makes the
    hard classics sound introspective simply by placing their lyrics in a plaintive
    musical context. If there's one positive remark to be made about <i>What's Next
    to the Moon</i>, it's that it sheds revelatory light on the subjective nature
    of lyrics.  Yet, that might be the only truly positive remark this album
    deserves. Sure, Kozelek's voice is still smooth and sad, and his guitarwork is
    still deft, yet modest.  But these are standard factory settings.</p><p>
    
    Once again, he's made music that just about everyone would describe as
    ""pleasant."" Except, that is, for die-hard AC/DC fans, who would most certainly
    be appalled at what Kozelek has done to their sex anthems. Suddenly, ""Love at
    First Feel"" isn't about statutory rape, but about a falling in love in spite
    of reason. And ""Bad Boy Boogie"" is the fatalistic admissions of a helpless
    rebel, not the sexual boasts of a misogynist. Fooled me.</p><p>
    
    Not that some sentiments here don't seem written for Kozelek. The first number,
    ""Up to My Neck in You,"" begins, ""Well, I've been up to my neck in trouble/ Up
    to my neck in strife/ Up to my neck in misery/ For most of my life."" Here, his
    languid delivery suits the material. But when he exerts the same energy for,
    say, ""Walk All Over You"" or ""If You Want Blood,"" he's no longer convincing.
    And other times, the lyrics just don't fit Kozelek, as hard as he tries to
    sensitize them. On ""Love at First Feel,"" for instance, he sings, ""I don't know
    what your name is/ I don't know what your game is/ I'm gonna take you tonight,
    animal appetite.""  Go get 'em, foxy.</p><p>
    
    In the liner notes to his latest part-covers album, Johnny Cash wrote, ""I
    worked on these songs until it felt like they were my own."" Kozelek doesn't
    seem to have done this at all. Instead, these tracks seem to have been worked
    on less than most ""MTV Unplugged"" sets.  There are a couple high points: the
    bluesy title track, which sounds like a cut from Mark Lanegan's infinitely
    more successful covers album, <i>I'll Take Care of You</i>. And Kozelek's
    vocals hit previously uncharted highs on ""You Ain't Got a Hold on Me,"" where
    he briefly inhabits the ghost of the sane Brian Wilson.</p><p>
    
    But overall this is Red House Painters lite, with one of Kozelek's most vital
    assets-- his confessional honesty-- entirely absent. Now he really needs a
    change if he wants to keep our interest. A big change, like reinterpreting his
    own songs as testosterone-fueled arena rock.</p></div>"|4523.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4523-whats-next-to-the-moon/|6.0|Ryan Kearney

    Technology (P.I.T.) in which three listeners, chosen at random from a sample
    group, were subjected to the latest release by the group Modest Mouse, <i>Sad
    Sappy Sucker</i>. They were given a set of facts about the release, which will
    be reproduced here.</p><p>
    
    Fact Sheet: Modest Mouse in 1994-95 consisted of Isaac Brock on vocals and
    guitar, Dan Gallucci on guitar, John Wickhart on bass, and Jeremiah Green on
    drums. <i>Sad Sappy Sucker</i> was their debut album, recorded over this time
    period by Calvin Johnson at Dub Narcotic, but never released until now.  It
    was shelved in favor of 1996's <i>This is a Long Drive for Someone with Nothing
    to Think About</i>. By that time, the lineup had removed Gallucci on second
    guitar and replaced John Wickhart with Eric Judy on bass.</p><p>
    
    The first half of the newly issued <i>Sad Sappy Sucker</i> consists of the
    original album, which runs at about 27 minutes. The second half is about
    nine minutes of tracks recorded for Brock's amateur Dial-a-Song service in
    the same time period.</p><p>
    
    *****</p><p>
    
    On Their Opinions of Modest Mouse:</p><p>
    
    Listener #1: I enjoy Modest Mouse.</p><p>
    
    Listener #2: I dislike Modest Mouse.</p><p>
    
    Listener #3: Am I in the wrong room? I think I'm supposed to be hearing the
    new G. Love and Special Sauce.</p><p>
    
    *****</p><p>
    
    On Isaac Brock's Vocals:</p><p>
    
    Listener #1: This seems to be the decision point for those who are on the
    fence about whether they enjoy the band or not. So naturally, I love his
    voice. And on this early record, he definitely sounds younger and more, well...
    mousy. But the shaky, always slightly aggressive quality of his voice has
    always appealed to me.</p><p>
    
    Listener #2: Naturally, I hate the guy's voice. It's like they got a tone-deaf
    retarded guy who's missing teeth to sing for them. I can't say this record has
    helped me warm up to it, and I probably would have hated it more if I'd heard
    this record before the others.</p><p>
    
    Listener #3: Hey, fuck this. I'm out of here.</p><p>
    
    *****</p><p>
    
    On Indie Style:</p><p>
    
    Listener #1: The early form of the group seems to owe more to Archers of Loaf
    than the Pixies. The structures are less varied, not as tight, and more laid
    back, with simple, catchy, guitar-pickin' hooks and a healthy, upbeat groove.
    It often works to their advantage. Sometimes the Pixies influence shines
    straight through even here, though, like on ""Red Hand Case,"" which features a
    bluesy progression and quirky, screeching vocals. And strangely, Brock uses
    his accordion a lot more than usual on both the Dial-a-Songs and the album
    itself. Jeremiah Green still proves himself to be one of indie rock's best
    drummers, even this early on in the game.</p><p>
    
    Listener #2: I agree.  Although the music has never made much of an impression
    on me-- especially with that guy's nasal yelp to get past-- Green's a fucking
    awesome drummer.</p><p>
    
    *****</p><p>
    
    On Guitars and Overdubbing:</p><p>
    
    Listener #1: I prefer the sound of the band's latest records, with Brock's
    masterful guitar stylings pervading the sound, overdubbed ten times over,
    adding the complexity that makes it so fascinating. But even before 2000's
    <i>The Moon &amp; Antarctica</i>, when his guitar was simpler, he still managed
    to pull off some fascinating riffs by himself. Here it's sort of entry level
    ""indie,"" and he's got a supporting guitarist to help him out. Nevertheless,
    the riffs are often engaging enough, especially for a fan like myself.</p><p>
    
    Listener #2: For me, the more interesting the guitars the better, and if the
    sounds of the previous records failed to interest me, you can bet this one
    bored me to tears.</p><p>
    
    *****</p><p>
    
    On Lyrics:</p><p>
    
    Listener #1: Isaac's lyrics here are clearly not as philosophically developed
    as they became in the later years. He still tries to tackle the big issues,
    like life and death; on the brief, solo-accordion ""Think Long,"" he sings,
    ""Sit and think for a while, and you'll realize that you still die/ If you're
    not thinking at all, I'm not sure why you're alive."" But with titles like
    ""Worms Vs. Birds"" and ""Mice Eat Cheese"" dominating the pack, it's clear he
    had a ways to go until he got to pensive musings like ""The universe is shaped
    exactly like the earth/ If you go straight long enough, you'll end up where
    you were.""</p><p>
    
    Listener #2: I'm sort of glad that he's sticking to the basics. The other
    words were simply pretentious bullshit.</p><p>
    
    *****</p><p>
    
    On Length and The Dial-A-Song Bonus Tracks:</p><p>
    
    Listener #1: It's interesting to see that the songs are so short. I mean, of
    course the Dial-a-Song tracks are all under a minute, but the songs usually
    run about two-to-three minutes here, and that's atypical of the band. Of
    course, it's further proof that Brock was just carving his niche; he was
    simply at the beginning of his path as a musician, his ideas not being able
    to sustain an epic track or maintain interest for longer periods of time as
    they so easily can these days.</p><p>
    
    The Dial-a-Song tracks prove this even further, featuring ideas stretching
    out over only thirty seconds with no cohesive way to connect them with others.
    They're often silly-- sometimes painfully, atonally so, especially when
    including kazoos and whistles-- but sometimes they hint at bigger, better
    songs. The most interesting of the Dial-a-Songs come early on, so they work
    best as a sort of afterthought to the bulk of the record.</p><p>
    
    Listener #2: The songs are mercifully short. The Dial-a-Song tracks are
    painfully amateurish. I can't believe I'm being subjected to this garbage.</p><p>
    
    *****</p><p>
    
    On the Completely Idiotic Decision to Make the Fourth Song Unlisted, Thereby
    Causing the Tracklist as Seen on the Packaging to Be Off by One for the
    Majority of the Record:</p><p>
    
    Listener #1: It's interesting that the unlisted fourth track happens to be
    one of the record's catchiest and best tracks. But even I'll admit that it's
    stupid to sequence it that way.</p><p>
    
    Listener #2: Doesn't fucking surprise me.</p><p>
    
    *****</p><p>
    
    On Favorite Tracks, Most and Least:</p><p>
    
    Listener #1: Besides the unlisted track, I enjoy the opener, ""Worms Vs. Birds,""
    as an example of the best track which fits the overall style of the record.
    It's loosely played, melodically simple, but highly enjoyable. My other
    favorite is ""Every Penny Fed Car,"" which strikes me as the most obvious hint
    to their future work; it begins instrumentally with a driving riff and a
    complex beat and then suddenly switches mid-song to chanting vocals and
    gradual, overstated power chords. My least favorites are the minute-or-less
    tracks within the body of the record. The ideas don't seem developed enough
    to have a place with the rest of the songs.</p><p>
    
    Listener #2: I guess I like the first half of ""Every Penny Fed Car,"" since
    it's instrumental and all. But the rest just bugs me. Obviously.</p><p>
    
    *****</p><p>
    
    Conclusions:</p><p>
    
    Listener #1: Overall, <i>Sad Sappy Sucker</i> feels as if it was sort of put
    together in a hurry, despite it having sat around in the warehouse for seven
    years. The album part has plenty of good songs, though, and any completist
    will want to hear it. The Dial-a-Songs seem disposable, but they're interesting
    to hear at least once to see how Brock got his start.</p><p>
    
    Listener #2: Man, I thought I hated them before. They're going to have to work
    really, really hard to impress me now.</p><p>
    
    Listener #3: Oh, what? Sorry, I forgot my Gatorade. I'll leave again.</p></div>"|5356.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5356-sad-sappy-sucker/|7.0|Spencer Owen

I never
    bought into the idea that just because something hasn't been done before
    means it has an inherent advantage over excellent but derivative work.
    Spurious logic, if you ask me.</p><p>
    
    The Action Time is a co-ed London sextet that are too busy nurturing and their
    free-spirited scorn at everything in the world to be bothered with
    establishmentarian concepts like ""originality.""  They wallow in the anger
    and attitude of youth, living through the personas they've created for
    themselves: Susie Sparkles, Miss Spent Youth, Black September, CC Rider, etc.
    I picture them spending lots of time practicing walking down the street
    together with a synchronized, ganglike swagger.  The fuck-all attitude--
    contrived or sincere, who cares?-- comes across perfectly in their music.  I
    never even questioned the motives behind their rage.  Good for them.  They're
    young; they'll grow out of it someday.</p><p>
    
    Whether they're nicking the cracked screech of Joe Strummer or referencing
    icons of revolutionary Black literature like Eldridge Cleaver and James
    Baldwin in the titles of songs (""Soul on Ice"" and ""The Fire Next Time,""
    respectively), the Action Time have made their debut album their pastiche
    manifesto, their vent at their myriad enemies.</p><p>
<i>Versus the World</i> opens with the call-to-arms ""Soul on Ice,"" a fiery
    fusillade of raw, distorted guitar tempered by retro keyboard accents and
    an overall Phil Spector girl-group dynamic.  A bit later, the Action Time
    offer up the pure, full-tilt fun of tit-for-tat vocals in ""Stranded on
    a Lonely Planet.""  September engages in a sassy dialogue with Sparkles and
    Miss Spent Youth on top of a distorted grind that urges people into doing
    early '60s dances.  The other superlative is the made-for-a-single old-wave
    sound of ""(We're Just) Killing Time.""  The raging guitars yield briefly and
    slightly in favor of some keyboard squealing and sweet vocals about
    proletariat alienation.</p><p>
    
    With climbing melodies and the reverb on overkill, ""Stay in the Car"" feels
    like a Rock*A*Teens outtake.  After this early misstep, the pace doesn't
    falter again until the last couple of songs.  But <i>Versus the World</i> ends
    with two consecutive duds, one of which, ""I Will Fear No Evil,"" is a good
    example of the road not taken: it's a poor execution of the ideas that they've
    already spent the record proving they can tackle.</p><p>
    
    Bringing to bear the scrutiny of the audiophile on <i>Versus the World</i>
    would almost surely result in disappointment.  It's sloppy music, all heart
    and no technique.  Yet, when listening to the Action Time, the old feel older,
    and the conservative more conservative.  All by virtue of considering the
    chasmic distance between where you are now, and the embarrassments, audacities,
    idealism and consequence-less fun of youth that the Action Time embody.  But
    as youth, they couldn't care less.  And then sometime during the third or
    fourth listen, you suddenly don't, either; it's enough that they're reckless
    and self-important.</p></div>"|32.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/32-versus-the-world/|7.0|John Dark

    even proudly announces, ""Averaging almost two records a year since 1995""--
    but the records they choose to release range from above average to beyond
    great.  On one side of the fence, there are the winners: Les Savy Fav's
    first two albums and Lifter Puller's <i>Fiestas and Fiascos</i>; on the
    other, there are the decent: Haywood's <i>Men Called Him Mister</i> and
    Enduro's <i>Half Rack of Sugar</i>.  Actionslacks' <i>The Scene's Out of
    Sight</i> falls somewhere in the middle.</p><p>
    
    Though not nearly as innovative as the art-punk onslaught of Les Savy Fav,
    Actionslacks' only aim is to make great pop music.  Their sights aren't set
    on pushing music to new peaks; they just want to satiate the pop-deprived with
    solid hooks and charged delivery.  And where so many of their indie pop
    contemporaries fall victim to asinine, three-chord rehashing and inept
    guitarwork, Actionslacks overcome with a fierce intensity and inspired
    songwriting.</p><p>
    
    The J Robbins-produced <i>The Scene's Out of Sight</i> is the third for
    the Berkeley, California-based foursome, and betters both its predecessors--
    the Skene!-released <i>Too Bright, Just Right, Goodnight</i> from 1996, and
    1998's <i>One Word</i> on Arena Rock-- in every respect.  The guys are
    considerably more confident now than on past outings, and they have every
    right to be; drummer Marty Kelly pulls off complicated fills effortlessly
    while bassist Ross Murray interplays complex rhythmic structures with
    singer/guitarist Tim Scanlin's plucked steel strings.  Even Scanlin's
    lyrics have grown up over the years.  Sure, he'll still stumble over SweeTart
    prose like, ""Tonight we're gonna scrape the sky,"" but what he lacks in poetic
    genius he makes up for in melody.</p><p>
    
    If there's a complaint to be made about <i>The Scene's Out of Sight</i>, it's
    that being berated with stories of scenesterism and tour vans gets tired after
    a while.  Surely, there are more important things in life than how many
    stickers you can slap on newspaper dispensers and the number of shows you went
    to last week.  But power-pop lyrics are renowned for their genericism, and
    simply put, they're just not the point.  If nothing else, these guys are a
    hell of a lot more skilled with the pen than better-knowns like the Get Up
    Kids and the Promise Ring.</p><p>
<i>The Scene's Out of Sight</i> isn't going to change anyone's life, and
    thankfully, it wasn't meant to.  Actionslacks are more than satisfied
    assaulting ""the kids"" with their blissful, high-energy performances.  And
    with their most competent album to date for sale at the merch table, it
    looks like the guys'll be riding the music geek fantasy for at least another
    five years.  Which is really all a Californian power-pop band can ask for.</p></div>"|33.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/33-the-scenes-out-of-sight/|7.6|Ryan Schreiber

I'm shackled to whim, a slave to fancy,
    perpetually impatient, high strung, and terrified of tedium.  As a makeshift
    cure, I've developed an attention span that rivals a hyperactive prepubescent
    Christian Scientist.  It's not ideal, but at least I'm occupied most of the
    time.  Of course, the key word there is ""most.""  Snags are hit every time I'm
    forced to stand in hellish lines, endure overlong anecdotes from friends and
    strangers alike, and withstand multiple listens of records I would otherwise
    turn off before the first track was finished.</p><p>
    
    Alpha's sophomore album, <i>The Impossible Thrill</i>, is emblematic of the
    latter example.  If having to write about Bristolian trip-hop is taxing,
    having to listen to it enough to get to that step is brutal-- especially when
    the material in question makes unintentional strides toward epitomizing
    dullness.</p><p>
    
    By bombarding the listener with innocuousness, Alpha forge a test to determine
    exactly when the pedestrian becomes excruciating.  By the third track, they
    more or less have their answer.  <i>The Impossible Thrill</i> is so pig-headed
    in its goal to evoke mood that conventions like variation, song structure
    and memorable songwriting are completely forgone.</p><p>
    
    The album's redundancy is particularly inappropriate because of its premise.
    Instead of continuing on a beat-heavy, electronic path to atmosphere, Alpha
    employ mostly live instrumentation to augment the rich, bluesy arrangements.
    Layers of strings glaze the songs, and are heavily depended upon to set the
    dour, spacy tone. <i>The Impossible Thrill</i> sifts through the constituents
    of pop trip-hop, exploits its darkness, and ultimately lacks any semblance of
    groove.  A song stringed as manipulatively as ""Dim"" plays like a reject
    Blaxploitation theme.  And, when the occasional dank beat from a drum machine
    does pop up, like on ""South,"" it only retreads the same sterile fare we've
    heard a million times before from artists like Hooverphonic and Morcheeba.</p><p>
    
    The vocalists on the record, Helen White, Wendy Stubbs, and Martin Barnard,
    only contribute to the drabness.  The interchangeable White and Stubbs both
    exhibit the conviction of mumbling somnambulists.  Though aiming to recall a
    more drugged-out Beth Gibbons, the two never muster anything greater than
    ""wispy.""  Barnard's approach is more affected, but just as unmoving.  With
    the vocals low in the mix, it's hard to hear exactly what he's (seemingly)
    complaining about.  And, when the rest of the content is taken into account,
    it's even harder to care.</p><p>
<i>The Impossible Thrill</i> is utterly pedestrian and overwrought.  Though
    the songs are mostly composed gracefully, with each part impeccably
    interlocking, this ultimately can't erase the record's inherent mundaneness.
    But at least the album lives up to its name; with the knowledge that the thrill
    is indeed unattainable, it's clear that adventure is best sought in virtually
    any other outlet.</p></div>"|132.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/132-the-impossible-thrill/|3.0|Richard M. Juzwiak

    significance and societal approbation, is that it still remains a
    storyteller's medium. Even the most textural backdrops are always based
    around human voices saying human words. Where rock bands of various stripes
    head farther and farther out into the realm of poncy abstraction, hip-hop
    narrows its scope. The best MCs-- save those meandering, fine-art fans in
    the Anticon camp-- are driven by precision, detail and narrative skill.
    But however weird the backing track might become, there's always a person
    up front, speaking.</p><p>
    
    What divides the underground from the mainstream, then, isn't so much the
    level of experimentation as the choice of narrational tone. Where the
    can-you-top-this tower of mainstream braggadocio is bound to eventually
    topple over, the rapidly surfacing regional scenes that compose the
    alternative maintain high levels of heavily personal weirdness or a degree
    of honest, searching levelheadedness that's astonishing to hear in the
    hyperbolic world of popular song.</p><p>
    
    All Natural-- MC Capital D and DJ Tone B Nimble-- clearly fancy themselves a
    fairly traditional battle-rap combo. None of the band's post-rocking labelmates
    pitched in ambient marimba soundscapes on <i>Second Nature</i>; most of the
    production sounds like a more obvious Wu-Tang, or veers into Native
    Tongues-style jazz suites. Fitting in with all this straightforwardness,
    Capital D and his various compatriots sling verses about how good they are
    at rapping-- especially in light of how crappy you and your sucka friends
    are.  And able as they are at this kind of stuff, there's an added bonus
    involved: All Natural can't hide how smart they are.</p><p>
    
    Aside from the various introspective asides sprinkled throughout the tougher
    tracks, plenty of songs here take up issues of note. ""Vegetarians"" is about
    avoiding stupid conflicts, while acknowledging the tricky temptations of
    manliness.  Elsewhere, the band takes up issues of class, race, and how
    fucked up rap is in the '01. Most extraordinarily, Capital D takes a good,
    long time to address a topic that the grime-obsessed freestyle union usually
    shies away from: it's a quiet, ruminative paean about how good it actually
    is to be alive.</p><p>
    
    That very quality, though, sometimes gets the band in trouble. All Natural's
    utterly unassuming nature keeps them from stretching too hard, allowing them
    to retread stuff any hip-hop fan has heard elsewhere. There's nothing wrong
    with hanging out in the background, perfecting a craft, and letting the world
    make of it what it will. But when a group's lyrical engine is this flexible,
    it's a shame that the beats themselves don't stretch as far as they might.
    Still, like the old Greil Marcus-penned adage says, sometimes it's enough
    for music to remind you that there are still people in the world you might
    like to meet.</p></div>"|115.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/115-second-nature/|6.8|Sam Eccleston

    Francisco resident Matthew Patterson Curry.  And in this case, the alias is
    wholly appropriate.  <i>Parts Water</i> is essentially a glitch-dub album
    with occasional vocals.  But just as the round-edged scissors that are given
    to kindergartners to cut out construction paper shapes are, for the most part,
    blunt, Curry has blunted and de-hazarded glitch music as we know it.</p><p>
    Like his peers, Kit Clayton and Sutekh's Seth Horvitz, Curry believes that
    glitch could stand to be incorporated into genres other than dub (I'm looking
    at you, Stefan Betke).  The most visible manifestation of this interpolation
    of glitch is, of course, Björk's <i>Vespertine</i>.  But even though, like
    <i>Vespertine</i>, <i>Parts Water</i> sports Curry's untarnished, self-sung
    vocal tracks, the album is also easily likened to Herbert's masterful
    <i>Bodily Functions</i>.  No, <i>Parts Water</i> doesn't go all out for the
    dancefloor like <i>Bodily Functions</i> generally does, but it hints that,
    with some minor remixing, he could find himself the creator of several
    dancefloor staples.</p><p>
<i>Parts Water</i> opens with ""Two Letter U's,"" in which Curry applies his
    sonic malfunctions to a slow go-go swing, and contrasts a loping swagger with
    a stuttering Hammond organ figure. ""A Wash"" opens with guitar twangs tugged
    at by glitches, until a horn imposes rhythmic order and ushers in the gospel
    organ that flourishes towards the end of the track.</p><p>
    Curry turns to glitch balladry for ""Stormy Weather,"" using vocal treatments
    similar to the ones Herbert messed with on <i>Bodily Functions</i>.
    Harpsichordian sounds tinkle in and out of the mix as Curry inserts the
    same terse hi-hat sounds that characterized Neil Landstrumm's <i>Bedrooms and
    Cities</i>.  Disconcerting harmonic wobbles are then allowed to breach the
    meniscus of the melody as Curry sings a heartfelt admonition: ""So don't make
    up your mind/ Your vision may be cloudy/ So now is not the time/ We're in for
    stormy weather/ I feel it in my knees.""</p><p>
    With the bass drum barely even a presence, ""7 Glasses a Day/7 Days a Week""
    relies on Landstrumm's taut percussion set to propel the track.  Under the
    trebly rhythms, an intoxicated Basic Channel-style organ pokes around, only
    to be accosted by a marauding band of dub echoes. ""Your Beautiful Feet"" begins
    with calm tones and a stuttering bass guitar.  Then, after Curry reveals
    himself in disconsolate vocals (""I'm a puddle/ Down on the street/ Watch where
    you're standing/ I'm six feet deep""), wobbly chords bubble up from beneath to
    replace the gentle keyboard's song.</p><p>
    Though glitch-bossa makes its debut on ""Esperanto,"" Curry returns to the fuzzy
    dub of Pole for the drifting clunks of ""Before (Less).""  On ""(Water)phone,""
    he sings surrealism about waiting for someone to pick up the phone he's
    dialing.  After a scratchy miniature, lo-lo-lo-fi New Order-ish guitar joins
    the fray and Curry concludes that the person he wants to talk to is in the
    shower, and that the running water is drowning him.  Curious.</p><p>
    But the aquatic theme that permeates <i>Parts Water</i> is never more
    prominent than during ""Sailor Stripes""-- a viscous melody figure swims
    through shards of sub-surface sunlight, like some winding eel searching for
    a plankton which is represented by fragments of human humming. ""Dipsy Daisy""
    stays submerged in Curry's ocean, but for once, he allows his kickdrums to
    pound, taunting them that they can break the surface and make it to dry land
    without a remixer's assistance, but only when he permits it.</p><p>
    After the upbeat, cowbell-driven ""Slipper,"" <i>Parts Water</i> closes with
    ""Mirror (Wet)."" The track not only reprises most of Curry's lyrical concerns
    (""I drank all the water I can drink/ I can't drink anymore/ My eyes are
    floating in my head"") but also the deft incorporation of glitch-dub into
    unexpected song forms. What impresses me above all about ""Mirror (Wet)"" is
    that Curry has written chord progressions and intriguing melodies that I've
    come to associate with his labelmate, Low Res. ""Mirror (Wet)"" could have
    been one of the terran tunes the extra-terrestrials captured on Res'
    <i>Approximate Love Boat</i>, the Plug Research release that first alerted
    me to the possibilities of applied glitch.  However, <i>Parts Water</i> stands
    apart.  Surely, we must afford Curry the same laurels we've bestowed upon
    Matthew Herbert and Björk.</p></div>"|6965.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6965-parts-water/|8.5|Paul Cooper

So much, in
    fact, that I had the entire plant world broken up into three botanical
    classifications. There were the ""things that go ouch,"" such as stinging
    nettles and briar, ""things that make itch,"" like poison oak and poison
    ivy, and ""things that smell bad,"" like the cat pee-smelling ailanthus,
    and the vomit-smelling, fruit-bearing female ginkgo tree.</p><p>
    
    Granted, I was working within a very limited geographical scale. The world
    outside the Northeastern United States undoubtedly contains many, many more
    prickly, poisonous, and smelly plants than I've encountered.  For me, a puke
    tree will forever be a female ginkgo, but I get the distinct feeling that
    God's green earth is home to many, many more plants that smell like vomit.</p><p>
    
    When I first saw Smog's new <i>'Neath the Puke Tree</i> EP, I immediately
    assumed that the EP's title alluded to the ginkgo. But then I looked on the
    back of the jewel case, and noticed that the EP was recorded in Melbourne,
    Australia, a place that is no doubt home to more puke-scented flora than even
    New York City. But that's not the only level on which I'm failing to connect
    to this record. For the first time in a while, I'm starting to get the feeling
    that Bill Callahan's instincts aren't working to his advantage-- a scary and
    depressing thought, considering the amazingly consistent body of work he's
    produced in the past decade.</p><p>
<i>'Neath the Puke Tree</i> has a decidedly more country feel to it than
    Callahan's past work. And no, I don't mean ""alt-country,"" with its twanging
    Telecasters and torn denim jackets. There's a serious, old-school country
    influence at work here, especially on the EP's opener, ""I Was a Stranger"".
    Utilizing a simple but effective motif of strummed acoustic guitar, relatively
    straightforward drumming, and flourishes of slide guitar, the track effectively
    paints a dusty picture of a sun-drenched desert that would be very much at
    home in modern-day western music.</p><p>
    
    Breaking slightly away from this formula, the record's second track is its
    standout. Barren and desolate, ""Your Sweet Entrance"" is classic Smog, full
    of vague romantic longing as expressed through Bill Callahan's claustrophobic
    vocals. It also contains one of the most masterfully executed weirdo chord
    changes I've heard in ages.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, at about this point, Callahan seems to have forgotten the first
    rule of recording sparse, guitar-driven ballads: tune the fucking thing! ""A
    Jar of Sand"" could be a great track for all I know, but I just can't get past
    the fact that his guitar is so painfully out of tune. I'm not sure what would
    be worse: if the guitar were out of tune due to general laziness, or due to a
    shoddy attempt at adding an ""experimental"" feel to the track. Either way, it's
    not any fun, and makes what would otherwise be a perfectly listenable couple
    of tracks (this and the fourth track, ""Orion Obscured by Stars"", are both
    plagued by this problem) unbearable.  Yet, even with these few thoroughly
    frustrating tracks, <i>'Neath the Puke Tree</i> manages to yank itself out of
    the abyss in time for its closer, the swampy ""Coacheecayoo"".</p><p>
    
    After having this EP on repeat play for a few hours, I'm feeling three
    conflicting emotions. First, I'm frustrated that Bill Callahan didn't bother
    tuning the damn guitar (we've established that, right?).  Secondly, I'm
    grateful that this isn't a full-length, because even though it's at times
    really likable, none of the tracks have the same punch as the better of Smog's
    album tracks. Finally, I'm hoping that my two major gripes with this EP won't
    carry over to the next full-length.  I mean, shit, maybe it's just really hard
    to find a tuning fork in Melbourne.</p></div>"|7282.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7282-neath-the-puke-tree-ep/|6.8|Matt LeMay

    proper male names, overcome the associative images of Michael Caine and a
    midget in a hairy orange alien suit to create impressionist folk music that
    prioritizes fiddling with the bells and whistles-- at times literally-- over
    troubadour tradition.  In American hands (and more specifically Athenian,
    Georgian hands), music of this ilk would wander into Brian Wilson's territory.
    But the Anglo angle leans more toward Syd Barrett and Fairport Convention.
    Woodwinds bleat.  Dewy pianos twinkle.  Bare guitars tiptoe.  Harmonies ooze
    and fade.  Sunny Day Real Estate frontman Jeremy Enigk flirted with similar
    sounds on his 1996 solo album, <i>Return of the Frog Queen</i>, before taking
    the path-- one Pink Floyd and Henry Cow blazed decades ago-- into prog.</p><p>
    
    The grammatically mangled <i>If You Happy With You Need Do Nothing</i> collects
    the lite, sylvan psych singles Alfie have released to date on Badly Drawn Boy's
    Twisted Nerve label.  And though never reaching the levels of attempted irony
    and wit (or the hooks) of the Boy, Alfie nevertheless wear wool hats and weave
    album covers of corduroy.  The aural chamomile commences with ""Bookends,""
    making the prerequisite reading references.  Fortunately, there are no songs
    of tea or sheep, but farms and rain are covered in the Alfie syllabus.  Simple
    strings and chimes establish the mood with a relieving yawn.  ""It's Just About
    the Weather"" shaves the hair off Gomez's back and throat to reveal a more
    tolerable rural emotion hoe-down.</p><p>
    
    It's impossible to play in the lanes of lithe acoustic music with violins,
    pianos, and tambourines in the northern United Kingdom without sideswiping
    Belle and Sebastian.  ""2 Up 2 Down"" does just that, strumming clean guitars
    like ukuleles with the dog-eared corners of <i>Far from the Madding Crowd</i>
    and punctuating with bike bell percussion.</p><p>
    
    The second side opens more interestingly with the Flaming Lips-like ""Umlaut,""
    where drug-cracked symphonies stomp lightly alongside crashing brass.  ""Check
    the Weight"" tries on the fashionable baggy loops of the Beta Band, and the
    closing ""Montevideo"" chirps with wristwatch electronics.  The beauty lies in
    the details, which, while comforting and ear-piquing, offers merely relaxing
    vacations rather than environments which beg to be inhabited.  Alfie treat
    folk like mood music, and might slip through this current ""quiet"" trend by
    hiding their true colors under heavy coats, hunched shoulders, and closed
    eyelids. Ol' Mum was onto something when she nagged, ""Speak clearly! Mind
    your posture!"" Hopefully, they'll rip open the rain-soaked cardboard on their
    debut LP.</p></div>"|106.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/106-if-you-happy-with-you-need-do-nothing/|6.9|Brent DiCrescenzo

I've had it for ten years, actually, but only
    recently did I do something about it.  My meal plan in college was couch change
    and 49-cent tacos.  I don't get much exercise, either.  Although the other day
    I did play a very strenuous game of street hockey against some neighborhood
    10 year-olds who appeared to be in <i>excellent</i> cardiovascular health.
    The worst part is my wife; she's so overly concerned about my condition:
    ""You're going to die,"" ""Don't forget your Accupril,"" and, ""Here, eat this
    celery and rice cake casserole I made for you,"" have all been in heavy
    rotation around my place.  I don't care what fucking Martha Stewart says,
    you cannot <i>bake</i> celery.</p><p>
    
    So I'm getting real tired of what's good for me.  Eating right, driving safe.
    Even listening to gourmet music.  It's all starting to blur: is it the genius
    of tofu and the healthiness of Sonic Youth or the other way around?</p><p>
    
    There's quite a bit that Alkaline Trio's music is not.  It's not challenging,
    ambitious, or visionary.  It's not clever or self-aware.  It's not even
    terribly skillful.  But what it is, is tasty.  Pure musical junk food: fast,
    greasy, and crafted for a general palate.  Some people can't bring themselves
    to ever go to a fast food joint once they've tasted better.  Others, like me,
    well... we shouldn't, but we do, anyway.</p><p>
    
    Already known for playing paradoxically dour but upbeat pop/punk, the Trio,
    dive a little deeper and darker on <i>From Here to Infirmary</i> than on
    previous efforts.  But even with an obsidian sheen, they still play catchy,
    riff-saturated edgy pop.  A dozen tracks of it, if that's what you're craving.
    Admittedly, some of the music is a tad too derivative for your average rock
    snob.  The riffs on ""You're Dead"" are pretty suggestive of the mid-90's
    Everclear hit ""Fire Maple Song.""  And ""Private Eye"" opens with tonal qualities
    borrowed from the <i>Bossanova</i> sessions.</p><p>
    
    The band often hits the mark in their lyrical imagery, though.  Not necessarily
    whole lines of brilliance, but just the smallest turn of phrase.  Snippets
    like, ""Sense DNA on barbed wire fences,"" and, ""Drank my insides raisin dry""
    demonstrate that they can write with restraint rather than aiming to shoot
    their lyrical wad all at once on a grand, poetic angst manifesto (and
    failing, no doubt).</p><p>
    
    Occasionally, however, the Trio jar you back to reality with bonehead moves
    like spelling out the very, very thinly-disguised metaphor in one song for
    the listener.  Not only was it obvious to the most casual ear, but the
    repeated outro, ""In case you're wondering/ I'm singing about growing up,"" in
    ""Mr. Chainsaw"" only serves to draw attention to itself and the fact that we
    weren't wondering... at all.  Another comical moment is the bits of Colin Hay
    vocals that slip into Matt Skiba's singing on ""I'm Dying Tomorrow.""</p><p>
    
    But for all its flaws, <i>From Here to Infirmary</i> remains nothing more
    than simply what it is: tuneful, consumable, and guiltily satisfying.
    Sometimes you just have to put regard for your own well-being aside and
    consume what you want, even if you know it's bad.  Even if you just read
    <i>Fast Food Nation</i>.  Go on, have that triple whopper.  After all, it's
    only here for a limited time.</p></div>"|110.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/110-from-here-to-infirmary/|6.5|John Dark

    certainly proved its worth to terrorists and psychopaths alike, may be one
    literary form to steer clear of when slapping together that first album.
    Just ask veteran MC Aceyalone.</p><p>
    
    Aceyalone has made a career as something of a hip-hop missionary. In 1991, he
    appeared on a scene flooded with gangsta-rap wannabes as a member of the
    L.A.-based Freestyle Fellowship.  The Fellowship would eventually grow to the
    status of underground legends by pushing the limits of the form, criticizing
    hip-hop's increasing commercialization, and choosing social criticism as a
    lyrical subject over the romanticizing of violence so popular at the time.</p><p>
    
    On 1998's <i>Book of Human Language</i>, Aceyalone raised his greatest
    challenge to those who would continue to pigeonhole his chosen art form.
    Structured as the sort of dark fairy tale one might find in an antique volume
    in the far corners of some rustic library, <i>Book of Human Language</i> was
    a stunningly dark and brooding foray into the twisted mind of a brilliant
    wordsmith, each song unfolding like a chapter over music culled primarily
    from old jazz cuts.  Back in those days, Aceyalone reveled in his role as a
    poet-laureate of the hip-hop world, spitting out lines like, ""I'd rather
    stimulate your mind than emulate your purpose/ And we have only touched on
    the surface of the serpent,"" sprinkling his verse with literary allusion.</p><p>
<i>Accepted Eclectic</i> opens with a challenge to ""all you shallow rappers/
    Bottom of the bottle rappers/ Spit and swallow rappers/ Hollow rappers/ Love
    to follow rappers."" Appropriately enough, Aceyalone's greatest competition
    turns out to be himself. While above par when compared to most recent releases
    from the hip-hop underground, <i>Accepted Eclectic</i> cannot hope to compare
    to its creator's previous works. Not only does <i>Eclectic</i> lack the
    cohesiveness that made <i>Human Language</i> such a stunning listen, but the
    songs seem tossed off in comparison.</p><p>
    
    While tunes like ""Five Feet,"" a rant against those who invade the personal
    space of others, are certainly amusing, they hardly pack the same punch as
    the introspective rhymes that occupied his other efforts. ""Give me five feet
    all around the world/ I don't want nobody touchin' me unless it's my girls,""
    is a great rhyme, provided verses like, ""The more I look around, the more it
    hurts/ I quietly go berserk when I work/ Hoping to find that part of my mind/
    That's mostly confined and blind,"" haven't been swimming around your head for
    three years.</p><p>
    
    Indeed, it's hard to believe three years of work went into <i>Eclectic</i>.
    Not only are the backing tracks sparse and cartoonish, the carefully chosen
    drumbeats of earlier albums are replaced with generic drum machines that could
    have been pulled off any mediocre hip-hop album in the bargain bin.  It also
    lacks a cohesive theme to bring one song into the next.</p><p>
<i>Eclectic</i> is hardly a bad album, though.  Even these seemingly phoned-in
    rhymes offer more playfulness and insight than those of many of his
    better-known contemporaries. And there are still those moments where his
    ingenuity shines through. Take ""Master Your High,"" in which Aceyalone mocks
    those unaware of their own limits. ""First you start mumbling/ Then you start
    stumbling/ Then your motor skills start malfunctioning/ Could it be the intake/
    Of the chemical that makes your body shake?""</p><p>
    
    The stupendous ""Hardship"" offers the only real glimpse of Aceyalone's
    introspective rhymes of lore. Not only is the musical accompaniment the only
    place where the album's seven (yes, seven!) producers comes close to matching
    producer Mumbles' intricate arrangements on <i>Human Language</i>, but it's
    reassuring to hear Aceyalone pontificating like he once did: ""Some people,
    they live life inside a glass case/ Some people, they live life in the
    vastness of space/ And others will live long at a snail's pace/ I live with
    hardship slapping me in the face.""</p><p>
    
    Pavement's Stephen Malkmus endured similar criticism when his solo debut failed
    to continue in the experimental vein his former band had been heading prior to
    its demise. But Malkmus' love for the project and the joy brought about by his
    newfound musical freedom shone through. Sadly, the same cannot be said for
    Aceyalone.  <i>Accepted Eclectic</i> comes across as second-rate.  Sure, it's
    often funny, and occasionally exciting, but ultimately, the attention to detail
    inherent in previous works has been marked absent.</p><p>
    
    All this brings up the ages old argument: when an artist has created work that
    can only be called revolutionary, should his later efforts be held up against
    the work of his peers, or should his previous work be used as fodder for
    judgment? The question is still up in the air. But Aceyalone's case, he's
    asked for it. It's right there, in pure manifesto form, on the opening track
    of the very first Freestyle Fellowship album: ""Acknowledging rap as an art
    form, we break the rules and set new standards in the arena by experimenting
    in tonal and harmonic inflections and sporadic pitch changes and deliveries.
    We'll stir your emotion and take rap music to its threshold of enlightenment.""</p></div>"|17.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17-accepted-eclectic/|7.3|David M. Pecoraro

    the Iron Mask</i> all suffer from the same malady: each is considerably less
    than the sum of its parts.  You might blame the Blazers' woes on weak coaching.
    And you could pin that insufferable failure of a movie on the presence of not
    one, but two Dicaprios.  So why is it that, even though the individual
    ingredients of fruitcake are generally palatable, the final product is so
    repulsive?  Abilene, a moody, pensive outfit from Chicago benefits from a
    cohesion and synergy that elevate them far above the working of their
    individual components.  Gerard Depardieu and Rasheed Wallace take note.</p><p>
    
    For a trio, Abilene fill a great deal of space, and for the simplicity of
    their guitar/drums/bass arrangement, they're a remarkably dynamic group.
    They're busy, yet, at the same time, exemplars of the less-is-more school of
    songwriting.  The seedy, post-rock noir of the album's opening track, ""Detroit
    Locker,"" utilizes a quirky time signature and sparse, hushed vocals while
    relying heavily on the constant ting-ting of the ride cymbal and a sharp,
    foreboding guitar riff.</p><p>
    
    This 35-minute, six-song semi-album was recorded by Bill Skibbe, and Juan
    Carrera of the lamentably long-defunct Warmers from Washington, D.C.  But lest
    you assume otherwise, Abilene aren't as fixated on the D.C. sound, coming off
    more like a less self-consciously art-oriented ""Chicago band.""  Even at their
    relaxed, stoner tempo, Abilene kind of rock.</p><p>
    
    The oil that keeps this act running is, without a doubt, its mood. The music,
    even in its most rhythmically jagged moments, sways in slow, opioid motions.
    Credit the sound mixing for this effect. When not carrying on a melody of its
    own, the warm, well-phrased bass parts are buried deep in the mix, just loud
    enough to anchor the guitar parts, but never enough to infringe on Scott
    Adamson's bright, expressive drumming. ""October"" is perhaps the album's best
    moment from a sonic perspective. Only towards the song's end are the players
    allowed to come together at full volume to create a climactic din and provide
    a supporting fabric for a rare instance of yelling by Alex Dunham.</p><p>
<i>Abilene</i> brings to mind June of 44, and to some degree, its off-shoot
    the Letter E; it recalls the quiet but tenser moments of the former, and does
    so well what the latter could never pull of at all. A veritable musical gelding,
    the Letter E has, to date, sounded sterile, bloodless and totally devoid of
    passion; Abilene resides at the opposite end of the quality spectrum, playing
    a similarly ""jammy"" brand of music, but one that conveys feeling and a unified
    stance.  And there are very few vocals here, so it goes without saying that
    I'm not talking about a lyrical or philosophical stance. The instruments do
    seem to be ""speaking"" from the same place, functioning organically, and
    displaying a unity of purpose. The songs all have a strong sense of drama,
    nice interesting shapes, and a sort of narrative quality to them, too.</p><p>
    
    All that said, this is just a taste of, hopefully, more impressive things to
    come. So far, the trio has only shown that they work very well together. Though
    Dunham's vocals are pleasant and judiciously spaced, you sometimes get the
    feeling that the low sound levels are meant to mask his shortcomings rather
    than create a dramatic effect.  The music has enough going for it to pique my
    interest and is strong enough in its execution to warrant respect. I hope they
    keep following whatever it is that brought them to this point to a more
    confidently delineated musical identity.</p></div>"|12.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12-abilene/|7.0|Camilo Arturo Leslie

Flip a switch, twiddle a knob, 33 to 45,
    instant D&amp;B.;""  Tell this to a junglist, and he'll bite a chunk out of your
    arm.  Or, tell a punk that he's just listening to sped-up garage rock, or a
    hardcore devotee that his music is just even faster punk, and you'll be met
    with a similar response.</p><p>
    
    It's both temptingly simple and degrading to these genres to suggest that the
    speed they're defined by is simply a variable that can be tweaked to produce
    another style.  But what's often overlooked is how difficult tempo is to
    master; anyone who's ever been in a band can attest to the challenges involved
    in starting at the right speed and keeping a beat with three other people.
    And it's at the extremes of the tempo spectrum that some of the most musically
    thrilling artists reside, proving that speed can be seen not only as an
    aesthetic quality but also as a genuine aesthetic in itself.</p><p>
    
    Take Tokyo, Japan's Melt-Banana, for instance.  ""Free the Bee,"" the first
    track on the band's new album (somewhat unfortunately entitled <i>Teeny
    Shiny</i>) comes off as drum-n-bass.  Until you realize the drumming is live,
    and that what you thought were samples of police sirens are actually guitarist
    Agata's high-pitched string twistings.  The blindingly fast beat continues
    under a loopy guitar riff and vocalist Yasuko's barked rhymes, only to shift
    into an even higher gear when the crushing chorus hits.</p><p>
    
    As on Melt-Banana's previous four LPs, speed is the rule here.  Although
    continuing in the tradition of 1998's <i>Charlie</i>-- a savagely well-produced
    album that found the band's songs consistently stretching beyond the two-minute
    mark in search of more cohesive and varied song structures-- the band
    rediscovers the breathless energy of their earlier 25-song-apiece albums,
    <i>Scratch or Stitch</i> and <i>Speak, Squeak, Creak</i>.  Yasuko neatly
    demonstrates that speed isn't a function of testosterone as she spits out
    syllables chosen more for their sound than their sense.</p><p>
    
    Even when the main vocal or guitar part (the term ""melody"" doesn't quite fit)
    slows down, as on ""Lost in Mirror"" and ""Moon Flavor,"" the complex drum patterns
    churning underneath still seem detailed at the subatomic level.  The brittle,
    martial rhythms provide the perfect counterpart to Agata's amazingly versatile
    guitar work, which can change from staccato skullfuck to elastic playfulness
    in an instant.  In ""Third Attack,"" the guitarist imitates a turntable, a yappy
    little dog, and a power drill, all before the chorus kicks in.</p><p>
    
    Agata's playing invites comparisons to Rage Against the Machine's Tom Morello,
    and Yasuko's fixation on Public Enemy and Cypress Hill would seem to tie the
    group to the ""rap-rock"" movement.  Luckily, none of these comparisons come
    anywhere close to being accurate.  Though influences can be picked out of
    Melt-Banana's sound (most immediately, hardcore and noise-rock), the end
    product is wholly unique, seeming to subsist purely in the speed at which
    their music is played.</p><p>
    
    The band itself seems to be under a mortal imperative to work as fast as
    it can; the production certainly falls flat in comparison to <i>Charlie</i>,
    and it's a sure bet that the entire thing was slapped onto tape in a day or
    two between live shows.  Their constant touring is usually attributed by fans
    to Agata's ""rare blood malady,"" an unspecified but eventually fatal condition
    that spurs the band to play as many live shows as they can together.  These
    sources are a bit dubious; however, the guitarist fuels the rumors by wearing
    a surgical mask in concert.</p><p>
    
    For someone like me, though, whose biggest speed fix comes from playing along
    with the ""fast money"" round on ""Family Feud,"" this rough taste of pure energy
    beats half an hour with Louie Anderson any day of the week.</p></div>"|5217.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5217-teeny-shiny/|7.1|Brendan Reid

While it seems to suggest some kind of
    rational, mathematical explanation of chaos, it's really just a qualitative
    study, examining the properties of a system in a state of flux.  The most
    well-known application of chaos lies in the fractal, an ever-repeating
    geometric pattern based not on traditional shapes, but on complex, non-linear
    shapes.  Everything is offset by an immeasurable and elusive factor. And yet,
    out of the chaos, can come something as beautiful as a mandlebrot.</p><p>
    
    The chaos theory has been put to work for everything ranging from
    telecommunications to washing machines that use fuzzy logic circuits to
    attempt to untangle clothes moving in a chaotic fashion. Chaos theory and
    fractals have also been applied to music-- some of the algorithms that are
    used to create fractals have also been applied to the realm of sound.
    Unfortunately, the result is a complete disappointment when held up to the
    beauty of a fractal.</p><p>
    
    But those trying to get the sounds of chaos down on record, take heart. Put
    away your theoretical physics textbooks and graphing calculators, and pick
    up a copy of <i>Some Best Friend You Turned Out to Be</i>. Max Tundra's latest
    effort is undeniable proof that a record can be chaotic without succumbing to
    dissonance.</p><p>
    
    ""Cakes"" kicks off the album with an analog flute and snare drum segment that
    would be at home in a ""Legend of Zelda"" game. Seems innocent enough-- pleasant,
    but not that far from traditional electronic music. Soon, however, the song
    shifts its structure completely, employing a drum machine beat and a piano
    track that seem to have little, if anything, to do with each other musically.
    And when you think you've got the segment figured out, the drum machine gives
    way to a blissful synthesizer loop, and ambiguous drones call to you from
    beyond. Suddenly, as the song begins to shift back towards its second segment,
    an elephantine trumpet comes out of nowhere, blasting the track, and your
    expectations, to smithereens.</p><p>
    
    The album's second track, ""Lamplite on a One Horse Shoe,"" opens with a
    seemingly random analog mantra. Like the greatest works of electronic
    minimalism, that relatively simple figure is built upon, added to, and
    transformed until it becomes something different, but retains a discernible
    similarity to its original.</p><p>
    
    But the real beauty of <i>Some Best Friend You Turned Out to Be</i> isn't in
    its electronic segments, but in the fact that the album doesn't limit itself
    to electronic elements. Instead of creating a record using all analog
    synthesizers, all samplers, or all acoustic instruments, Max Tundra has
    crafted an album that uses all three. ""6161"" uses lo-fi, reverb-doused
    guitars, xylophones, and layer upon layer of crusty analog synthesizers
    to construct a sonic collage of mammoth proportions. But what makes the
    track truly stand out is the amazing melodic complexity demonstrated--
    what seems like hundreds of individual, unrelated melodies adding up to
    an alarmingly cohesive whole.</p><p>
    
    The 11-minute ""Carbon Cones"" serves as the perfect closer, and summary, of
    <i>Some Best Friend You Turned Out to Be</i>. At times explosive, at times
    meditative, and always putting to use an eclectic series of acoustic and
    synthetic instruments.   Due to its at times overwhelming nature, it would
    be natural to put something here to the effect of ""this record is not for
    everyone."" But to say that would be ridiculous-- this is the kind of dynamic,
    creative record that should be heard by as many people as possible. Though
    it occasionally resembles electronic minimalism, <i>Some Best Friend You
    Turned Out to Be</i> is the first of its kind: a true maximalist record.</p></div>"|5159.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5159-some-best-friend-you-turned-out-to-be/|9.2|Matt LeMay

""quare id
    faciam fortasse requiris? nescio sed fieri sentio et excrucior.""  Translating,
    with some artistic license, as, ""I hate and love [Autechre].  Perhaps you're
    asking why I do that?  I don't know, but I feel it happening, and am racked.""
    Of course, Catullus didn't have Autechre in mind when he wrote this poem, but
    I had this poem in mind when I heard <i>Peel Session 2</i>. Generally, I love
    Rob Brown and Sean Booth, the English duo that comprises Autechre. But at the
    moment I hate them and am exhausted, because I have to describe their sound.</p><p>
    
    Nearly every comparison the critics use to describe Autechre seems terribly
    desperate, from architecture to computer source code to virtual landscapes.
    But this is not by any fault of the critic. The difficulty of Autechre's music
    is surpassed only by the difficulty of describing it. Nonetheless, the attempt
    must be made, so critics invariably use any number of the following words:
    blips, bleeps, farts, echoes, sparkle, skitter, clanks, pulses, drone, chopped,
    synapses, and on and on. These words may as well be Latin. But rest assured,
    I'm no different: plenty of them undoubtedly will appear below.</p><p>
    
    And so the inevitable attempt, however futile, begins.  This four-song,
    27-minute EP, which was originally broadcast on September 9, 1999, opens with
    ""Gelk."" (It should be noted that the song titles were chosen by John Peel
    because the audio masters delivered to Radio 1 contained none.) The track
    begins calmly with a trotting beat, analog hiss, and an occasional bass pulse
    that raises static as if the music were played through blown speakers. Foreign
    synths chime in, and a piano descends into the sonic plane just as the
    keyboards turn intergalactic, flickering out of earshot in perpetual
    reverberation. But nothing too surprising.</p><p>
    
    Then ""Gelk"" turns ominous. Deep synths set the dark tone, but the thickened
    beat, no longer clean now but crackling and popping, sends the song into the
    dungeon. Given the gurgling and indecipherable whispering, there must a
    deformed creature down here, maybe Sloth or the Gimp. The song soon strips
    down to one single sound, which most nearly resembles someone plucking the
    low strings of a grand piano. A more standard beat ends the interlude, as
    does what might as well be considered electronic steel drums, and soon the
    track is washed over by distant crashes, like Godzilla and King Kong playing
    soccer with a Zildjian delivery truck. When it finally ends, you realize
    you've almost run the full gamut of emotion.</p><p>
    
    The next three tracks, unfortunately, aren't quite as varied or complex.
    Before you can even digest ""Gelk,"" the raucous ""Blifil"" breaks in with a
    more furious and uneven beat, thick drones, and muffled, chopped vocals. But
    the song barely progresses from there; the only other significant addition is
    droplets of digital water. Still, by the end of the track, one does sense that,
    over the course of seven minutes, Autechre have taken you from an underground
    dig to an extraterrestrial voyage.</p><p>
    
    The clacks that open ""Gaekwad"" consistently stutter and fizzle out like a
    spinning coin coming to rest.  Other sounds reminiscent of creaking doors and
    radiators fill in the background noise. More steel drum-like notes and ghostly
    ambient whines keep the ear trailing along, and eventually, trebled beats skip
    in to carry the tune. When mellow synths, orchestral stutters, and high-pitched
    pings achieve melody over the skittering beat, <i>Peel Session 2</i> achieves
    its most Aphex-like moment. But the cackling and wheezing that soon interrupt
    make this the only obvious and direct comparison on the EP.</p><p>
    
    Then there's the aptly-titled ""19 Headaches."" Some might say it's avant-IDM,
    but isn't IDM avant enough?  I say it's Brown and Booth doing their best
    Phish impression-- digital jamming, if you will.  The same skittering sounds
    are here, in addition to a synth straight out of ""3-2-1 Contact."" Sounds chirp
    into the foreground like pikas popping their heads out of a rock bed. Like
    these small, darting mammals, ""19 Headaches"" is at first interesting, then
    uncompelling, and finally, annoying.</p><p>
    
    This effort could almost be called lo-fi drill-n-bass, if there were such a
    thing. Perhaps their grittiest work to date, the EP is always worn raw by
    fuzz, static, or hiss-- a sharp contrast to the clarity of efforts such as
    <i>Tri Repetae++</i>, which rests on the opposite end of Autechre's oeuvre.
    Still, although <i>Peel Session 2</i> is uneven and oftentimes bears similarity
    to their less-popular work (<i>Chiastic Slide</i> and <i>EP7</i>, for instance),
    we should nonetheless consider ourselves fortunate that, unlike Latin, this
    music has yet to bastardized out of existence.</p></div>"|360.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/360-peel-session-2-ep/|6.9|Ryan Kearney

You won't be able to dip niftily into Cole Haan
    for a pair of pumps without being brushed by Tracey Thorn's morose vocals or
    Ben Watt's primed-for-Lazy-Dog deep house setting. But why is it boutique
    music? What drives floor managers at Banana Republic to slide EBTG discs into
    the store system and expect the crepe de chine blouses to breeze out the store?
    Before hypothesizing on that one, I'd like to examine why ""Lullaby of Clubland""
    and many other post-<i>Missing</i> EBTG songs are perfect disco.</p><p>
    
    Disco's initial power was its diversity. Before the term denoted a style, it
    marked out a feeling. What was the common thread between Michael Olatunji's
    ""Drums of Passion"" and the Temptation' ""Cloud Nine?"" Though they might
    arguably share the same low-budget production values, they both reflect an
    underground sensation.</p><p>
    
    After the 1969 Stonewall riots, when the love that
    still could not speak its name burst out onto the sidewalks and right in the
    public's dropped-jawed face, gay men found that they wanted to have tremendous
    fun together and be open about their lifestyle.  The fact that, before then, any
    encounters had a distinctly clandestine buzz about them was admittedly mild
    arousing, but anyone so engaged could easily end up in a drunk tank or holding
    cell with some very unattractive bedmates. Juice bars and gay-owned
    establishments relished the newly grasped visibility and gave their clientele
    a place that wouldn't make them vulnerable to public scrutiny and loathing.</p><p>
    
    The music that blasted out of these places was R&amp;B;, heavy rock, psychedelic
    soul-- anything that had either an outsider vibe or a message of liberation
    and hope. It's no surprise that the flag of the queer nation is the rainbow of
    ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" promise.</p><p>
    
    But soon, the price of visibility and exposure had to be paid, and the retreat
    kicked in-- just as the so-called gay plague began to rob cities like New York
    and San Francisco of their sons. At this very time, disco had become the
    monster that forced Rod Stewart and the Rolling Stones to fashion their own
    disco tunes just to appear au courant. Culture, like nature, obeys Newton's
    Third Law: for every action there's an equal an opposite reaction.</p><p>
    
    Underground dance tunes still expressed hope, but now as more and more
    clubbers got sick, a cruel and stalking dramatic irony leaked into the
    uplifting grooves. No record expresses this ambivalent reality than Machine's
    ""There But for the Grace of God."" Other tunes, such as DC La Rue's almost
    tribal anthem, ""Cathedrals,"" express regret for past behaviors and a reticence
    to give those habits up entirely. This melancholy marks the second and more
    enduring wave of disco classics. Melancholy mixed into euphoric rump-shaking
    tunes is a potent force and one that speaks to our mortality.</p><p>
    
    Of course, an entire night of songs about how there's a Hell below and we're
    all going to die would bum out even Kant's philosophical brain. But you can
    find a fine thread of this introspection in the songs of Pet Shop Boys and
    the turbine house of Felix da Housekatt.</p><p>
    
    Everything But the Girl fit into this aesthetic perfectly. Before their
    conversion to club music, the duo's jazz-folk miserablism made them favorites
    for barflys who sank brews with Sade's <i>Diamond Life</i> in the background.
    The rest of us found their albums fussy, overly concerned with throwing jazz
    shapes, and way too art-schooly. But translate Thorn's lyrical preoccupations
    into a heavy house setting, and you're guaranteed to come up with club classic
    after club classic. It's all about the context, after all.</p><p>
    
    Because of the winning juxtaposition of Thorn's moaning on about being a
    mixed-up lonely kid who can't even get a shag off a soaked beardy-weirdy
    jazznik, and some stylin' deep house, Everything But the Girl have been
    surrounded by folks who wouldn't have even pissed on them previously. How
    must they be grateful to Todd Terry for opening their ears to house!</p><p>
    
    So why do you find yourself tearing up when shopping in Sephora? Is it
    because your arch-rival in eyeliner, Gabby Glickman, has sashayed off with the
    last bottle of ""No, I'm not really a waitress"" nail polish? Maybe. But more
    likely, the shrewd floor manager has put this disc on. You will part with
    money. You will have been targeted out for extreme credit card abuse. You
    will be sobbing not in spite of your appreciation of the inherent genius of
    EBTG's funky mopeyness, but directly because of it. Studies in fashion
    boutiques consistently prove that Tracey and Ben sell slingbacks. They also
    charm the pants off of me. But you wouldn't want to go near any of my
    fervidly discarded skootz, I assure you.</p></div>"|2856.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2856-lullaby-of-clubland-ep/|7.7|Paul Cooper

According to my old college
    Spanish textbook, it translates as follows:</p><p>
<i>pelo</i> - n. 1. hair, coat of animal, down, fiber  2. hair trigger
    3.  triffle, nap, color of a horse  4. hairpiece, toupee</p><p>
    
    In the case of the Aluminum Group's fourth release, I'd wager the rug
    definition is the most apt.  They're both kitschy, questionable, and
    suggest a lifestyle that's usually the butt of jokes.  But the vain man
    who dons a toupee is convinced it looks great, no matter how weighty the
    evidence to the contrary.  It's the sort of affected sophistication that
    the Aluminum Group has raised to an artform.  But it begs the question:
    ""Just <i>why</i> exactly?""</p><p>
<i>Pelo</i> finds the influences of brothers John and Frank Navin firmly
    in place, if not their caliber of songwriting.  The Aluminum Group sound
    is evident in every track, every lyric, every nuance.  This shit is as
    smooth as a Bacharach's ass.  It's a soundtrack to a 70s made-for-TV
    movie, but a quality one-- something like <i>Brian's Song</i> or <i>Sybil</i>,
    not that <i>Boy in the Plastic Bubble</i> tripe.</p><p>
    
    Some of the first few tracks are a little more daring than previous efforts
    by the Navins.  Though not quite worthy of the adjective ""experimental"",
    they're definitely a departure for the group, who work in sampled noise
    and dancier beats on the opener, ""Pussycat"".  But <i>Pelo</i> settles into
    its form-fitting, comfy oeuvre soon enough.  The too-rich bass in ""If You've
    Got a Lover, You've Got Life"" gets the groove going early and is among the
    highlights of the disc.</p><p>
    
    Ultimately, though, <i>Pelo</i> is a triumph of average-- a zero-sum game.
    The few noteworthy tracks are negated by the bombs.  For every standout,
    rare as they are, there are embarrassing nadirs like ""Tom of Finland
    (An Homage)"".  Nobody had any business wasting perfectly good studio time
    ensuring that this turkey made it onto plastic.  But maybe I assume too
    much.  Perhaps the intended ""homage"" was slap-in-the-face sarcastic-- so
    intentionally bad that Tom has rolled over in his grave with an embarrassed
    grimace.</p><p>
    
    Equally weak is the clumsily titled ""Good-Bye Goldfish, Hi Piranha"", a
    song that dramatically builds only to crescendo with the brief, impotent
    lyric: ""I took advantage of your honor/ In the cellophane/ What looks like
    one thing/ You bought cocaine but got flour"".  This is part of the problem
    with <i>Pelo</i>; the bad stuff is ultimately more memorable than the good.</p><p>
    
    Say what you will about the Aluminum Group; they certainly are earnest. Whether
    or not they're misguided is irrelevant.  Just as there's no sense in arguing
    religion or politics at the dinner table, one gets the sense that any persuasions
    attempting to get the Aluminum Group to see the error of their ways would be at
    least equally futile.  Their resolve even makes me doubt myself.  Perhaps rock
    will wane and disappear, leaving odd niche bands like the Aluminum Group vindicated.
    Vindicated, but very, very alone.</p></div>"|139.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/139-pelo/|5.0|John Dark

    Peter Gabriel should call his next album <i>Peter Gabriel Makes Grown Men
    Cry</i>. To this day, I'm not exactly sure how he meant that. Either:</p><p>
    #1: Gabriel's songs have apparently continued to be so heart-wrenchingly
    emotional that men still shed tears simply at the sound of his voice.</p><p>
    #2: He's such an anal perfectionist that it's taken him years to craft
    his latest studio album, and fans, as well as record execs, weep with
    frustration.</p><p>
    As for the frustration thing, it's been eight years, and Gabriel still
    hasn't finished it.  2000, however, did see the release of a new UK-only
    Peter Gabriel record titled <i>OVO: The Millennium Show</i>. The album is
    technically a soundtrack to the disastrous Millennium Dome show that
    occurred in England a year ago.  Just as Geffen attempted to convince the
    public that Beck's <i>Mutations</i> was not an ""official"" follow-up to
    <i>Odelay</i>, <i>OVO</i> is being deemed ""not the official follow-up to
    1992's <i>Us</i>"". So, what's a fan to do, except simply take this as
    consolation for four-fifths of a decade of waiting?</p><p>
    For one, they can hope that the real album is better.  <i>OVO</i> has its
    moments, sure, but it's also fairly inconsistent.  The sentiment and plot--
    yes, there's a plot-- is, in fact, so hackneyed it's hard to believe that
    Berg Implication #1 could be the case.  Despite all this, Gabriel does at
    times come through: a little over half of the record ranks alongside his
    early 90s work.  Had the rest been cut, <i>OVO</i>'s runtime would weigh
    in at 20 minutes less, but because they're all here, their mediocrity
    preserved in plastic for all time, the album's pitfalls prevent it from
    gaining consistency and cohesiveness.</p><p>
    According to the liner notes, Gabriel has recruited some of his ""favourite
    voices"" to sing the bulk of <i>OVO</i>'s material.  The female presence is
    welcome; like Kate Bush and Sinéad O'Connor before them, Iarla O Lionaird
    and the Cocteau Twins' Elizabeth Fraser provide a lovely, sensual atmosphere
    to their cuts.  When Richie Havens and Paul Buchanan pop up, though, it's
    unclear why Gabriel, whose vocals would have lent themselves infinitely
    better to these songs, didn't just sing them himself.</p><p>
    ""The Story of OVO"" opens the album with promising, ethnically rich
    accompaniment, until Rasco (??) and Neneh Cherry start rapping.  In the
    more than thirty years Peter Gabriel has been recording, he's never before
    written a rap, and it becomes clear immediately: ""A long time ago in a far
    away land/ There was a man/ Who learned to understand.""  The Gabriel-sung
    chorus and the rhythmic closing almost make the trite lyrics worth enduring.
    Okay, they don't.</p><p>
    But that's somewhat easily forgiven with a casual press of the 'skip' button.
    The first half's only major standout, ""Low Light"", follows with a beautiful
    ambient feel and an intro previewing the orchestral melody of a later track,
    the musically stunning ""Downside-Up"". ""The Time of the Turning"" sounds nice
    initially, but ultimately reveals itself as mediocre, with Havens and Fraser
    taking lead vocals on a generally forgettable melody. ""The Weavers' Reel""
    pairs a reprise of ""Turning"" with a formulaic, lifeless Celtic reel, augmented
    with an unforgivably cheesy dance beat. And ""Father, Son"" attempts to go the
    way of Gabriel's previous ballads, but with such a saccharine sentiment and
    ordinary melody, it goes the way of elevator music.</p><p>
    It's after this track that the line of demarcation from indifference to actual
    greatness becomes apparent, since the next song sets a new standard of quality
    which is ultimately fulfilled by <i>OVO</i>'s remainder.  ""The Tower That Ate
    People"" is Gabriel's funkiest track since ""Sledgehammer"", with growling verse
    vocals, phased guitars, overdriven organ, and a gorgeously haunting bridge
    melody. ""Revenge"" follows flawlessly with a breathtakingly strong, layered
    rhythm by African drum group The Dhol Foundation. And the 10-minute closing
    collaboration with electronic artist BT, ""Make Tomorrow"", is consistently
    enjoyable throughout its extravagant running time, bearing enough melodic and
    tonal changes to keep the listener interested.</p><p>
    But the best track by far arrives just before the ending. ""Downside-Up"" is,
    melodically, one of the best songs in Gabriel's entire catalog-- and it was
    a damn strong catalog to begin with.  The banal lyrics keep it from joining
    the ranks of his other classics, but the fluidity and richness of the chorus
    melody, and the skilled, outstanding guitar line that enters at the bridge,
    makes it a strong contender.</p><p>
<i>OVO</i> should nicely tide over you longtime fans until the eventual
    release of the forthcoming <i>Up</i>.  It's inconsistent, though, and at
    times overbearingly trite, but it does contain some surprisingly effective
    material.  If nothing else, the $30 import tag is a better bargain for the
    obsessive fan than a plane ticket to Britain.</p></div>"|3373.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3373-ovo-the-millennium-show/|6.8|Spencer Owen

    Canada compound. Notoriously journalist-shy (they're rumored to run screaming
    into haggis-infested forests at the sound of an incoming fax), Michael Sandison
    and Marcus Eoin leave it to their records to inform us of their politics, their
    preferred abandonments, and the ill winds that blow through the purple-heathered
    glen.</p><p>
    But those expecting a poorly judged foray into two-step garage will be crushingly
    disappointed, as <i>In a Beautiful Place Out in the Country</i> runs like updated
    material from their majestic 1998 offering, <i>Music Has the Right to Children</i>.
    And like that album's namesake, these five elegantly mournful melodies creep and
    explore like adored but unruly children, full of wide-eyed astonishment and naïveté.
    These songs speak to those of us who've bartered our innocence for the experience
    of rent payments, asinine bosses, rolling blackouts, and a suborned democracy.</p><p>
    After the effortless, ingratiating simplicity of the record's opener, ""Kid for
    Today"", Sandison and Eoin roll out the heavier bass of ""Amo Bishop Roden"".
    Though the song is easily the most groove-dependent on <i>A Beautiful Place</i>,
    the duo nicely retain their electro-agrarianism-- a strain of folk music I've
    yearned for since Ultramarine abandoned the Fairport Convention-styled techno
    of <i>Every Man and Every Woman Is a Star</i>.</p><p>
    When Boards of Canada's acknowledged appreciation for the laughter of children
    opens the vocodered titled track, it's as though Daft Punk's ""One More Time""
    had calmed down and realized it forgot to have a childhood.  This track, like
    ""Kid for Today"", stands as a persuasive reminder to grown-ups that it's alright
    to lead simple lives, free from adornment.  The vocoder is a little hackneyed--
    its lifespan as a relevant music-enhancing device has officially drawn to a
    close-- but there's a distinct ""innocent abroad"" aesthetic here that many
    bands seem too media-savvy and advert-aware to pull off convincingly. (When the
    Boards of Canada protest that they never meant to become as huge as they have,
    I believe them-- Belle &amp; Sebastian these Scots are not.)</p><p>
<i>In a Beautiful Place Out in the Country</i> concludes with ""Zoetrope"", a
    slowly revolving pastiche of minimalist melodies and Eno/Lanois ambience.
    There are no children's voices and no tunes reflecting wonderment-- just an
    echoing cleansing of the palette.  Perhaps they'll shock us when they return
    with a violently beautiful, Alec Empire-inspired remake of the Minutemen's
    <i>Double Nickels on the Dime</i> next year.  Or perhaps they'll just carry
    on doing that at which they excel: creating the music of innocent eyes.</p></div>"|835.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/835-in-a-beautiful-place-out-in-the-country-ep/|8.9|Paul Cooper

It's no different than yesterday,
    the day before, or last year.  But they don't need your sympathy-- not yours
    or anybody's.  They live for it.  After all, it's what allowed them the means
    to record their debut full-length, the angstfully titled <i>Fuck Fight
    Fail</i>.  It's all very dramatic.</p><p>
    
    During the course of eight songs, these guys mourn their way to personal
    fitness over dramatic, synthesized string sections, weeping guitar and
    the occasional airy effects.  But rather than whining overwrought emo
    sentiments about dark Septembers and forgotten mix tapes, Kepler go in for
    darker and artier statements like, ""There's blood on the sidewalk/ Bones
    behind the garbage.""  Alright, so the emocore has left some kind of
    impression on these guys, and it shows up in their songs from time to
    time.  Kepler, however, are closer in execution to traditional slowcore
    outfits like Codeine and Rex than burgeoning monstrosities Sense Field
    and Fireside.</p><p>
<i>Fuck Fight Fail</i> opens with the glistening, minute-and-a-half-long
    instrumental ""I Will Not Return Your Records"", spotlighting Jeremy Gara's
    glossy guitarwork and Michael Sheridan on 'space machine.'  ""Light House""
    follows the tidal, almost shoegazer ""Loose Ground"", with frontman Jonathan
    Georgekish-Watt delivering the refrain ""Everyday, my sentence is remanded/
    My execution is stayed"" over wind chime guitar and ex-Pitchforker Samir
    Khan's cello-like basslines.  The record's highlight, though, comes in
    the dead center, with ""Upper Canada Fight Song"".  Over nine minutes, the
    song gradually builds to a Godspeed-esque crescendo that peaks with crashing
    cymbals and huge drums that drown out nearly every other element.</p><p>
    
    So, yeah.  Kepler are better than I'd hoped they might be, despite the
    melodramatic flair for song titles like ""The Way You Fall Apart"", and a
    bandname that references that astronomer guy who discovered that planets
    move in elliptical paths.  Still, they could stand to shed some of their
    emo tendencies in lieu of something a little more artistically viable.
    <i>Fuck Fight Fail</i>'s louder territory, and even its more 4AD areas,
    are really the album's shining moments.  Regardless, the boys have got
    a great deal of promise, and their next album will likely shock this one
    into submission.</p></div>"|4403.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4403-fuck-fight-fail/|7.4|Ryan Schreiber

    similar instrumentals, ""Danelectro 2"" and ""3,"" built on the group's now
    trademark sound of atmospheric keyboards, reverbed guitar plunking, distant
    feedback and Georgia Hubley's always brilliant, subtle drumming.  They seem
    to head further into an almost post-rock territory (albeit of the melodic
    Mogwai type) than their previous records.  Still, the songs bear much
    resemblance to the hazy, dusky, organic atmosphere of <i>And Then Nothing
    Turned Itself Inside-Out</i>, during which sessions these songs were recorded.</p><p>
    
    The two songs lull me into a dreamlike state before I'm jarred awake by the
    intro of <i>Danelectro</i>'s first remix, by the Arsonists' Q-Unique.  As
    with any Arsonists track, it begins with terribly rote DJ scratching, and
    here, seems to follow the 'rock remix' formula to a T.  Sorry, but the last
    thing these songs needed was rank turntablism.  The track ends up a jarring
    contrast to the previous two, with quick cuts and electronic percussion, and
    within seconds has shattered the atmosphere established by the band.</p><p>
    
    Kit Clayton's remix opens <i>Danelectro</i>'s second half, following the form
    of the previous, by simply abandoning much of the smooth texture of the
    original in favor of rough cuts and synthetic textures.  ""Danelectro 1""
    follows, which provides a smooth transition into Nobukazu Takemura's 11-minute
    remix of ""Danelectro 2,"" the most effective remix presented here.  He adds
    some subtle polyrhythmic percussion layers and keyboard effects which bring
    the whole thing closer to Tortoise brand post-rock.  While it can't really be
    considered an improvement, it at least retains the atmosphere and feel of the
    original.</p><p>
    
    Nothing on this EP is particularly awful-- Yo La Tengo certainly can't be
    blamed for their efforts-- but sometimes things are better left unremixed.
    The sequencing is overwhelmingly tacky, and really, how often do you think
    you'll find yourself in the mood for Takemura's epic reworking of a vaulted
    Yo La Tengo instrumental?  The record has its moments of beauty, but in the
    end, it fails to add up to a satisfying whole.</p></div>"|8869.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8869-danelectro-ep/|6.3|D. Erik Kempke

    loopy spirit of early '60s psychedelia. But just because you slap a
    Hammond organ on top of some garage-buzz guitar, toss in a backward solo,
    and hand a tambourine to a band member's girlfriend, it doesn't mean you're
    suddenly the Kinks, or even Strawberry Alarm Clock.  Are you listening,
    Asteroid Numberfour?
    If you're going to be copping moves from the same moribund genre that spawned
    ""Austin Powers"" and his many oft-repeated catchphrases, you'd better have
    some style of your own to bring to the party.</p><p>
    
    Bands like the Olivia Tremor Control, Guided By Voices and the Lilys can get
    away with this kind of thing because they have passion, skill, and the knack
    for a catchy pop hook. Asteroid Numberfour seem to think that hiring the
    Lilys' Kurt Heasley to co-produce the five songs on <i>Apple Street</i>
    will get them by.  Well, guys, the genius didn't exactly rub off. At least
    Heasley did his job well, since <i>Apple Street</i> has enough little flourishes
    to pass for a reasonably authentic replica. But it never sounds like the band
    cares at all about originality, or has any remotely compelling reasons for
    making music.</p><p>
    
    And that's not even the bad news.  You want the bad news?  Here it is: <i>Apple
    Street</i> sucks, and it sucks hard. Not because the music isn't well written
    or because there's so little effort put forth, but because it's shot through
    with the kind of sneering condescension and vapid posturing that makes Marilyn
    Manson seem earnest. Take the tired, by-the-numbers scenester-dissing
    of
    ""Local Fashion Junky"": astoundingly, Asteroid Numberfour makes us feel
    sorry
    for the title character when jeering, ""If you're feeling lonely/ There's no
    need to cry, I'll tell you why/ You should hear the way we talk about you.""
    I don't think I need to point out the irony here.</p><p>
    
    Then there's the sickeningly saccharine flute solos on ""Poor Man's Falls"" which
    manage to turn a half-baked portrait of go-nowhere small-town life into
    something almost reprehensibly exploitative. Why don't I believe a word you
    sing, Asteroid Numberfour? Perhaps the cynical lyrics and bouncy pop melodies
    works for countless other bands, but you just fail miserably at it. Get the
    fuck out of my sight.</p></div>"|325.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/325-apple-street-ep/|2.6|Nick Mirov

Tucked away in my room, with my computer,
    CD player, and digital Casio keyboard, I laughed at the fools who wasted their cash on
    fuzzy-sounding crap that can be almost perfectly replicated by software.  I would chuckle
    to myself whenever I saw some poor sap dropping a grand on a vintage keyboard. After all,
    for a mere 200 smackeroos, all the sounds on that big, bulky keyboard, along with many
    others, can be compacted onto a small, friendly CD-ROM.</p><p>
    
    This summer, all that changed. I was at a Guitar Center in New Jersey, and I spotted a
    compact, odd-looking keyboard from across the room. That day, I fell in love with a 1985
    Korg Poly-800, a bizarre digital-analog hybrid made immensely popular by its powerful
    circuitry and affordable price. That, and the pitch bend joystick.  Mmmmm...</p><p>
    
    As soon as I brought my new love object home, I immediately understood the appeal of analog,
    especially as it relates to the creation of bizarre, quirky sounds. Something about
    knob-twiddling, or even compulsive button-pushing, just seems much more conducive to
    creative sound creation than sitting in front of a computer and clicking repeatedly.</p><p>
    
    If you don't believe me, check out Add N to (X)'s debut album, <i>On the Wires of Our
    Nerves</i>, or to a lesser extent, their second album, <i>Avant Hard</i>. On these two
    albums, especially the former, the three members of Add N to (X) seemed to have a
    complete grasp over the infinite orgasmic joy of the analog synthesizer. On these albums,
    abrasive, insane sounds were extracted from a variety of analog synth sources, making for
    some of the damned coolest electronic music to grace the 1990s.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, the appeal of the analog synthesizer, like so many other toys, can't last
    forever. There are only so many parameters that can be edited, so many filters that can be
    applied, and so many oscillators that can be, uh, oscillated, before the newness wears off,
    and you find yourself seeking out ""new directions."" Uh-oh.</p><p>
<i>Add Insult to Injury</i> is the first Add N to (X) record to sound in the least bit
    forced. On both of their previous records, the plethora of amazing sounds incorporated,
    combined with some completely crazy ""songwriting,"" made for a truly exciting listen. Here,
    we see the group at a loss for new ideas and recycling strikingly similar melodies, sounds,
    and song structures over the course of 12 tracks.</p><p>
<i>Add Insult to Injury</i>'s greatest weakness comes with the formula which seems to have
    generated about 1/3 of the songs on the album-- a vaguely surfish bassline, drums that would
    sound at home in cheesy 70's soundtracks, and sadly ambiguous synthesizer sounds. Yes, it's
    a cute formula, and it's in some ways more accessible than Add N to (X)'s earlier works. But
    there is a huge structural problem with this formula: by applying the same bass and drum
    backbone to slightly different songs, the awesome analog synthesizer noises that once
    constituted the bread and butter of the group's sound now seem to float aimlessly over the
    song, resulting in a disjointed mess.</p><p>
    
    Despite this giant flaw, <i>Add Insult to Injury</i> does have a few exceptional moments. The
    funky ""Pokerole"" is one of the finest songs the group has penned, as is the album's single,
    the Bruce Haack-esque ""Plug Me In."" The album's closing track, ""The Regent is Dead,"" is also
    pretty cool, utilizing a fucked-up analog marching band sound and some high-pitched, squelching
    blasts of pure analog joy.</p><p>
    
    So it turns out that <i>Add Insult to Injury</i> may be a more apt title than the group had
    planned. For those of you disappointed by <i>Avant Hard</i>, this record may very well be the
    final straw. It's sad to hear a group that once had so much potential descend on a slippery
    slope towards mediocrity. Thus, <i>Add Insult to Injury</i> serves as a disappointing reminder
    that sounding cool can only get you so far.</p></div>"|51.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/51-add-insult-to-injury/|5.9|Matt LeMay

    than Plus 8 picking up my squelching scorcher.</p><p>
    
    With partner John Aquaviva, Hawtin cherry-picked the foremost in Detroit-style
    cyber-sheened techno. It was Plus 8 that introduced the world to Speedy J,
    Vapourspace, the Kooky Scientist, and Hawtin's own abstract acid alter ego,
    Plastikman. Most of the label's releases can rightly be called classics. For
    instance, Vapourspace's <i>Gravitational Arch of Ten</i> remains one of the
    most soulful of all techno records.  And who could not be wowed by Kenny
    Larkin's sumptuous bleep-n-beat roller, ""Colony?""</p><p>
    
    These three compilation discs break down the seven years of Plus 8's existence,
    there's a definite sense of a house style that comes with listening to them in
    succession. Hawtin's roster kept to the cyber-Detroit blueprint drawn up by Juan
    Atkins and Derrick May. In the label's life, it didn't deviate like Warp or
    Rephlex. Not that deviating is in any way an unsound strategy. Immersing yourself
    in these compilations, you're without doubt immersing yourself in an unmistakable,
    immaculately constructed vision of the future.</p><p>
    
    Talking about purity is a particularly pitfall-laden pastime, but it's to be said
    that from Cybersonik's ""Technarchy"" to Theorem's ""Mantra One"" Plus 8 delivered
    consistently pure product. Come to think even harder about it, Plus 8 tracks, in
    some ways, are remixes of each other. And, yes, just like any Dr. Moreau-type
    experimentation, the Plus 8 catalog does have a few mutations and chimeras. But
    unlike chimeras in the natural world, they're more than welcome in art.  Hawtin's
    own ""Substance Abuse"" (recorded under his FUSE moniker) is one such luridly
    fascinating aberration, and the soundclash between FUSE and LFO (merely titled
    ""Loop"") pretty much constructed the ideal filtered loop track that so many have
    been borrowing from since.</p><p>
    
    But the masterpiece on these discs is certainly Plastikman's ""Spastik."" Created with
    nothing more than a epileptic drum machine, the track is like having a synchronized
    helicopter display team waltz and tango around your brain. It's like Bach's <i>Goldberg 
    Variations</i>, or Steve Reich's <i>Music for Twelve Musicians</i>, in that it
    explores all possibilities within a given musical constraint, whether that be Baroque
    aria, American minimalism, or Detroit techno. If for nothing else, Hawtin will long
    be revered for ""Spastik.""</p><p>
    
    After Hawtin closed up Plus 8 in 1997, he established M_Nus, an outlet for minimal,
    highly textured, less club-orientated material. Was he biding his time? Is the world
    now ready for the return of Plus 8?  Ah, what the hell, when shit's this good, bring
    it on, anyway!</p></div>"|1957.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1957-plus-8-classics-1990-1997/|7.7|Paul Cooper

    lark is the extreme baseline technique. Let me explain. In my life, I've
    exposed myself to extreme situations, not out of nonchalance regarding my own
    mortality or for the masochistic thrill of risk, but so that I may have an
    extensive archive of abnormal experiences with which to judge every moment I
    walk this Earth.</p><p>
    In order to judge pain, I contracted a rare meningeal condition. In searing,
    cortex-rupturing agony, I suffered experimental surgery. Now when I get a
    boo-boo, I run my fingers through the still-springy-to-the-touch furrows in
    my skull and console myself that the minor injury could be a whole lot worse.
    When I was in college, I witnessed the most drunk a human male could become
    and live. My housemates and I, having relished 746 quarts of Carlsberg Special
    Brew, forgot to pass out. Instead, I watched as two of them repeatedly threw
    themselves down a flight of stairs. Needless to say, the morning after was not
    only heralded with a bastard-behind-the-eyes hangover, but also major contusions
    and 48-hour paralysis.</p><p>
    When reviewing, I also use extreme baselines of excellence as well as ones of
    disgust.  These reviewing baselines are pan-genre and are obvious. <i>Pet
    Sounds</i>, Otis Reading's <i>Otis Blue</i>, and Pale Saints' <i>The Comforts
    of Madness</i> at one extreme; Anthea's <i>Words and Beats</i> and Yes'
    <i>Tales From the Topographic Oceans</i> at the other.</p><p>
    So where does Jamie Lidell's debut album, <i>Muddlin Gear</i>, fit?  Upon first
    listen, all but those of you who wake up to Merzbow would term <i>Muddlin Gear</i>
    ""unlistenable spunkjazztossfrenzyfuckshite,"" and would prefer to deal with a
    suppurating glans rather than suffer a rewind of that spastic electronic crap.
    But let me tell you, a burst bell-end is a whole lot less enjoyable than
    <i>Muddlin Gear</i>.</p><p>
    I agree that, initially, Lidell's record is a tempest of fuzz, 220bpm jungle
    beats, and interplanetary lounge jazz. But once you get past the gag reflex,
    you can delve deeper into the album's tight constructions which only <i>seem</i>
    to blast apart.  Lidell's time as one half of Super_Collider, with the skillful
    Cristian Vogel, should have been a giveaway that he don't produce nothing if
    not a sweet smelling turd.</p><p>
    Where Vogel's <i>Rescate 137</i> album, released about the same time as
    <i>Muddlin Gear</i>, toned down the frenetic runaway towtruck beats and
    scorching beams of white noise, Lidell's album conceals the delicacy with
    heavily splenetic tricks. And beauty abounds during the record, but it's more
    of a Cronenberg beauty than a Merchant Ivory one.</p><p>
    This beauty radiates fully in the closing moments of the final track which
    glimmers like the gaseous giant that is Tangerine Dream's pre-<i>Streethawk</i>
    masterpiece, <i>Zeit</i>.  But in order to get to ""Daddy, no lie,"" we got some
    mountains to traverse and some jungle to cut our way through. ""Ill Shabata""
    begins with a duet between Pavarotti and someone throwing his guts up before a
    303-sounding chainsaw slices through this cartoon scene. ""La Scappin Rööd"" is
    bacterial bleep jazz, such as the Mars Lander discovered under a rock late one
    Martian afternoon.</p><p>
    ""Silent Why"" riffs on Miles in a woodblock-scraping style
    before the Autechre algorithm gets nasty on some electro beats innocently
    passing by.  More Miles gets abducted for ""Da Doo Doo""-- this time it's Chick
    Corea's tinkling electric piano that competes against the ambient sounds of
    monumental structures sheering.  By comparison, the clicks and cuts of ""The
    Cop It Suite"" make a soothing glitch of a light respite. Which leaves us with
    my pick for highlight, ""Dröön_99,"" which is nothing less than Charles Mingus
    and Teddy Charles' ""Laura"" remixed by a stratospherically bolloxed Danny
    Zelonky.</p><p>
    Jamie Lidell has taken the Trash Collective's aural-invasion aesthetic and
    tweaked it for far subtler ends. Though this album doesn't present a baseline
    criterion, <i>Muddlin Gear</i> will prep you for when the body-snatching pods
    land to give you the most visceral baseline experience of your life.</p></div>"|4776.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4776-muddlin-gear/|6.6|Paul Cooper

    so much historically as personally. It's an intimate moment captured in sound.
    As Archer Prewitt himself accurately phrased it, these songs are ""documents.""
    Recorded live to eight-track in March 1999 (with a little post-production
    overdubbing), <i>Gerroa Songs</i> arose out of a vacation of sorts. Tony Dupre,
    a friend and engineer, invited Prewitt and others to a haunted, dilapidated
    ex-Nunnery by the seaside cliffs of Gerroa, New South Wales, Australia. During
    the day, they swam, relaxed, talked, watched leaping dolphins, and recorded
    pleasant songs.  During the evening, they watched the house become dark,
    listened to insects drone on, and recorded gloomy songs.</p><p>
    
    They never saw the much-rumored ""phantom lady"" who supposedly appeared in a
    chair at the end of the long dark hall. But she seems to have surfaced on the
    opening track, ""Gerroa."" Two computer glitches and an abandoned drumbeat pass
    by before the song ascends into waves of rattling and whirring machinery, like
    a specter floating among the hanging pots and pans of an industrial kitchen.
    It's hard to say if this is intentionally orchestrated or if it's the ambient
    noise of the building. That it fades away for a quaint guitar and simple
    percussion suggests the former. But the noises return, this time accompanied
    by a cacophony of deep cello notes, eerie moaning, and discordant noises
    reminiscent of parts of Jackie-O Motherfucker's <i>Fig. 5</i>. As the guitars
    and drums reenter, these sounds pull out again, but for one high, sustained
    violin stroke that holds for the last minute of the five-minute song.</p><p>
    
    Following ""Gerroa"" comes ""The Bay,"" an brooding two-minute guitar instrumental
    that sounds recorded in a large, empty room with a bare wooden floor. Waves,
    wind and birds are barely audible in the background, adding a natural depth
    to the sound that, while completely opposite from the studio depth of his
    finely-crafted sophomore album, 1999's <i>White Sky</i>, is equally effective.
    On ""Meant to Be,"" these ambient sounds are even more audible, as are the
    insects that Prewitt alludes to in the liner notes. Finally unveiling his soft
    vocals, he sings, ""Meant to be, yeah, you were the one/ Meant to be, now never.""
    This must have been one of the night songs.</p><p>
    
    ""Along the Coast"" is the first song that one can be sure was recorded in the
    afternoon. Featuring only Prewitt's deft guitarwork and the occasional
    interjecting cello or background harmonies, the song is like much of his
    other work: subdued, but not sad.  Likewise, the strings and guitar of ""Waves
    Waltz,"" the Nick Drake-ian fingerpicking of ""Tell Me Now,"" and the beautiful,
    personal closer, ""Her Magic"" are more similar to the pensive, autumnal
    <i>White Sky</i>. However, with the exception of ""Her Magic,"" these entries
    aren't quite as engaging.</p><p>
    
    But the EP's standout track, ""Another Peace of Mind,"" is among Prewitt's best
    efforts. A simple drumbeat returns-- bass drum, hi-hat, snare-- as does light
    guitar strumming. ""The time it takes you to be late,"" sings Prewitt. ""Beware
    the folks that you berate/ Take care the steps you have to take."" The song
    then leaps down into a sublime epiphany of deep bass, evocative strings,
    and the worrisome lines, ""Never going to find/ Another peace of mind.""</p><p>
    
    Surprisingly-- given the mellow, lush <i>White Sky</i>-- gloominess and
    underproduction suit Prewitt well, but this different approach allows for
    decidedly less hummable melodies to balance out the quieter, sunken
    confessionals. Still, <i>Gerroa Songs</i> is successful at what it attempts
    to accomplish. And while Prewitt's experience recording <i>Gerroa Songs</i>
    is probably more memorable than our experience listening to it, that he would
    share his pleasant, creepy vacation with us is enough to warrant
    appreciation.</p></div>"|6469.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6469-gerroa-songs/|7.3|Ryan Kearney

    information comes mastery of communication.  Right now, virtually any piece
    of information can be transferred from any place on the planet to any other
    place instantaneously. Less direct methods become outdated, and therefore
    obsolete. Morse code is one of these outdated methods. Whereas nearly anyone
    can use a cellular phone or e-mail, it requires time, patience, and training
    to decipher even a sentence of Morse code.</p><p>
    Brokeback have chosen to name their second and latest record, <i>Morse Code
    in the Modern Age: Across the Americas</i>, after this particular method of
    antiquated communicative technology, and it seems to fit, somehow. It's not
    a literal thing; there are no Morse code sequences hidden anywhere on the
    record. But the entire work seems to exude a lack of clarity and directness.
    It's the feeling of driving in open country, listening to AM radio, and
    listening to only static broken occasionally by purely gorgeous music from
    an unknown source, which promptly fades away again.</p><p>
    Chicago-based post-rocker Douglas McCombs, on hiatus from Tortoise, Eleventh
    Dream Day, and Pullman, is the original and once sole member of Brokeback. On
    1999's <i>Field Recordings from the Cook County Water Table</i>, he approached
    his new project from a solo standpoint, creating simple, often concise
    compositions around his bass, the contributions from outside collaborators,
    and the found, ambient sounds of his environment.  On this record, however,
    Noel Kupersmith of the Chicago Underground Trio and Quartet has officially
    joined the project, and the difference in sound is ultimately striking.</p><p>
    The first two tracks on <i>Morse Code in the Modern Age</i> seem as if they
    could drift endlessly. ""Lives of the Rhythm Experts"" begins with a Yo La
    Tengo-style sudden organ-- which, appropriately enough, happens to be YLT
    bassist James McNew's donation to the 16-minute track. The organ drone
    reverberates and hovers aimlessly throughout, never even accidentally
    stumbling upon a melody or a structure, as a subdued electronic stutter
    provides the rhythmic base.  Kupersmith's drum kit fades in and out with
    restrained clatter until it finds a steady rhythm all too briefly, only to
    once again collapse and disappear.</p><p>
    McCombs and Kupersmith are both bassists, but on this track, as on the rest
    of the record, McCombs uses his six-string electric bass for more melodic
    purposes, and Kupersmith's acoustic double bass handles most of the low end.
    They remain absent for the majority of ""Lives of the Rhythm Experts"" until
    the 13-minute mark, at which point the humming organ and electronics fade
    away to reveal McCombs' beautiful, silvery melodies and Kupersmith's
    anchoring support.</p><p>
    ""Flat Handed and On the Wing"" comes off as an improvisational piece built on
    Kupersmith's wandering double bass, with the exception of a brief bassless
    coronet interlude. McCombs' bass is unrecognizable, ostensibly treated with
    effects that resemble oceanic sonar. Joey Burns of Calexico contributes
    trembling, echoing electric guitar that appears sporadically within the
    track's 12 minutes.  The song rambles and almost begins to flounder towards
    its end, until Burns' shimmering, strummed guitar saves the piece, creating
    the record's clearest and most radiant moment.</p><p>
    After these long, largely meandering compositions, <i>Morse Code in the Modern
    Age</i> seems to end rather abruptly, with an effective but poorly placed
    instrumental cover of Roy Orbison's ""Running Scared"" that runs just under
    2\xBD minutes. Featuring both members of Calexico this time (Burns and John
    Convertino), as well as the choral vocals of Stereolab's Mary Hansen, this
    traditional rendition utilizes McCombs' capable imitation of a baritone guitar
    lead with his six-string bass. It's short, sweet, and to the point, and would
    be one of the record's highlights if it hadn't been placed with such desultory
    works as the previous two.</p><p>
    The disc includes an enhanced, visual portion to be viewed on your computer,
    which features videos of the first two tracks created by <i>Dutch Harbor</i>
    filmmaker Braden King. ""Lives of the Rhythm Experts"" is accompanied by images
    of South American villages, and ""Flat Handed and On the Wing"" coexists with
    footage from the wing of an airplane. The videos seem to compliment the tracks
    nicely, but after time, they become boring, as these pieces generally lend
    themselves to the background and the audio/visual experience doesn't hold
    enough interest to maintain the full attention of the viewer.</p><p>
    Like the subject of its title, <i>Morse Code in the Modern Age</i> seems
    inefficient, and involves a heightened level of patience to decipher.  The
    first listen is rewarding and, at times, fascinating, involving full
    recognition of Brokeback's incorporations of various layers and structures of
    sound and effects.  But with future listens, the static moments become too
    static, and the majority of the time is spent waiting impatiently for those
    glimmering moments that you know are there, when the beautiful music comes
    through the white noise and then just fades away again.</p></div>"|949.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/949-morse-code-in-the-modern-age-across-the-americas/|6.8|Spencer Owen

Not only have we experienced it in a multitude
    of television promos and movie soundtracks, but it's infested other genres of
    music to the point of ubiquity.  This year alone has seen myriad releases from
    those eager to defy genres and shift forms.  From Badly Drawn Boy's
    folk-electronic hybrid to OutKast's full-on jungle hip-hop of ""B.O.B,"" it's
    clear that artists in even the most unlikely genres can't seem to keep their
    hands off their knobs (no pun intended, but if it were, Bright Eyes could most
    certainly be included in the list).  We've come to the point where the
    integration of electronic and rock is a virtual no-brainer, to the extent
    that, for the most part, ""experimenting"" with the combination is becoming
    quite dull.</p><p>
    
    On previous outings, Echoboy's Richard Warren delivered a rock-techno sound
    to widespread acclaim.  <i>Volume Two</i> finds him treading over similar ground
    just as successfully.  Instead of crashing rock and roll and electronica
    head-on, his integration is a more subtle mix.  He's not a pioneer by any
    means, but <i>Volume Two</i> is testament to his more nuanced approach.  On
    this, his third album, Warren allows the guitars and ""real"" instruments an
    equal say, and ends up with music that sounds incredibly intelligent in light
    of many other clumsy cross-breeding musicians.</p><p>
    
    Take ""Sudewestfunk No. 5,"" for example.  The pure-funk of the guitar riff is
    complemented by an understated drum machine that sounds like a piston
    releasing steam.  The song morphs and the steam is usurped by big, tinny drum
    sounds and high-pitched bleeps.  Similarly, both""Siobhan"" and ""Schram and
    Sheddle"" recall Squarepusher's foray into jazz, without abandoning the
    glorious and frightening noises that electronica offers.  ""Schram"" is
    particularly exceptional; two distinct drum parts match at the start of the
    song, then spiral out of synch, and almost work themselves back together.
    All the while, reverb cascades all over and the song closes as a mere drone.
    And using only an 8-track to record, Warren is cognizant of the fact that
    every layer counts.</p><p>
    
    Though some of the more rock-oriented numbers are a bit too big beat for my
    taste, the production isn't really the problem; Warren's lyrics are.  Though
    adding vocals to an album made mostly of electronic-based music helps vary a
    potentially monotonous sound, it often doesn't work so well for Echoboy.  On
    the airy ""Circulation,"" Warren seems to be taking a confessional approach and
    spinning a tale of lost love (he has a ""heart so cold"" and wants to ""circulate
    your system with love"").  The result is trite and sounds out of place in
    contrast to the relatively intelligent material presented in other areas of
    <i>Volume Two</i>.</p><p>
    
    On the other tracks that feature singing, Warren chooses to distort and filter
    his vocals so that the listener is barely able to make out what he's saying;
    probably a smart move.  Here, Warren merely uses his voice as another distinct
    layer to the sound, managing not to distract the listener with cliches.  And
    it's greatly appreciated that these pains have been taken, because what's
    happening musically on <i>Volume Two</i> is leaps and bounds more interesting
    than any lyrics Warren could possibly muster.</p></div>"|2677.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2677-volume-two/|7.0|Richard M. Juzwiak

    is of Morton Salt and its iconic logo: a strolling girl in a yellow raincoat
    hoisting a purple umbrella to deflect airborne particles of sodium chloride.
    And yet, though this girl seems not to have a care in the world, the phrase is
    usually associated with a quick succession of unfortunate events (after all,
    no ""Today Show""-watching human being likes a downpour).</p><p>
    But when I used this phrase the other day, I had a different vision altogether.
    I must first explain why. First, it took almost three hours to complete a
    40-minute flight from Boston to New York. Second, I've been looking, or rather
    finding, love in the all the wrong places. And third, I got fired. When it
    rains, it pours, indeed. So then, the image: an open, festering wound a la
    <i>Requiem for a Dream</i>, into which salt slowly trickled, fizzled, and
    dissolved in a bubbly, bloody mess.</p><p>
    A bit dramatic? You bet, with some hyperbole added-- like salt-- for good
    measure. But what better mindset could there be for facing Nine Inch Nails'
    latest remix album? Trent Reznor, after all, has a distinct place in my
    history: I was prevented from attending my junior high graduation because,
    during the year-end dance, I ""slamdanced"" to ""Head Like a Hole,"" kicking a
    chair over in the process. I didn't deserve that then, and I don't deserve
    this now. But that's what NIN is all about: the weight of minor injustices on
    human emotions.</p><p>
    The title was promising, if only because it mirrored my sentiments (so long
    as it's not a tactless reference to Chinua Achebe's classic novel; plus, The
    Roots got first dibs). Likewise for some of the song titles: ""Slipping Away,""
    ""The Great Collapse,"" ""The Wretched,"" ""The Frail."" Overdone yes, but sometimes
    one wants unfiltered emotion, as much as it resembles adolescent angst. Little
    did I know that the album and aforementioned song titles actually refer to
    Reznor's talent.</p><p>
    Despite its inherent relation to <i>The Fragile</i>, <i>Things Falling Apart</i>
    should, like any other album, stand on its own.  But this album doesn't stand;
    it never gets up. It's a toddler with two knobs for legs and arms like a Mr.
    Potatohead. The 53 minute-long album kicks (read: dozes) off with ""Slipping Away
    (Into the Void Manipulation)"" by Reznor and Brit mixer/engineer Alan Moulder.
    Does this sound familiar?: a plodding, Neanderthal beat; a dated guitar; a
    violin; searing but sanitized fuzz. Then, everything stops so Trent can scream
    his first line: ""I keep slipping away."" After throwing in those same blips
    he's employed since the beginning of time, the song becomes predictably
    muddled and furious.</p><p>
    ""The Great Collapse""-- the only new track here-- seems out of time, in a bad
    way. It combines the simplistic beat of the <i>Pretty Hate Machine</i> era
    with the tasteless piano atmospherics of his later work. ""The Wretched,""
    reinterpreted here by Keith Hillebrandt of the Nothing ""collective,"" is
    another ""Hurt""-style subdued song that slowly builds and then crumbles. And
    Benelli's take on ""The Frail"" is still a cheap, pseudo-stringed-quartet piece,
    but with a few clanks here and there. Brilliant!</p><p>
    But here's the best part: three, count 'em, <i>three</i> remixes of the truly
    unforgivable ""Starfuckers, Inc."" Dub producer Adrian Sherwood gives the song
    a, well, dubby makeover. Skinny Puppy's Dave Ogilvie, hot off his work
    remixing Mötley Crüe, goes the house route. And Charlie Clouser's version is
    a drum-n-bass-via-trance journey that doesn't even remotely resemble the
    original. All three remixes are slight improvements over the original, but
    isn't that automatically the case?</p><p>
    The only bright spot here wasn't even originally composed by NIN: a cover of
    Gary Numan's ""Metal."" Reznor drenches the first five minutes in fuzz, but
    during the last two minutes, pleasant, unforced acoustic strumming and
    quavering keyboards subtly rise above the fuzz. It's these two minutes that
    saved the album rating from goose eggs.</p><p>
    I desperately wanted this album to speak to me. To join me in this rut. To
    agree that yes, when it rains, it pours. But as suspected, it didn't.  Instead,
    it sunk lower-- way down below me. Listening to this album was so painful
    that the festering wound no longer seemed so serious: a cut mends itself, but
    <i>Things Falling Apart</i> is around for the long haul.</p></div>"|5798.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5798-things-falling-apart/|0.4|Ryan Kearney

Among them:  1)
    The Gallagher brothers will keep fighting and releasing records that no one
    cares about; 2) Bobby Gillespie will keep trying to push Primal Scream into
    making a new <i>Screamadelica</i> and end up with a big-bunch of big-beat
    bullshit; 3) Jarvis Cocker will keep taking forever to record and end up with
    a Pulp album that pales in comparison to its predecessor.  And while it might
    not rank up there with the most inevitable events in a post-Britpop landscape,
    we still should have seen this decade-spanning career retrospective of Blur's
    coming.</p><p>
    
    Blur is easily among the best bands to come out of the '90s Britpop scene.
    Borrowing from their influences (a teaspoon Stone Roses, a healthy dose of
    the Kinks, a dab of the Beatles, and a sprinkling of the Smiths), they carved
    out a sound that was uniformly accessible.  Though they produced five great
    albums out of the six they recorded (their debut, <i>Leisure</i>, was lacking),
    their strength has always been their singles.  <i>The Best of Blur</i> might
    be a little useless to old fans who already own their old stuff, since 17 of
    the 18 tracks are taken from previous albums.  However, if any fans are like
    me and verging on becoming burnt-out on Blur, the disc is a perfect way to
    get reacquainted and fall in love all over again.</p><p>
<i>The Best of Blur</i> serves as a document for an astonishingly consistent
    career full of hits over in Britain.  It's a shame that their success in
    America has been limited to a three-month span in the summer of 1997, during
    which teens screamed, ""Whoo-hoo!"" along to the Pixies-induced parody of
    American rock, ""Song 2.""  But disappointing as it may be, it's not at all
    surprising; Damon Albarn's voice is a working class English croon, and his
    lyrics are decidedly British (example: the use of the word ""jackanory"" to
    describe how things are going in ""Country House""), something that doesn't
    play well with this nation's blind patriotism.</p><p>
    
    As with any retrospective, the track listing isn't going to please anyone.
    Though much of essential Blur is collected, there are notable omissions.
    Their second album, <i>Modern Life is Rubbish</i>, is underrepresented with
    only ""For Tomorrow"" making the cut (""Chemical World"" and ""Popscene"" should
    have been included, since they're easily among Blur's best).  Additionally,
    b-side-turned-<i>Trainspotting</i>-anthem, ""Sing,"" is six minutes of
    psychedelic perfection that would have added contrast to many of the jubilant
    pop songs presented here.</p><p>
    
    Still, it's hard to argue with the material that made it to this record.  The
    disc, though not sequenced in chronological order, covers all facets of Blur's
    career.  There's the early shoe-gazing days of ""She's So High,"" the bouncy
    dance beats of ""Girls and Boys,"" the riff-heavy pure pop of ""Country House,""
    and the more ""experimental"" (though completely characteristic) lo-fi crunch
    of ""Beetlebum.""  The one new song included, ""Music is My Radar,"" warrants an
    appearance not just as a previously unavailable track, but as truly one of
    their best.  It's minimalist, groovy, and combines the shiny poppy old Blur
    with the ragged noisy new Blur perfectly.  Throw in a bonus disc of 10 live
    tracks taken from last year's singles show at Wembley Arena, as well as great
    packaging, and the two-disc set seems more than worth its price.</p><p>
    
    Blur themselves would probably dismiss the album as shit.  Supposedly, none of
    the members were concerned enough with this release to speak up and say what
    should be included.  Damon Albarn, particularly, has been vocal about taking
    a dislike to the band's previous material (which led to Blur's branching out
    on their previous two albums).  Additionally, he's recently expressed distaste
    for the pop music scene as a whole.  Latter point taken, the former seems like
    arrogant self-deprecation.  Perhaps Albarn looks back on his past, sees catchy
    melodies, accessible production, and myriad screaming fans who love not only
    his music, but his good looks as well.  From that perspective, Blur not only
    perfected Britpop, but also opened the door for boy bands who have helped
    contribute to the compost heap that is Top 40 radio.  Yes, Blur may have been
    a boy band (and they might very well still be one), but there's no doubt that
    they're the most clever, likable, and best boy band in the world... Ever!</p></div>"|830.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/830-the-best-of-blur/|8.6|Richard M. Juzwiak

    Brits.  Shelling out $9.99 for two remixes or b-sides accompanying an LP
    version of the single's title track can be maddening-- especially since UK
    prices of such releases can run as low as £1.99.  The Chemical Brothers know
    this and they care.  Almost all of their releases, including albums, DJ mixes,
    EPs, and singles have been released in America in some form, eliminating the
    need to buy over-priced imports.  <i>Music:Response</i> is yet another in this
    series of the Chem's 'cross-the-Atlantic fairness.  The boys are giving it
    back to us Americans.  Aren't we lucky?</p><p>
    I must note, though, that the sarcasm stops here.  True, it's tempting to hate
    the Chemical Brothers, the Pied Pipers of the Discotheque that brought their
    music to America and led an influx of big-beat biters to our turf.  No longer
    (were they ever?) regarded hip by the horned-rimmed elite, it would be easy to
    take this opportunity to preach to the converted and assault <i>Music:Response</i>.
    I mean, really, the Chemical Brothers are to, say, La Bouche as Face to Face
    are to Blink-182, in terms of hipster cred; and that's not saying much for any
    of those implicated.</p><p>
    This said, though, <i>Music:Response</i> is an arresting release if only
    because it defies the banality that arises from what we've come to expect from
    big-beat.  Unlike Fatboy Slim, the Chemical Brothers aren't making tepid strides
    to hang on to their waning popularity.  <i>Music:Response</i> is not subversive,
    per se, but it's a surprising bit of raucous fun for the dancefloor.  It's all
    about making asses shake, and at this point, if the Chemicals can do that,
    they're far more successful than the majority of their contemporaries.</p><p>
    The title track appears three times over the course of the EP, and it's this
    sort of overkill that detracts from a potential mini-LP aesthete, and betrays
    <i>Music:Response</i> as merely a 48-minute single.  The album version of the
    title track, taken from the Brothers' 1999 full-length, <i>Surrender</i>, is
    MOR big-beat, high on funk and electro bleeps but lacking in unlikeness.
    Justin Robertson's ""Gentleman Thief Mix"" of the track, though, turns up the
    plush factor by adding a deeper, groovier bassline and clinking cowbells a la
    ""Rappers' Delight.""  With Robertson at the helm, the track is revamped as a
    late-nite house number and benefits greatly from the cross-over.  The
    ""Futureshock Main Response"" mix, while not as successful as Robertson's
    reworking, improves its source material by pumping it up a notch and adding
    keyboard effects that recall a tinny wind-up symphony.</p><p>
    ""Freak of the Week"" and ""Enjoyed"" are both outtakes from the <i>Surrender</i>
    sessions, and, surprisingly, the best tracks on the EP.  The former is a funky,
    frenetic house song with a brooding, sculpted bassline.  Though big-beats
    monopolize the song within three minutes, the jaunt into house is a welcome
    one.  It's even better in ""Enjoyed,"" with its high-energy house beats and a
    highly synthesized bassline that sounds ripped out of Donna Summer's much-sampled
    electro-disco hit ""I Feel Love.""  In actuality, the bassline comes from
    <i>Surrender</i>'s ""Out of Control,"" of which a live Glastonbury version
    also appears.</p><p>
    Live versions of ""Got Glint?"" and the aforementioned ""Out of Control"" close
    out <i>Music:Response</i>.  ""Out of Control"" is mostly stripped of the Bobby
    Gillespie/Bernard Sumner vocals of the original, and comes off as a trivial
    dub reworking with audience cheers at the opening and closing.  ""Got Glint?""
    is similarly pointless, as its sole variation is the inclusion of a dicing
    guitar riff that accelerates until it sounds like hummingbird wings.</p><p>
    The disc features an enhanced portion featuring the video for ""Let Forever
    Be.""  If you can get past the fact that the Noel Gallagher-sung tune is
    ultimately just a sad parody of <i>Revolver</i>'s ""Tomorrow Never Knows,""
    director Michel Gondry's wacky visual effects rank up there with Björk's
    ""Human Behaviour"" and ""Army of Me,"" and Daft Punk's ""Around the World,"" as
    the talented videomaker's best.</p><p>
<i>Music:Response</i> is an altogether satisfying affair, though as most of
    the songs clock in at around eight minutes, it's not exactly the best of
    home-listening electronica.  The Chemical Brothers are still doing what
    they've always done, without watering down their sound and attempting to
    reach to a wider audience.  With big-beat's allotted 15 minutes near the
    13:30 mark, the Chemicals seem poised to gracefully fade into obscurity.  God
    bless 'em for it.</p></div>"|1414.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1414-musicresponse-ep/|6.5|Richard M. Juzwiak

    of oratory with Supremes-style back-up singers (picture three lovely,
    impeccably coifed ladies in sequin gowns, elbow-length gloves and bow-ties
    oooh-aah-oooh'ing about ""Zionist Conspiracies"") he might very well settle on
    the Marvelous Farraquettes as their title. At which point these guys will just
    have to choose a new name. But sticking with the Likely, they'll get to keep
    their name and people will continue asking themselves, ""What the hell is (a)
    Faraquet?"" After listening to the band, though, they'll decide that it doesn't
    much matter because the name, like Faraquet's singular brand of rock, just
    <i>sounds cool</i>.</p><p>
    
    During my first semester at a certain overrated university on New York's
    Upper-West side, the Ministry of Housing placed me in a tiny room with a
    prep-schooler named Neil. Though eventually we became great friends, that
    first semester was a real goddamned trial. Skipping straight to the point,
    our musical tastes clashed.  Badly.  Like oily cat and watery dog.</p><p>
    
    Sure, over time we performed our little token exchanges-- I came to enjoy the
    De La Soul album he blared incessantly, and Neil quit rolling his eyes and
    saying, ""Kill your mother!"" in his faux-demon voice while making the heavy
    metal hand gesture when I'd put on my music. Or my ""music"" as he preferred.
    And no, I wasn't listening to fucking Black Metal or anything of that sort.
    Rather, those were the years when I was listening, almost exclusively, to a
    handful of Dischord bands. I remember running down the list of them, hoping
    one would break the streak: Fugazi (""Kill your mother!""),  Nation of Ulysses
    (a truly heartfelt ""Kill your mother!""), umm... let's see, Jawbox
    (unjustifiably, ""Kill your mother!""), Minor Threat (well, you can imagine),
    and so on.</p><p>
    
    The first thing that came to mind when I'd finished listening to <i>The View
    from This Tower</i> was how I wished it'd been around in 1996. A Dischord
    band to stump Neil! Not even he could've kill-your-mother'd Faraquet in good
    faith.</p><p>
    
    At the risk of earning myself another cheeky missive from a jazz snob, I'm
    going to invoke the genre in vain and simply say that Faraquet ""has horns.""
    Their riffs whir and run circles around your head. Scarcely a moment is left
    unadorned by Chad Molter's tight drumming. Devin Ocampo's spindly, spidery
    guitar lines virtuosically toe the line between scorching and wanky. On the
    harder, more discordant songs, mood and direction zigzag violently while the
    quieter stretches of the album lend those same deft maneuvers calm and
    entrance, like time-lapse photography or stoner laser-light shows. But though
    the vestiges are there, this ain't Smart Went Crazy. It's more like Crazy got
    smart, taking astronomy classes and intensive music courses.</p><p>
    
    Say Thrill Jockey fucked Dischord and the resulting child lived long enough
    to get a taste for, among other things, <i>Synchronicity</i>-era Police.  Odd
    time signatures, tempo change-ups, the occasional use of brass-- in short,
    all the things on a ""rock"" record that would normally send people screaming
    from the room. They're all here in abundance. Did I mention cellos? Congas?
    It all works perfectly.</p><p>
    
    Nothing about <i>The View from This Tower</i> sounds the least bit contrived
    or ""experimental""-- it's exactly as it should be. They aren't going to change
    any lives with this one, but quietly and effectively, Faraquet has issued a
    challenge to their peers: to expand their musical lexicon and range of
    expression, and throw off some of that stifling rock and roll orthodoxy.</p><p>
    
    There's some biblical passage and it goes something like, ""If your faith was
    as big as a mustard seed, you could move a mountain.""  I'm not trying to get
    holy on you or anything, but Faraquet reminded me of that, albeit incongruously.
    If you could replace only 1% of all the unconscionably shitty bands out there
    with bands like Faraquet... well, you get my drift.</p></div>"|2992.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2992-the-view-from-this-tower/|8.0|Camilo Arturo Leslie

    my last review, from which some people inferred that I claimed his label
    lacked a diverse sound, I decided that I would highlight the label's variety
    in my next review of a TMU disc.  The Six Parts Seven makes my goal easy--
    it handily shatters every preconceived notion I had about the label's roster.
    It's about as far away from a Harriet the Spy-style blistering hardcore
    attack as is humanly possible.</p><p>
    
    About the only thing shared by the Six Parts Seven and their labelmates is
    their locale.  This Kent, Ohio-based quartet has been making mature,
    shimmering, instrumental post-rock for over six years now.  And e-bow, viola,
    guitar, lapsteel and percussion are mixed gently and equally on <i>Silence
    Magnifies Sound</i>, their second full-length.  Very reminiscent of their
    debut, 1999's <i>In Lines and Patterns</i> (released on Donut Friends),
    nothing new or different is on the menu here.  It's more of the same: silky
    smooth, clean, ringing tones of twin guitars create the atmospheric conditions
    that allow for evocative touches by the e-bow and viola.</p><p>
    
    At its worst, <i>Silence Magnifies Sound</i> flirts dangerously with Windham
    Hill new age, like a weathered Michael Hedges.  At its best, it's exploratory,
    ambient rock with an art-school panache.  More a suite divided into nine parts
    than a traditional album with nine different tracks, the album is clearly
    jazz-like in its <i>modus operandi</i>: choose one musical phrase, flesh it
    out, develop it and watch it metamorphose.  Let it drive the piece.  Each
    song highlights a single theme and kneads it repetitiously with slight
    variations that cumulatively build.</p><p>
    
    The standouts come when the rhythm picks up somewhat, such as on the looping,
    and moderately peppy ""The Day After the Day After Here"" or the mid-paced,
    melodic ""The Constant Variables.""   Though the somnambulist nine minute
    closer, ""Changing the Name of October,"" seems to end long before you're
    ready for it to be over.  It starts slow and builds to, well... slowness,
    but it's the song's intricacies that save it from neverending mediocrity.</p><p>
<i>Silence Magnifies Sound</i> is a perfect backdrop for a refined,
    sophisticated experience like a museum tour or an art exhibition.  But for
    those other times in your life, when you happen to be outside of such a
    cultural institution, you'd damn well better be in the mood before popping
    this one in the player.  Because, you see, if you aren't in the exact frame
    of mind needed to appreciate music like the Six Parts Seven create, <i>Silence
    Magnifies Sound</i> will put you there.  Whether you like it or not.</p></div>"|7205.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7205-silence-magnifies-sound/|6.3|John Dark

    <i>Necrophones</i>, don't you think? I do. Then again, I just sat through it
    for the third consecutive time and have lost all perspective. Third time, it
    turns out, is not a charm. I'm further from comprehending this album than I
    was prior to hearing it.</p><p>
    
    Daniel Higgs is the vocalist for Lungfish. He's got an unruly prophet-chic
    beard and a face stuck on ""stern."" Higgs looks like he might have gotten
    kicked out of the Brethren for taking it all too seriously. His lyrics are
    exceedingly imagistic, paradoxical, puzzling, sometimes fascinating, and
    highly likely to make you shake your head and mutter ""what the <i>fuck</i>?""</p><p>
    
    Sometimes it seems to work, but it never makes sense. Or maybe it does, who
    the hell knows?  I, for one, have neither the exegetical skills nor the time
    to delve into the kooky-ass cosmology of Higgs' head.  Consider the following
    passage: ""The kiss embalmed for state display/ The state as defined by broken
    minds/ The mind a concentric mirror maze/ The mirror swirling begins to drain.""
    Scattered bits seem to cohere into themes but the connective tissue is pure
    schizophrenic spew. The above passage continues, ""A drain sucking at its own
    remains/ There remains an echo migrating through space/ The echo draped in a
    bridal gown/ The gown reveals a fist of vapor.""</p><p>
    
    The music is standard Lungfish fare but significantly darker than on previous
    albums.  The classic Lungfish technique, in case you were worried, is quite
    intact. Another all-you-can-eat of re-pe-ti-tive riffery that spins like
    machinery, or slowly, like parodies of nature cycles, over and over with
    little or no change. The first time I heard Lungfish I remember expecting
    that the endless terrain of riffage might pay off at the song's end with
    some surprising climactic change. Wrong!  The changes only come with the
    silence between tracks and the beginning of a new endless expanse of riffage.</p><p>
    
    Lungfish is also sounding more medieval than ever these days. It's up to you
    to decide if that's a good thing. It took a while to get that mini-Stonehenge
    scene from <i>This is Spinal Tap</i> out of my head. And when I finally did,
    it was instantly replaced by shitty scenes from Tolkien novels. This is punk
    rock for hobbits, or maybe a soundtrack to the Black Plague.  It's background
    music to distract you from the lice multiplying in your hair, the fleas in
    your ass-crack, the blood-gorged tick on your eyeball, the biting draft in
    your roofless stone hovel, and the putrid week-old bowl of gruel you're having
    for dinner.  Now that's rock.</p><p>
    
    This has as much to do with Higgs' singing as it does with the music.  Back
    around the release of <i>Songs for Walking and Talking</i>, he pulled off
    hoarse punk in a fairly conventional but effective way; now he has this sort
    of ""evil"" affectation to his singing.  He sounds alternately whiny and wannabe
    creepy, like the three witch sisters in Desmond Davis' <i>Clash of the
    Titans</i>. The result sounds menacingly like Jethro Tull: unvaryingly
    dirge-like and unpleasant.</p><p>
    
    All in all, though, this is just Lungfish. <i>Necrophones</i> won't win them
    new fans and it won't cost them any, I'm sure. The man with the tumbleweed
    convention on his face and his band of slow-motion marauders have been around
    13 years and aren't hanging it up anytime soon.  And if you've stuck it out
    through their first eight albums you're probably already eating this one up.
    Like the shrill cries of a baby, or the sound of shelling, or tinnitus,
    <i>Necrophones</i> gets more slightly more tolerable with every repeat listen.
    In the meantime, I've got a pot of Quaker Instant Gruel on simmer, and a fair
    wench over, so I really must be going.</p></div>"|4926.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4926-necrophones/|6.0|Camilo Arturo Leslie

    But perhaps the greatest thing that separates our fine union from those
    denizens of the far-reaching unknown is the odd translation method the
    Japanese use to write and speak in English. With a different phonetic system
    entirely, the Japanese come up with entirely bizarre English phrases that
    leave out and add words at random and, at times, seem to have no affiliation
    with what's actually trying to be communicated. Read any electronics manual
    for proof.</p><p>
    
    Takako Minekawa is Japanese.  Japanese, of course, being synonymous with ""not
    American."" Therefore, she's not exempt from our droll Western stereotypes.  On
    her new release, the seven-song <i>Maxi On</i> EP, as well as on most of her
    other material, Minekawa's lyrics come chock-full of fractured English.  In
    any other context, her strange take on the language could seem hilarious. But
    for some reason, the novelty wears off quickly on her records. This being a
    good thing, since it doesn't seem like she's particularly aiming for a laughing
    good time.  She even demands we ""stop laughing"" in ""Lullaby of Gray,"" and it's
    an apt request.  Minekawa should be taken seriously.</p><p>
    
    Takako has made a habit of collaborating with other established artists on
    her solo efforts. On 1996's <i>Roomic Cube</i>, she worked extensively with
    Buffalo Daughter; on 1999's <i>Fun9</i>, DJ Me/DJ You and current beau
    Cornelius split much of the backing. Things aren't much different here: the
    title, <i>Maxi On</i>, seems to be a play on words regarding her new
    collaborators, the New York City duo Dymaxion. Technically, only the Jeremy
    Novak half of Dymaxion was involved, but he uses his group's moniker and
    shares writing, arrangement and production credits for <i>Maxi On</i>'s first
    four tracks.</p><p>
    
    Novak's presence on the opening title track immediately indicates a slightly
    new sound. Sure, Minekawa's trademark chirping vocals and pulsing rhythms
    are present, but the overall tone is dirtier and funkier. ""I can touch deeply
    your mad dreams,"" she trills over muted minor-key guitar, thick basslines, and
    a canned old-school beat. ""A Report on an Investigation"" has the air of a
    spiritual film noir, a dark detective story with shimmers of hope.  In fact,
    the only track out of the four Dymaxion collaborations that doesn't bear a
    similar aura is ""Brioche,"" just under two minutes of shimmering, polyrhythmic
    synthesizer and her gorgeous, layered vocal harmonies.</p><p>
    
    But though it's all been good so far, <i>Maxi On</i>'s peak arrives with
    Minekawa's strictly solo tracks. ""Picnic at Loose Rock"" is a relaxed
    instrumental with a harmonium melody, wordless, bubbly vocals, and a pulsating
    yet calming rhythm. ""Follow My Dreams"" is truly dreamlike; featuring Cornelius
    on various electric guitars, each aural element touches off the ground and
    gracefully soars through ethereal melody. And ""Sleeping Bag,"" the final cut
    and the bonus track for us Yankees, closes the disc similarly with the simple
    repetition of the word ""sky"" chiming throughout the shifting, hypnotic
    accompaniment of pianos, electric bass, xylophones, subtle brass, and
    ocean waves.</p><p>
    
    Yes, her past is littered with song titles like ""SHH Song"" and ""Kangaroo
    Pocket Calculator."" Yes, the phrases ""it's serious fairy tale with an
    extension cord"" and ""a beautiful things for the after crying"" can be found
    in <i>Maxi On</i>'s lyric sheet. But once the dimwitted American curiosity
    wears off, Minekawa reveals herself as yet another artist helping to forge
    the path for interesting and exciting musical landscapes.</p></div>"|5300.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5300-maxi-on-ep/|8.3|Spencer Owen

I know because I, <i>un</i>like
    the Palm Beach County Board of Canvassers, counted every last one.  A high
    number to be sure, but one that takes on an even greater and more absurd
    significance when you consider that half of the tracks on the album are
    instrumental.  Make no mistake about it, friend, that's a lot of fucking
    la's.  But is it too many?  The factual and unsubjectivicated answer is, in
    a word: yes.  We're talking roughly a 3:1 nonsensical-to-intelligible
    lyric-syllable ratio here.  That's up there in doo-wop territory (though not
    as high as scat).  Those are ""Teletubbies"" numbers!</p><p>
    
    And at its worst, that's just what <i>Buzzle Bee</i> is: music for
    ""Teletubbies.""  Not the surreal banjo-and-snare marches of the theme song,
    but rather, the kind of music that Tinky-Winky, Dipsy, La-La and Po might
    enjoy kicking back to after a hard day's romping with bunny rabbits.</p><p>
    
    Sonically, the High Llamas couldn't offend someone if they tried.  The music
    has an Eddie Haskell character to it-- very proper and calculated.  One might
    suspect an ulterior motive, if not for the fact that frontman Sean O'Hagan
    steeps his chord progressions in penultimate sincerity the way only a
    certifiable perfectionist can.  It's music not just for a happy world, but
    for a world in which nothing unhappy had <i>ever</i> occurred.</p><p>
    
    With more vibraphonic chime-farts than Lionel Hampton on Quaaludes, and
    Mary Hansen on semi-permanent loan from Stereolab, <i>Buzzle Bee</i>
    gurgles like a symphony of swamp gas idiophonica.  And it's not treading
    new ground so much as it is the same old ground with different shoes.
    The opening track drifts along, buoyed by a sing-songy chorus of ""Lay down/
    Watch the traffic go by,"" a lyric so dreamy it sounds phoned-in from the
    Astral plane.  O'Hagan's plain-jane vocals are an asset to the track, though,
    if only because he wisely avoids the vocal posturing and hammy crooning that
    his contemporaries so often fall victim to.</p><p>
    
    ""Get into the Galley Shop"" attempts to be a microcosm of the album, if not the
    band's entire back catalog.  It's catchy and retro in its technique (all the
    drums are right-channeled), and the three-part harmonies glisten like tubs of
    Nickelodeon Gak.  The lyrics are cryptic enough to be either profound or
    goofy; you make the call: ""You need to take your sandals off to take away the
    porcelain/ Hopping in a hotel bar hidden in a marching band/ Music popping
    from the bar, driven by a cosmic man.""</p><p>
<i>Buzzle Bee</i>'s low point comes with ""Tambourine Day,"" which shark-circles
    its melody without ever finding it.  But the other instrumentals, taken as a
    clutch, are a mixed bag.  ""Switch Pavilion"" centers around Hansen's-- you
    guessed it!-- wispy ""la-la"" phrasing; the sedative ""Sleeping Spray"" is the
    gentle mellow break of the album-- the place where they ""take it down a
    notch,"" despite the fact that it's already practically off the scale.</p><p>
    
    ""New Broadway"" does its best to be endearing while catching the listener
    off-guard with its many style shifts and rhythm variations.  It also
    showcases some of the better bass work on <i>Buzzle Bee</i>, which is
    otherwise lackluster punctuation-- commas and periods rather than pop
    exclamation marks.  But once the closer, ""Bobby's Court,"" gets past the
    pedestrian verse, it features an enraging five-note syncopated loop that's
    surprisingly juvenile for the Llamas.  Usually, O'Hagan's arrangements
    are deeper and a little more intricate; this one sounds like something he
    dug out of his pre-microdisney days.</p><p>
    
    What we're left with when all's said and done is a brief eight tracks and
    40 minutes of somnambulist, <em>pianissimo music.  But you know, when
    push comes to shove, those ""la's"" are a real bitch.  810!  My god, man!
    That's enough la's to choke a llama!</em></p></div>"|3861.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3861-buzzle-bee/|6.0|John Dark

    Calling a collection of largely inferior previously unreleased tracks <i>The
    Masterplan</i> is a little presumptuous, to say the least. But, then again,
    Oasis have, for years, thrived on presumption, pretension and hype. Until
    finally, their boasting, preening and carrying- on backfired with 1997's
    uninspired pop failure <i>Be Here Now</i>.</p><p>
    
    Now that Oasis, too, are bigger than Jesus Christ, they suddenly they find
    themselves at a major creative impasse. And hey, what better time to hawk a
    few throwaway tunes to the general public?  This previously- ignored garbage
    gets scraped from the bottom of some dumpster behind Epic records, and
    packaged as newly- discovered gleaming treasures. Easy, eh? ""Blimey, look wot
    I found, it's The Lost Oasis Anthology!""</p><p>
    
    Maybe the Gallagher brothers caught
    wind of Yoko Ono recently raiding her late hubby's closets for every last
    note, screech or belch he ever put on tape. ""Noel's brain's in hibernation,
    chaps,"" you can hear Liam saying. ""Somebody raid the rubbish dump. Check in
    a basement or dustbin or somethin'. That's where they usually find lost
    tapes. An' gimme another snort o' that fookin' Borax, chappie...""</p><p>
    
    On <i>The Masterplan</i> there are a few scattershot moments of crackling energy
    on ""Fade Away,"" and ""Headshrinker"" that certainly blow away ""Wonderwall""
    and ""Alcohol and Cigarettes,"" for example. But they're the kind of updated
    '60s power-pop anachronisms that Matthew Sweet had already perfected on
    1991's <i>Girlfriend</i> and 1993's <i>Altered Beast</i>. ""The Swamp Song""
    is an endless, clumsy blues jam. ""Going Nowhere"" is thoughtless, meandering
    orch-pop. Oasis' Beatles affectations reach unintentional comedic heights on
    an extended live version of ""I Am The Walrus,"" where Liam turns in a real
    wheeze of a vocal performance.  You begin to realize they might not even
    pass for a good imitation of Wings, really.</p><p>
    
    I'm afraid this compilation just isn't enough to spark a renewed interest
    in these quickly fading toss-pots. Obviously, it's much easier for Oasis to
    package shit as diamonds and chuck it out among the entertainment- starved
    rabble, rather than actually try and transcend the vacuum they've been
    writing songs in for so long.  (Hunker down in the studio and possibly
    re-think your incredibly narrow approach to pop tunesmithing, lads?)  Being
    the stubborn Beatles snobs they are, though, they'll most likely continue
    with the same unforgivably lame <i>Revolver</i>- era Beatles knock-offs while
    making futile genuflections at the altar of Mr. Paul Weller.  Maybe it's
    about time they debut the talents of the long- forgotten, previously
    outtaken third Gallagher brother: autistic, pennywhistle- blowing Tosser
    Gallagher. Poor wanker's been gathering dust in a London basement for
    years, you know.</p></div>"|5930.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5930-the-masterplan/|3.7|Michael Sandlin

No, Molina hasn't been known to sport a Marxian beard, and he's long since ditched his multiple monikers. But he has a few other things in common with Oldham, alt-folk's reigning Prince of Darkness. Consider the following: in 1996, Molina released a single on the Palace imprint; he now consistently records with a rotating cast of musicians; and <i>Ghost Tropic</i> was Molina's second full-length release of 2000 (<i>The Lioness</i> came earlier in the year).</p>
<p>But the connection runs deeper. Molina also plays hushed, somber folk music, usually with sparse instrumentation. His lyrics, while more personal, are nearly as poetic and dark. Then, of course, the most obvious comparison: the fragile voice. Generally speaking, Molina's pipes are cleaner than Oldham's-- a fact that becomes particularly apparent during those rare high notes. But when low-key, his voice sounds disconcertingly similar. Thus, given that since 1999's <i>Axxess &amp; Ace</i>-- his highwatermark thus far-- Molina has become subtler and even more subdued, and his voice has moved closer in nature to Oldham's. On <i>Ghost Tropic</i>, where Molina's voice is now similarly broken, the difference would be indistinguishable to the untrained ear.</p>
<p>The comparison between Molina and Oldham has been made time and again, and is probably as sickening to Songs: Ohia's fans as it is to him. But there's a reason I insist on making the tired comparison: never before has it been more apt. <i>Ghost Tropic</i>, the band's fifth proper full-length, makes even <i>The Lioness</i> seem, at the very least, content. For his version of ""I See a Darkness""-- or rather, ""I See a Heart of Darkness""-- Molina again enlisted Alasdair Roberts of Appendix Out, who also played on <i>The Lioness</i>, as well as members of Lullaby for the Working Class. Their influence, though, goes sadly undetectable.</p>
<p><i>Ghost Tropic</i> was recorded at Dead Space Recording Studio in Lincoln, Nebraska, but sounds as though it were recorded live in a haunted hut somewhere in an Ecuadorian rainforest. At night. Take, for instance, the opener, ""Lightning Risked It All,"" which begins with wooden percussion, a sparse acoustic wrenched out of tune after each note, and the lines, ""Still no guides/ It's not a generous world/ It is a separate world/ The bad luck taste of the dark/ The broad luck of blood on the water."" But these words aren't delivered with any rapidity: you're given enough time between each line to consider eternity. A random kickdrum might snap you back to reality, as might subtly increasing percussion. Or you might continue wandering off, set further adrift by the increasingly restless wooden clacks that sound like water dripping in puddles.</p>
<p>The rest of the album isn't much different, with the bulk of its tracks rarely progressing from where they begin. South American percussion usually offers tempered accompaniment along with a thunderous piano, both of which are occasionally complimented by a Spanish guitar, pedal steel, glockenspiel, eerie keyboard-chorus or shrill triangle. And Molina's voice inevitably enters in, usually after the one-minute mark, to deliver, in a death-bed rasp, lines such as, ""Death as it shook you/ You gave it a fool's look/ You said I am an empty page to you"" (""The Body Burned Away""), or, ""Simply to live, that is my plan/ In a city that breaks us/ I will say nothing"" (""No Limits on the Words"").</p>
<p>But what really holds the album together-- perhaps better than the choice of instruments, lyrics, or Molina's voice-- are the tropical birds. Unlike, say, Phish or Quasi, Molina doesn't tactlessly plop a mess of birds in the middle of his album. Instead, birdsong slides in now and then, reminding you where you are (the tropics, fool). Only occasionally do the chirps reach a cacophony, as on the two instrumental tracks entitled ""Ghost Tropic,"" where the birds sound as though they've been awaked by the unsettling music emanating from the hut.</p>
<p>None of the eight tracks that comprise <i>Ghost Tropic</i> are true songs. They're more like movements that make up the larger whole of the album, which acts as a 51-minute song. There are no tangible choruses; at best, you'll hear a couple lines repeated two or three times. In short, this is a mood piece. As such, it'll suit your needs perfectly at times, and incompletely at others. The two 12-minute tracks that essentially end the album-- separated only by one of the short instrumentals-- won't seem long enough for you one day, and will be horrendously sluggish and repetitive on another. It's like watching a Brita filter a liter of water: sometimes you're too damn thirsty to wait, so you give in to tap water; other times you hold out, knowing that your patience will make the experience entirely satisfying.</p></div>"|7336.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7336-ghost-tropic/|7.5|Ryan Kearney

    of electric Miles Davis to get them through an album.  They pulled it off
    pretty well on record, and even better in concert.  But while last year's
    <i>Utonian Automatic</i> showed massive improvement over their 1997 debut,
    <i>The Unstable Molecule</i>, the last thing I expected them to pull off was
    a genre-bending blend of creative jazz and German-style minimalist electronica.
    Yet, here it is in all its glory: <i>Who Stole the I Walkman?</i></p><p>
    
    The album's bizarre title merely hints at what lies inside.  Burbling cut-ups
    of incidental noise boil over rumbling bass tones and insect sounds.  Subtle
    preprogrammed keyboards and digital twicks tumble along sporadic percussion.
    Backwards instruments float softly upon grids of glassy space effects.  And
    mingling with these warped squirm-atics are elements of the tried-and-true
    jazz-funk Isotope 217 have cranked out on past efforts.</p><p>
<i>Who Stole the I Walkman?</i> is, simply put, the next level of jazz.  Isotope
    217 meld genuinely inventive ProTools ambience with fusion, and end up with a
    genre that has never been explored.  Their unsettling mixture of casual found
    sound, chopped clicks, gentle tones, and augmented chords is strangely comfortable,
    and the combination achieves a remarkable seamlessness, considering that these
    two styles of music were invented more than 30 years apart from each other.  It
    also didn't hurt that Casey Rice-- who has, since the early '90s, evolved from
    an assistant engineer on Liz Phair's <i>Exile in Guyville</i> and the Sea and
    Cake's self-titled debut, into a studio wizard whose angular manifestations as
    Super ESP have hoisted him amidst the electronic elite-- recorded the album.</p><p>
    
    ""Harm-O-Lodge"" kicks off the largely downtempo record with an almost random
    bassline which serves as a meandering foundation for the song's sampled Atari
    beeps, cropped cymbal crashes, and insane sax.  ""Moonlex"" opens with quiet, pre-set
    crowd noise-- likely from any of the billions of shows they've played at Chicago's
    prestigious Empty Bottle venue-- and over four minutes, melts into a thick syrup
    of Rob Mazurek coronet, computer-generated drones and various reversed instruments.</p><p>
    
    The crowd theme continues throughout ""Kidtronix,"" but this time, there are twice as
    many people in the audience.  Over the scenester racket, Isotope lay a chaotic
    assemblage of manipulated bass, jingle bells, and purposefully clumsy drumming.
    But the album's standout is easily ""Sint_d,"" which consists of warm, organ-
    impersonating keyboards spilling microwaved chords over a series of clicks and
    cuts straight off a Mille Plateaux label sampler.</p><p>
<i>Who Stole the I Walkman?</i>'s cover art is an homage to Squirrel Bait's
    self-titled album, but it's hard to know why they chose it for this album--
    the record itself certainly doesn't sound anything like <i>Squirrel Bait</i>.
    <i>Utonian Automatic</i> featured nondescript, blurred photos that seemed to
    suggest genitalia (maybe it's just me), while <i>The Unstable Molecule</i>
    more accurately depicted the splattered disarray of their music with an oil
    painting of jumbled shapes.  But the simple silver mosaic is oddly fitting for
    <i>Who Stole the I Walkman?</i>, in that, if nothing else, it looks ""computery.""
    It hints that there've been some unexpected changes in the Isotope camp.</p><p>
    
    This record breaks barriers for Chicago's tireless post-rock addiction, breathing
    new life into the city's stagnating avant-garde and jazz scene. Solely on the
    merits of its electronic facets, <i>Who Stole the I Walkman?</i> would blow away
    such recent innovators as Autechre and Squarepusher in terms of sheer originality.
    But combined with the band's trademark fusion skronk, it is the birth of a new
    music, and the resuscitation of truly exploratory jazz.</p></div>"|4139.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4139-who-stole-the-i-walkman/|8.6|Ryan Schreiber

    view this album as a handy portfolio. Just as freelance graphic designers
    carry around a folder of their snazzy java jacket designs for the local
    coffeehouse or program booklets for the neighborhood Peanut Butter Contemporary
    Kids Christian Street Dance Theater Ten-Year Jamboree, <i>Remixes 1997-2000</i>
    serves as a quick introduction to give you a firm idea what they can do for
    your act.</p><p>
    
    In unexpected antithesis to the resurrectional artwork of Creed's <i>Human
    Clay</i>, these discs come functionally housed in brown cardboard, lest we get
    distracted from their 20 minor variations on light bossa beats and smooth
    Hancock chords.  Miraculously, though, some Jazzanova remixes have ousted
    the original versions. Who remembers the King Britt mix of Ursula Rucker's
    succulently breasted (just listen!) ""Circe?""  The tech house has been altered
    to make time for a Sunday evening ale or two.  As a bonus for ham-fisted
    DJs, Jazzanova have incorporated the exact sample as used by Daniel Ibbotson
    in his ""Things Change"" track. DJ-friendly this may be, but it sure isn't going
    to wake, say, the Elephant 6 collective into ""outside the box"" thinking.</p><p>
    
    The Jazzanova rework of Ski's ""Fifths"" exhibits two noticeable tendencies of
    this collection. Firstly, in an attempt to dupe us into believing that the
    band have earned their remix-fee and actually come up with fresh music,
    Jazzanova sample the Larry Levan mix of Gwen Guthrie's ""Seventh Heaven"" and
    clunkily incorporate that song's signature squiggle. By doing this, Jazzanova
    perhaps think they can convince us that they're spontaneous, off-the-wall,
    and possibly a smidgeon out-to-lunch. We're not fooled.  To its credit, the
    remix finds all the right shimmy-shimmy dynamics, but dropping that squiggle
    is awkward at best.</p><p>
    
    Secondly, who the hell is Ski? Do Jazzanova scour the world for jazz-dance
    acts that only the sub-editors at <i>Straight No Chaser</i> care about? If
    the band's reputation bears any weight, we'd expect to find huge names on
    this collection of three years' worth of sweet labor. So where are they? Why
    is it that Groove Armada and Deep Dish get to tinker with Madonna's ""Music""
    and not these fellows? Are Destiny's Child Austriophobes? Would the bassist
    from Jamiroquai walk out if this lot were let loose on their precious
    grooves?</p><p>
    
    I can't believe record companies are fearful of what Jazzanova might hand
    over. As <i>Remixes 1997-2000</i> amply testifies, this band are utterly
    dependable; one can be entirely certain how the remix will sound.  It comes
    down to one of two reliable styles: a bossa groove or a batacuda thumpathon.
    Either way, it gives lazy DJs huge amounts of style points (one copy sold to
    Paul Oakenfold!  Another shipped to Dave Ralph!). The one thing I'm still
    unclear on is why the biggest names artists-- 4 Hero, Incognito, MJ Cole--
    all bear Gilles Peterson's stamp of approval?</p><p>
    
    I'd like to suggest that the band's consistency and dependability, rather
    than launching them into riches beyond the dreams of avarice, have rendered
    the band and their work unfortunately ignorable. Record execs know they're
    not going to be paying for a Jazzanova mix that incites like ""A Galaxy of
    Scars,"" the high-anxiety samba that opened the Third Eye Foundation's <i>You
    Guys Kill Me</i>.  This is a real shame.  Yet more annoyingly, you can hear
    nagging echoes of far greater mixes in Jazzanova's lesser sounds. During the
    mix of Liquid Lounge's (who?) ""Complete Life,"" the vocalist is left to perform
    a passable ""Relax""-era Holly Johnson ""nya nya nyaah,"" for example.</p><p>
    
    Fittingly complementing these unimaginative reworks are the unimaginative
    track titles.  Scanning the tracklist is akin to reading every sentence on
    a detention blackboard: ""[name of remixee] Jazzanova Mix."" Sure, this is
    functional-- it lets everyone know who's on the job.  But where's the flair,
    the wit, the slightest amount of interest?  You don't find Richard D James
    simply signing his work ""The Aphex Twin Mix.""  Given how much of a chore
    remixing has become in recent years, I'm imagine that inventing a snappy
    title for your version is one of the few really fun parts.  But Jazzanova,
    like the Cinematic Orchestra, take everything just a little too seriously.
    So, we must ask ourselves, is jazz-dance really quite the most tedious genre
    in music?</p><p>
    
    Not at all.  Jeff Sharel's self-titled album floors with its delicately
    <i>OvalProcess</i>-esque take on jazz dance-afro beat fusion. And how about
    the special funky mess of Chet Baker's 1977 version of ""Love for Sale"" with
    Alphonso Johnson on a nether-hugging Moog? Or San Francisco's Luv N' Haight,
    who adoringly compile bags of jazz-dancy goodies that abound in irresistible
    exuberance?  Clearly, the genre is more than sufficiently capable of
    delivering excitement in armfuls.</p><p>
    
    For Jazzanova, though, their melodic predictability is their selling-point.
    They've crammed their portfolio with stolid workouts and earnest pastiches.
    These are far from ideal qualities when it comes to an album. Any of these
    tracks inserted into a set would usher in a soothing ersatz Rio carnival
    vibe, but releasing it all in a block like this offers the band little
    credit. I could be apologetic and state that this was bound to occur, given
    the band's preferred method of referencing not only the source track, but
    also other tracks by the remixed artist. This, of course, is utter shit-- to

    I'm caught. I want uplifting, challenging, complex, beard-free, fun,
    jazz-dance!  I want to be captivated by their takes on art, life, and humanity!
    Yet, if I want to find these things out about Jazzanova-- what they can really
    do when released from remix pressure-- I'm left hunting for a three-song EP
    released in 1998, and their one-off, ""Fedtime's Flight,"" from a year earlier.
    Needless to say, that shit just doesn't cut it.  Hrrumph.  Well, at least I'll
    always have Chet to fall back down on. I'm never left in doubt as to what
    motivates him.</p></div>"|4225.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4225-remixes-1997-2000/|5.2|Paul Cooper

    genre. I mean, sure, the layers of tape hiss and analog crust did give lo-fi
    music a unique sound. But it seemed to be an utterly superficial distinction,
    and one which had little bearing on why I was such a big lo-fi fan for so
    long. I mean, <i>Bee Thousand</i> is one of my favorite albums of all time;
    it could've been produced by Todd Rundgren for all I care.  The songwriting
    was the only ingredient necessary.</p><p>
    
    Notice how much of that is in past tense. The perhaps ill-titled lo-fi genre
    has all but disappeared. Just pop in the latest album by Pavement, Sebadoh,
    or Guided by Voices for proof. Or the Bevis Frond.</p><p>
    
    That's right, <i>Valedictory Songs</i>, Nick Saloman's first record on Rubric,
    is thoroughly produced-- no hiss, no clipping, no crust. What's more, the record
    is Saloman's first studio release in years that includes touring band Andy
    Ward and Adrian Shaw, whose instrumentation on last year's live Frond record
    proved them more than technically proficient.</p><p>
    
    When I received <i>Valedictory Songs</i> in the mail, I was hoped desperately
    that it would be an album every bit as good as Saloman's last two solo outings
    under the Bevis guise, the irrepressibly cool <i>North Circular</i> and
    <i>Vavona Burr</i>. Both of these records are testaments to Saloman's sick
    talents both as a guitarist and a songwriter, chock full of insanely catchy
    melodies, air-tight grooves, and enough heavy riffage to keep a Sabbath fan
    satiated.</p><p>
    
    Saloman also demonstrated a knack for penning compelling organ-driven ballads,
    as well as the occasional 10-minute anti-corporation/music critic rant. But
    the truly remarkable aspect of Saloman's work to date isn't the ground it's
    covered, but the fact that it's been so consistent. <i>Valedictory Songs</i>
    doesn't break this mold; it's a fine rock record in every possible sense. Nary
    a weak moment to be found, in fact. But it lacks the strong moments, the
    backbone of past efforts.</p><p>
<i>Valedictory Songs</i> finds Saloman in more ballad-heavy territory than on
    previous releases. ""High on a Downer,"" ""The Speed of Light,"" and the mid-tempo,
    '70s-inspired ""Early Riser"" certainly tread closer to ""monster ballad"" status
    than anything Saloman has done in the past, due in no small part to the syrupy,
    multi-tracked vocals. And while all of the ballads on <i>Valedictory Songs</i>
    are undeniably well-written, never succumbing to soppy-ass lyrics, they just
    don't have the distinctive edge of other Frond recordings.</p><p>
    
    The album does have a few damned fine rock songs on it, though. The opener,
    ""Godsent,"" chugs along on a typical Saloman guitar riff, beating '70s rock at
    its own game. ""China Fry"" swaggers on a slide-guitar riff and a ""you fuckin'
    ingrate"" chorus that will bring a tear to the eyes of those who miss the days
    of T.Rex. As a rock songwriter, Saloman is simply unstoppable. Sadly, the lack
    of musical momentum on <i>Valedictory Songs</i> suggests that he may be
    slowing down. My suggestion? Take two shrooms and record another album in the
    morning.</p></div>"|682.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/682-valedictory-songs/|6.9|Matt LeMay

    satisfactory, nice, benign, harmless, innocuous, innocent, largely unobjectionable,
    safe, forgettable.</p><p>
    
    I have just summed up in 19 words what I am about to say about Coldplay's
    debut full-length, <i>Parachutes</i>, in 600.  Aside from being seemingly
    tailor-made for the paper-thin adult contemporary market, what is it about
    this Britrock quartet that's driving them up the American charts? Is it their
    popularity in their home country, or their Mercury Music Prize nomination?
    Could it be their charming, boyish good looks?  Perhaps, even, a reputation
    built by Noel Gallagher's projected insistence that they're ""a bunch of fuckin'
    pansies, the lot of them?""</p><p>
    
    In reality, Coldplay's secret deadly weapon is vocalist Chris Martin. With
    the ability to mimic a Brit-accented Dave Matthews one minute, Jeff Buckley
    revived from the dead the next, and sometimes even a young Peter Gabriel,
    Martin's heartfelt delivery seems to be what's winning the hearts, wallets
    and alternative radio request lines of Americans young and old. That's not to
    say that the rest of the group isn't sharp. Guitarist Jon Buckland provides
    plaintive, strummed acoustic guitar with the occasional amplified wail, and
    bassist Guy Berryman with drummer Will Champion form a competent rhythm
    section.</p><p>
    
    Oh yeah, the songs. They're nothing special. Most of the 10 tracks on
    <i>Parachutes</i> are indeed pleasant enough, often consisting of standard
    alterna-pop fare with the occasional folky ballad. They're innocent and
    inoffensive in general, but in turn, they're also exceedingly generic
    and immediately forgettable-- so much so, in fact, that after a minute of one
    song, you've usually already forgotten what the last song sounded like.  And
    that's even after a few listens.</p><p>
<i>Parachutes</i> opens with ""Don't Panic,"" the title of which is likely
    lifted from British mock sci-fi classic <i>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the
    Galaxy</i>, despite the fact that the song has nothing to do with it. This
    subdued, dreamy opener contains Martin's falsetto chorus of ""We live in a
    beautiful world,"" which seems to sum up the overall sentiment of the record;
    the record also closes with the inspirational swinger ""Everything's Not Lost.""</p><p>
    
    Most of the other songs sort of drift in and out of consciousness, with the
    exception of the second track, ""Shiver."" It's the only truly decent song on
    <i>Parachutes</i>, but simultaneously, it's the only one that blatantly shows
    its influences. In fact, the influence can even be pinned to a single song:
    Jeff Buckley's ""Grace."" Martin has his Buckley impression down cold, complete
    with dynamic range and the trademark vibrato.  But as enjoyable as the song
    may be, there's no question that Buckley did it better.</p><p>
    
    And of course, you've probably heard their smash hit single, ""Yellow,"" by now.
    Indeed, it's the most obvious choice for a single, and it represents
    Martin's vocal stylings effectively, but it's also the record's weakest moment.
    Buckland's grating, slightly tuneless guitars seem jarring, especially when
    sequenced in the middle of a series of songs that generally lack dissonance.
    And the saccharine lyrics are those that might have caused Mr. Gallagher's
    hypothetical remark: ""Look at the stars/ Look how they shine for you/ And
    everything you do."" You'd practically expect the band to show up at your
    doorstep with a wilting bouquet and Hallmark card.</p><p>
<i>Parachutes</i> is ultimately a promising debut for Coldplay, if by
    ""promising,"" I mean, ""promising them a windfall of cash and international
    popularity."" If nothing else, it's harmless and pretty. Unfortunately, it's
    nothing else.  If that's what you look for in your music, by all means, go
    for it.  If you want substance, I suggest moving on.</p></div>"|1539.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1539-parachutes/|5.3|Spencer Owen

One of my most profound examples is a Microstoria release that has an     Oval remix called ""Microstoria Runtime Engine"" on one side and Stereolab's     mix of ""Endless Summer NAMM"" on the other. I picked up this unassuming 12""     used a few years ago, just before a long weekend when, for some reason, most     people close to me were out of town. During those blessed three days of     solitude, I listened to that Oval remix probably twenty times, and my     amazement grew with each spin.</p>
<p>Drawing elements from five different Microstoria tracks, Oval's Markus Popp     (who was, in a sense, remixing himself since he comprises one half of     Microstoria with Mouse on Mars' Jan St. Werner) created with ""Runtime     Engine"" a piece that was both the most ""digital"" track I'd heard and the     most organic. The way the various clicks, buzzes and drones were organized,     ""Runtime Engine"" didn't sound ""played"" by something living, but seemed to be     some kind of life in itself. The image that came to me during the first few     listens was a heavily magnified film of cells diving in the womb. As the     various loops interacted with and built upon each other, the components     remained the same but swelled according to some strange underlying algorithm.     And this precise arrangement of seemingly random electrical impulses struck     me as very beautiful.</p>
<p>I still put on ""Runtime Engine"" every month or so (it's also on the     Microstoria remix album <i>Reprovisiors</i>), and it hasn't lost its luster.     But there is a downside to this kind of listening transformation. I've     spent the years since digesting clicks, cuts, glitches and squirms in search     of something with similar personal impact, and it's hard to come by. This     exploration has led me through the complete catalogs of both Microstoria and     Oval, and still, nothing for me matches ""Runtime Engine"" for sheer wonder.</p>
<p><i>Model 3, Step 2</i> is Microstoria's first studio album since 1996's     <i>snd</i>, and while it's very good, it falls short of that highly subjective     ideal. Still, this is a fine collection of warm, glitchy ambience that should     appeal to admirers of abstract electronics. Much more subdued than Oval's more     recent efforts, and more random than St. Werner's solo work as Lithops,     Microstoria find a happy medium of strange, nervous, consistently surprising     atmospheres. Drawing from similar sound sources as <i>Ovalprocess</i> (sampled     guitar buzz digitally stretched to its limit, oddly percussive texture shifts,     manipulated organ chords), Microstoria construct an alien, yet still oddly     familiar environment.</p>
<p>One reason I think Microstoria is lost on people is that they think of it as     ""ambient"" music to be played quietly while doing something else.  Quite the     contrary, music this dependant on detail demands to be played loudly,     preferably through a decent stereo or headphones. ""Glocky Bit"" features layer     upon layer of delicate sound buried beneath its bass-heavy synth chords.     These tiny repeating melodies hover several leagues beneath the more menacing     surface, adding levity to the outwardly oppressive foreground.</p>
<p>The distantly pop ""Flexen"" is a glowing drone constantly bumped off track by     digital clicks, and only at volume can one hear just how. Close your eyes and     crank ""Paro Fadeout"" and you'll swear you're floating in the ocean, listening     to a whale trying to speak the language of a submarine. <i>Model 3, Step 2</i> may not represent a paradigm shift, but it deserves to be heard.</p></div>"|5273.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5273-model-3-step-2/|8.0|Mark Richard-San

    and relevance are waning.  Like a designer club drug that delivers heady waves
    of euphoria before cutting out, leaving the brain depressed and deprived of
    seratonin, this hip-hop/breakbeat/techno (with a dash of rock n' roll) hybrid
    is rapidly fading.  True, big-beat by the likes of the Chemical Brothers, the
    Propellerheads, and our subject at hand, Fatboy Slim has gone strong for a
    good two and a half years-- far longer than your average hit of ecstasy.
    After listening to Slim's latest, <i>Halfway Between the Gutter and the
    Stars</i>, it seems we've reached come-down time.  And surprise!  It's no
    fun at all.</p><p>
    
    Like technology, the nature of electronic music remains in an eternal state of
    flux: constantly changing, evolving, and effortlessly remaining hip.  Kitschy
    disco throwbacks and penchants for analog keyboards aside, subgenres like
    drum-n-bass and big-beat that combine, rather than defy, previous influences
    have a relatively short shelf-life.  The dank, yellow-fluorescent glow of
    stagnation that emanates from <i>Halfway</i> is emblematic of the decline.</p><p>
    
    I'm tempted to give Norman Cook the benefit of the doubt and assume that he's
    at least slightly aware of this.  After all, this is the guy who, on his solo
    debut, <i>Better Living Through Chemistry</i>, sampled the Who's ""I Can't
    Explain"" and transformed it into the hyper break-filled dancefloor throwdown
    ""Going Out of My Head.""  This is the guy who carved funk out of the light
    jangle of Cornershop's ""Brimful of Asha.""  These previous recordings and a
    slew of others, dependent on Slim's often impeccable taste for hooks and
    samples, have proven him able to reach virtuoso status when it comes to
    filling the dancefloor.  In short, he's proven himself as a shrewd producer
    whose intelligence is not to be discounted.</p><p>
    
    It's perhaps because of these past successes that Slim seems a divided man on
    <i>Halfway</i>, his undeniably difficult third LP.  At times, he continues his
    role of happy-go-lucky party music mastermind, as on the acid-house-tinged
    anthem ""Star 69"" or the similar ""Retox.""  Both tracks feature incessant vocal
    samples of only a few words over throbbing, gooey beats.  Slim's playing it
    safe here, doing what he knows he does best: mindless music meant for little
    more than dancing.  Of course, with the current state of big-beat, these
    tracks sound all but redundant, but you can't fault a guy for preserving what
    he helped popularize, right?</p><p>
    
    Slim, though, apparently feels some pull from his previous Top 40 hits and
    tries a few stabs at reclaiming that popularity from the masses.  If his
    big-beat tracks on <i>Halfway</i> are somewhat of a musical stagnant pond,
    the more commercial-minded tracks here are like the resident fish flailing
    and gasping for oxygen once the pond has dried up.  The record's first single,
    ""Sunset (Bird of Prey),"" with its techno-lite arrangement and spooky Jim
    Morrison sample, is a glaring example. It's a mere quarter-inch away from
    Enigma territory and would have fit nicely on <i>Pure Moods 3</i> had it been
    released in time.</p><p>
    
    Even worse than ""Sunset"" are the collaborations with neo-soul poseur, Macy
    Gray.  ""Love Life,"" in particular, allows Gray to ramble aimlessly for almost
    seven minutes over a quasi-funk/R&amp;B; beat, rather than adhering to standard
    verse-chorus-verse conventions.  At the song's conclusion, she breaks it down
    ""Sesame Street""-style: ""Said I'm gonna A ya/ And I'm gonna B ya/ And I'm gonna
    C ya, gonna D ya/ If I E ya, 'cause I wanna F ya/ Yeah, I wanna F ya/ Yeah, I
    wanna F ya.""  It's all really too embarrassing.</p><p>
    
    So, Slim gave it a third shot and ended up with a lackluster-- spotty at best--
    finished product.  Can't blame him for trying, as the problem lies more with
    the everchanging landscape of electronic music and the dying big-beat genre
    than it does with his technical skill.  To paraphrase a character from last
    year's British slice-of-club-life film, <i>Human Traffic</i>, ""When the
    comedown outweighs the fun, the party's over.""  This is exactly the problem
    with <i>Halfway Between the Gutter and the Stars</i>, and most of the popular
    big-beat currently being offered. I hear two-step garage is gonna be massive,
    though.  Can't wait.</p></div>"|3008.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3008-halfway-between-the-gutter-and-the-stars/|4.2|Richard M. Juzwiak

Given that he was
    the frontman for the classic 80's panstick-and-synth band Japan, and that he's
    played Icarus so many times with the ferocious prog-rock sun, the fact that
    he's not a punchline to a <i>Where Are They Now</i> segment on VH1 persistently
    astounds.</p><p>
    
    Japan, contrary to the beliefs of the uninformed, were not just another
    panstick-and-synth act. Entirely separate from Ultravox, Visage, Spandau
    Ballet, and of course, Duran Duran, Japan confused New Romantic signifiers
    and slipped some awe-inspiring songs past the phalanx of make-up artists and
    featured-in-<i>The Face</i> costume engineers. Though Japan never had the
    overwrought campy wit of ABC or the low-rent wink of the Human League, Japan
    can justifiably claim to have written a song (maybe even two) that should
    become a standard.</p><p>
    
    When I first heard ""Ghosts"" (my prime candidate for elevation into the Canon),
    my head had previously been cluttered with Duran Duran's ""Planet Earth""
    (primarily because my classmates and I would recreate the rhythmic synthline
    by tapping our wooden rulers up and down the edges of our desks) and Depeche
    Mode's ""See You"" (primarily because my yet-to-break voice could just about
    carry that simple tune whilst replacing ""see"" with ""bonk"" or any scatological
    verb we could come up with in fits of short-trousered laughter).  The slow
    thrump of marimbas and Sylvian's dry, too-many-Gitanes lament of this track
    gave my 12-year-old mind extreme pause and sent me into a premonition of
    mid-life anxiety.</p><p>
    
    Even at twelve, I knew I would never compare that song with ""Girls on Film.""
    Like ""Autumn Leaves,"" it's an indelible, perennial melancholy. It's one of
    the realest, most human, songs I have ever heard. And even if David Sylvian
    had turned into a bloated sack of toss like some of his VH1 vaudevillian New
    Romantic contemporaries, I would still praise him for giving the world that
    song. However, Sylvian habitually overeggs the custard; he simply can't resist
    the temptation of slipping some arty prog-rock beneath the radar. Remember,
    two steps from David Sylvian lies Marillion's toss-strewn territory.</p><p>
    
    I think Sylvian recognizes how epochal ""Ghosts"" was and remains to be. Though
    the other songs on its host album, <i>Tin Drum</i>, attempted to incorporate a
    similar curl of deep contemplation, nothing managed the simplicity and grace.
    Sylvian's post-Japan career, I believe, has been a striving for another
    ""Ghosts.""  And while I don't believe he's succeeded, his attempts have always
    fascinated me.  Sylvian's songs, their blend of poetic regret and delicately
    dismal cadences, are like loved ones who clasp their hands against your cheeks
    to hold you still in order to tell you a hurting truth.  Alas, he's not
    achieved his goal. You have a whole lot of earthmoving to do to reach that
    tender core.</p><p>
    
    The two discs of <i>Everything and Nothing</i> compile previously unreleased,
    re-recorded, and lesser known tracks from Sylvian's post-Japan career. Though
    the ponderous title of this collection is occasionally mimicked in the music,
    this retrospective is largely contemplative and charmingly overblown. This is
    such pretentious toss that I can't help but adore it. Unlike the pretension of
    Gary Numan or Rush, Sylvian never forsakes beauty; he just chooses to shine a
    trillion-lumen floodlight upon a tender moment.</p><p>
    
    Sylvian will never escape the often justifiable charge that he expresses his
    emotions in a studied, calculated manner. <i>Everything and Nothing</i> provides
    ample material to back this up. Sylvian sounds burdened by the cachet that his
    collaborators will bring him. He sounds as though he's got to make the most of
    working with Holger Czukay, Jon Hassell, and Marc Ribot. Though these
    collaborations never collapse into utter muso-boarishness, these songs have
    an undeniable plod factor to them. ""Weathered Wall,"" excerpted from the
    <i>Brilliant Trees</i> album, and performed with Czukay twiddling a Dictaphone
    and an SW radio, sneaks away without sounding too much like a stodgy art piece.
    ""The Scent of Magnolia"" (previously unreleased and drawn from the <i>Dead Bees
    on a Cake</i> sessions) mixes Bill Frisell's indie-sanctioned jazz guitar with
    martini-lounge beats. The naked sincerity of ""Heartbeat (Tainai Kaiki II)"" is
    spoilt by the screeching guitar that marauds its cock-rock way across the
    song's sweet sward.</p><p>
    
    ""Blackwater,"" excerpted from the Rain Tree Crow project that served as a
    reunion for the members of Japan, sounds like a Mike and the Mechanics song
    that's gone hoity-toity and entirely too uptown. ""Albuquerque (Dobro #6)"" is
    a brief but utterly Saks Fifth Avenue appropriation of twanky American folk
    that features a dobro and Sylvian imagining himself as-- heavy-handed wordplay
    ahead-- a <i>soul</i> proprietor.  I suppose the New Mexico tourist board can
    at least thank Sylvian for not crooning about a mistaken left turn at
    Albuquerque like Bugs Bunny did so many times. Hey, if your state were being
    turned into a dumping ground for nuclear waste, you'd be grateful for such
    crumbs, too.</p><p>
    
    ""Ride"" picks up Sylvian's Western theme, as he shouts ""saddle up and ride
    away!"" against the tsunami swells of a nine-thousand piece orchestra and some
    lone trumpeter who's spent way too much lolly on mystic Miss Cleo's attempt
    to draw down Miles Davis' mojo from some ethereal plane. ""The Golden Age"" is
    a lounge-industrial indictment of decadence, reminiscent of a cello-and-clank
    version of Talking Heads' ""The Overload"" as performed by doom-and-double-mochachino
    string quartet Apocalyptica. ""Pop Song"" is hardly true to its title. The
    late 80's synthfunk and the fuck!-my-keyboard-player's-a-nutjob solo would
    sit awkwardly in Carson Daly's playlist, and Sylvian's moaning about the
    Sunday Supplements' being at the beck and call of the government isn't exactly
    graceful, either.  Besides, by harassing the glossy magazines that accompany
    the Sunday <i>New York Times</i>, isn't Sylvian attacking his own audience?</p><p>
    
    Since <i>Gentlemen Take Polaroids</i>, Sylvian has shown his ambivalence
    towards popular music. When he wrote and performed ""Nightporter,"" he was
    flashing his contempt for new-wave rawness. He was courting the conservatoire
    while thumbing his nose at the kids. Or perhaps he wanted to make sure that
    Ultravox wouldn't get away with the amateurish ""Vienna.""</p><p>
    
    Sylvian is an awkwardly transgressive artist that fails more often than he
    succeeds in combining avant-gardish elements with his unmistakable grasp of
    the pop song form.  Nonetheless, I'd like to suggest that Sylvian explore
    more electronic territory. As ""Godman"" and the bowed-cymbal ambient project
    Approaching Silence prove, he has a Prince-like appreciation for sound. In
    the same way that Pete Astor reinvented his shuffly jangle pop into the lo-fi

Just like the
    spider's web, their strategy for securing prey is utterly elegant and
    jaw-droppingly efficient. Rather than churning out remix after remix like
    Timo Maas or Junior Vasquez, they spin their unique style, take cover,
    and wait for us to pass by and become entangled in their sticky electro
    funk.</p><p>
    
    This isn't to say that the duo are indolent scruffs. They rapidly followed
    up last year's liquid <i>Stay Down</i> with the avant hip-hop of <i>A
    Virus with Shoes</i>. They reconstructed Paul Weller's ""Heliocentric,"" as
    well as taking a manky squeegee mop to St Etienne's ""Heart Failed."" They
    haven't pandered to hard house or courted the self-infantilizing day-glo
    trance massive. Their vision is fixed and no one can distract them from it.
    ""Cotton Stains"" capitalizes on the elastic properties of that drum-n-bass
    staple, the bassline wobbler, by bouncing flecks of sound off its bucking
    back. ""Machine Maid"" reminds us just how downright gorgeous unfiltered
    electro-boogie can be.</p><p>
    
    As a dispatch to the two-step messengers,
    ""Akwalek"" merges a minus-28'd UK garage rhythm with Eno/Lanois ambient guitar.
    The bubbling percussion caresses as much as it urges you to get down. The tiny
    reminders of the album's title (there are three of them, in increasingly ornate
    sophistication) are dense packets of hypermolecules, bearing superficial
    resemblance to entire Chain Reaction albums, or any number of Stefan Betke's
    fuzzed-out dub sessions. These congregations of ill vapors cleanse the palette
    between the thoroughly filthy electro of the other 16 tracks here.</p><p>
    
    Two Lone Swordsmen shape electro and post-punk disco as Henry Moore sculpted
    the human form. Weatherall's abstract beats are as curvy as they are playful,
    as precise as they are liberated. Because Weatherall doesn't give props to an
    erroneously hierarchical tradition, he incorporates whatever he chooses into
    his tracks. And rather than finding an ancient instructional LP or sampling a
    stinky b-movie, Weatherall and Tenniswood craft their own twisted sounds and
    uniquely freaky beats, and thereby give permanence to an inherently vapid
    genre.  By grafting the art house experimentation of Krautrockers Neu! and Can
    onto post-punk disco, the Two Lone Swordsmen are stoking up the same fires that
    Liquid Liquid, ESG, Dinosaur L, and (before them all) Cymande ignited years
    ago. Bet the bastards can hold their own in a punch-up an'all!</p></div>"|8223.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8223-tiny-reminders/|9.3|Paul Cooper

    the narrow, sloped streets of the seaside New England town where I live and
    picks up the dry Christmas trees that people have dragged to their curbs the
    night before. Nearly every resident participates in the ritual, likely out of
    both convenience and duty: to add ammunition to the upcoming bonfire. This
    year, I found myself driving around the town much as the trucks had. Usually,
    one can see a long trail of needles running the length of people's long
    driveways, but this year a significant snowstorm had hovered over the area
    for more than a day.  So, instead, there were deep, grooved channels in the
    feathery snow, as one might expect to see in the Minnesota woods in the heart
    of hunting season.</p><p>
    
    The snow was still falling when I passed the enflamed mountain of Christmas
    trees on the harborside beach, which the town firemen had ignited without any
    apparent difficulty. Given the slippery road conditions, I drove by the fire
    as if in slow-motion. I was surprised to see so few spectators. An event that
    usually looks like a joyous burning of minor holiday sins instead seemed like
    a silent vigil to the year 2000. And, indeed, the true death of the millennium
    coupled with an enormous fire can render one hopelessly reflective.</p><p>
    
    In a rare moment of literary convenience, I happened to be listening to <i>The
    Fire Show</i> in my car. The band's members-- M. Resplendent, Olias Nil, E.S.
    Roth and Crian Lubinsky-- refer to their songs as jigsaw puzzles, but their
    music puzzles more like fire: you can't solve it, only experience it. Like
    fire, the Fire Show are composed of a consistent molecular structure that
    continually changes shape. Up close, one can't help but wonder at their
    irreverent fluctuation and familiar yet unpredictable delivery of sound:
    each track is five, ten, fifteen songs crashing together; from afar, they
    don't move at all: the album feels like one long fluid song.</p><p>
    
    The eight-minute album opener, ""F. Pilate,"" begins as you now might expect:
    with feedback like crackling fire. Labored drums and a casual guitar triumph
    over the subdued chaos when M. Resplendent sings, ""I'll find my way inside
    your heart/ My city smog in your country lungs,"" his reverberated voice not
    unlike Robert Plant's on ""In the Evening."" Then, the eerie song begins a
    journey in which it loses to the fuzz, clarifies, is enhanced by sternly
    plucked strings, meets passing noises of indefinite origin, is interrupted by
    Dylan Thomas, and ends on a poignant note: piano, acoustic guitar, and
    Resplendent, a vocal chameleon, now soaring above it all.</p><p>
    
    ""Please Kill the Barium Swallows"" has the Fire Show mixing strings similar to
    those of Godspeed You Black Emperor, with alternately muffled and crisp vocals
    and guitar pickings straight out the Northwest.  As M. Resplendent takes on
    the appearance of Home's Andrew Deutsch-- one of the Fire Show's nearest kin--
    one feels ready for a more straightforward rock song.  But then it breaks.
    Pieces are strewn everywhere, and the Fire Show seems in no rush to put them
    back together. But the song repairs itself as quickly as it crumbled, and the
    rush of hearing it is like watching a car crash in reverse.</p><p>
    
    Not until the fourth track, ""The Antipathetic,"" is producer Brian Deck's
    impact obvious. The distant, hollowed vocals, atmospheric guitar and
    randomly-trebled drums are all Deck trademarks. That the Fire Show worked with
    him is no surprise at all, for they also resemble the later, more meandering
    and experimental work of Red Red Meat. Which is why a comment about Radiohead
    on their website surprised me: ""I feel betrayed... Perhaps Radiohead have made
    a completely lovely record, but, in the process, they've sacrificed we-ism for
    me-ism.... Long live the Rock and Roll Band!"" The Fire Show employ guitars,
    sure, but they're not a verse-chorus-verse, three-minute rock band. And this
    record would certainly be considered ""challenging"" by most mainstream rock
    fans. ""4 Times Through the Angel,"" for instance, relies on a mechanized beat
    and synth threads. There are also two guitarless ambient numbers.</p><p>
    
    The reason my town's tree-burning wasn't well attended is obvious: the storm.
    The few who braved the weather saw the relentless snow melt as it came within
    ten feet of the burning trees, leaving a clear halo around the flames. The
    few who listen to this album will have a similar experience. It may make you
    uncomfortable at times, reflective at others, and just as often, it will
    energize you. But, as reliably as fire itself, this music is sure to transfix
    you. Just don't try and solve it: you'll end up in the hospital with
    third-degree burns.</p></div>"|3061.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3061-the-fire-show/|7.9|Ryan Kearney

    take the good with the bad, and the bad with the good."" More and more, though,
    I'm beginning to wonder if there aren't some holes in that philosophy. Good
    and bad are, by definition, polar opposites, but whoever first penned this
    motto forgot to mention the center of the spectrum: things that are neither
    good, nor bad, just... there. Do you have to take that as well?</p><p>
    
    After hours of internal deliberation, I've decided you don't.  Bland,
    middling music can often be more offensive than something genuinely awful.
    If you're hearing something bad, at least emotions and feelings are evoked.
    Average music, though, just fades into the background.  You feel nothing,
    so you virtually hear nothing; the frequencies are wasted on your ears.  You
    could have used that time to hear something that at least causes some kind
    of reaction.</p><p>
    
    With each album, Polly Jean Harvey moves gradually from the barrage of passion
    of her previous work into the central category. 1993's <i>Rid of Me</i>
    captured her in her raw environment, setting fires and creating primal rhythms
    with just her electric guitar. On her fifth solo release, <i>Stories from the
    City, Stories from the Sea</i>, she may be maturing, or more vulnerable, or
    more vulnerable to her maturity.  But regardless, the sheen gets slicker and
    her music gets duller as the time passes.</p><p>
    
    As inspiration for this album, Harvey spent six months in New York, fully
    shedding her old wolf's skin for a more stylish, expensive wool-lined jacket.
    The record begins with ""Big Exit,"" a track that shows Harvey posing as a bored
    Patti Smith.  Granted, the chorus hook is one of her best in recent memory,
    but even that moment emits a vague feeling of by-product familiarity. ""Good
    Fortune"" sustains a similar but even more banal pop sound, with Harvey
    distinctly recalling Chrissie Hynde, both musically and vocally. And ""A Place
    Like Home"" and ""We Float"" further the tepid attitude, replacing the live drums
    of the first two tracks with cheap, glossy programmed beats that would feel
    right at home on a Des'ree record.</p><p>
    
    The lyrics on <i>Stories from the City</i> are just as average as the music--
    so average, perhaps, as to seem much worse than they actually are.  On ""Big
    Exit,"" Harvey feels intimidated by this crazy world, singing, ""I want a
    pistol in my hand/ I want to go to another land."" On ""This is Love,"" she
    barely elaborates on the already mundane title, adding this seemingly
    non-sequiturial commentary: ""Does it have to be a life full of dread?/
    Wanna chase you 'round the table, wanna touch your head."" Most of the rest
    of her prose is similarly culled from an elementary rhyming dictionary.</p><p>
<i>Stories from the City</i> does have a couple of songs interesting enough
    to almost save it from the desert of mediocrity. ""One Line"" provides a
    pleasant musical backdrop for once, with rhythmic muted guitar, a sustained
    vibraphone, and ethereal background vocals by Thom Yorke. Yorke then takes a
    gorgeous turn at lead vocals in ""This Mess We're In,"" continuing with a
    similar cadence, with Harvey singing the chorus over Yorke's wordless
    crooning. And ""Kamikaze"" has enough actual aggression and feeling to make it
    the record's only real standout, featuring a live duplication of a frantic,
    jazzy jungle beat, rough guitars, and a vocal performance that comes her
    closest to resembling passion since <i>To Bring You My Love</i>.</p><p>
    
    But three good songs do not a record make. In the end, <i>Stories from the
    City</i> ends up just slightly to the right of the dead middle ground. A
    shame, too, since Harvey once used space and dynamic to make exciting music.
    Now, more often than not, she uses music to make empty space. Optimistic as
    I am, though, I'd like to look at it this way: as far between as the moments
    of enjoyment may be, they're still there, which proves Harvey still has a
    little bit of the knack left. She may now appreciate style over substance,
    but she surely still loves making music, even if her sense of conviction is
    less powerful than it used to be.</p></div>"|3756.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3756-stories-from-the-city-stories-from-the-sea/|5.5|Spencer Owen

    verdict comes down to environment versus genetics. If music can be brought
    into the study, chromosomes might as well throw in the towel, since environment
    seems to have behavior in a headlock when you put D.C. under the scope. The
    first five seconds of ""Fever Sleeves"" project more D.C. landmarks than the
    Mall. Taking a quick survey of the city, we find ghettos reaching into
    suburbia and suburbs reaching into ghettopia. Georgetown gentrification rubs
    against white government blocks as other sectors rot under boarded windows.
    So, it's not surprising that pop bands from D.C. can carry nasty faces and
    ragged edges, while hardcore bands may spice their spikes with coats of
    glucose.</p><p>
    
    Q and Not U roll out of the mold of the Capitol dome in the stereotypical D.C.
    form and find an ideal home in the roster of D.C. archivists, Dischord Records.
    For Dischord's 20th Anniversary, <i>No Kill No Beep Beep</i> serves as suitable
    a summation as the label's upcoming box set. Beeping guitars flutter, thrash
    and crash like wuxia.  Drummer John Davis leads the listener through the
    herky-jerky chaos like an acrobatic fullback. At times, the rhythms and changes
    rumbling from his kit hog too much spotlight, and songwriting takes a backseat
    to cluttered post-hardcore aerobics. Q and Not U pummel through their disc in
    piecemeal haste. Duel guitars stutter to spit out all they learned from Fugazi
    and Circus Lupus. This is punk rock filibustering. Loopy finger-tappings and
    harsh pick-hammerings take precedence over the chordal strumming of those
    other cities.</p><p>
    
    Lyrically and vocally, the band's three singers follow the lead of the
    guitars-- cutting and spewing random thoughts that smash suburban imagery
    with violence, politically charged vocabulary, and disdain. The result is a
    sometimes silly, sometimes screamy mishmash of typical collegiate new-wave
    ramblings. Take lines like, ""Kill me with that favorite comb,"" and, ""We
    breathe clock and telephone/ Basement fires keep us so alive."" They mean
    little more than rock din. Q and Not U have a notion of what they should
    sound like, but haven't yet discovered what they will and can sound like.
    Their best song, ""End the Washington Monument (Blinks) Goodnight"", mimics
    the loose Fugazi of <i>End Hits</i>. They proclaim: ""Inside the convex lens/
    We all crash new jet planes tonight,"" in an attempt to emulate their icon,
    Fugazi's Guy Picciotto, who put it much better when he sang, ""Your eyes/
    Like crashing jets/ Fixed in stain glass/ With no religion.""</p><p>
    
    Still, few bands sound like this, and even fewer towns sound like this.  Zeal
    may outmeasure experience and uniqueness, but blaming D.C. for producing Q and
    Not U is like blaming Keebler for making cookies. A scene which constantly
    cannibalizes and cross-inspires, D.C. looks to produce some slight new
    variations yet. <i>No Kill No Beep Beep</i> comes with all the frustrations
    and thrills of a debut. I'm just waiting for them to put the ""new"" in ""new
    wave.""</p></div>"|6626.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6626-no-kill-no-beep-beep/|7.1|Brent DiCrescenzo

While not technically a word,
    at least by dictionary standards, it's closely linked to the word ""euphony.""
    For the ""differently literate"" among you, ""euphony"" means a sound or collection
    of sounds crafted to please the ear. It implies pure, unfettered joy through
    music, an uncommon melodic experience that rises above many others. Euphone,
    then, would appear to resemble an instrument or mechanism responsible for
    creating this type of euphony. That being said, Euphone still don't quite live
    up to their namesake, but they're getting closer.</p><p>
    
    Chicago's Ryan Rapsys and Nick Macri are both multi-instrumentalists, but at
    their hearts, they're simply drums and bass, both part of the former Heroic
    Doses rhythm section, and masterful at their craft. Unfortunately, 1999's
    <i>The Calendar of Unlucky Days</i> was a fairly drab record with minimal
    instrumentation and little jazz-inflected post-rock variety. Luckily, with
    the 13 new tracks on <i>Hashin' It Out</i>, Rapsys and Macri attempt to bring
    more diversity to their sound, as well as more guest musicians than ever to
    flesh it out. And it works; why, without the brilliant, all-star conga work
    by Dan Bitney of Isotope 217 and Tortoise on ""Do You Up,"" the record would
    have surely failed!</p><p>
    
    Okay, I'll cut the sarcasm. In reality, the new formula does work to Euphone's
    advantage. <i>Hashin' It Out</i> isn't a terribly cohesive record, and it does
    drop in quality near the end, but its pleasures are substantial, common, and
    fun enough to be commendable. When acting alone, there are more hits than
    misses this time out, such as the laid-back opener, ""Gyrations,"" featuring
    electronically manipulated vocals and dreamy, effect-laden guitar and bass.
    Despite their multi-instrumental capabilities, though, Euphone had the good
    taste to give their guests some creative input, and it works strongly in the
    album's favor.</p><p>
    
    The record's finest tracks were created with the help of Jeremy Jacobsen, a
    member of 5ive Style and otherwise known as the Lonesome Organist. On ""Press
    On"" and ""Bad Ascending,"" easily two of the record's highlights, Rapsys and
    Macri act as the skilled rhythm section, adding occasional keyboard
    accompaniment while Jacobsen contributes complex guitar parts.  It all comes
    off effortlessly, and stands as the closest thing to euphony these guys have
    created yet. The other two songs featuring Jacobsen don't quite match the
    others, but they do succeed. ""Where's the B?"" is just over two minutes of pure
    funk with Jacobsen's occasional angular guitar.</p><p>
    
    Without Jacobsen, Euphone seem to meander a bit more. The record's oddball
    is ""Newscast,"" a minute-long foray into the world of composing theme music
    for your local TV news program. But tracks like ""Nick is Ryan"" seem to create
    the result of effective spontaneity that many of the others on <i>Hashin' It
    Out</i> strive for. And while the rest achieve varying degrees of success--
    excepting ""Confirmation of Suspicions,"" the aimlessly rambling five-minute
    closer-- there's rarely another memorable melody or structure to be found.</p><p>
    
    Euphone have finally discovered that collaboration is the key to their success,
    and <i>Hashin' It Out</i> is the proof.  That's not to say that they aren't
    talented on their own, but if Jeremy Jacobsen joined Euphone to create a
    full-time trio, perhaps we could expect more cohesive results on their next
    effort. Far be it from me to offer a band career advice, of course, but it
    never hurts to mention it, right?</p></div>"|2846.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2846-hashin-it-out/|7.1|Spencer Owen

More hooks than your grandpa's tackle box! Sticks like a hanging chad in your
    brain!  Alright, enough, I'll stop.  But, seriously, these guys have really got potential to spare. Enough
    potential, maybe, to someday become a capital ""G"", capital ""B"" Great Band.  But what a terrible name!  Really.
    I mean, c'mon, Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band allusion or not, that's a hell of a thing to call yourself.  When I'm
    forced into saying the name out loud, I feel just like the fat white dude from the old IHOP commercial that
    haunts the pancake house in a cheap masquerade get-up because he can't endure the shame of asking the waitress
    for ""the rooty-tooty-fresh-and-fruity breakfast, please.""</p><p>
    
    But the important thing is that Death Cab cares.  Every release these guys have turned out to date evinces
    an affectionate attention to detail and an unwillingness to cut corners. From their consistently well-sculpted,
    sad and saccharine pop songs to the beautifully designed CD sleeves they commission from Thingmakers, these
    guys obviously enjoy what they're doing. And, most importantly, they want the listener to enjoy it as well.</p><p>
    
    The <i>Forbidden Love</i> EP consists of three new songs and two retooled tracks from this year's <i>We Have
    the Facts and We're Voting Yes</i>. ""Photobooth"", the eminently hummable opening song, begins with a four-bar
    intro of lo-fi and cheesily perfect Casio-style dance beat that gives way to the round, warm-blooded splendor
    of the first verse. The effect attained when the grainy, submerged-sounding lead-off is suddenly overtaken by
    the fuller and lush sound of the song's main body is powerful. The no-tech Casio beat persists for the song's
    duration, buried subtly in the mix, and makes a nice percussive counterpoint to Michael Schorr's tastefully
    restrained drumming. Decorative flourishes like synthesized strings and toy piano effortlessly enhance where
    they might have obtruded, and keep Benjamin Gibbard's cloyingly sweet melody from becoming stale.</p><p>
    
    The next track, ""Technicolor Girls"", is a lazy ballad whose melody bears more than a passing resemblance to
    those of Quasi's Sam Coomes. Though pretty, it's definitely the EP's weak link, dragging on longer than is
    probably called for, and offering little to chew on other than the repetitive, cleanly picked guitar line
    and a general pleasantness.</p><p>
    
    Things are back on track, though, with ""Song for Kelly Huckaby"". Waltzy, driving drums, nice interplay
    between the synth lines and the vocal melody, along with the distorted but low-key guitar playing come
    together beautifully. At times, Gibbard's singing is outmuscled by the synthstrings, but problems with the
    mix aren't quite enough to sink the song, which is easily as good as anything they've released before.</p><p>
    
    The EP's two final cuts are alternate versions of arguably the best songs off <i>We Have the Facts</i>:
    ""405"" and ""Company Calls Epilogue"". Ordinarily, this kind of thing is a good indicator that you oughta stay
    the hell away; 40% of this EP is, after all, old material. Death Cab, however, does a beautiful job of
    reprising these tracks, revamping not just the arrangements but their entire personality and tenor. The
    new takes on these two songs are wonderfully refreshing in contrast to the bland demo mixes and alternate
    versions of most EPs.</p><p>
    
    As you might surmise from the title, ""405 (Acoustic)"" strips the original down to its essence. The omission
    of the drum tracks leaves the high notes strummed on the upbeat as the song's sole rhythmic force, and the
    result is striking. Compared to the original, this version is much more intimate as well as, um, pretty.
    And it's certainly not gonna quell further comparison to Elliot Smith. Gibbard isn't quite the songwriting
    sophisticate that Smith has been-- yet. But his easy grasp of melody and his great voice bode well for the
    future.</p><p>
    
    ""Company Calls Epilogue (Alternate)"" boasts several cool changes.  Delay has been added to the main arpeggiated
    guitar line, turning every picked note into two, and a touch of delay has been layered on Gibbard's singing.
    The song has a more relaxed, narcotic feel to it. Rhythm-wise, the great boom-tap, boom-tap, kick-and-snare
    bit that underlined the lyrics ""But I can't"" and ""Date's been set"" in the original chorus have been removed,
    and the drum levels have been lowered to subconscious levels. The result is a floaty effect. The soporific
    scenery makes the ideal background for the addition of a bright ride cymbal in the pre-chorus that's panned
    sharp to the left and seems to be coming from directly behind you. Spooky! Again, these guys realize it's all

    Yes, they obviously know what they're doing. But they've still got to change that name.  I suppose it's
    working for them, though, what with the <i>Seventeen</i> interviews and all. For now, just hold your breath
    and hope they don't get huge and make the jump to the ""adult"" market. You'd have to knock them substantial
    cutie points if they appeared in <i>Cosmo</i> as delegates from the Land of Sensitive Guys, or to weigh in
    on blowjob technique, or worse still, to appear photographed hanging out with Courtney Love.  Or god forbid,
    Drew Barrymore.  Come to think of it, maybe they ought to just add five members and change that name of theirs
    to God Forbid Drew Barrymore. Yeah!</p></div>"|2231.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2231-forbidden-love-ep/|7.5|Camilo Arturo Leslie

For the band, ""all that you can't leave behind""
    implies facing up to their platinum salad days of the Edge's trademark echo
    shimmers and Paul ""Bono Vox"" Hewson's Lexus-honk vocals. For the general
    public, the title reifies our struggle to leave behind the image of Bono
    hatching from a disco lemon, dressed in that rayon six-pack t-shirt. For a
    band settled into four-letter pseudonyms from their 1980 debut, breaking up
    never seemed like an option. From day one, U2 was a rock constellation-- a
    warplane-- and we expected epics. It's an early affair, a hazy infatuation,
    that has since bloated into comfortable taking-for-granted. As with all
    ubiquitous products, the familiarity of logos, slogans, and icons eventually
    supplants whatever original feelings we may have had.</p><p>
    U2 are, indeed, a universal product, much like the Catholic Church Bono
    humbly admires.  The swoosh on The Edge's skully cap, and the golden arches
    of Bono's glasses spring to mind.  Song titles and lyrics on <i>All That</i>
    boldly declare familiar, safe dogma and generic commandments, such as ""Grace"",
    ""Peace on Earth"", ""I believe in you,"" ""Won't you take me, take me please,""
    ""I know it aches, and your heart breaks,"" etc.  This new batch of songs
    heralds a conscious and welcome revocation of dance-inflected bubbleglam,
    but scales back too far. In searching so hard for their souls, U2 have
    hacked away their flesh and skull, leaving a lobotomized approximation of
    glory.</p><p>
    ""Beautiful Day"" opens with bombast after a cheeky keyboard tease, and
    peaks with Bono's cracking voice in the shouted coda: ""What you don't
    have/ You don't need it now!"" And so the album climaxes at 3\xBD minutes.
    The gospel ballad, ""Stuck in a Moment You Can't Get Out Of"", maintains
    the buzz admirably, again peaking in the coda with Brian Eno's faux-brass
    keyboard belts. Elsewhere, Eno's fingerprints remain undusted. The album
    could have benefited from more of him; apparently, it takes Brian Eno +
    Berlin to = renaissance.</p><p>
    ""Elevation"" slaughters hope with reckless chops of the hackneyed sword,
    as Bono commits songwriting faux pas #1: rhyming ""sky"" with ""fly"" and
    ""high.""  The details will be spared, but you can work it out. Damn you,
    God and aerodynamics, for making altitude a necessity for flight, in
    the sky, which happens to be above us.  As the album's sticker proclaims,
    ""Walk On"" is locked and loaded as the second single. Epic midtempo should
    always follow punchy power-rock, you see. Nice, but unexciting. Here,
    Bono seems dead set on ruining U2's return with clichés. Minutes after
    the aforementioned poetic gaffe, he returns with, ""A singing bird in a
    cage/ Who will only fly/ Fly for freedom."" That little bird is you, guys!
    Free yourself from your cage! For freedom!</p><p>
    The record stomps around in this valley before mounting another two-song
    peak with ""In a Little While"" and ""Wild Honey"". On the former, the
    vulnerability of Bono's ""vox"" makes a welcome return from minute 3:30
    to inject some heartfelt emotion into the tingling doo-wop. ""That girl!/
    That girl!/ She's mine,"" Bono bellows with larynx scratches, evoking the
    dead spirit of Van Morrison.  ""Wild Honey"" similarly ob-la-dis like a
    giddy Van, and somehow escapes the shame of Bono declaring, ""I was a
    monkey."" Testament to the band there.</p><p>
    But it's back into the dark nadir until the album's closer. Bono joins
    hands with Sinéad O'Connor in healing the world on the tepid carol,
    ""Peace on Earth"". ""Jesus, can you take the time/ To throw a drowning man
    a line,"" Bono asks. Hey, if the world is so dark, take off your sunglasses.
    Bono's Healing Heart takes a ""look at the world"" on the next track, and
    discovers that people ""feel all kinds of things."" Indeed.</p><p>
    But not even Tom Waits' grizzled pipes could salvage the atrocity of
    ""New York"". Over one of the best musical beds he's ever been offered,
    Bono weaves a Hallmark lover's tale, in the city where ""Irish, Italians/
    Jews, and Hispanics/ Religious nuts [and] political fanatics/ [Stir]
    in the stew/ Happily/ Not like me and you."" Subtle breakbeat drumming
    and glistening guitar be damned, Bono will ruin a song.  And so the
    story goes for the entire album-- one of the band's finest, if not for
    the tweeting and hooting of The Fly and his grating lyrics. Beautiful
    day, certainly, but the rest of the week was all jetlag and rain. Can't
    The Edge sing, too?</p></div>"|8329.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8329-all-that-you-cant-leave-behind/|5.0|Brent DiCrescenzo

    the pool, directly after the montage that follows his first sexual encounter
    with Mrs. Robinson. His father asks him what he's doing, and Benjamin says,
    ""Well, I would say that I'm just drifting here in the pool."" His father wants
    to know why, and Ben answers, ""Well, it's very comfortable just to drift here.""
    Adam Wiltzie of Stars of the Lid and Bobby Donne of Labradford are two men who
    understand such comforts. And together, as Aix Em Klemm, they've created a very
    pleasant place to drift.</p><p>
    
    It's fun to hear a collaborative record like this, where every note can easily
    be traced to its creator. I imagine Wiltzie to be responsible for the gorgeous
    guitar drones that pulsate through ""Prue Lewarne"" and ""The Girl with the Flesh
    Colored Crayon."" Both tracks feature the delicate, low-level hum that his
    full-time band perfected on <i>The Ballasted Orchestra</i>. Wiltzie also
    vocalizes on both these tracks (calling it singing isn't quite right) in hushed,
    reverberating tones. His vocals are just another shading, really, the melody
    flowing with the current instead of paddling anywhere on its own. The voice is
    effective, adding a welcome layer of gloomy ambience.</p><p>
    
    Labradford's brand of quiet music has always been too ordered and precise for my
    taste, somehow lacking a vital emotional component. But on <i>Aix Em Klemm</i>,
    Bobby Donne's contributions seem the perfect counterpoint to Wiltzie's organic
    guitar sculpture. On ""3x2 (exit),"" I'm guessing that Donne contributes the
    high-pitched buzz that burrows between the sheets of feedback, as I remember
    something similar from <i>E Luxo So</i>. And the otherwise respectful
    ""Sophteonal,"" which consists mostly of slowly repeated electric guitar picking
    and delicate piano, gains much from a disorienting layer of computer manipulation.
    I'm reminded of Markus Popp's contributions to Gastr del Sol's <i>Camoufleur</i>,
    the way he ran the acoustic information through his notebook computer and returned
    a digital ghost to the mix. These high-tech embellishments add textures that the
    lo-fi Stars of the Lid would be unlikely to attempt, and are a large part of what
    makes this collaboration unusual.</p><p>
    
    The final track, ""Twentyone,"" is a theft of Angelo Badalamenti's ""Twin Peaks""
    theme, with its dreamy piano chords and too-pure bassline, but it's so pretty we
    can forgive the transgression. This is a lovely piece of ambient drone rock, and
    fans of either band will not be disappointed.</p></div>"|87.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/87-aix-em-klemm/|7.4|Mark Richard-San

In her 1964 essay,
    ""Notes on Camp,"" Susan Sontag pretty much laid the floor plan for the culture
    industry to make profitable factory-issue kitsch.  You can hear the jingle of
    change today as it's spewed out in the form of 1-800-COLLECT commercials,
    hideous neon Old Navy vests and the shamelessness of constant movies being
    remade.  And then there's the fixation on all things outmoded, which becomes
    a sort of retro-fetishism.  It's pretty harmless in most forms, just a
    retread of the corporate ideas of yesteryear; trinket stores that specialize
    in 50's metal lunchboxes are an eyesore, but they're also an aspect of
    Americana.  The question, then: when does obsession arise?  You can't sell
    something that doesn't have a shared history that people can identify with.</p><p>
    
    Washington, DC's Barcelona probably understand that.  That's why the first
    song on their new album starts with bubbly Casio keys and the kind of lean,
    linear drumming that immediately sounds the 80's alarm.  But bassist Jennifer
    Carr's straightforward delivery and cute vocals are bound to bring a wry
    smile to any former new-waver: ""Your friends all wear too much black/ Girls
    think it's funny he dances like that/ Boys all think he must be strange/ I
    don't see what they mean.../ Your hair looks like Robert Smith/ Nightclub
    straps around your wrist.""</p><p>
    
    Most modern synth-pop bands rely on the form New Order perfected, full of
    smooth transitions and layered electronic sequencing.  Barcelona share some
    of that sophistication, but their simple keyboard sound harkens further back,
    to the type of unpredictable analog burps and squiggles that populated the
    music of the Buggles and Thomas Dolby in the early 80's.  There are also
    elements of indie rock in their music, heard in the way their basic
    song-frames seem built around guitar, bass and drums rather than extended
    electronic passages.</p><p>
    
    But here's the catch: each of the four members of Barcelona are computer
    programmers, and nowhere is this more evident than in the lyrics.  ""Bugs""
    begins with a gleeful little keyboard melody and guitarist Jason Korzen's
    vocals, which aren't nearly as endearing as Carr's.  He repeats the song
    title a bunch of times along with the chorus, ""But I've got a plan/ If you'd
    only hold my hand/ We'll make this through.""  That's new wave for you-- dull
    double-meanings.  The bugs could be computer- or <i>relationship</i>- related.
    Yes, we get it.</p><p>
    
    ""Electronic Company"" opens with some Kinks-esque guitar chords and Korzen's
    geek fantasy: ""With your hardware, you're almost new/ With my eyes closed,
    you're almost human.""  You'll catch a friend tapping their foot to the beat,
    but how many will really identify with, ""Given the choice, I'd choose
    electronic company/ No pain, no hassles, just electricity?""  ""Obsoletion""
    shows an introspective side of Barcelona with a downbeat groove that would
    sound at home on a Peter Murphy record.  The verse-trading boy-girl harmony
    here gets your head nodding, until you hear the lyrics: ""My friends are so
    unfashionable/ My friends are models from last year/ My friends have strange
    addictions/ I'm always wishing they would leave.""  The kids' assertion in
    the chorus that this is ""just another way to speak of obsoletion"" doesn't
    satisfy.  Are they being brave here?  Or do they not have any friends they
    care to keep?</p><p>
    
    That question is partially answered on one of the album's better songs,
    ""Paging System Operator."" Korzen tells the story of himself at 13, just a
    hacker looking for direction.  He finds a pirated copy of ""EA Winter Games""
    and dials up the guy who pirated it at his BBS (a precursor to the Internet,
    where your computer rung up another personal computer).  He's seeking
    guidance, so he creates a chat room to page the guy.  You don't find songs
    about meetings in primitive pre-cyberspace often.  It ends in a sort of
    self-reflective, mirrored moment: on the other end, it's just another
    13-year-old hacker.</p><p>
    
    The problem with this album is appeal: new wave kids
    obsessed with obsolete tech and rhythm sections that sound like early Cure
    tracks aren't going to sell that many records.  But Barcelona are like any
    great local band-- they'll keep playing their cute songs with studied
    indifference, perfectly comfortable in their retro world.  Or maybe, as Carr
    suggests on one song, they'll ""have to bring your server down.""  But that's
    the revenge central to so many 80's movies: you eventually develop sympathy
    for the nerd.  Sometimes they even work their way into your heart.</p></div>"|557.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/557-zero-one-infinity/|6.7|Christopher Dare

The Hebrew emblazoned in dirty
    copper on the cover of their <i>Slow Riot for New Zero Kanada</i> EP belongs to
    him: tohu-va-bohu, it reads: void and waste. The lengthy passage on the sleeve of
    that EP is lifted from his book.  Blase Bailey Finnegan III, the Providence
    street preacher whose rantings appear on the two first Godspeed You Black
    Emperor! releases, is his avatar.  The music of Godspeed, for all its bombast
    and lament, extends Jeremiah's ministry into a new millennium.  Preaching in a
    vocabulary drawn from Boston hardcore, in a spidery array of radical leftist
    rhetoric, Godspeed You Black Emperor! have delivered a blistering (albeit
    politically imprecise) homily on the new world order.</p><p>
    
    That said, the Canadian nontet's <i>Lift Your Skinny Fists Like Antennas to Heaven</i>
    is a massive, achingly beautiful work, alternately elegiac and ferocious. However,
    <i>Lift</i> plays like an oddly transitional album: much of the first disc presents
    a refinement of the sound that crystallized on 1999's <i>Slow Riot</i> EP, while
    the second disc flirts with moments of vertiginous shoegazing, looser rock drumming
    and reckless crescendos of unalloyed noise. Succinctly, the first disc is easily
    continuous with their earlier work; the second disc might just be the future.
    The disparity is immediately striking.</p><p>
    
    This is not to suggest that the first disc is not wonderful-- it is, but mostly
    as a cultivation of ideas and sounds embedded in <i>F#A#oo</i> or <i>Slow Riot</i>.
    The waltz-like grace of the opening part of ""Storm"" (titled ""Levez Vos Skinny
    Fists Comme Antennas to Heaven"") is dominated by rising cello and violin which
    evolve, with the addition of guitars and martial drum taps, into a loud triumphal
    procession. Blaring trumpets seem to announce the advent of some head of state,
    and the whole affair proceeds with military discipline and measured effect. The
    violent explosion never comes: the parade merely approaches and recedes.</p><p>
    
    The second part, ""Gathering Storm,"" begins in entwined guitars: one bowed, one
    screwdrivered, one gently plucked. With the entrance of the cello, violin and
    rumbling toms, the guitars begin to shriek in distortion. The effect is amped-up
    slowcore sludge that's all tension and no release, merely dissipation and noise
    reminiscent of Cale-era Velvet Underground performances.   Seven minutes later,
    ""Cancer Towers on the Holy Road Hi-Way"" ends the track in crushing paranoia with
    locomotive percussion thundering toward breakdown.  (It is also Jeremiah who
    predicted that destruction would come from the North.)</p><p>
    
    The second track, ""Static,"" opens with a looped recording of a supermarket welcome
    message, giving way to indecipherable megaphone vitriol.  Sparse piano and drone
    frames the static-drenched field recordings with mournful effect. ""Chart #3"" is
    treated guitar drone and distant buzzing similar to records released by the
    Fatalists or James Plotkin.  Piercing static and high frequency ambient yields
    to the monologue of a fringe Christian preacher. ""When you see the face of God,""
    he intones, ""you will die and there will be nothing left of you, except the
    god-man, the god-woman, the heavenly man, the heavenly women...,"" girded by
    skeletal string arrangements.</p><p>
    
    Near the end of the first disc, ""World Police and Friendly Fires"" initially
    reminds me of Erik Frielander's <i>Watchman</i> compositions, and his work with
    Greg Feldman on John Zorn's <i>Bar Kokhba</i>. Eventually, however, ""World
    Police"" erupts into thick, layered drone rock (think the Dirty Three, but less
    dispersed) that sounds like a heavy metal riff slowed to quarter-speed and
    suddenly accelerated into wailing guitars and slashing strings. It is, I think,
    the first disc's finest moment. The final part, ""The Buildings They are Sleeping
    Now,"" is a quiet whoosh of fragmentary strings and deep noise. The disc simply
    falls apart; the last moments are so inaudible that you're never sure when the
    music has actually stopped.</p><p>
    
    Murray Ostril introduces the second disc with his reminiscing on the heyday of
    Coney Island. The sentiment is so politically and religiously neutral that it
    stands apart from other Godspeed field recordings: nostalgia for the good old
    days. Nothing more. The second part of ""Sleep,"" ""Monhein,"" is dominated by Efrim
    Menuck's wailing screwdriver-on-frets effect. From this plodding dirge comes an
    incredible air raid siren of sound, flagging and rising over the military
    percussion. But instead of the familiar tension and release, Godspeed opts for
    maddening sustain. When the drums die out, all that remains is the tremulous
    scream.</p><p>
    
    After a Labradford-like introduction of repetitive guitar and subtle chimes,
    ""Broken Windows, Locks of Love Part III"" erupts into sheets of noise somewhere
    between <i>Loveless</i> and <i>Pangea</i>. The advent of nimble, almost hip-hop
    drumming, is a shock, and a loose, raucous jam coalesces, recalling Cul de Sac's
    country-surf-kraut concoctions. Part of you will say: why can't it all be like
    this?</p><p>
    
    The final track, ""Antennas to Heaven,"" begins with an old mountain folk tune,
    which is inevitably consumed in processed machine noise.  Echoey chimes and
    looped glockenspiel reverberate through ""Edgy Swingset Acid"" while Francophone
    children dreamily play and sing.  The playground, however, is weirdly menaced by
    liturgical organs that soon give way to a momentary burst of dense, jangly rock.
    On ""She Dreamt She Was a Bulldozer She Dreamt She Was Alone in an Empty Field,""
    guitars and bells tick-tock over delicate dark ambient, counting the moments as
    the instruments flare up on fire and descend like a sunset. Godspeed You Black
    Emperor! have apparently expanded their emotional repertoire of indignation and
    grief to include joy.  But the appropriately titled ""Deathkamp Drone"" is ghostly
    electronic gloom.  The track's final moments are a wash of humming synths,
    echoing guitars, and pins-and-needles noise that comes just a little too close
    to human screaming.  By the time the piece ends, the tide is way out.</p><p>
    
    Real innovation in a leaderless nontet must be geologically slow.  <i>Lift Your
    Skinny Fists</i> succeeds precisely because it utilizes Godspeed You Black
    Emperor!'s numbers in a way that previous works did not. <i>Lift</i> opens up
    its sound to various voices and influences within the collective, letting moments
    of pop/rock, ambient and even hip-hop blossom where once there was only gravelly
    symphonics and aural landscape. Those moments were, for me, nothing short of
    thrilling.  This is why <i>Lift</i> shouldn't be accused of merely preaching to
    the converted fan who has long since accepted the grandiosity of their sound and
    the vague rhetoric of their dissent. They show signs of doing what they condemn
    the world for not doing: changing, evolving, experimenting with new approaches,
    growing.  And that's why Godspeed You Black Emperor!-- along with Jeremiah,
    Blaise Finnegan and every other prophet of doom-- might all turn out to be wrong.
    Perhaps it does get better before it gets worse.</p></div>"|3489.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3489-lift-your-skinny-fists-like-antennas-to-heaven/|9.0|Brent S. Sirota

    straight-ahead rock album that borrowed the stop-start cadences and tired
    loud-soft dynamics of D.C. rock, and filtered them through a grad student
    geek-chic sensibility. And it worked.  The resulting music was rough-edged
    but musicianly, sounding kind of like the Warmers after a half-year of
    music lessons. Geoff Farina's effete, lilting vocals might have come
    across as just plain annoying in any other context, but the earnestness
    of his delivery along with the album's unhurried, lounge-core feel, and
    the punchy guitar tone Farina coaxes out of his Fender gear worked. Like,
    synergy, man.</p><p>
    
    1998's <i>The Bed is in the Ocean</i> took Karate down a new path. The
    album was like your friend's hairbrained scheme that you agree to go along
    with, if only because the last one worked out well.  And again, it worked.
    <i>Bed</i> smoothed over the abrasive elements of their previous album,
    employed more complex chord changes, and garnished it with meandering,
    jazzy guitar lines. Many of the songs incorporated ""jammy"" interludes that
    narrowly evaded corniness on the merits of their execution, a feat in and
    of itself. But it was a balancing act that worked precisely because of the
    precariousness of the proposition, and not despite it.</p><p>
    
    Which brings us back to the album at hand. <i>Unsolved</i> is a jazz album.
    Whether or not it's an ""authentic"" jazz album, or just three rock guys
    playing jazz make-pretend, I couldn't tell you. My knowledge of jazz guitar
    begins and ends with having read the name Django Reinhardt somewhere, once.
    But, does it matter?  The drummer uses brushes on some songs, distortion is
    scarce, and the progressions sound damn jazzy. Gone is the sugar that once
    made the medicine go down. It couldn't even be called jazz in rock clothing.</p><p>
    
    And it doesn't always work. The album's second track, ""The-Lived-But-Yet-Named,""
    comes across, both musically and lyrically, as scathing parody. Unfortunately
    for Karate, it isn't. Consider the following lyric: ""How much will the
    Leitmotiv sway to compensate for our fallow-yet-vigorous play?"" Can you
    imagine a context in which that line wouldn't sound completely pompous?
    Yeah, neither can I. And that's because there isn't one. The fact is,
    certain language is just ill-suited for song lyrics. The old Geoff Farina
    sounded like the sort that might steal your girlfriend, then come back
    later in the day to cart off all your old college textbooks. The worst
    lyrical moments of this album paint the portrait of a guy emasculated by
    excessive studying, in dire need of an extension on his dissertation so
    he can go get some sun and air.</p><p>
    
    On the third track, ""Sever,"" Farina makes a passing and pointless reference
    to cultural critic Raymond Williams that, instead of enhancing this otherwise
    good song, adds an unnecessary and unsightly pedantic touch. The same song,
    however, marks one of the album's rare incursions into rock turf. After the
    opening jazz-cum-'70s-buttrock riffage and a few jazzy verses, it delves
    into a prolonged instrumental midsection that pays homage to Black Sabbath.
    In a good way.</p><p>
    
    ""One Less Blues,"" the album's longest and, perhaps, strongest track, opens
    with dissonant, gently-picked guitar over an ominous bass-line. At one point,
    a blues/jazz solo gives way to delay-drenched guitar that eventually circles
    back to the '70s jam-rock feel of ""Sever."" Karate ties these segments
    together seamlessly into an evocative whole.</p><p>
    
    Its missteps aside, <i>Unsolved</i> is both good and daring. It shows Geoff
    and company as the versatile, gifted, and skilled musicians and songwriters
    they are. Perhaps, the strongest case for it is that Karate goes for broke
    whereas fans would have been satisfied by <i>The Bed is in the Ocean II</i>.
    In doing so, Karate made another rewarding and compelling album that forces
    the listener to hear them on their terms.</p></div>"|4385.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4385-unsolved/|7.9|Camilo Arturo Leslie

    Roger Tellier-Craig, and their first recording was a seriously limited
    split 7"" with Godspeed that came as part of the bilingual Montreal
    rag <i>amaZINE</i>.</p><p>
<i><b>Mini review-within-a-review of that amaZINE split:</b> Fly Pan
    Am's track is nothing special-- just a pretty, low-key instrumental rock
    track.  But the Godspeed cut rocks the Bauhaus.  It begins in typical
    Godspeed fashion-- an interview with some old crank. But this guy has a
    fascinating story to tell about the old days of circus sideshows and
    geeks who were, he claims, alcoholics or drug addicts denied their fix.
    The problem now, he says, is all the geeks are roaming the streets,
    instead of in cages where they should be. Perfect. Some cheap strings
    then burst in (I think this was an earlier, 4-track version of Godspeed)
    and they build to a grand, tragic climax until the track is overwhelmed
    by bassed-out electronics. Wow. Now, back to our regularly scheduled
    review.</i></p><p>
    A 1999 eponymous full-length came next from Fly Pan Am, and now comes
    this 30-minute, three-track EP. So, now that we have the background out
    of the way, here comes the part where I tell you what's good and what's
    bad about <i>Sedatif en Fréquences en Sillons</i>. The good is that
    these guys can build an appealing and peculiar instrumental groove.
    The bad is that they spend too much time on other stuff. Let me explain.</p><p>
    The opening track is a kind of remix/reworking of some material off their
    debut. After a few seconds of random noise, Fly Pan Am fall into a driving
    two-chord vamp that features some beautiful picking by Tellier-Craig. This
    opening section builds a head of steam, with a good bit of tension added
    by some threatening noise that weaves in and out.  And then, around the
    four-minute mark, the song disappears completely, and we're treated to
    what sounds like an extended recording of a piss-drunk Norm Abrams tearing
    through his shop, trying to find the right tool to amputate his leg. It's
    nothing particularly interesting, just a bunch of cans rattling about and
    the occasional saw or power drill. The band eventually breaks free of this
    wreckage, staggers back into that beautiful opening, and adds to the mix
    the ethereal, wordless voice of Norsola Johnson, who is seemingly trying
    out for a part in Steve Reich's <i>Proverb</i>.</p><p>
    The second track ""éfférent/afférant"" is essentially a Can tribute, and a
    fine one at that. More electronics and sound effects weave in and out of
    the steady rhythm, with the bass in particular evoking the pulse of ""Yoo
    Doo Right."" Because it's so hypnotic, it's a short ten minutes.  And this
    time, Fly Pan Am make good use of the added dissonant textures. The final
    track is a shorter, slightly more compelling tape noise collage, but again,
    there's nothing too striking or affecting about it.  That about says it.</p></div>"|3118.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3118-sedatif-en-frequences-en-sillons-ep/|6.3|Mark Richard-San

    who saw it would know immediately that it was Picasso who drew it. Now,
    don't think I'm going to be so gauche as to compare Spoon to Picasso
    directly, but hear me out here: you can hear a simple, forceful drumbeat,
    a barked syllable, a quick strum of the guitar, or the crackling note of
    a dying keyboard, and immediately identify it as a sound created by Spoon.
    That's why they're such a great band-- they have the ability to stamp
    their indelible signature on the most atomic components of rock 'n' roll.</p><p>
    
    Of course, not everyone shares my pro-Spoon sentiment-- take Elektra
    Records, the label that half-released <i>A Series of Sneaks</i> in 1998,
    shortly before unceremoniously dropping the band from their roster. For
    nearly two years now, the band has floated around without a label,
    releasing only two singles and a compilation track in that time. But
    finally, Merge Records came to their senses and hooked the band up with
    a deal. Thus, we are graced by the presence of <i>Love Ways</i>, an EP
    recorded <i>after</i> their long-awaited third full-length, <i>Girls Can
    Tell</i> (which will be released early next year by Merge), but released
    now as sort of a ""hi, remember us?"" statement. Although one gets the sense
    that Spoon saved their best material for the full-length, <i>Love Ways</i>
    showcases the band's evolving sound and songwriting skills quite well.</p><p>
    
    Spoon's best work in the past has hinged upon their apparent
    deliberateness-- in the skeletal arrangements of the songs, in the placement
    of decorative sounds, and of course, in the band's playing. In this sense,
    <i>Love Ways</i>' looser vibe works both for and against it; it's proof that
    Britt Daniel can write great, catchy songs even when he's casually tossing
    them off, but it's also not quite as substantial as previous releases.
    Still, there are at least two classic Spoon tracks to be found here: ""Change
    My Life,"" a spooky sigh of a song cut through with lightning bolts of
    guitar clang, and ""Jealousy,"" a deceptively sprightly tune with a
    Beatles-esque bounce playing off a shimmery organ backdrop.</p><p>
    
    But even when they're not 100% on, Spoon can still polish the most
    tarnished cliches to a reflective glimmer. ""I Didn't Come Here to Die""
    sports a pushy, twangy riff that hiccups just often enough that it
    doesn't get too repetitive. On ""The Figures of Art,"" Daniel's voice is
    such that he can sing a cheap line like, ""It's easier to eat a broken
    stomach than drink on an empty heart,"" and still sound heartfelt.
    Finally, there's ""Chips and Dip,"" a doo-wop song without the actual
    doo-wops; the track seems to exist solely so Britt can sing the words,
    ""Shuck and jive."" Although if someone compiled a list of ""Top 10 Words
    or Phrases We've Always Wanted to Hear Britt Daniel Sing,"" I guarantee
    ""shuck and jive"" would be on there somewhere.</p><p>
    
    I've tried to explain the greatness of Spoon to newcomers and nonbelievers,
    without much success; it's just that they have the indescribable ""it"" that
    99% of bands sorely lack. It's the way the molten-glass strands of guitar
    shatter against Jim Eno's Ironman drumming, the way Daniel sings so
    lackadaisically from the back of his throat, the genuinely odd sound loops
    and warm, buzzy layers of organ. <i>Love Ways</i> may not completely deliver
    on Spoon's ""it,"" but it shows that they haven't lost it, and that's pretty
    darn alright.</p></div>"|7427.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7427-love-ways-ep/|7.9|Nick Mirov

    last year's Worst and/or Most Disappointing Albums lists. <i>Pitchfork</i>
    served up a favorable review, but nothing so imperative that it warranted
    purchase or some form of semi-legal piracy. I have a soft spot for Gastr del
    Sol's <i>Camoufleur</i>, but I wouldn't call myself a fan. And in the interest
    of full disclosure, I found Grubbs' beloved <i>The Thicket</i> to be artfully
    dull. Bill Bradley-dull.</p><p>
    
    Last year, New Haven's 33.3 copped a Grubbsian stance on their <i>Plays Music</i>
    with predictably somnolent results. Town and Country's <i>It All Has to Do with
    It</i> treads the same abstract ground. Perhaps the era of detached music is
    passing. Sure, people bristle at Godspeed You Black Emperor!'s apocalyptic
    pomposity, but-- calculated or otherwise-- it beats the hell out of Town and
    Country's studied indifference.  You may not like your emotional content
    spoonfed, but would you rather have it in abeyance?  Simply unavailable.  Town
    and Country make music to accompany cigarette-smoking and beard stroking-- it's
    to be, in a word, appreciated. This is not a particularly sophisticated
    observation but it seems that music designed to have a solely cognitive appeal
    must be so intellectually satisfying that the listener is not distracted by the
    absence of other aesthetic dimensions. Such music must be good to think, and
    this music isn't.</p><p>
    
    Truth be told, <i>It All Has to Do with It</i> is something of a one-trick
    pony: Drone. Rinse. Repeat. People will talk about texture, but it's just
    something to do to keep from turning the television on. <i>It All Has to Do
    with It</i> has virtually no percussion at all, making it a spectral array of
    plodding contrabass (two of them!), arty harmonium, muted trumpets and
    ultra-delicate acoustic guitars. The bells and vibes are obligatory garnishing,
    and the whole affair is shrill and ugly. The final track, ""That Old Feeling,""
    is the album's only promising piece. But the ten minutes of limpid, jazzy
    noise backed by a remarkably constant piercing drone (and followed by four
    minutes of screeching, aimless guitar) fail to excuse the prior 25 minutes of
    irritating drift.</p><p>
<i>It All Has to Do with It</i> is constantly up in the air, lingering:
    virtually nothing that might suggest a theme, either musically or emotionally.
    The effect is singularly amazing: the music is so difficult to locate oneself
    in that you'll always find yourself outside of it, obstructed and pushed around
    by it. I had several minor epiphanies of how incredibly annoyed this music
    made me.  But just because you're interrogating your threshold for aggravation
    doesn't necessarily mean you're in the presence of art.  Like becoming aware of
    a buzzing fluorescent light, or a distant car alarm, the intellectual
    commitment doesn't stretch far beyond: Where is that coming from?  When will
    it stop?  And finally: why won't it stop?</p></div>"|8121.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8121-it-all-has-to-do-with-it/|4.1|Brent S. Sirota

    the funk.  But the fact that even Mr. Funkadelic himself couldn't
    track down the funk these days is testament to the funk's elusive
    nature. Indeed, trying to track down the funk can be not only difficult,
    but dangerous as well; it's been known to lead to a variety of maladies,
    including bad hair and cocaine addiction. Take Rick James: a prime
    example of what happens when an unprepared individual attempts to
    tame the funk.</p><p>
    
    So, it's a good thing the Eternals haven't tried to track down the
    funk.  If they did, the funk may be lost forever, depriving future
    generations of hours of mindless ass-shaking. On their self-titled
    debut LP, these guys manage to pull out the kind of syrupy, deep
    grooves that could trap anything, even the wily funk, like quicksand.</p><p>
    
    Furthermore, I'm not sure if the funk could make it past the Eternals
    without being severely warped and mangled. Catchy and keen as the funk
    may be, it is fairly predictable, relying on a few tried and true (in
    some cases, trite and true) rhythmic techniques, most of which involve
    bass and drums, or heavily wah'd guitars.  So, instead of repackaging
    the old style, the Eternals created some of the thickest, deepest, and
    most beautifully fucked-up grooves imaginable as their new funk
    prototype.</p><p>
    
    Insane keyboards and samplers grind like dentist drills under the
    powerful baritone tremolo and fractured sing-speaking of frontman
    Damon Locks.  But given the nature of his voice, and the similarly
    dramatic and concise bent of his lyrics, it's often hard to say
    whether or not his delivery is intended to be taken so seriously.</p><p>
    
    The real beauty of this record is the way the Eternals seamlessly
    combine so many diverse elements into such a stylistically unique
    mix. Traces of dub, rock, jazz, reggae, and, yes, the funk, are all
    present, but thankfully lack the cartoonish exaggerations
    implemented by other recent bands as a way to garner acclaim.
    Instead of accomplishing this with a few samples, distorted guitars,
    a horn section, and a twinge of wah, the Eternals combine the melodic
    and rhythmic sensibilities of these genres to create a perfectly
    integrated sound, and then flavor it with their own warped sense of
    song structure.</p><p>
    
    If there's any criticism that can be levied against the Eternals, it's
    the fact that, while their music is definitely diverse, the songs on
    this album tend not to stray far from mid-tempo. But when a band has
    come so close to perfecting a given style, would it really be all that
    advantageous for them to try something radically different?  Never
    forget what happened to Sunny Day Real Estate when they tried to
    become Rush.</p><p>
    
    Yes, a lot has happened to the funk in the past 25 years, as evidenced
    by the fact that the closest thing to a funk band you'll see on MTV
    these days is the Red Hot Chili Peppers.  A sharp contrast to the
    Eternals, who eschew the trappings of traditional funk to create the
    rich, organic grooves the genre could only have dreamed of achieving
    in 1975.</p></div>"|2842.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2842-eternals/|8.4|Matt LeMay

    classical statuary erected as perpetually new in the place of the
    perpetually old. This is, after all, the New World; we dedicate these
    talismans against ruin across the landscape almost as if to keep history
    itself at bay, to keep time from catching up with us.  Underfoot are
    bones and detritus, though, the debris of the little nameless events that
    are excluded from American history. It's all a rather shallow grave when
    you think about it.</p><p>
    
    Jackie-O Motherfucker's unprecedented <i>Fig. 5</i>, the group's first
    CD release, presents a dim and unsettling archaeology of American music.
    Released in the wake of the American century, it's the first
    unapologetically brilliant piece of experimental music I've heard this
    year. Somehow constructed bereft of any postmodern irony, <i>Fig. 5</i>
    transforms a commanding grasp on the celebrated tributaries of American
    music-- jazz, Appalachian folk, soul, African-American spirituals, West
    coast surf-rock, Protestant hymns, Louisville post-rock, bluegrass,
    electronic noise-- into an autochthonous gospel. Jackie-O Motherfucker--
    two multi-instrumentalists, Tom Greenwood and Jef Brown and the cadre of
    eclectic talents with whom they surround themselves-- abandoned the remix
    loop jazz-fusion of their first two albums (available only as LPs) and
    literally emerged from the basement and the soil with a masterpiece.</p><p>
    
    The gust-blown digital hum of the first track, ""Analogue Skillet,""
    underpins plucked and scraping strings, like a bow on the nervous system
    itself. It's buzzing neon yielding to something like a screen-door
    creaking on its rusted hinges behind wind chimes in ""Native Einstein,""
    a kind of front porch minimalism. There's a faint chorus of young girls
    counting down in the recesses, playing Double Dutch in the road. The
    strings sound like saws; the lone sax whines like an animal. The scene
    is replaced by the solemn repetition of guitar twang; ""Your Cells are in
    Motion"" is the working man's Mogwai: a funereal procession of rising guitar
    and faint vocals coalescing steadily into shantytown post-rock, tarnished
    but true. Labradford will spend the entirety of their career trying to
    create this song and never get it right.</p><p>
    
    The choral ""Go Down, Old Hannah,"" performed here by the Amalgamated
    Everlasting Union Chorus Local #824, is a prison camp work song dating
    back to the turn of the century-- a plea for sunset to end the workday.
    ""Amazing Grace,"" the slave trader John Newton's ubiquitous 1779 hymn to
    God, is barely recognizable as Appalachian free jazz: steely banjos and
    twittering horns that sound like bagpipes are equal parts mountain folk
    and Pharoah Sanders.</p><p>
    
    The lilting ""Beautiful September"" provides an interlude of catchy No
    Depression dream-rock. But the album's centerpiece is clearly the tribal
    24-minute ""Michigan Avenue Social Club,"" a track that sounds at times
    like dismembered Gershwin, and at other times like Cul de Sac with horns.
    <i>Fig 5.</i> fades out on the brief, chirping ""Madame Curie,"" dissolving
    into the earth from which the whole work arose.</p><p>
    
    For all its disparate strands, <i>Fig. 5</i> is surprisingly cohesive,
    constructing some ratcheted new sound with junk and memory rather than
    laundering old sounds with the irony and veiled contempt of other
    pastiche exercises. The disc itself is packaged in an oddly fascinating
    die-cut cardboard folio, complete with snippets of Alan Lomax's celebrated
    American ethnomusicology. <i>Fig. 5</i> is slow and plodding like time
    itself. This work, again, simply has no precedents. Or rather, its
    precedents lie in the dusty anonymities of American musical history,
    instead of the proud and touted monuments of our cultural past.  Listen to
    it once if you can.  It is our secret national anthem.</p></div>"|4187.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4187-fig-5/|9.2|Brent S. Sirota

    the small silver disc contained therein.  Suddenly, staring up at me from
    beneath the clear plastic tray of Laurent Garnier's <i>Unreasonable Behaviour</i>
    were the following words:</p><p>
<i>""J'espére que tu t'es lavé les mains avant de me toucher!!!""</i></p><p>
    Or, as those of you who endured four years of high school French have already
    translated, ""I hope that you washed your hands before touching me!!!""  ""My
    God,"" I gasped as I read the words over and over. ""It can't be-- a clean
    Frenchman!""  (Tactful, yes?)</p><p>
    Sadly, Garnier's request didn't quite mesh with my usual ritual of soaking my
    hands in rancid donkey piss before reviewing an album.  (I figure, if athletes
    are allowed their fucked up good-luck charms, who's to say critics shouldn't
    be allowed the same idiosyncrasies?)  I hadn't yet listened to the album, and
    I wasn't sure if it was worth the effort of heeding its warning. But here at
    <i>Pitchfork</i>, we believe in giving any album, regardless of nationality,
    the benefit of the doubt.</p><p>
    Popping the disc in, I couldn't help but harbor a secret hope that Garnier
    would single-handedly manage to cast away the obnoxious kitsch that is too
    often associated with French dance music. It wouldn't be easy, though-- within
    a few seconds of <i>Unreasonable Behaviour</i>'s opener, it was pretty clear
    that Garnier was working well within the range of Mute Records' burbling synth
    and drum machine electronica.</p><p>
    Indeed, the album has all the tenets of this particular variety of electronic
    music: relatively simple, slightly lounge-tinged chord structures, spastic
    synth melodies, and stereotypical drum machine beats. What makes <i>Unreasonable
    Behaviour</i> of note is the fact that, at his best, Garnier understands the
    single greatest asset of the type of music he's working with: it sounds really
    cool. <i>Unreasonable Behaviour</i> excels through simple flourishes-- the
    thundering bass synth in ""The Warning,"" the blaring trumpet in ""The Man with
    the Red Face,"" and the flanged snare drum of ""Forgotten Thoughts."" Melodically,
    though, there's nothing new here.  Typical techno fare.</p><p>
    Though this record is, at times, immensely cool-sounding, Garnier seems to
    have difficulty overcoming the quirk. An open note to all techno musicians:
    <i>Vocoders are not cool</i>. ""Hey!  It's a voice, but it sounds like a
    computer! Neat!"" No, not neat. On <i>Unreasonable Behaviour</i>'s mercifully
    short title track, Garnier couples a thoroughly annoying vocoder with an
    equally annoying speech about techno. One minute and twenty seconds of sheer
    annoyance.  And just as irritating, but longer, is the extended foray into
    heavy-handed manipulated vocals on ""Greed (Part 1+2).""</p><p>
<i>Unreasonable Behavior</i> is a very well-executed album at times, but it
    certainly doesn't live up to its name.  Garnier is quick to point out that
    the CD and vinyl versions of this album contain different tracks and mixes:
    ""Unreasonable behaviour? You said it!"" No, Laurent, I didn't say it.  But aside
    from putting words in your mouth, Garnier seems hell-bent on putting words on
    his albums.  Bad, bad words.  Minus the kitsch, this album would get a
    pristine thumb pointed upwards. But it's going to take a lot more than
    Garnier's brand of uneven techno to get me to wash these hands.</p></div>"|3400.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3400-unreasonable-behaviour/|7.0|Matt LeMay

    Hell, at this point, he seems damn near anachronistic, reeking of floppy
    canvas sneakers and backwards baseball caps and songs about girls and
    inoffensively distorted guitars. Gedge fronted the long-also-running UK group
    the Wedding Present for 12 years, patenting a strummy, light-angst sound
    that was frustratingly difficult to take seriously, despite the craft and
    quality concealed in their best work.</p><p>
    
    The Wedding Present legendarily shoved early Pavement buzz into high gear with
    their b-side cover of ""Box Elder,"" and no less an authority than Steve Albini
    deemed them ""nice enough to date your sister."" Couple that with a brace of
    songs that define the mid-'90s non-twee pop aesthetic, and the race is over:
    in a quiet, continually underplayed, terminally unhip way, the Wedding Present
    stand as possibly the most important U.K. indie-pop act of the decade. Though
    Madchester bands and shoegazers often pick up the most dap for such
    achievements, the Wedding Present delivered more quality for a longer period
    than your favorite Limeytalk-spouting heroes could dream of.</p><p>
    
    The Wedding Present have apparently folded, having maintained a resolute
    four-year silence, and Gedge has recouped with Cinerama.  The band still
    features Gedge's endearingly froggy vocals jousting with their self-consciously
    ""cute""-voiced foil, keyboardist Sally Murrell. The songs still revolve around
    banal/timeless troubles of the heart, though the driving forces are still so
    defiantly pro-craft, pro-pop and anti-experimentation that it makes one wonder
    where Gedge does his record shopping. It's as if the man's never heard hip-hop,
    jungle, free jazz or any of the other rock-band additives du jour.</p><p>
    
    Gedge has, however, definitely heard of Portishead. Either that, or he's a
    closet '60s-exotica soundtrack fan. Cinerama spike the dorkcore stylings of
    their frontman with heavy doses of tinkly cocktail Moog, smatterings of
    wah-wah guitar, and chilly Serge Gainsbourg arrangements. Once again, starting
    a trip hop-inflected pop band in A.D. 1998 is hardly cutting edge, but hipster
    cred has never been Gedge's principle motivation.</p><p>
    
    Though the band's long-players, <i>Va Va Voom</i> and the near-fabulous
    <i>Disco Volante</i>, have been quite cool, any longtime Gedgeophile can tell
    you the real story of the man's work is in the singles. <i>This is Cinerama</i>
    studiously compiles the first slew of less-than-12"" action by the group, and
    keeps the winning streak going.</p><p>
    
    ""Kerry Kerry"" kicks things off with a slab of affable, acoustic pop, but the
    song's b-side, ""Love,"" really gets things going. Over a bed of the funkiest
    guitar a SpinArt recording artist's ever mustered, and a fugue of keyboard
    lines, Gedge sings of the titular subject while the Delgados' Emma Pollock
    circles him with gorgeous, sweeping harmonies. ""Manhattan"" clocks in at a
    relatively epic five minutes, and it's a crowning example of Cinerama's more
    atmospheric approach. There's barely any guitar on the track, the melody sounds
    played on a synthetic harpsichord, and sampled horns build to the chorus.
    Where most groups who traffic in such aesthetic oddities are content to
    congratulate themselves for figuring out ProTools, Gedge's rock-solid pop
    instincts smoothly integrate such atmosphere into yet another love-gone-wrong
    standard. The insertion is so seamless, it becomes hard to remember there's
    anything remotely odd going on at all.</p><p>
    
    So, no, Gedge's new atmospheric palette hasn't taken him far from his favorite,
    untimely concerns. He hasn't suddenly embraced Marxism, Hegelian dialectics
    or post-structuralism. He's still talking about love and sorrow, growing old
    when you still feel like a child. None of these social problems are as au
    courant as the WTO or the death of language, but they'll never be irrelevant,
    either. Somebody's got to keep a handle on this stuff, and who does it better
    than this?</p></div>"|1472.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1472-this-is-cinerama/|7.5|Sam Eccleston

    something for a highly specialized portion of the population, but hardly a
    crowd-pleaser in any sense of the word. After all, Mountain Goats albums
    sound like most band's demos, superficially speaking-- the lion's share of
    the project's corpus is John Darnielle singing and strumming an acoustic
    guitar into a boombox.</p><p>
    
    One can't claim stylistic innovation for the group, exactly, because whatever
    innovation has occurred over the course of their many records has been purely
    internal. The introduction of a violin, an electric guitar, a Casio keyboard
    or, hell, a studio is an occasional treat for a listener, but the Goats are
    hardly going to be called reinventors of rock music or synthesizers of a bold
    new style. The question presented by any record of this ilk is, of course, do
    we need more of this stuff? With formally adventurous rock music pushed
    progressively to the fringes of culture, do we need more records on which
    people further explore territory that's already been mapped to perfection?</p><p>
    
    But, then, does innovation really matter in the end?  What Darnielle and his
    merry band are doing, with more acuity and aplomb than virtually anyone in
    that great fog of ""independent music,"" is preserving a specific kind of craft
    and clear-headed thinking that, in these days of Grooveboxes and 20-minute
    remixes, is going the way of the dinosaur.</p><p>
    
    These kinds of portentous statements might irk someone with a casual awareness
    of the Goats' oeuvre, partially because Darnielle stubbornly refuses to hand
    over the goods on a casual listening. A lot of the band's songs sound, at
    first, like a frantically battered acoustic guitar accompanied by vocals which
    don't come near anyone's definition of sonorous or pretty, however passionate
    their delivery. Craft and aplomb don't seem to enter the equation.</p><p>
    
    That ain't Darnielle's fault, though. The years of lo-fi supremacy have
    forever paired home recording and acoustic musicianship with the most unctuous
    kinds of sincerity and confessionalism. Consequently, Darnielle's writing,
    loaded with narrative trapdoors and non-explicit references to other works,
    is grouped in with every piece of my-girl-done-wrong twaddle any college
    student with a Tascam might decide to dress up with a drum machine and a
    made-up record label.  But to view the Mountain Goats as a contemporary Cat
    Stevens project with a higher tolerance for speaker damage is to miss the
    pleasure.</p><p>
    
    On <i>The Coroner's Gambit</i>, our fearless guide shows off some of his
    sharpest writing yet. There are both cutting lines (""I'm just grateful my
    children aren't here to see this/ If you'd ever seen fit to give me children"")
    and masterful set pieces (the rending ""Elijah"") which exhibit Darnielle's
    storytelling ability.  But those descriptions imply that <i>The Coroner's
    Gambit</i> is pleasant singer/songwriter craft-- all spare arrangements and
    lilting whimsy.  On the contrary: ""spare"" is hardly the word for this stuff.
    These songs are filled to bursting with feeling, with words, with characters,
    with purpose. It often seems like there's nothing going on at all on a
    Mountain Goats track. But careful listening to rhythmic flourishes, throwaway
    choruses, and the inflections of single words reveals that there's more
    happening here than anyone could possibly ask for.</p><p>
    
    Put the emphasis on ""story,"" of course. Though Darnielle's readings sound
    anguished and intimate enough at times to suggest that this is a bad-breakup
    record without parallel, he never suggests that these are real-life nuggets
    of wisdom. Instead, <i>The Coroner's Gambit</i> is a deeply heartfelt record
    about, among other things, the impermanence of life and relationships that
    draws from actual feeling but recontextualizes those feelings in carefully
    wrought ballads and story songs.</p><p>
    
    Even better, the musical accompaniment on <i>Gambit</i> is Darnielle's best
    yet.  Where records like <i>Nine Black Poppies</i> got along on guitar bashing
    and enthusiasm, the new offering uses an almost astonishingly subtle approach.
    ""Island Garden Song"" floats over a surprisingly intricate guitar filigree, and
    the violin that weaves in and out of ""Onions"" is cleverly integrated enough to
    put to rest any Goats-directed accusations of primitivism.</p><p>
    
    Of course, any rabidly enthusiastic review for a record of this nature-- one
    that executes its given project carefully and movingly, and shows little
    interest in smashing boundaries-- begs a question: why do we need more of
    this?  Why do we need more well-executed folk-pop songs about the travails of
    the heart?  For those of us out here in the weird-rock hinterlands, sandwiched
    as we are between cloying, cute obviousness and foggy abstraction, the answer
    to that question is simple: we need this more now than ever.</p></div>"|5453.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5453-the-coroners-gambit/|8.5|Sam Eccleston

    indie empire would have, not so many years ago, claimed as staunch
    subjects-- are now defecting for the surprising country of underground
    hip-hop: it's the directness, stupid.</p><p>
    
    Have you noticed them missing? Sure, you have. The kids sneaking into
    grown-up rock shows are getting putzier and putzier, and the bands are
    getting older and older. Where once one could expect the rare, youthful
    outburst to transform itself into redemptive wonder, indie rock coolness
    is largely derived these days by relative oldsters.  Meanwhile,
    underground hip-hop websites, fanzines and record stores are showing up
    left and right.  How come They of Beats and Rhymes are getting the
    enthusiasm They of Cardigans and Uncertain Rhythms once enjoyed?</p><p>
    
    For a fairly detailed answer, look no further than <i>Reflection Eternal</i>,
    the new LP by Black Star stalwart Talib Kweli and DJ wunderkind Hi-Tek. The
    album's a good example of what's right with hip-hop lately and wrong with
    a lot of rock and roll.</p><p>
    
    Like his sometime groupmate Mos Def's <i>Black on Both Sides</i> (though
    with a substantive drop in articulation and a proportional increase in
    kneejerk argumentation), Talib Kweli's new joint is wry, reflective,
    principled and questing. Despite his occasional propensity for
    self-righteousness (""[I'm a] best-selling author writing great chapters
    in history""), Kweli is generally expressive and concerned, rather than
    hectoring and moralizing.</p><p>
    
    Because it lunges forth from NYC-based undergroundism, Kweli and Tek aren't
    particularly concerned with funkiness. Instead, Hi-Tek's beats thud and
    thwack steadily, possessing flow instead of heft, and reliability in lieu
    of inventiveness. Kweli uses the rhythm as a foundation, building rambling,
    baroque rhyme structures on top of them, exhibiting his cock-eyed ""skills.""
    This kind of braggadocio doesn't weaken the effort in the same way his
    moralizing self-canonization does, if only because he can often back
    those claims up.</p><p>
    
    Unlike a lot of present and future 12"" soldiers, Kweli is full of things he
    wants to say.  When he thanks his parents for not divorcing until their kids
    were older, it's a rending, astonishing moment; his praise for
    African-American women is a crowning moment for rap empathy. It's one of
    the few occasions where hip-hop has deigned strive for tenderness over
    all else.</p><p>
    
    Which brings me to the music's current ascendancy among the weird-teen set:
    <i>Reflection Eternal</i> includes, among its other virtues, an open
    description of its self-perceived place in the world. Where independent
    rock music has abandoned its own position as an aesthetically driven,
    non-dogmatic community of performer/audience equals for interesting,
    but ultimately non-communicative abstraction, hip-hop continues to build
    from the essential impetus for lasting, powerful art: ""Hi, how are you?
    My name's...""</p></div>"|4548.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4548-reflection-eternal/|7.9|Sam Eccleston

    <i>Making Bones</i>, the group's last release, to make sure I hadn't
    underestimated it. Like everybody, I occasionally dismiss a record and find
    out later that I kind of like it. I remembered that I didn't think much about
    <i>Making Bones</i> when I reviewed it way back in 1998, and <i>Our Aim is to
    Satisfy</i> sounded good right out of the blocks. A quick listen to <i>Making
    Bones</i> eased my mind: it's not terrible, but it sounds pretty average.
    This year's model is anything but. The songwriting is sharper, the sounds are
    more varied, and there is barely any British-accented rapping (an extreme and
    possibly xenophobic personal bias).</p><p>
    
    Oddly, the thing that keeps this band from greatness is their insistence on a
    live rhythm section. I never could have imagined myself saying such a thing
    five or six years ago. Back then, I always wanted drums to sound live, even
    if I knew they were sampled. I liked a certain amount of electro and '80s pop,
    but the sound of drum machines in general turned me off, especially when there
    was no ""song"" working as a counter. But having ingested so much digitally-based
    music over the last couple of years, I've come to appreciate the expressive
    power of the computer. Red Snapper's drum sound and the stand-up acoustic bass
    are very similar on most of their tracks (also the problem with my once-beloved
    Soul Coughing), and it now strikes me as a limitation.</p><p>
    
    Still, there's much on <i>Our Aim is to Satisfy</i> to love. The first track,
    ""Keeping Pigs Together,"" sets the tone. An instrumental (my favorite kind
    of Red Snapper track), the song borrows its chords from U2's lovely ""October,""
    adding a churning beat beneath to drive home the plaintive melody.  Soon,
    the disc rolls into ""Some Kind of Kink,"" wherein Red Snapper bring the funk
    with <i>two</i> basslines at work: one owes a lot to the O'Jays' ""For the
    Love of Money""; the other works its scholarship for the Roni Size Brown Paper
    Bag School of Slippery Acoustic Drum-n-Bass.  Tack on a pounding snare, a
    spooky synth refrain, and some pinched, stanky vocals right out the 1970s
    and you got yourself a killer track.</p><p>
    
    Similarly impressive is ""The Rake,"" with an odd Donald Duck style vocorder and
    the kind of spare, low-key rapping I can deal with. And several of the new
    trip-hop-meets-soul cuts, which were unbearable on <i>Making Bones</i>, end
    up working rather well. ""Shellback"" contrasts slow, heavy beats with the
    angelic voice of Karime Kendra. Sure, she hasn't got anything to say, but
    she says it rather beautifully.  A few of the tracks in the latter half of
    the record fail to register at all, but enough standouts remain to recommend
    <i>Our Aim is to Satisfy</i> to the curious.</p></div>"|6723.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6723-our-aim-is-to-satisfy-red-snapper/|7.6|Mark Richard-San

    of Champions</i>, grows on you at a rate that would make the Andromeda strain
    proud.  Each time I listened, my tentative rating for it jumped at least a
    point, to wind up at a respectable, if not outstanding 6.8.  Which is fairly
    impressive for a band that plays some of the most straightforward, guileless
    music west of the San Andreas Fault.  Initially, I vainly sought some higher
    meaning or nobler purpose in the band's music.  But the joke was on me; there's
    only one level to <i>Kingdom of Champions</i>: a visceral level.  So light
    your smoke, drink your beer, lower your expectations, and enjoy the music.</p><p>
    Frontman Aaron Espinoza channels Social Distortion's Mike Ness fairly
    effectively (sans the poor-man's Rob Halford faux-biker chic image) throughout
    half the disc.  Side-stepping harmonies work surprisingly well in place of
    sneered ones, and the shouted backup vocal adds... well, shouting.  The songs
    are also very mildly dissonant, but in measured, tried-and-true ways.</p><p>
    Aside from the early Social Distortion feel, though, a lot of the ubiquitous
    post-punk influences pop up blatantly, in that nose-on-your-face kind of way:
    Hüsker Dü, Wire, Buzzcocks, the Fall and the Pixies.  About the only thing you
    couldn't see coming is the bass intro terrifyingly similar to Circle Jerks'
    ""15 Minutes"" that makes an appearance on ""Eileen.""  Dismiss that as coincidence,
    I suppose.</p><p>
<i>Kingdom of Champions</i>' highlight comes at the halfway mark in a
    triumvirate of blessed, fortunate songs.  The droning ""Dead on the Dancefloor,""
    which feels like a more agreeable ""Levitate Me,"" declares ""Backwards she bent/
    And now she's dead/ She got what she asked for/ She's dead on the dancefloor/
    She cut a rug.""  While far from revelatory, the lyrics affect through a
    seditious whispered delivery.  The balladry of the title track follows with
    a casual and effortless grace that drifts from your consciousness almost
    before you realized it was there, like a wisp of hickory campfire smoke.
    ""A.M. Countdown"" recalls something borne out of the same Southern Gothic
    sensibility that sustained bands like Pylon and the young REM for so many
    years.  Also in strong contention is the penultimate ""I Can't Take This,""
    which nods ever so slightly to their more rootsy debut, <i>Filthy Doorways</i>,
    with rollicking verses set against its angrier, malevolent chorus.</p><p>
    Oddly, Earlimart chose to end <i>Kingdom of Champions</i> anti-climactically,
    with a recorded drunk rant that clocks in at nearly 5\xBD wasted minutes.  It
    seems little more than an in-joke committed to plastic, and baffles with every
    listen.  I mean, far be it from me, whose bands have never made it to the
    point of walking through the doors of a recording studio, to cast stones at
    others.  Still, my mama told me not to waste food because other people in the
    world are starving.  And this track stands out as one of the few poor
    decisions here.  Even weaker songs like ""Cabin Fever"" and ""Tuxedos"" don't bomb
    as much as lurk in boring anonymity.</p><p>
    On this record, Earlimart abandons the country-folk leanings of their debut
    full-length in favor of executing some fairly accomplished, pop-informed
    post-punk.  But they're not the second coming of your favorite defunct band,
    as their influences might suggest.  (Would you really want that, anyway?)
    Rather, <i>Kingdom of Champions</i> has the feel of a local band made good.
    Every mid-sized, Midwestern, middle-income college town has a dozen bands
    just like Earlimart.  You buy their records, go to their shows, and hang out
    with the members.  And you root them on, hoping they manage to make the jump
    into the minor leagues where they can begin to get the recognition they
    deserve.  And if nothing else, Earlimart is one band that's worth rooting
    for.</p></div>"|2651.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2651-kingdom-of-champions/|6.8|John Dark

    owned a copy of Superdrag's major label debut, <i>Regretfully Yours</i>. I'd
    heard the album's first single, ""Sucked Out,"" somewhere and more or less
    liked what I heard.  It was your basic pop song-- nothing to write home
    about-- but what made it stand out were its slick pop vocals.  I mean, the
    other components of the track might not have set my ass ablaze, but those
    harmonies and melodies were just too goddamned catchy for me to ignore.</p><p>
    
    So, like any curious music fan might, I went out and bought the album under
    the assumption that if the band had written one good song, they might have
    written more.  Well, they did, technically.  Every track on <i>Regretfully
    Yours</i> lived up to the standard set by that first single.  Unfortunately,
    none surpassed it.  In fact, none of the songs on the album seemed the least
    bit interested in deviating from that standard in any way, whatsoever.  So,
    instead of having bought one enjoyable, guilty pleasure of a power-pop song,
    I'd sunk my money into an entire album of them.</p><p>
    
    At first I was okay with it, but as I listened to the album over time, I
    began to feel cheated. I wanted substance to my music-- some change or risk,
    not x number of cloned, lazy pop-rock tracks. So <i>Regretfully Yours</i>,
    which had potential to be a truly entertaining album, ended up being a mildly
    pleasant, but completely insubstantial piece of disposable modern music,
    instead-- something you listen to while waiting for the really, really
    powerful music to come your way.</p><p>
    
    Four years later, the boys in Superdrag-- now minus one major label record 
    deal with Elektra-- hit us with <i>In the Valley of Dying Stars</i>. Besides
    bearing one of the most comically melodramatic titles of the year, <i>In the
    Valley</i> has the unfortunate pressure of being Superdrag's ""comeback album.""
    After strip-mining the already predictable sound of <i>Regretfully Yours</i>
    and recycling it into their universally ignored sophomore album, <i>Head Trip
    in Every Key</i> (even <i>I</i> didn't buy that one), Superdrag hit the skids,
    stopped selling records, and like so many unlucky bastards before them, fell
    out of the public eye.  Now they're back, out to reclaim a place in the
    spotlight. How do these musical pioneers plan on doing this?  Frankly, by 
    releasing the same damn album for a third, and hopefully final, time.</p><p>
    
    I guess someone in Superdrag is going to have to lose an eye before they figure
    out that this gimmick just doesn't cut it. Two albums' worth of dismal record
    sales and critical dismissal hasn't yet convinced them that you need more than
    slick production and greasy, infectious vocal hooks to make good music.</p><p>
    
    Don't get me wrong, this stuff isn't actually that awful.  I mean, they could
    do a hell of a lot worse.  A lot of the music on <i>In the Valley</i> (and
    their other albums and EPs) is catchy, cleverly arranged and generally well
    put together. The music is respectable rock, and whoever writes their songs
    deserves a pat on the back for their sugary-sweet harmony work. Still, <i>In
    the Valley</i> is music that's more likely to make you fall asleep than air
    guitar.</p><p>
    
    Built around their trademark fuzzy guitars and drums buried so low in the mix they
    sound almost embarrassed to be there, Superdrag's latest offering comes off as a
    predictable, less intelligent alternative to Built to Spill's <i>There's Nothing
    Wrong with Love</i>. Crammed with standard chord progressions and lyrics too vague
    to have any emotional impact, <i>In the Valley of Dying Stars</i> is nice enough
    to listen to in small doses, but it's that less intelligent and predictable part
    of the Superdrag sound that keeps the album from being all-around good. Twelve
    tracks is apparently not enough breathing room for these guys, as the boys rarely
    bother to vary from their standard three-minute, three-chord, pop-savvy formula,
    churning out an album consisting of one texture, one style, and one trick.</p><p>
    
    The real bitch, though, is that <i>In the Valley</i> hints at what these guys might
    be capable of if they just took some chances. Three tracks stand out on the album:
    the ridiculously titled ""The Warmth of the Tomb,"" ""Ambulance Driver,"" and
    ""Unprepared.""  These three tracks have one thing in common: they sound different
    than the rest of the shit on the album. ""Ambulance Driver"" has an obvious country/
    southern-rock twang that adds some much-needed soul to the Superdrag catalog; ""The
    Warmth of the Tomb"" and ""Some Kind of Tragedy"" are both slower, looser numbers than
    the band's typical hyperactive, economy-sized numbers. On these tracks, the band
    actually sound like they're enjoying playing the music, and not just trying to get
    the hell out of the studio before their time expires.</p><p>
    
    There is honest-to-god musical potential here, I swear. Superdrag isn't a total lost
    cause. In fact, even their mistakes as better than they used to be. This, combined
    with the genuinely good tracks on the album might mean that, after three records,

    (Yes, that old thing.)  Well, Jega went to architecture school with \xB5-ziq and
    Aphex Twin, so he'd know more about that than most. Unsurprisingly, Jega
    sounds not unlike his better-known classmates. Falling squarely into the
    this-is-techno-but-don't-dance-to-it camp, Dylan Nathan tics and quirks like
    any addled British gent with too much time, an ugly beard (I presume) and an
    808 should. But, distinguishing him from the rest of the ""Look, ma! I'm a
    genius"" dance music crowd, Nathan clearly took better notes in architecture
    than the rest of the IDM crowd ever bothered to.</p><p>
    Far more than his stateside debut, <i>Spectrum</i>, Jega's <i>Geometry</i> is
    preoccupied with questions of space. The record opens with a vast humming
    sound, as if Nathan were demonstrating how big a space he's working in by
    recording a huge wind rushing through it. Though the first appearance of
    actual music diminishes that scale down to the humble bleeps and clicks of
    ""Alternating Bit,"" a caustic little digibyte of electro-inspired troublemaking,
    every piece here is as carefully thought out as a building might be.</p><p>
    Principally, <i>Geometry</i> supplants the fury and blistering speed of the
    first few Jega offerings with a glassy, almost pretty surface. Where the last
    record took a page from Squarepusher's relentless, haywire jitteriness, many
    pieces here sound like Philip Glass with a shorter attention span and no
    interest in opera. Keyboards slither between, over and under beats; songs
    move with almost mathematic precision (<i>Geometry</i>, get it?). If the
    last Jega album, as some pundits remarked, invented drill-n-bass, this is
    ""chill-n-bass.""  This isn't the chamber-music transcendence of Aphex Twin's
    slower moments; it's a gorgeous absense of feeling. The tracks work like
    clockwork and with approximately as much emotional commitment. And just
    because it won't make you cry doesn't mean you won't nod your head.</p><p>
    Still, anyone who's looking to techno like this stuff for matters of the
    heart is missing the point. The stuttering beats and languid melodies at
    once conceal and describe the undergirdings beneath them, making
    <i>Geometry</i> a fascinating, if not moving, musical experience. This
    is music about the experience of listening to music. It's like singing
    about dancing about architecture.</p></div>"|4230.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4230-geometry/|6.5|Sam Eccleston

There shouldn't be any way possible on
    God's green earth that a British art-punk with anarchosyndicalist leanings
    could put together a band that includes an acknowledged ex-member of KMFDM
    on pedal steel guitar and make credible-sounding circa-1960 roots country.
    Worse, this lot of expats do it a lot better than most Americans of the same
    ilk.</p><p>
    
    Admit it. It rankles a little bit when someone from exotic climes with his or
    her own cultural legacy waiting to be exploited comes along and exploits ours
    better than we do. By all rights, Jon Langford's roots project ought to be a
    collection of rockin' madrigals and ballads about flowers. We've got a brace
    of alt-country upstarts who can defame our glorious traditions just fine,
    thanks. Where does this pack of goofy bastards get off thinking they can
    one-up our national heritage?</p><p>
    
    But they do, damn it. Jon Langford has always utilized his extracurricular
    time with the Wacos to exorcise the C&amp;W; demons that have lurked in his work
    with the Mekons since the 1980s. Where great Mekons albums integrate a vaguely
    folkish, space cowboy vibe, the Waco Brothers sound like real-deal ten-gallon
    hatters with a grouchy streak and a subscription to <i>The Nation</i>. There
    are no body-positive-feminist allegories about pirates to be found here. Sure,
    there's a William Blake nod on occasion, but mostly, Langford and
    co-singer/songwriter Dean Schlabowske invoke the spirit of the common man,
    crank up the hollow-body guitars and rock their wary ways.</p><p>
    
    Hoping for artistic growth is completely off the subject when talking about
    the Waco Brothers. After all, the band's an acknowledged nostalgia act. All
    the same, despite its bellicose title, <i>Electric Waco Chair</i> finds our
    boys in a relatively contemplative mood: the songs center generally on getting
    older; the tempos aren't nearly as frantic as they've been in the past; and
    the jokes here are at least a little bit subtler. The Wacos still want to be
    the party band in the honky-tonk at the end of the world, but they've come to
    realize they need a couple slow jams for couples to dance to.</p><p>
<i>Chair</i>, eager to please as other Waco offerings, includes a brace of
    crowdpleasers. The air of scabrousness that hovers over most Mekons projects
    isn't anywhere to be found here, replaced instead with a rummy goodheartedness
    in short supply among independent-label socialists these days. Langford seems
    unnecessarily into channeling Billy Bragg at times-- particularly on the
    egregious ""Walking on Hell's Roof Looking at the Flowers""-- and some of the
    arrangements are a little shticky, like when the Brothers attempt a
    Spanish-flavored feel on ""Cornered.""  But nit-picking individual moments here
    is pointless spoil-sportsmanship. It's like going to a great rent party and
    complaining that the beer sucks.</p><p>
    
    The Waco Brothers aren't about flawless, detailed songcraft. They're about
    lager-soaked good times with just enough anxiety and doubt to make the trip
    worth taking.  And, in that respect, <i>Electric Waco Chair</i> never
    disappoints. Though these fellas don't take the country idiom as seriously as
    your favorite American punk-countryist might, they sure have a great time
    doing their work.</p><p>
    
    If anything, their irreverence toward country music is what separates the
    Waco Brothers from the herd. Where American revivalists are frustratingly
    serious about their music, treating country like holy writ, the Waco Brothers
    don't have the same stake in it. Because it's not their history, they can
    treat it as a contemporary event and return it to the go-for-broke fun spirit
    behind all that worship old-time tunage gets subjected to. Besides, who wants
    to listen to madrigals all day, anyhow?</p></div>"|8552.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8552-electric-waco-chair/|7.2|Sam Eccleston

    Delworth, Deanna Vargona, Paul Niehaus, Allen Lowrey, Jonathan Marx, C. Scott Chase, Marc
    Trovillion, Kurt Wagner, Paul Burch Jr., Mark Nevers, Dennis Cronin, Alex McManus, and Matt
    Swanson, with non-Lambchop members Tony Crow, Ken Coomer, Matt Bach, Paul Booker, the Nashville
    String Machine, and a choir.  The list is so long I considered throwing my name in there to see
    if anyone noticed, but I don't really want to slip casually into ""the Lambchops"" (as I like to
    call them).  Here's why:</p><p>
    
    First off, I'd have to be really quiet.  Even if my only involvement in the band was
    irresponsibly tossing my name into a list of band members, I'd probably be typing too loudly
    to be let into the club.  Lambchop don't rock at all.  Sometimes they embody the lilting tempo
    and achy narratives of a slow, Southern night.  Other times, they explore the soul-inspired
    fantasies of an obedient student at orchestra practice.  They do, however, occasionally
    approximate swelling mushy-movie music, with the help of the Nashville String Machine.
    Secondly, I'm sure I'm not cool enough to be on the inside of this joke.</p><p>
    
    My family and I listened to <i>Nixon</i> on the car ride to my brother's graduation.  My
    grandmother liked it, but it was ""too smooth"" for my parents to get through.  Much like
    Bacharach, an influence in Wagner's writing on ""You Masculine You,"" Lambchop's smooth n' easy
    orchestral pop-meets-country-meets-soul sound sits best with grandmothers who like the style of
    the music but can't make out the lyrics, and with hipsters who ""get it.""</p><p>
    
    Lambchop is a fusion of styles that both transgresses formal genre boundaries and creates an
    unsettling disjuncture by pairing in-the-know lyrics with the more conservative sounds and
    production styles of Nashville.  That being said, <i>Nixon</i> serves as a reminder that
    expertly executed stylistic hybrids and ironic juxtapositions-- great though they may be--
    don't replace memorable songwriting.  Sure, it's a novel concept, but while some of us may
    still be patient enough to ""get it"" five albums into the band's career, Wagner's talent and
    unique vision should demand a more challenging album.</p><p>
    
    For a project involving so many musicians, there's something stifled and almost claustrophobic
    about this album's overall sound.  It's not unlike spending several hours with your family in
    a small box that moves at a consistent pace over farmland and rolling hills.  Images of
    families and endless days are cataloged as the countryside maps itself through a car window,
    cleansed of the intellectual stimulation or emotional strain of staying in one of the many
    passing homes.  Both the ironic distance built into their indie-intellgensia-meets-Appalachian
    lyrics, as well as the almost scientific blending of styles, feels like detached pastiche.
    You're listening through a car window.  Did I mention that one of your family members sometimes
    sings in an annoying ""soulful"" falsetto after listening to one too many Earth, Wind and Fire 
    records?</p><p>
    
    In the plainest terms possible, <i>Nixon</i> is a record for grandmothers and hipsters.  It's
    also turned out to be a record for yuppies who ask, ""Who was that pleasant group that opened
    for Yo La Tengo?"" when in pursuit of the perfect album to soundtrack their wine-and-cheese
    parties.  Several of my friends who heard <i>Nixon</i> said, ""This isn't bad.""  But it isn't
    bad in the most damning way.  The songs are decent, it's carefully arranged and well produced,
    and it's even innovative in ways.  But while it's hard to imagine hating Lambchop, it's also
    hard to believe they could be anyone's favorite band.</p><p>
    
    On <i>Come On Pilgrim</i>, Black Francis sings, ""I wanna be a singer like Lou Reed.""  While
    Kurt Wagner's voice at times recalls Lou Reed, no one will ever pen, ""I said I wanna a be a
    singer like Kurt Wagner/ 'I like Kurt Wagner,' she said sticking her tongue in my ear."" That's
    because Wagner's songwriting is smart, well-crafted and creates its own stylistic niche
    garnering critical acclaim, but simply fails to inspire or leave a permanent mark the way
    Lou Reed or Frank Black have. I'm perusing <i>Nixon</i>'s liner notes in a failed attempt to
    find something smart to write regarding the ""Suggested Reading"" list of books on Richard Nixon,
    but the album's already fallen out of rotation.  You got it-- my grandmother and I are
    listening to the Pixies.</p></div>"|4657.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4657-nixon/|6.5|Kristin Sage Rockermann

    one paid attention to (including, it sometimes seemed, himself), Merle Haggard
    signed with the Epitaph subsidiary Anti-. This move afforded the prolific
    veteran an opportunity to do exactly what made him a legend in the first
    place: compose excellent, commercially-unconcerned country music. But there's
    a discernible difference: Merle Haggard has grown into his surname, and it
    suits him well.</p><p>
    ""Watching while some old friends do a line/ Holding back the want to in my own
    addicted mind"" is the lyric that opens <i>If I Could Only Fly</i>, an album
    strong enough to remind one of Haggard's work in the '60s and '70s. Accompanied
    by an acoustic guitar, snare brushes, occasional electric pickings and a barely
    audible organ, Haggard continues, ""Wishing it was still the thing even I could
    do/ Wishing all these old things were new."" Its subtle power is enough to make
    my 23 year-old body somehow feel old and tired.</p><p>
    As strong as the opening track is, a whole album of it would leave me a
    shriveled heap of flesh and bone. Haggard, of course, realizes this. So he
    quickly jumps into the Hank Williams-inspired ""Honky Tonky Mama,"" which he
    delivers in an odd, but engaging, swallowed voice. After the laid back slide
    guitar of ""Turn to Me,"" the album hits another high point with its title
    track.  Largely just an acoustic guitar, a harmonica and his smooth baritone,
    Haggard sings, ""I feel so good and then I feel so bad/ I wonder what I ought
    to do."" Written here, it reads like the sad, simplistic reflections of an old
    man. Yet, everything about the song is so beautifully understated as to make
    one understand, if not sympathize.</p><p>
    But, again, Haggard moves through various subgenres with impressive ease.
    ""Crazy Moon"" sounds as if it were written from the shores of Hawaii;
    ""Bareback"" is Bob Wills-style country swing; ""Proud to Be Your Old Man"" is
    a blues-inflected ragtime number. And through Haggard's consistently subtle
    approach, the songs flow together with no disruption.</p><p>
    Despite these worthy numbers, the best moments here are when, as on ""Wishin'
    All These Old Things Were New,"" and ""If I Could Only Fly,"" Haggard sticks
    closely to his acoustic guitar and alludes to his past. ""I'm Still Your Daddy,""
    for instance, opens with the nearly spoken lines, ""I knew someday you'd find
    out about San Quentin."" An unsettling harmonica rides through before he
    resumes: ""It's time you knew the truth about your papa/ I've not always been
    the man I am today."" With compelling, confessional honesty, he goes on to
    address his criminal past, his former youthful naiveté, and to admit his
    wrongfulness.</p><p>
    The stripped-down ""Uncle John"" begins with a reference to the death of his
    father. Then, he informs us how his career began: ""Looking back, it all looks
    like a marathon/ And it started with an E chord I learned from Uncle John.""
    The final number, ""Listening to the Wind,"" is just what you might expect: the
    description of a man at the latter end of his life, alternately listening to
    everything around him, and to the concerns in his own mind.</p><p>
    The obvious comparison is to Bob Dylan. Both men, thankfully, still have a
    message, albeit of a nature quite different from their earlier years. Although
    Dylan's <i>Time Out of Mind</i> is certainly a greater triumph, <i>If I Could
    Only Fly</i> shows that perhaps Haggard has more to say, given the upheaval of
    his youth. In either case, that Dylan and Haggard are still making music is a
    blessing to the rest of us. Perhaps, in listening to their reflections on
    aging and the accompanying doubts, we can learn how to face our own mortality
    with greater equanimity and fewer regrets.</p></div>"|3704.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3704-if-i-could-only-fly/|7.6|Ryan Kearney

    Blues 1947-1974</i>. I think this was the first time I realized that certain
    record labels were identified with a specific ""sound."" The hugely influential
    R&amp;B; singles cut during those years by people like Joe Turner, Otis Redding,
    Joe Tex, Wilson Pickett, Aretha Franklin and Ray Charles are rightly
    identified with their performers, but the music definitely shared a
    sensibility. After all, these tracks were recorded in a small handful of
    studios, with many of the same producers, session musicians and songwriters.
    So, though it was nowhere near as mechanized as Motown later became, Atlantic
    R&amp;B; had an aesthetic, and this meant that the heavenly box set was a unified
    listening experience, with each disc flowing like melted butter.</p><p>
    
    The fantastic Ninja Tune retrospective <i>Xen Cuts</i>, celebrating the
    label's 10-year anniversary, has a similar cohesiveness. Though the several
    dozen artists on these three discs come from at least four continents and
    work in different genres, there's always some thread that's still vaguely
    ""Ninja Tune."" It must have something to do with the kinds of records that
    turn label founders Jonathan More and Matt Black on. We can guess that they
    appreciate '60s exotica and Blue Note jazz, and they especially dig the
    hip-hop of the late '80s-- the time when they made their first recorded
    impact by remixing Eric B and Rakim's ""Paid in Full."" Consciously or not,
    they've kept their ears open for artists with a similar quality, even though
    the roster they've accumulated is as rich with variety as it is with talent.</p><p>
    
    Fine DJs that they are, Coldcut know how to select and sequence tracks,
    further upping this collection's listenability factor. Each disc here seems
    to have a loose theme. The first showcases the hip-hop side of Ninja Tune,
    with a good chunk of the 18 tracks featuring Native-Tongue influenced MCs.
    Highlights include Lyrics Born and Lateef of Bay Area rap duo Latyrx turning
    in their best rap ever over a groove by the Herbaliser on ""8pt Agenda."" Kid
    Koala offers ""Emperors Main Course,"" his beautiful, funny and previously
    hard-to-find reworking of Ryuichi Sakamoto and David Byrne's theme from
    <i>The Last Emperor</i>.  And Luke Vibert's funky ""I Hear the Drummer"" is a
    slice of drum programming perfection. Hard as it is to believe, there really
    isn't really a weak cut here.</p><p>
    
    The second disc gives a nice overview of Ninja Tune's various other
    personalities, from the rare groove-inspired funk of Clifford Gilberto
    to the sampling virtuosity of Amon Tobin to the exotic trip-hop of Funky
    Porcini. It's mostly a downtempo affair, never straying too close to the
    kinetic drum-n-bass some of the artists here dabble in. Though they're
    all keepers, special props go to the percussive jazz grooves built by
    Neptune on ""Soul Pride,"" and Up, Bustle &amp; Out on ""Los Locos Cubanos.""</p><p>
    
    The final disc contains rare and unreleased tracks, and it's a testament
    to this collection that, while it's a tad more schizophrenic than the
    other two discs, it's nearly as strong. John McEntire's mix of Coldcut's
    ""More Beats &amp; Pieces"" bubbles with rhythmic ideas. Kid Koala's live
    ""Drunk Trumpet"" (recorded at Chicago's Metro) is a useful indicator of
    the depth of Eric San's talent, as he improvises turntable jazz that's
    actually <i>melodic</i> without the benefit of the studio.  Fourtet
    finds the dark heart at the center of the Cinematic Orchestra's drifting
    ""Channel 1 Suite,"" further distinguishing him as a major remix talent
    (check out his EP with Pole). And DJ Food's ""Peace Pt. 1"" is an all-out
    bongo-heavy party jam. As a label retrospective, <i>Xen Cuts</i> does
    indeed have something of the Buddha nature; instead of thinking back as
    we listen, we are blissfully immersed in The Now.</p></div>"|1947.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1947-xen-cuts/|9.1|Mark Richard-San

    something truly remarkable happened to me-- epiphanic, even. For the first
    time in my life I experienced actual ennui. Can you believe that? Just
    like characters in 19th century novels!  Not just dull, run-of-the-mill
    boredom, or impatient, fidgety disinterest, but <i>enn-fuckin'-ui</i>!
    Yeah!</p><p>
<i>Watering Ghost Garden</i> finds this San Francisco quartet serving up a
    low-sodium, reduced-calorie six-song helping of Blah.  Considering the effusive
    praise and lofty predictions lavished upon 1998's <i>I Become Small and Go</i>,
    you might be inclined to hope this EP is some sort of red herring. You know,
    to, uh, throw the sophomore slump off their scent, and ensure smooth going to
    their forthcoming Dreamworks full-length.</p><p>
    
    Or, perhaps this is just the lackluster batch it appears to be on first
    listen.  But things get off to a good start. ""Centipede Eyes"" is lush, not
    unpleasantly overproduced pop.  Remember Shudder to Think's more conventional
    sounding songs from the <i>First Love, Last Rites</i> soundtrack?  Well, take
    out half the quality and pour it on the ground as a libation to the god of
    unmet expectations. You're left with a perfectly good half-bottle of Creeper
    Lagoon. Drink up.</p><p>
    
    ""Roman Hearts"" is more of the same. Unfortunately, maudlin piano lines and
    synthesized string arrangement pretty much torpedo the song's passably pretty
    melody. Also, something about Ian Sefchick's vocal inflections here hints
    strongly at the onset of delusions of Radiohead. Prognosis: grim.</p><p>
    
    The verse to ""Big Money Struggle,"" a track produced by former Talking Head
    Jerry Harrison, is great. And if that looked like a barbed compliment to you,
    you get a cookie. Or a free copy of the new Creeper Lagoon EP. The verse is
    to the overall song what the face is to the girl about whom people say, ""Well,
    she has a pretty face."" The chorus, accordingly, is the big, ungainly ass and
    hunched, pimply back that makes a pretty verse more a badge of shame than a
    redeeming element. Or perhaps they <i>meant</i> for it to sound like an NBC
    sitcom theme song resulting from a Wallflowers Crap Music Summit.</p><p>
    
    ""Chain Smoker"" sports an electronic drum kit, more misplaced sounding piano
    tinkling, and best of all, sitar.  ""My Friends Adore You,"" meanwhile, is
    gorgeous. The Creepers keep things simple, adding decorative flourishes like
    a chorus of falsetto voices, and subliminal keyboard parts, where appropriate.
    But, inexplicably, around the fourth minute-- like that fuck-up friend
    everybody has who can't handle good fortune-- they throw in a ""heavy rock""
    section with a jarring 3/4-to-4/4 tempo change, and a turgid, stinking guitar
    solo.</p><p>
    
    Then, <i>Watering Ghost Garden</i> draws to a close with ""God Will Understand,""
    a track that seems like more of a moody outro than a proper song. Owing to its
    brevity, there's not enough time for the guys to actually ruin it, and
    consequently, it's the EP's most successful minute.</p><p>
    
    You know the rap on these guys. <i>Spin</i> readers' designated ""Best New
    Artist of 1998,"" lauded by the <i>New York Times</i>, featured on a big time
    movie soundtrack (well, okay not quite-- <i>Dead Man on Campus</i>). Though
    <i>Watering Ghost Garden</i> is an awkward, ankle-busting step off the curb
    for these four, Creeper Lagoon may just redeem themselves with their next
    album.  In the meantime, this EP proves again that, apart from promoting music

    and had lived for years in my garage, despite the fact that I hadn't fed it.
    From that point on, the dream is just a blur of abstract terror, and I'm still
    overwhelmed by thoughts of how that thing might have survived, and what
    horrible form it might have taken on.  The experience of listening to
    Therapy?'s career retrospective is not unlike that dream.</p><p>
    It feels like the return of my perfect teenhood, which was spent as a
    long-haired, greasy, flannel-and-torn-jeans-wearing (though admittedly dorky)
    rocker.  My musical consciousness had begun with Nirvana, the Smashing Pumpkins,
    and their grungy ilk, and hard rock was my bread and butter.  As the years
    passed, though, I found myself distanced from anything that could have been
    classed as ""metal,"" due to the increasing backward-cap-and-wifebeater aesthetic
    which didn't mesh with my delicate sensibilities.  Plus, it sucked trying to
    convince people that <i>Paranoid</i> was a work of art far more sophisticated
    than it's generally given credit for.</p><p>
    To be honest, Therapy? missed me the first time around.  And I probably
    wouldn't have given these guys much credence if I'd heard them then, as I
    generally liked my metal bands at least as arty as Soundgarden.  These guys
    haven't got a trace of art in them.  What they do have is at least as much
    rock and roll spirit as the MC5.  And an endless supply of undeniably catchy
    riffs and hooks, all delivered with the same ham-fisted bludgeoning delivery.</p><p>
    The tracks are remarkably consistent, if arranged seemingly at random. But
    that hardly matters; the band's oldest tracks are at least as good as the two
    obligatory new ones.  ""Bad Karma Follows You Around,"" one of the latter, is
    such a spirited number it's hard not get swept up in the sheer ""rock power"" of
    it all.  On the other hand, <i>So Much for the Ten Year Plan</i> is an
    embarrassing reminder of the worst cliches of pre-Bizkit '90s hard rock,
    give or take an Alice in Chains record.</p><p>
    Like Nirvana, Therapy? were equally influenced by the Ramones and Black
    Sabbath, so those elements coincide easily within their songs.  There's no
    evidence of ""growth"" or ""progression"" over the course of their careers, aside
    from the inevitable quieter tracks that came in recent years.  But even these
    are as tuneful and as their loud/fast counterparts, with the exception of an
    ill-advised cover of Hüsker Dü's ""Diane,"" where the band attempts the tired
    ""string arrangement = maturity"" equation with roughly the same success as a
    Poison power ballad.</p><p>
    Lyrically, these guys are all brooding and intense, and they've got the
    goatees to prove it.  The teen angst is here in spades; they speak to the
    rock geek within with lines like ""Your beauty makes me feel alone"" in
    ""Screamager.""  Who can't identify with that, man?  And who wouldn't cringe
    when it's followed by ""Screw that/ Forget about that/ I don't want to think
    about anything like that?""  They do lighten it up on ""Potato Junkie"" with the
    anthemic line ""James Joyce is fucking my sister,"" putting themselves right in
    line with their native Ireland's rich literary heritage.</p><p>
    I can't stop myself from feeling that this music is somehow ""bad,"" and I have
    a palpable sense of guilt as I listen to it.  Still, there's an undeniable
    appeal.  Therapy? seem almost unabashedly retro and geeky compared to the
    current spate of rap-metal bands currently flashing across the MTV eye.
    What's most difficult to quantify, though, is that it's completely enjoyable,
    while simultaneously impossible to take seriously.  File 'em under ""guilty
    pleasure.""  And tell no one.</p></div>"|7988.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7988-so-much-for-the-ten-year-plan-a-retrospective-1990-2000/|6.5|D. Erik Kempke

Structured ostensibly as a tribute to the
    group's ""European roots,"" Blonde Redhead could be forgiven for trumping the
    ""global village"" exotica card.  The concept is not sound enough, however,
    nor is it executed as smoothly as one might have hoped.</p><p>
    
    The EP consists of five songs, the first two of which are versions of songs
    off their <i>Melody of Certain Damaged Lemons</i> album (""In Particular"" and
    ""Hated Because of Great Qualities"") sung in French and Italian.  These
    opening tracks form the crux of <i>Melodie Citronique</i>'s misgiving.
    They're nothing special; the songs themselves are, note for note, exactly
    like their previous versions, suggesting that Kazu Makino, who sings on
    both, simply dubbed foreign language vocals over the backing tracks.  While
    that's an underwhelming prospect to say the least, the awkward vocalizations
    add no new dimensions to the songs.  The questionable premise is undercut by
    the fact that the Japanese Kazu has no ""European roots"" to speak of, and a
    certain laziness is apparent in neglecting to translate the chorus of ""In
    Particular,"" which remains exactly as it was on the album.</p><p>
    
    The one new original track, ""Chi E E Non E,"" is an entirely different matter.
    The first song written by the group in Italian, it's a delicate acoustic
    track sung beautifully by guitarist Amedeo Pace that brings to mind the
    more subdued moments of Os Mutantes.  Why the song is tucked away and not
    given prominence in the EP's tracklisting is a mystery.  Following it is
    a well-executed Serge Gainsbourg cover, ""Slogan,"" sung in French by Kazu.</p><p>
<i>Melodie Citronique</i> closes with ""Four Damaged Lemons,"" a remix of
    <i>Melody</i>'s ""For the Damaged"" by Third Eye Foundation's Matt Elliot.
    The remixing apparently had to do mostly with texture and atmosphere, as
    Elliot opts not to tinker with the actual song, preferring instead to
    drape a translucent sparseness upon an otherwise unchanged track.  Pleasant
    enough, it's not the dramatic reworking necessary to round off this
    lukewarm collection.  Simply put, the first two tracks are completely
    dispensable, the remaining three only lightly.</p></div>"|805.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/805-melodie-citronique-ep/|5.0|S. Murray

    is largely comprised of a black-and-white photograph of a room with a wood stove,
    a modest lamp and a bed with a wrinkled blanket draped over it. The cover of their
    sophomore release, <i>Life in a Bubble Can Be Beautiful</i> is even more sparse.
    It's a photograph of a cloth, perhaps cotton or wool, with ""Red Stars Theory""
    stitched in white along the border of the two competing colors of the cloth:
    brown and dark red. So what the hell is with the bright-blue-and-pink lamb, 
    knotted scarf and all, hopping on the mint-green cover of their new EP?</p><p>
    Album covers can serve many purposes, of course, but artists usually create 
    covers that they feel are visual encapsulations of their album's theme. Those 
    artists who aren't striving for thematic unity-- which is often because they
    haven't got any-- simply want cover art that fits their sound and image.  Covers,
    therefore, also act as signifiers, which often double as warnings-- that, for
    instance, their sound and ideology have changed. But this is just an EP, so
    what does one make of its odd, surprising cover?</p><p>
    Well, don't worry.  This five-piece outfit-- which features 764-HERO bassist
    James Bertram and Modest Mouse drummer Jeremiah Green-- haven't gone Elephant 
    Six or anything.  The first track of this four-song, 30-minute EP, ""And Often
    Off Again,"" is the original version of ""An Alarm Goes Off,"" the closing track
    from <i>Life in a Bubble</i> that was ""constructed"" for that album by Sientific
    American. Not surprisingly, this version is shorter (although still over six
    minutes long) and more rock-oriented. The guitar frolics comfortably in the foyer
    while the edgy violin and swirling atmospherics remain in other rooms on other
    floors.  Although the subtle digital manipulations are missed, the song builds
    a palpable and rewarding momentum absent from its sliced-up offspring.</p><p>
    The following track, ""Our Nearest Neighbors,"" was recorded during the <i>Life in
    a Bubble</i> sessions, but left off the album. God knows why. Had it been included,
    it would have made for one of that record's strongest numbers-- which speaks
    volumes when considering that <i>Life in a Bubble</i> was easily the most
    underrated post-rock record of 1999. After two minutes of a guitar walking in
    circles and classical arrangements of cello and violin encouraging, Bertram sings,
    ""We're almost home/ A few more blocks."" It's all so comfortable until he continues,
    ""When we get back/ There's gonna be a lot of fighting and curse words.""  And at this
    point, the song's torso is ripped open, guitar strings stretching and snapping like
    weak tendons. The track best exhibits Red Stars Theory's unique strengths: to harness
    the emotion of emocore without indulging in the maudlin lyrics; and to exercise the
    artistic grandeur and complexity of post-rock, but without the cold detachment and
    pretension.</p><p>
    The EP's third track is a remix by Sientific American of <i>Life in a Bubble</i>'s
    ""Parts Per Million.""  Eerie, atonal whirs (à la Boards of Canada) open the number,
    soon accompanied by pockets of static and a crisp guitar. This song's original
    version only becomes recognizable when, two minutes in, the familiar stringed
    notes rise out of the murky digital cutting board. The violin and cello are soon
    distorted and eventually suffocated by guitar interjections, hollow drums and
    exponential bleeps that inevitably define the song as an electronic, but organic,
    auditory trip.</p><p>
    The final number, ""Boring Ghosts,"" is another remix by Sientific American from
    a song off the previous album.  That song, unfortunately, was <i>Life in a
    Bubble</i>'s only truly weak point (let's just say it was aptly-titled). While
    this remix is similarly aimless, a wavering hum and other indecipherable sounds
    lend the song more depth. So, instead of a short, boring song, we're offered an
    eight-minute, Eno-esque ambient jaunt that's perfect to listen to while, say,
    sitting against the stone wall of the main terminal at Grand Central at 6:00pm
    on a Friday.</p><p>
    So how, then, does the record's cover make sense? The fuzzy, carefree lamb
    reflects the somnolence of Red Stars Theory's dreamlike movements through space,
    as exemplified by the first two tracks. But, while soft and inviting, the colors 
    are nonetheless off: lambs aren't pink and blue. The comforting image of the lamb 
    has been visually manipulated, but remains equally comforting, albeit in a more
    surreal way. The same could be said for the remixes that make up the latter half
    of this EP: the pleasant music has been cut-and-pasted, but it hasn't lost its
    pleasantness.</p><p>
    Or maybe they just thought it would be funny to put a lamb on the cover.</p></div>"|6727.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6727-ep/|7.8|Ryan Kearney

    collective since last year's singles compilation, <i>Cul de Sacs and Dead
    Ends</i>.  Or perhaps E6 has distanced themselves from the Minders: no logos
    on the package, no Robert Schneider production.  So, perhaps thankfully, out
    go my extended comparisons of prominent Elephant 6'ers to their counterparts
    in '60s pop music.</p><p>
    
    On <i>Cul de Sacs</i>, Martyn Leaper repeatedly demonstrated his sharp
    instincts for pop songwriting and tight, efficient arrangements.  Each song
    did exactly what it needed to do in two or three minutes.  Somehow, though,
    this five-song EP fails to gel or show any consistency, despite its brevity.
    It shows the band making a few tentative steps outside the limitations of
    their sound, but losing some of their appeal in the process.</p><p>
    
    The group takes over full production chores here, and the tape hiss still
    present on their last album has since departed.  The first track, ""Young and
    With It"" bears the largest similarity to their previous outings, with its
    economical guitar work, brisk drums, and chiming keyboards.  Sure, it's
    pleasing, but far from remarkable, and it definitely wouldn't have stood out
    on their last LP.  The next track, ""On and On,"" is better, driven by a
    pulsating bassline; harmonizing flutes, and dueling harpsichords enter the
    mix as the song progresses.</p><p>
    
    The problem with <i>Down in Fall</i> as whole becomes apparent with the
    following song, ""Time Machines,"" an ominous piano-driven track accompanied by
    an old time-management seminar tape.  It's interesting, but only serves to
    derail the continuity.  A track like this could work in the context of an LP,
    but here, it's merely distracting.</p><p>
    
    Based on the music, <i>Down in Fall</i> certainly counts as a minor entry
    into their discography, but, rather frustratingly, it's the CD-ROM footage in
    the enhanced portion that raises the rating a few notches and keeps my
    interest in the band's future work piqued.  Leaper shows off his expanding
    array of home recording gear, and the patient can listen to him endlessly hem
    and haw over the pros and cons of home recording.  But the footage of the band
    doing a take on the new songs ""Golden Street"" and ""Light in the Morning""
    instantly outshine the tracks on the audio portion.  The hooks are here in
    full force, and the band is far more successful in venturing beyond its peppy
    pop background.</p><p>
    
    During the interview portion, Martyn Leaper states, ""All of this has already
    paid for itself,"" indicating his first reel-to-reel machine in the corner.
    So perhaps this is just a way of generating the funds to finish their next
    album.  If so, I suggest you make a contribution through purchasing their
    earlier records.</p></div>"|5296.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5296-down-in-fall-ep/|6.6|D. Erik Kempke

    Studio !K7's uptown DJ Kicks mix series. And following the path of greatest
    predictability, Evelyn sequences music you'd imagine he'd compile.  This
    should not have been the case for several reasons.  <i>A Word of Science</i>,
    Nightmares on Wax's debut as a trio, reveled in a warped aesthetic that
    peaked with the hallucinatory ""Aftermath,"" a track so twisted and evilly
    looped that Second Summer of Love casualties are known to wander throughout
    Greater London muttering the thought-crimping vocal refrain.</p><p>
    
    With Evelyn abandoned by his crew, he turned his musical attention from
    funk-avant-garde, to just honest-as-the-Earth hip-hop. No more messin', Evelyn
    wanted to slam some real street shit on us. And well qualified he seemed to do
    this. ""Night's Interlude"" had become one of the Ur-texts for James Lavelle's
    Mo'wax roster, eliminating the necessity for anyone to get up and strut their
    bad selves. Nope. Just bob yer 'ead, mate and that'll show your appreciation.</p><p>
    
    But the signifiers got more than a little muddled. Unlike Sotheby's auctioneers
    trained to notice and respond to the merest suggestion of a flick of a bidder's
    wrist, one couldn't distinguish between a too-cool-for-this-shit Mo'wax devotee
    or the involuntary head-lolling of some zee-onked bong-boy.</p><p>
    
    The unhappy result of this indistinguishability was the sloppy deluge of
    trip-hop, amid which subsequent Nightmares on Wax albums <i>Smoker's Delight</i>
    (prosecution rests!) and <i>Carboot Soul</i> barely floated.  With the
    opportunity to assemble a mix disc for Studio !K7, I'd hope that Thomas would
    put down the pipe and give us something noteworthy.</p><p>
    
    I'd like to imagine that a mix disc from a respected label such as Studio !K7
    would seek to be part of the great tape-compilation tradition.  Obsessive
    pause-button compilers across the world, sweaty-palmed with the excitement of
    introducing friends, family and the mail-room guys to music outside of their
    usual zone, challenge themselves to juxtapose pleasant oddities.  An Otis
    Redding soulwrencher against a Sandy Denny lament, perhaps, for a natural and
    expected collision.  I remember the compilation tape my hippie friend Mike
    made for me that introduced me to the Third Bardo, the Third Ear Band, and
    Love. If I ever lost that tape, I'd be devastated.</p><p>
    
    So, commercially available compilation CDs should ideally be replaceable
    irreplaceables.  Studio !K7 have provided us with at least one such disc.
    Nicolette's installment swerved effortlessly and logically between <i>Shut
    Up and Dance</i> urban hardcore and deep ambient to IDM stalwarts Plaid. The
    never-disappointing Nuphonic label has become the motherlode of such desirable
    compilations. Not only have they released the two David Mancuso <i>Loft</i>
    sets, but also Norman and Joey Jay's Notting-Hill-Carnival-in-your-living-room
    <i>Good Times</i>.</p><p>
    
    It irks me to report that you'll have just okay times with Nightmares on Wax's
    compilation. It's not that any of the tracks are cornball or turgid. The artists
    and the labels represented have all licensed high quality drops of wax. From
    ""Ay, Ay, Stutter,"" Saukrates' unintentional tribute to UK comedy rappers
    Morris Minor and the Majors, to the nu-oldskool breaks of Grand Unified's
    ""Shake Up""; from the Stax horn section-adoring ""Ease Jimi"" by Nightmares on
    Wax to the jazz-disco of Syrup's ""Chocolate,"" Evelyn plays one good record
    after another.  Though he thankfully didn't attempt to turntable some
    cross-fader action, or to perform the crab-walk, the scoozy, the
    backspin-shuffle, or even a salvo of triplicate zickity-zags, Evelyn could
    have done something a bit special than wait until one record was fading out
    before pressing the start button on another. This just lends a blandness to
    a disc that could have been an ear-opening, run-down, dumpster-strewn alleyway
    of musical unexpectations.</p><p>
    
    Free of anything out-of-the-ordinary, the Nightmares on Wax's contribution to
    the DJ Kicks series will find favor with those who love their music barely
    audible, and with those who cherish their music collections more as
    qualifications for admittance into the scenester clique.  Or, of course, with
    those who spend time prospecting for a missing eighth (last seen underneath a
    sofa cushion... or was it in the freezer cabinet?) than considering the quality
    of the contents of their disc-changer.</p></div>"|5793.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5793-dj-kicks/|5.5|Paul Cooper

    because he is a ""slave to the rhythm.""  While this statement went largely unnoticed--
    probably due to the fact that Jackson's public image at the time was more closely
    related to his choice of ""friends""-- those four little words came to me at the perfect
    time. As I was rapidly becoming more obsessed with music, my physical reactions to
    music were amplified as well, and before long, anything with even a twinge of rhythm
    had me dancing around like a caffeinated flea.  Needless to say, this didn't do much
    for my social life-- I became something of a circus freak, ""that weird guy with
    headphones."" To make matters worse, I had yet to come up with an acceptable wise-ass
    response to the question, ""What the fuck is your problem?""  Thankfully, the King of
    Pop came through for me.</p><p>
    
    Yes, ""I am a slave to the rhythm"" certainly did its job, eliciting knowing chuckles
    from those well-versed in pop culture, and quizzical stares from everyone else. I
    thought I had the whole thing worked out. Until Don Caballero entered my life.</p><p>
    
    Despite the relative spaz factor of my movements, there had always been a pretty
    constant rhythm behind the music I listened to, assuring that no matter how goofy and
    awkward I looked, there was always at least a discernable rhythm to my soulless
    twitching. But when Don Caballero's <i>What Burns Never Returns</i> found its way into
    my collection last year, any shred of dignity that might have remained quickly
    disintegrated. Layer upon layer of paroxysmal rock guitar, coupled with Damon Che's
    insanely inventive drumming, left my nervous system in tatters and my body seizing
    in suitably bizarre patterns. Suddenly, being a slave to the rhythm just wasn't enough.
    I had become a slave to Don Caballero.</p><p>
    
    And what a blissful servitude it was.  The band combined the driving, distorted
    guitars of heavy metal with the intricate arrangements and percussive elements of
    post-rock. It was a match made in heaven, and I was more than happy to forego my
    social standing to experience the immeasurable thrill of this band.</p><p>
    
    Even when I learned of the imminent release of <i>American Don</i>, I was still hooked
    on <i>What Burns Never Returns</i>, as well as Don Cab's earlier records. Though <i>For
    Respect</i> and <i>II</i> are considered by most to be their masterworks, I found the more
    fractured and complex rhythms of <i>What Burns Never Returns</i> more appealing. Thus,
    I hoped that <i>American Don</i> would take the band's signature formula one step
    farther, rocking harder and tossing in even more curveballs.  But while <i>American
    Don</i> does show the band attempting to take several steps forward, they too often
    wind up tripping over their own feet.</p><p>
    
    The most noticeable difference between <i>American Don</i> and previous Don Cab records
    is the relative lack of distortion. While previous efforts balanced gritty, abrasive
    chords with intricately plucked clean guitar parts, <i>American Don</i> places the
    emphasis almost entirely on the latter. As a result, the album lacks the driving rhythmic
    and melodic force of their previous outings.</p><p>
    
    Another disappointment is the lack of surprise on <i>American Don</i>. Talking about
    individual tracks seems futile since they all seem to follow a very similar formula:
    clean, layered guitars, thumping bass, and thankfully, Damon Che's always-refreshing
    drumming. Still, time changes come far less frequently and are much less fluid than on
    past albums.  And adding to the less exciting nature of <i>American Don</i> is the
    saddening fact that the more adventurous studio techniques hinted at on <i>What Burns
    Never Returns</i> still haven't been fully fleshed out.</p><p>
    
    But even with all its weaknesses, <i>American Don</i> still has the one distinct advantage
    of being a Don Caballero record.  Of the countless bands trying their hands at instrumental
    post-rock, Don Cab may be the best at giving the rock equal billing with the ""post. So even
    if it isn't suited for moonwalking, crotch-grabbing, or settling out of court for an

    through comets' paths, and travel, and to my memory I had never witnessed
    burning debris scratch across the night sky. Radiohead were hunched over
    their instruments. Thom Yorke slowly beat on a grand piano, singing, eyes
    closed, into his microphone like he was trying to kiss around a big nose.
    Colin Greenwood tapped patiently on a double bass, waiting for his cue.
    White pearls of arena light swam over their faces. A lazy disco light
    spilled artificial constellations inside the aluminum cove of the makeshift
    stage.  The metal skeleton of the stage ate one end of Florence's Piazza
    Santa Croce, on the steps of the Santa Croce Cathedral. Michelangelo's bones
    and cobblestone laid beneath. I stared entranced, soaking in Radiohead's new 
    material, chiseling each sound into the best functioning parts of my brain
    which would be the only sound system for the material for months.</p><p>
    
    The butterscotch lamps along the walls of the tight city square bled upward
    into the cobalt sky, which seemed as strikingly artificial and perfect as a
    wizard's cap. The staccato piano chords ascended repeatedly. ""Black eyed
    angels swam at me,"" Yorke sang like his dying words. ""There was nothing to
    fear, nothing to hide."" The trained critical part of me marked the similarity
    to Coltrane's ""Ole."" The human part of me wept in awe.</p><p>
    
    The Italians surrounding me held their breath in communion (save for the
    drunken few shouting ""Criep!"").  Suddenly, a rise of whistles and orgasmic
    cries swept unfittingly through the crowd. The song, ""Egyptian Song,"" was 
    certainly momentous, but wasn't the response more apt for, well, ""Creep?""
    I looked up. I thought it was fireworks.  A teardrop of fire shot from space
    and disappeared behind the church where the syrupy River Arno crawled.
    Radiohead had the heavens on their side.</p><p>
    
    For further testament, Chip Chanko and I both suffered auto-debilitating
    accidents in the same week, in different parts of the country, while
    blasting ""Airbag"" in our respective Japanese imports.  For months, I feared
    playing the song about car crashes in my car, just as I'd feared passing 18-
    wheelers after nearly being crushed by one in 1990.  With good reason, I
    suspect Radiohead to possess incomprehensible powers.  The evidence is only
    compounded with <i>Kid A</i>-- the rubber match in the band's legacy-- an 
    album which completely obliterates how albums, and Radiohead themselves,
    will be considered.</p><p>
    
    Even the heralded <i>OK Computer</i> has been nudged down one spot in Valhalla.
    <i>Kid A</i> makes rock and roll childish. Considerations on its merits as
    ""rock"" (i.e. its radio fodder potential, its guitar riffs, and its hooks) are
    pointless.  Comparing this to other albums is like comparing an aquarium to 
    blue construction paper. And not because it's jazz or fusion or ambient or 
    electronic. Classifications don't come to mind once deep inside this expansive,
    hypnotic world.  Ransom, the philologist hero of C.S. Lewis' <i>Out of the Silent
    Planet</i> who is kidnapped and taken to another planet, initially finds his
    scholarship useless in his new surroundings, and just tries to survive the
    beautiful new world.</p><p>
    
    This is an emotional, psychological experience.  <i>Kid A</i> sounds like a
    clouded brain trying to recall an alien abduction. It's the sound of a band, and
    its leader, losing faith in themselves, destroying themselves, and subsequently
    rebuilding a perfect entity. In other words, Radiohead hated being Radiohead,
    but ended up with the most ideal, natural Radiohead record yet.</p><p>
    
    ""Everything in Its Right Place"" opens like <i>Close Encounters</i> spaceships
    communicating with pipe organs.  As your ears decide whether the tones are
    coming or going, Thom Yorke's Cuisinarted voice struggles for its tongue.
    ""Everything,"" Yorke belts in uplifting sighs.  The first-person mantra of 
    ""There are two colors in my head"" is repeated until the line between Yorke's
    mind and the listener's mind is erased.</p><p>
    
    Skittering toy boxes open the album's title song, which, like the track ""Idioteque,""
    shows a heavy Warp Records influence.  The vocoder lullaby lulls you deceivingly
    before the riotous ""National Anthem.""  Mean, fuzzy bass shapes the spine as unnerving
    theremin choirs limn.  Brash brass bursts from above like Terry Gilliam's animated
    foot.  The horns swarm as Yorke screams, begs, ""Turn it off!"" It's the album's shrill
    peak, but just one of the incessant goosebumps raisers.</p><p>
    
    After the rockets exhaust, Radiohead float in their lone orbit. ""How to Disappear
    Completely"" boils down ""Let Down"" and ""Karma Police"" to their spectral essence.
    The string-laden ballad comes closest to bridging Yorke's lyrical sentiment to the
    instrumental effect. ""I float down the Liffey/ I'm not here/ This isn't happening,""
    he sings in his trademark falsetto.  The strings melt and weep as the album shifts
    into its underwater mode. ""Treefingers,"" an ambient soundscape similar in sound and
    intent to Side B of Bowie and Eno's <i>Low</i>, calms after the record's emotionally
    strenuous first half.</p><p>
    
    The primal, brooding guitar attack of ""Optimistic"" stomps like mating Tyrannosaurs.
    The lyrics seemingly taunt, ""Try the best you can/ Try the best you can,"" before
    revealing the more resigned sentiment, ""The best you can is good enough."" For an
    album reportedly ""lacking"" in traditional Radiohead moments, this is the best
    summation of their former strengths. The track erodes into a light jam before
    morphing into ""In Limbo."" ""I'm lost at sea,"" Yorke cries over clean, uneasy arpeggios.
    The ending flares with tractor beams as Yorke is vacuumed into nothingness. The
    aforementioned ""Idioteque"" clicks and thuds like Aphex Twin and Bjork's
    <i>Homogenic</i>, revealing brilliant new frontiers for the ""band.""  For all the
    noise to this point, it's uncertain entirely who or what has created the music.
    There are rarely traditional arrangements in the ambiguous origin. This is part of
    the unique thrill of experiencing <i>Kid A</i>.</p><p>
    
    Pulsing organs and a stuttering snare delicately propel ""Morning Bell."" Yorke's
    breath can be heard frosting over the rainy, gray jam.  Words accumulate and stick
    in his mouth like eye crust. ""Walking walking walking walking,"" he mumbles while
    Jonny Greenwood squirts whale-chant feedback from his guitar.  The closing ""Motion
    Picture Soundtrack"" brings to mind <i>The White Album</i>, as it somehow combines
    the sentiment of Lennon's LP1 closer-- the ode to his dead mother, ""Julia""-- with
    Ringo and Paul's maudlin, yet sincere LP2 finale, ""Goodnight."" Pump organ and harp
    flutter as Yorke condones with affection, ""I think you're crazy."" To further
    emphasize your feeling at that moment and the album's overall theme, Yorke bows
    out with ""I will see you in the next life."" If you're not already there with him.</p><p>
    
    The experience and emotions tied to listening to <i>Kid A</i> are like witnessing
    the stillborn birth of a child while simultaneously having the opportunity to see
    her play in the afterlife on Imax. It's an album of sparking paradox. It's cacophonous 
    yet tranquil, experimental yet familiar, foreign yet womb-like, spacious yet visceral,
    textured yet vaporous, awakening yet dreamlike, infinite yet 48 minutes.  It will
    cleanse your brain of those little crustaceans of worries and inferior albums clinging
    inside the fold of your gray matter. The harrowing sounds hit from unseen angles and
    emanate with inhuman genesis. When the headphones peel off, and it occurs that six
    men (Nigel Godrich included) created this, it's clear that Radiohead must be the
    greatest band alive, if not the best since you know who.  Breathing people made this
    record!  And you can't wait to dive back in and try to prove that wrong over and over.</p></div>"|6656.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6656-kid-a/|10.0|Brent DiCrescenzo

Not that I
    stumbled over basic operations, but I didn't have a clue about anything that
    required working beneath the manageable facade of the system software. Then,
    while thumbing through the <i>New York Times' Book Review</i>, I saw a piece
    about <i>Inventing Software for Dummies</i> in which Harold Bloom insisted
    the book would ""make Gateses-- nay, Einsteins of us all."" How could I resist?
    So, I bought it, read it, and was thereafter a brilliant man. But as I also
    remained a music critic, I insisted upon first inventing something that
    would take music to a new level.</p><p>
    
    Here's what I came up with: a program that creates images inspired by music.
    With an instantly accessible Internet database of trillions of images and
    videos, the program could be used by anyone, anywhere. What's more, you could
    play the same album as many times as you please, and the visuals would never
    be the same. Legitimate art on your very own desktop!  And, if you think about
    it, I was the creator of all of it. I would be the most viewed artist of all
    time.</p><p>
    
    When I finished the program a few months ago I wanted to test it with
    something really out there, to witness its full potential. So, I put in
    Captain Beefheart's <i>Trout Mask Replica</i>. Do I need to tell you what
    happened? The screen displayed a bubbling, vomitous mess of every color
    imaginable, each one appearing beside the least compatible color (brown
    against pink, and so on). It was the most beautiful rotten mess I'd ever
    seen. Then, the program crashed. After recently fixing it, I was still
    hesitant to run it, so I chose an album I thought wouldn't require as much
    range: Black Heart Procession's <i>Three</i>.</p><p>
    
    The opening track confirmed my suspicions. Responding to the simple, ominous
    beat that begins ""We Always Knew,"" my computer screen flashed consecutive
    images of a lone soldier's stiff legs as he marched down a narrow stone
    corridor. The stroboscopic effect warped time, further slowing the soldier's
    progress. Once an equally deliberate bassline entered, the images turned into
    a fluid video, the camera panning back while other sounds unfolded-- drums,
    metallic scrapings, classical organ chords, falling piano bars, blasts of
    mechanized fuzz, and parabolic guitar pickings.</p><p>
    
    Just as the soldier's face was about to be exposed, Pall Jenkins' low voice
    began singing, ""You want to know/ Where the truth is found/ We try to breathe/
    But life was never found in you."" The camera stopped broadening its scope
    until the vocals rose in pitch, peaking with ""Did you come back from the
    fires?/ Did you come back from your quest?/ Was it all to see the blood was
    on our hands and say I guess I knew.""  At that point, the screen burst into
    a blinding, radiant whiteness that dissolved into black-and-white catscans of
    fidgety brains, melting as seen through tears.</p><p>
    
    For the next song, ""Guess I'll Forget You,"" the program stuck with the idea
    of human organs. This time it focused on the heart, starting with pictures of
    oversized ones, descending to that of a premature baby, and ascending back
    again.  It repeated this process with such rapidity as to mimic a beating
    heart, but a horribly grotesque one. Black swaths drifted across the screen,
    and occasionally, when a trumpet sounded, the program showed a bull goring a
    Spaniard. A bit overt, but wrenching nonetheless.</p><p>
    
    My computer fell asleep during ""Once Said at the Fire,"" but quickly awoke
    to ""Waterfront (The Sinking Road),"" with its frightening whirs, guitar
    strokes like sonic axes, heavy drums, and vengeful piano. A silhouetted
    figure on the screen maneuvered large, slippery rocks. Heavy rain obscured
    detail-- even the time of day-- and eventually concealed the man. When the
    clouds receded, only footprints in the mud remained.</p><p>
    
    The entirety of ""Till We Have to Say Goodbye"" was accompanied simply by a
    very accurate sketch of Leonard Cohen that I could have sworn I'd seen
    earlier, perhaps buried beneath the ruins. Over the next three songs, the
    program returned to the visual themes of ""Guess I'll Forget You,"" yet with
    enough variation to keep the experience fresh, as all heartbreakings are.
    And with ""The War is Over,"" the program offered a continuous video of a
    sweeping bird's eye view of ravaged hillsides.</p><p>
    
    For the seven-minute closer, ""On Ships of Gold""-- a thematic reprise of the
    opening track-- the screen returned to the lone soldier, marching to the
    familiar beat. As the song slowly built up, the camera pulled back and rotated
    to show the back of the man as he walked toward a legion of ships. His pace
    picked up, and he began running until he neared the shore, at which point it
    became clear that all the boats were sinking.</p></div>"|762.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/762-three/|7.8|Ryan Kearney

    (mascot: the Fightin' Beatles) the headmasters award graduates tattered
    wool ski caps, uneven facial stubble, torn t-shirts and wristbands before
    nudging them into the real world.  The degree doesn't get them very far,
    though, so the alumni typically find positions as dishwashers or heroin
    junkies.  The pay is shit, but it's all songwriting fuel.</p><p>
    
    The whimpering Elliott Smith exploded as the school's first success.  With
    that grizzled face and old hat, Elliott quickly wore himself thin, sounding
    dangerously close to Aimee Mann, a recent graduate of Smith's rival public
    school, Solo Careers for Failed Leadsingers State.  Smith's dried leaves
    became plastic houseplants as his once delicate acoustic numbers bloated
    into George Harrison knock-offs with the maudlin emotional subtlety of a
    Bone Thugs 'N' Harmony video.  Meanwhile, gifted foreign exchange student
    Badly Drawn Boy's Damon Gough was bored doodling in ISEFMS classes and
    huffing whiteout in his shed with R.E.M's ""Hairshirt"" blaring on repeat.
    Now, as Elliott Smith slips dangerously close to Bryan Adams' ""(I Wanna Be)
    Your Underwear"" territory, Gough hits the real world with his debut
    full-length, <i>The Hour of Bewilderbeast</i>.</p><p>
    
    The loose, scatterbrain album operates much like the early solo endeavors
    of Paul McCartney, with 80% developed gems flowing effortlessly from the
    damp, rustic English countryside.  Yet, (fortunately?) Gough still seeks
    his Linda.  ""It's killing me/ I'm dying,"" he sighs over Sunday morning
    horns, cleverly pausing before finishing: ""To put a little sunshine in
    your life.""  In less modest mouths and over colder sounds, the song could
    only fail.  Here, it fires up the enzymes before the shimmering guitar of
    ""Everybody Stalking"" suddenly echoes with verve.  Just as quickly, the
    number dissolves into the multitracked organs of ""Bewilder.""</p><p>
    
    Inconceivably, the British press heralded Badly Drawn Boy as the next Beck
    and Beta Band, due mostly to his lazy, absurd live performances.  Clever
    rouse, for Gough pulled his act together brilliantly at Glastonbury 2000,
    securing the coveted Mercury Prize in the same critics' hearts moments
    before <i>The Hour of Bewilderbeast</i> even hit streets.  After the hype,
    the result sounds baffling; there's not a pinch of irony to be found in the
    shifting, meticulous mix.</p><p>
    
    ""Stone on the Water"" pummels Belle &amp; Sebastian in the race to approximate
    Nick Drake's brilliance with jazz drum brushings and spider-fingered acoustic
    fluttering.  But, not content to merely skip stones on a Scottish pond, Gough
    stomps harder on ""Once Around the Block,"" which similarly surpasses Elliott
    Smith in the crown for reaching George Harrison's ""My Sweet Lord.""</p><p>
    
    Piano, strings, harps, and Wurlitzer attach insect wings to the lovely
    songs.  They'll swarm and pester your head for days.  With this concise tour
    through the gentler side of British songwriting history-- from understated
    psychedelia to sylvan protest folk-- Badly Drawn Boy proves what shallow saps
    American liberal arts majors can be behind a guitar.  At 18 songs, just over
    an hour, <i>Bewilderbeast</i> initially overwhelms, but the fictitious
    creature seems like the perfect mascot for England's new school.</p></div>"|526.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/526-the-hour-of-bewilderbeast/|8.6|Brent DiCrescenzo

James Taylor
    and David Brown have long garnered 'nuff respec' from tech-house trainspotters,
    but not for introducing the world to the analog ""cuzzah-cuzzah chzam"" sound or
    updating the Belgian Hoover preset. No, Swayzak, rather like Orbital, have
    striven to express their deeply chunky selves within strict limits by sticking
    to their unique sound palettes.</p><p>
    
    Swayzak's debut album, <i>Snowboarding in Argentina</i>, abounded in polished
    tubes of dubbed delights and attracted envious attention from Plastikman Richie
    Hawtin's M_Nus label. M_nus' Dale Lawrence, under his Theorem guise, then initiated
    a sample-trading dialog which has resulted in some swoonsome, small-room techno
    12-inches. So Swayzak know how to wow their peers, but what about us, the
    discerning public?</p><p>
<i>Himawari</i> is, to be fair, a valiant attempt to grab some mass appeal. But
    I'm afraid that if they're hoping to grab some Madonna remix action, this album
    isn't going to persuade the execs at Maverick. While the tracks here are
    recognizably Swayzak's own, the duo have, in places, diluted their chrome-plated,
    Chain Reaction sound so that those who haven't had the unquestionable pleasure
    of shagging to <i>Snowboarding in Argentina</i> can catch up with their grooves.
    And therein lies the problem.</p><p>
    
    The impressive thing about Swayzak's debut album was the manifest care and
    attention they funneled into every painstaking detail. That they hadn't
    propelled the genre to new heights didn't matter-- they perfectly adapted what
    others had left behind in their rush for the next farthest horizon. <i>Himawari</i>,
    however, suffers from sometimes straying from this admittedly restrictive focus.</p><p>
    
    After dub-poet Benjamin Zephaniah has exhorted us to slightly criminal acts on
    ""Illegal"" (the most Jah-inspired track on <i>Himawari</i>), Kirsty Hawkshaw,
    likely out of work since her days with Opus III, lends her thin vocal talents to
    ""State of Grace"". Before listening to this disc, I was intrigued at the prospect
    of a Swayzak vocal track. How would Taylor and Brown subtly graft a voice onto
    their alloyed techno? ""State of Grace"" could have been a rare moment of true
    experimentation for them. But they chickened out and made the song into a
    passable Visage pastiche, complete with a verse sung-spoken in some dissolute
    European language.  ""The Frozen Loch"" is Swayzak's bid for some Groove Armada
    chill, but a Scottish lad's poem set to drifting beats isn't going to get too
    many Salinas beach babes dancing horizontally.</p><p>
    
    Swayzak have apparently recognized the critical success of Circulation and
    Peace Division, and contribute ""Caught in This Affair"" to the house/techno
    interface.  Driven by a melting rhythm track and topped off with the title's
    vocal sample, the band has a low-key chance of being used as cross-fader fodder.
    The track sounds awkward, and the careful confidence that made me pay close
    attention to <i>Snowboarding in Argentina</i> and their <i>Blufarm</i> 12""
    is noticeably absent here.</p><p>
    
    But for every fumbled attempt at crossover, <i>Himawari</i> provides a true
    thrill. ""Mysterons"" is entirely unencumbered by its blatantly techno title and
    scoops up contention for the jackiest, rim-shot marathon of acid techno I've
    had the delight to hear this year. ""Pineapple Spongecake"" (I guess we should be
    grateful that they didn't have Ho-Ho's lying around on the mixing board that
    afternoon) harkens back to the <i>Snowboarding in Argentina</i> sessions and
    preserves the band's techno-purist appeal. ""Betek"", <i>Himawari</i>'s final
    and finest track, reprises Zephaniah's words from the opener.  It stands as a
    true floor-buckling classic, relentlessly building like Underworld's DJ staple
    ""Born Slippy"".</p><p>
    
    Swayzak, so much more than many other techno acts, deserve huge success.
    Taylor and Brown are conscientious and hard-working-- qualities rare in these
    bandwagoneering churn-'em-out times-- and all of these tracks have a manifest
    beauty to them.  Yet, I find it hard to recommend the present release
    unreservedly because of the apparent compromises they've made to their
    previously exemplary sound.</p></div>"|7648.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7648-himawari/|6.6|Paul Cooper

Having already released three     EPs and a singles collection this year, not to mention a few guest     appearances, Oldham probably said to himself, ""What's one more?"" But     there's a significant difference between <i>Get on Jolly</i> and his     other recent outings: this is his first under the moniker Bonnie ""Prince""     Billy since last year's devastating masterpiece, <i>I See a Darkness</i>.     Anyone who's heard that record can understand why I passed on his other     2000 releases, but simply had to buy this one.</p>
<p>Your suspicions about the EPs title are probably correct. Joined by the     Marquis de Tren-- aka Mick Turner-- Oldham has created yet another slow,     somber, minor-key mood piece.  The opener, ""2/15,"" begins with an ambling     bass reminiscent of Turner's full-time band, Dirty Three.  The cautious     pickings of an electric guitar move in along with an organ, but that's     all-- not just for the song, but pretty much for the whole record.</p>
<p>Oldham sings, of course, and on ""2/15,"" he sings about singing. I can't     help but wonder if he's talking to his fans when he says, ""I know you     take pleasure in my singing."" But I also can't help but find meaning in     the final line, ""My life can only break out in songs that have no purpose.""     Not that this 21-minute, six-song EP is purposeless; it just lacks any     apparent direction or palpable momentum.</p>
<p>Still, since this is, after all, Will Oldham, <i>Get on Jolly</i> is a     worthwhile listen.  Although it sounds as if he's singing in a tiled     bathroom, Oldham's delicate, shaky voice is as distinct and touching as     ever. On ""25,"" he slowly admits, ""All other desires that distract me day     and night are empty to the core,"" with Turner's background vocals     providing stability. And on ""81,"" he manages to sing, ""Hidden in the     heart of things/ You make flowers into edible things,"" with a minimum     of awkwardness.</p>
<p>Following on the heels of this glacial spoken-word track, ""64"" is the     record's most engaging number, if only because it contains consistent     guitar chords and cymbal splashes. The closer, ""66,"" also features cymbals,     but they're more haphazardly employed. And <i>Get on Jolly</i> ends just     as it began: quietly and discretely.</p>
<p>Can you sense my struggle to describe this album? If you've read this far,     then you've read three more paragraphs than necessary. But since you're     still here, you might as well see me through a final summation: if you need     some Oldham music to listen to during that 20-minute period of time between     arriving to work and actually working, <i>Get on Jolly</i> serves the     purpose nicely.  Of course, if you're really in the mood to listen to him,     chances are, you have time for one of his better full-lengths.</p></div>"|700.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/700-get-on-jolly-ep/|7.0|Ryan Kearney

    is playing or if it's simply a drum machine. Usually, there are enough telltale
    signs that such a factor can be picked up by ear, and if not, consulting the
    liner notes provides the necessary information. But in the case of Morcheeba's
    <i>Fragments of Freedom</i>, I find it difficult to tell the difference, let
    alone care. Either way, it's clearly been sanitized by an omnipresent click-track
    to serve the simple, shuffling beats and lush, labored production.</p><p>
    
        Apparently, Morcheeba have grown tired of their trip-hop also-ran status
    and now search for a new pigeonhole to fit squarely into.  This is just as
    well since they've never really nailed the subgenre's active ingredient of
    paranoia.  <i>Fragments of Freedom</i> finds the nondescript trio of two pale
    producers and a chick singer bravely staking their claim on record shelves
    already packed with slick, passionless contemporary funk-- right between Macy
    Gray and Lenny Kravitz.</p><p>
    
        Aside from the old-school Morcheeba sound of the opener, ""World Looking
    In"", and a couple of low-key instrumentals that scream ""didn't feel like writing
    lyrics that day"", <i>Fragments of Freedom</i> is a consistent and predictable
    stylistic overhaul into hyphenated hipster-pop for people who actually liked
    Cibo Matto's last album. It fits the form to a T, right down to the brief,
    pointless Biz Markie cameo.  The tracks here sport such similar singalong
    choruses and easy midtempo beats that I'd be extremely hard-pressed to guess
    which one's the single, much less select a personal highlight. And backup
    singers now crowd Skye Edwards' once subtle and distinctive vocals, obscuring
    the outfit's only exceptional charm.</p><p>
    
        There's nothing the least bit distasteful or offensive here, and maybe that's
    the problem. One can appreciate the skill and craft that Morcheeba exhibit, but
    when you lean in to get a glimpse at the slightest bit of personality or creativity,
    there's simply nothing to speak of. It'd be an excusable shortcoming had so many
    artists not already proven that intelligent dance music isn't necessarily an
    oxymoron.</p><p>
    
    If Morcheeba manage to land an actual club hit with this record-- which is
    plausible if given the proper promotion-- I say more power to 'em. I'd probably
    prefer their tunes on pop radio to the bulk of what's out there now.  But as a
    personal listening product, the contents of this record are no less flat, smooth,
    or mass-produced than its jewel case.</p></div>"|5424.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5424-fragments-of-freedom/|5.1|Al Shipley

Especially for those of us who live in
    city, there's no escaping it; the noise of dense humanity has become a part
    of our lives. We accept and ignore it just to survive. But sometimes the
    noise becomes so overwhelming that the brain can no longer shut it out.
    That's when we do one of two things: lose ourselves, or lose our geography.</p><p>
    
    Earlier in the day on which I wrote this, I woke up to a busy hammer just
    ten inches from my head, flooding through the porous plaster wall. I swore
    at someone whose face I'd never seen.  Then, the alarm clock joined in,
    providing a grating beat that lasted all day, accompanied at times by the
    horn blasts of sedate cabdrivers, the parade of victors and their drunk
    fans, and the deafening screech of the old red 6 train. The noise got so
    loud as to erase my memory of it having never existed.</p><p>
    
    Isn't it amazing, then, that I arrive home only to subject myself to more
    noise: music that to virgin ears would sound like a drowning robot or a
    greenhouse explosion? Yes, and understandable, too: the heightened stimulus
    threshold must be met. But just as silence makes clearer the urban noise I
    live through, so too does listening to Johnny Cash expose my mostly
    stentorian music collection.</p><p>
    
    Like 1994's <i>American Recordings</i> and 1996's <i>Unchained</i>,
    <i>American III</i> was produced by Rick Rubin and includes covers of
    well-known and lesser-known songs. On the opening number, for instance,
    Cash boils down Tom Petty's ""I Won't Back Down"" to its essence, employing
    just two guitars and a barely audible organ. The only important instrument
    here, though, is Cash's voice. As deep and heavy as a mudslide, it raises
    the dead, the lonely, and the heartbroken.</p><p>
    
    What makes this not just a covers album is that, as Cash explains in the
    record's liner notes, he makes the songs feel like his own. Sure, Petty
    wrote it, but its hard to deny that, ""You can stand me up at the gates of
    hell/ But I won't back down,"" is a quintessential Cash sentiment. They're
    not his words, but they <i>are</i>. Call it a vocal strongarm. And he does
    this again and again, from Neil Diamond's ""Solitary Man"" to Egbert Williams'
    ""Nobody"", from David Allen Coe's ""Would You Lay With Me (In a Field of
    Stone)"" to U2's ""One"".</p><p>
    
    But <i>American III</i>'s high point is its two-song centerpiece. The first
    is Will Oldham's ""I See a Darkness"", on which it becomes clear that, perhaps
    because of his neurological disorder, Cash's voice isn't as sure and strong
    as it once was.  When he quavers, with Oldham singing backup, ""Is there hope
    that somehow you can save me from this darkness?"" the effect is absolutely
    devastating. You won't listen to the song the same after this. The shivers
    will eventually leave your spine, but the residue remains.</p><p>
    
    That song's transcendent power also stems from its production, which, although
    still sparse, is relatively lush. The organ and piano that rise to match the
    guitar remain in use for Nick Cave's ""The Mercy Seat"". Chronicling the
    first-person thoughts of a man being executed, this song, more than any
    other on the album, was written for Cash. Building to a rumbling crescendo,
    he belts out, ""And the mercy seat is smokin'/ And I think my head is meltin'.""
    This would've brought even Gary Gilmore to tears.</p><p>
    
    The second half of the album features mostly original compositions. Sparse
    like the early tracks, ""Field of Diamonds"", ""Before My Time"", ""Country Trash"",
    and ""I'm Leavin' Now"" prove that Cash hasn't lost his songwriting step, and
    they show why he can temporarily lay claim to other artist's songs. While
    some critics take issue with Rubin's underproduction, none of the songs on
    <i>American III</i> require ornate instrumentation. Whether they've been
    fluffed up or stripped raw, at the core of each is a compelling statement
    from one of our greatest humanists.</p><p>
    
    I keep telling people that I'm going to leave the city and move westward
    to the country or the mountains. I've done it before, and did so with enough
    success that I didn't concurrently sentimentalize the journey in an effort to
    reduce cognitive dissonance. It may be in two months or twelve, but sooner or
    later, I'll hit my breaking point, when I either lose the noise or it loses
    me. The survival instinct requires that I move.  Guess who's going to be guide?</p></div>"|1332.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1332-american-iii-solitary-man/|8.6|Ryan Kearney

Those quick to decry a
    foolish consistency forget that there's an angel in the details-- an angel
    of our better natures, let's say, urging the hard elegance over the easy noise.
    To charge The Sea and Cake with rehashing the same album amounts to deriding
    Monet for painting the same haystacks. Not only is it wrong, it has simply
    missed the point. It's strange that an album as demure as <i>Oui</i> will
    have such a bitterly polarizing effect; the skirmish over the fine line
    between continuity and paralysis seem so irrelevant to the grace and
    sophistication of this work.</p><p>
    
    This album's October 3rd release date already presents a small parable for
    <i>Oui</i>; it's a day consecrated to Saint Radiohead. But superficially,
    the day marks the release of two eagerly anticipated albums; it concludes a
    three-year absence of serious studio output from both bands. By way of contrast,
    <i>Kid A</i> puts its predecessors through the dream cuisinart; it turns oedipally
    on its forebears. <i>Oui</i>, however, recalls past Sea and Cake albums like lost
    loves: fondness tempered with regret. Some will search <i>Oui</i> for signs of the
    radical innovation and disruption than lend <i>Kid A</i> its oneiric vitality, but
    they'll search in vain.  Rather, the studied affirmative of <i>Oui</i> is sober in
    the face of the past, almost sad and not quite dreaming.</p><p>
    
    The Sea and Cake were born middle-aged, their respective musical puberties farmed
    out among a handful of preceding bands.  The self-titled debut always sounded
    seasoned and precise. Its various musical styles are fused with such mastery and
    deliberation that one would never have believed that the band was intended as a
    one-off project. 1995's <i>Nassau</i> regressed into a newfound adolescence: Sam
    Prekop yowled; John McEntire set aside the brushes for hard sticks; Archer Prewitt's
    rhythmic strum dominated the album. Remember the sloppy jangle of ""Nature Boy"" or
    the snaky garage fusion of ""A Man Who Never Sees a Pretty Girl That He Doesn't Love
    Her a Little"", the churchy farfisa in ""The Cantina""? But even amidst the regression
    and brilliant irresponsibility of <i>Nassau</i> sat the shattering seaside dolor of
    ""Parasol"", recalling an earlier clarity, and virtually anticipating the grievous
    composure of <i>Oui</i>.</p><p>
    
    The shrill yelps and jagged swing of <i>Nassau</i> and <i>The Biz</i> have faded into
    memory. Electronics have come to play a greater role in the band's more recent output.
    Whereas the electronic elements of earlier work never really moved beyond warbling
    afterthoughts, <i>The Fawn</i> was virtually engulfed in twittering synths and subtle
    machinery. The title track was perhaps the most artificial work of the band's entire
    catalog heretofore: drum machine, synthesizer loops and the sweep of programmed
    symphonics. The spontaneity of Eric Claridge's understated bassline served to single-
    handedly save that track from seeming a pale recursive remix of itself. The jazz-like
    spontaneity of earlier efforts was replaced with methodical studio construction. The
    album was lovely but somehow artificial. The abysmal Jim O'Rourke-molested remix EP
    follow-up, <i>Two Gentlemen</i> set new standards for warmed-over ambient pablum,
    virtually anticipating the entire Casino Versus Japan discography and receding limply
    into obscurity and dim regret. When was the last time you heard someone mention ""The
    Cheech Wizard Meets Baby Ultraman in the Cool Blue Cave?"" Please.</p><p>
<i>Oui</i> is less an apology than an awakening. A lesser band might have recanted
    with knee-jerk speed, hooking a fistful of lite-funk <i>Nassau</i>-style tunes up to
    the jumper cables. Instead, the Sea and Cake disappeared into painting and solo
    pursuits, emerging three years later with <i>Oui</i> like the afternoon sun in your
    eyes. They haven't revived the improvisational flex of their early canon; if anything
    <i>Oui</i> is the most meticulously produced thing they've done. And the electronics
    remain virtually omnipresent-- to strange effect, since the melodies are reminiscent
    of the very low-tech jazz-croon of Sam Prekop's 1999 solo album. But nothing is taken
    for granted. Intimacy reigns. The fact that it all holds together is astounding.</p><p>
    
    McEntire's drumming is inhumanly nimble, almost approaching robotics. Beneath the
    boss-level video game music frenzy of ""Afternoon Speaker"", the effect is digital
    clockwork. Prekop oozes, ""Wasn't that a putdown?"" ingenuously over Prewitt's incredibly
    rhythmic lilt. It's pure synchronicity, but driven.  The instrumental, ""You Beautiful
    Bastard"", ruminates like late summer; the music exhales. Paul Mertens' faint string
    arrangements meld with Prewitt's sighing wah-wah lines; Claridge's listless bassline
    seems to stand in for the narrative.</p><p>
    
    While initially promising to be a predictable nod to vogue Brazilian music, ""The Colony
    Room"" subsumes its hints of tropicalia into a rising chorus of Prekop's disjointed lyric
    of fortune-cookieisms and found conversation: ""Welcome to the top, well, I thought so/
    Bring it to an end, without hassle/ No disaster, I guarantee."" The very Tortoise-esque
    ""The Leaf"" fuses gamelan music with blue-eyed soul. Prekop's voice flutters out like
    sweet cigarette smoke: ""I'm waiting till the winter dies, skillfully."" Again, ""Two
    Dolphins"" flirts with tropicalia but subverts the sound with languid electronics and
    McEntire's too-tight percussion. Prekop stage-whispers the line that could serve as
    the motto for <i>Oui</i>:  ""And I know that it sounds right/ Many miles away/ Paradox
    stay forever/ Celebrate this day.""</p><p>
<i>Oui</i> is stunning easy listening in recession, but up close it's genius. The
    production, the arrangements, the instrumentation, the electronics would sound cumbersome
    in the hands of the unexperienced, but The Sea and Cake fuse these elements with economy
    and care. If <i>Oui</i> doesn't erupt like an outright revolution, it's only because the
    band makes it look too easy.  Great art doesn't always come like a shot heard 'round
    the world. And maybe that's the mark of a truly brilliant work of music: it's explosive
    inspiration masquerading as a lullaby.</p></div>"|7040.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7040-oui/|9.0|Brent S. Sirota

    Love Me,"" a track culled from his 1991 album, <i>Girlfriend</i>.  Though Sweet
    is actually pleading to an unresponsive lover in the song, he might as well
    be singing directly to me.  No, I've never been romantically involved with the
    guy; I'm just having a hard time grasping Sweet's significance to '90s music.
    It's true that with his modern rock radio breakthrough, ""Girlfriend,"" Sweet
    immediately stood out as the premier power-popper of the decade.  But three
    years later, Weezer came along, instantly seizing the crown with their
    perfection of the genre and pushing Sweet into runner-up position.</p><p>
    
    In 2000, Sweet emerges as a somewhat inferior predecessor to Elliott Smith;
    they're both undoubtedly well versed in writing catchy melodies, and they both
    adore their own voices enough to multi-track virtually every vocal delivered,
    harmonizing with themselves throughout their hook-laden choruses.  But whereas
    Smith comes off as a brooding troubadour that grew up listening to Lennon and
    Garfunkel, Sweet often seems like a smiley, shiny chap who was fed a steady
    diet of Zeppelin and Big Star.</p><p>
    
    Matthew Sweet boldly embraces his influences, seemingly unconcerned about the
    highly derivative nature of his music.  Not that there's any post-modernist
    mechanism at work; Sweet's music is far too simple to hold any grand, elusive
    meaning.  In fact, Sweet's willingness to snatch ideas from his best-loved
    artists is often the very thing that frees his music.  Let's face it: the
    stuff is pretty enjoyable, and doesn't pretentiously proclaim to be anything
    but that.  And when Sweet is successful, he's truly masterful, like on the
    lovely mid-tempo shuffles, ""We're the Same,"" ""Sick of Myself,"" and ""What
    Matters.""</p><p>
    
    When Sweet veers away from his usual mid-to-uptempo brand of arena pop, though,
    he's likely to fall on his face.  The worst career highlights documented on
    <i>Time Capsule</i> include all-out ballads like the too-Phil Collins sap-fest
    ""Until You Break,"" and the aforementioned ""You Don't Love Me,"" which is
    redeemed only by its quotability.  Here, Sweet does his best James Taylor,
    and predictably, winds up sounding... a lot like James Taylor.</p><p>
    
    It's hard to say how history will remember Matthew Sweet.  Less than a decade
    after the then-labeled ""seminal"" <i>Girlfriend</i> LP, there don't seem to be
    many people around who still care all that much about him.  But at his best,
    Sweet made music that was at least fun, and <i>Time Capsule</i> suggests that
    while that may not secure him a place in the annals of Important '90s Rock,
    the attempt to get there sure was a blast.</p></div>"|7657.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7657-time-capsule-the-best-of/|7.2|Richard M. Juzwiak

The deadline's coming up and I can't find a
    simple comparison of the 90 Day Men's sound to that of two or three
    other better-known bands.  I can only think that it reminds me of an
    instrumentally more accomplished and quieter version of Sonic Youth.
    I figured I shouldn't show my ignorance too much in this review (oops,
    too late), so I decided to ask my close friend Joe to identify some
    possible influences.  Some writers get a reputation for being
    encyclopedias of modern music history made flesh, but Joe surpasses
    that mark by a few Scott Walker references and a casually mentioned
    connection between Travis Morrison and Laurence Welk in four degrees.
    If anyone can help me with this review, it's him.</p><p>
    
    He's immediately impressed and surprised by the opening track, ""Dialed
    In.""  After a minute or two of trance-inducing repetitive guitars, he
    asks if the band is purely instrumental.  In short order, he receives
    his answer in the form of Brian Case's loosely rhythmic spoken vocals.
    As I'd previously thought, his ""slacker of the year"" delivery creates
    the primary anachronism of the 90 Day Men's sound.  For standard
    delivery, his voice is as animated as a cockroach drowning in maple
    syrup, and in moments of expression, he simply whines in lack of diction.
    We both agree that if we could change one thing about this band, it
    would be the vocal style, or even the vocalist himself.  Joe comes
    up with the first similarity: to Slint.  He's right-- the interlocking
    guitars and spoken vocals satisfy some of my need for review fodder.
    On to another track.</p><p>
    
    I skip to ""Exploration Vs. Solution, Baby,"" which begins in a more
    frenzied variation on the first track's ostinaticism.  Case offers a
    bit of post-modern worry about the fate of society, then steps aside
    for bassist Rob Lowe (not <i>that</i> Rob Lowe, naturally) to chant,
    ""The future will not be like the past/  The future will not be like
    the present/ The authority of the rational as opposed to the unseen/
    The importance of the concrete as opposed to the symbolic/ The
    importance of the individual versus group.""  It struck me, as it had
    before, that 90 Day Men are, overall, pretty fucking pretentious.
    And being a fan of progressive rock, I don't throw that term around
    lightly.  It bothers me only inasmuch as the use of overtly self-important
    material is done in a ham-fisted manner, as in ""Exploration Vs. Solution,
    Baby"" and a few other spots on the record.  I can't complain too much
    as, at the very least, Case avoids such clumsiness most of the time.</p><p>
    
    As the album progresses, Joe often mentions potential references for
    my review.  The structures and obvious art-house attitude call <i>Marquee
    Moon</i>-era Television or the somewhat obscure Welsh band Jack.  The
    guitar orchestration (done entirely in the studio, since Case is the
    only guitarist) with the occasional, subtle addition of electric pianist
    Andy Lansangan remind both of us of early-'80s King Crimson and Talking
    Heads, giving credence to their claim on New Wave influences.  As
    previously mentioned, they ride the No Wave as well, with touch points
    like the frequently discordant riffing guitars and tossed-off vocal
    delivery of the old, good Sonic Youth.</p><p>
    
    Despite such diverse influences peppered throughout the album, the 90
    Day Men come up with a feel that, despite its rich heritage, sounds
    quite unique.  I've never heard a band that created the same dark,
    ennui-laden feel as this one, and they deserve credit for that alone.
    Joe and I agree: we're giving it to them.</p></div>"|5807.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5807-it-is-it-critical-band/|7.2|Craig Griffith

    nearly every previous Meat Puppets album with its surreal cover illustration, but
    the consistencies end there. In fact, it's questionable whether the words ""Meat
    Puppets"" should even appear on this album's artwork, since the artist behind it
    is the only remaining member of the band's original lineup, guitarist Curt Kirkwood.</p><p>
    
    To be fair, the outcry over the exclusion of founding members Derrick Bostrom and Cris
    Kirkwood is for mostly sentimental reasons. Cris' continuing downward spiral of drug
    addiction is an understandable if unfortunate circumstance of his absence, and Bostrom
    has retired to the Puppets' birthplace of Arizona, presiding over the band's legacy
    with an official website and last year's comprehensive series of Rykodisc reissues.
    In the meantime, Curt Kirkwood has relocated to Austin and enlisted a new backing band,
    including second guitarist Kyle Ellison, who served as an addition to the original
    trio's last few tours together.  As such, one might hope that this Texan incarnation
    would recall the ZZ Top-inspired southern fried boogie of 1987's underrated <i>Huevos</i>.
    No such luck.</p><p>
    
    Before we go any further, though, let's get a few things straight:  a lot of the
    criticisms I'm levelling at this band would be rendered moot if the guys had stuck with
    their original name, the Royal Neanderthal Orchestra. But without the name recognition
    and expectations that go with the first new Meat Puppets album in five years, <i>Golden
    Lies</i> likely wouldn't even see release. And I can't say that I'd consider that such
    a bad thing, having heard it.</p><p>
    
    Kirkwood barely even got <i>Golden Lies</i> issued under the Puppets' name, having
    been screwed on their contract to London/Polygram thanks to the Unigram merger that
    rendered so many of the labels' bands and workers unemployed. So, Kirkwood ended up
    on Breaking Records, an imprint run by none other than Hootie and the Blowfish. That's
    right, Hootie and the Blowfish.  Yes, of Hootie and the Blowfish fame.  If that isn't
    a severe indicator of the music industry's inability to deal with any kind of music
    that could be even vaguely categorized as ""rootsy,"" I don't know what is.</p><p>
    
    Contrary to the conventional wisdom about commercial breakthroughs by cult favorites,
    1994's <i>Too High to Die</i> was actually one of the best Meat Puppets albums in
    years at the time of its release. Its hard-spined rock approach and Curt's top-notch
    soloing would have made it a great guilty pleasure if they hadn't suddenly found
    themselves in vogue for that fleeting moment. Unfortunately, the album's follow-up,
    <i>No Joke!</i>, was just that, placing them in another rut with a droning alt-metal
    sensibility.  Now, with half a decade and the entire rest of the band laid to waste,
    the band's future seems far from gleaming.</p><p>
    
    And indeed, it is.  Initially, <i>Golden Lies</i> confuses too much to allow for
    disappointment. After all, confounding expectations with a tweaked, fuck-all attitude
    was always an active ingredient in these guys' appeal.  But the album's ""Intro"" itself
    is none too promising, a bizarre sample of the forest people of Cameroon set to a
    mechanized dance beat.  From there, the album settles into a series of unremarkable
    mid-tempo hard rock tunes, with an increasingly marked sense of melancholy and
    resignation.</p><p>
    
    With Butthole Surfer Paul Leary largely absent from the proceedings, Kirkwood's
    self-production comes off as a pale imitation of the inspired touches Leary offered
    their last couple of records. Flangers and other flashy effects twirl around at
    random intervals as if to distract from the inescapable blandness of the songs.
    Atmospheric whooshes begin nearly every track. Processed drums clank and synths
    bubble over.  It might actually be considered slick over-production if it weren't
    so sloppy.</p><p>
    
    ""Hercules,"" however, marks the first clear sign that something is terribly wrong.
    An awkward a cappella intro gives way to an even more awkward attempt at a catchy
    rock tune with simply awful lyrics. Later, ""Pieces of Me""-- not the Jewel song--
    makes the exact same mistake. But this a cappella intro suddenly and conspicuously
    fades out as if Kirkwood realized they'd already done it.  The goonish riff rock of
    ""Take Off Your Clothes"" and the downright corny ""Batwing"" are also prime contenders
    for sending you straight to the stop button.</p><p>
    
    The evolution of Curt Kirkwood's vocal delivery has been one of the least
    predictable in recent history. On early Meat Puppets records, he alternated
    between an unsteady croon and a throaty mumble. Over the years, he's cultivated
    a flat, almost deadpan, approach that manages not to skirt the melody, while
    harmonizing with Cris in a way that only brothers can.  On <i>Golden Lies</i>,
    Curt's multi-tracked vocals eerily recall Cris' harmonies, though lack the
    chemistry that made the combination work.  And often, Curt resorts to shouting
    in halting syllables that vaguely resemble rapping.</p><p>
    
    It's representative of the sad state of affairs that the best moments on <i>Golden
    Lies</i> transparently recall highlights from later albums already past the Meat
    Puppets' prime. ""Turantula"" would be a solid contender for the best song here if
    not for the fact that it's a lazy fusion of the jumpy rhythm from <i>Too High to
    Die</i>'s  ""Never to Be Found"" and a melody similar to that of half the songs on
    <i>No Joke</i>.  The single, ""Armed and Stupid,"" a holdover from last year's <i>You
    Love Me</i> EP, rocks harder and more hummably than the rest of the album, but
    can't shake the feel of being just another <i>No Joke</i> outtake.</p><p>
    
    Some bands display a consistency of craft that keeps them listenable even during
    their fallow or experimental periods.  Others stumble so often and so badly that
    even the fans are forced to question the validity of the rewarding moments. Curt
    Kirkwood and the Meat Puppets have built a long career out of both disappointing and
    surprising, and have still managed to turn out a fair share of enduring works. But
    with even the identity of the band behind the name now in question, I wouldn't expect
    any more pleasant surprises from the Meat Puppets.</p></div>"|5198.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5198-golden-lies/|4.3|Al Shipley

And it was good.  But many people
    proposed that Something be done about it.  There exists a concept of too
    much of a good Nothing.  The people started creating things to fill
    Nothing, and most of them created things worse than Nothing.  After a
    while, people started to clamor for a return to Nothing, or at the very
    least, not much more than Nothing.  And thus, the ""new age"" dawned, with
    soft synth purrs and bird noises ruling the day.</p><p>
    
    Other people started making big Somethings again, usually with guitars,
    basses, and drums.  And over time, the Nothings and the Somethings grew
    apart until, from the heavens of alpha-wave sleep, came Tristeza.  And
    it was horrible.</p><p>
    
    Picture a combination of Paul Winter-ish new age, the worst traits of
    '80s synth-pop, and post-rock of the Tortoise school.  Then, take a lot
    of psychedelics and convince yourself that you really are interested,
    and that you're not just saying that to impress the aging hippie you're
    trying to get in the sack.  If what you look for in your music is a
    whole lot of self-delusion, just <i>try</i> to get into Tristeza.  I
    dare you.</p><p>
    
    It's not as this band puts up so many barriers to entry that a gut
    reaction occurs, telling the listener to eject <i>Dream Signals in
    Full Circles</i> from the stereo before permanent brain damage occurs.
    No, they're far more subtle than that, using the age-old ""first song
    doesn't suck nearly as much as everything else"" bait-and-switch to
    paralyze the languid listener into an instant torpor.  Once there, the
    suck is laid down like the bricks of a charnel house.</p><p>
    
    To Tristeza's credit, the production values here are so high that, at
    any moment, Windham Hill could ring them and invite them to a vegetarian
    lunch to discuss a contract.  Everything's clean and well-played, with
    only the occasional buzzy bass lick reminding one that this isn't a
    bunch of session musicians dozing away in an L.A. studio.</p><p>
    
    The complete lack of melody is what keeps the chiming guitars and
    background synth pads from fully rising up from the subliminal
    level.  You could at least hum the main/only motif of ""Mogwai Fear
    Satan,"" but this is like mental doldrums orchestrated for two guitars,
    keys, bass, and drums.  The dynamics, both of volume and timbrel change,
    are as absent as you were on Senior Skip Day.  But you can't
    intentionally go to bed with Tristeza, as you'll actually wake up to
    the mindless repetition.</p><p>
<i>Dream Signals in Full Circles</i> is Tristeza's second full-length
    album, and it's a goddamned Nancy Drew mystery to me how they've managed
    to appear on the covers of several small indie zines and accumulate a
    small following.  But in the realm of independent music, virtually
    any band can establish their own fanbase.  I don't know any of Tristeza's
    fans personally, but I do have a name for them:  Children of the great
    Nothing-Something.</p></div>"|8165.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8165-dream-signals-in-full-circles/|3.5|Craig Griffith

    it than <i>Some Voices</i>.  Can't be ignored-- Pinback's background noise blares with
    critical acclaim of an intensity easily strong enough to drown out the focused signal of
    their recent output.  Zach (more properly known as Armistead Burwell Smith IV, but Zach'll
    do just fine) and Rob (Crow, that is) boast formidable genealogies in both quantity and
    quality.  Zach's Three Mile Pilot not only rarely gets a bad review, they also share lineage
    with Black Heart Procession.  And Rob Crow's brought no less than a Midas' touch to pretty
    much every project he's awkwardly strummed through.  We're talking seven proper full-length
    albums under such worrisome monikers as Heavy Vegetable, Thingy, and Optiganally Yours.  And
    the list just keeps growing...</p><p>
    
    As such, <i>Some Voices</i>' four songs look like a squadron of X-Wing fighters going up against
    the Star Destroyer of their discography-- the odds aren't good.  But when a recorded voice opens
    the EP with ""Hyperdrive sequence begun, hit it Pinback..."" and a synthesized drum-n-bass loop
    gives way to an ""Every Breath You Take"" guitar phrase, at least we know they've mastered another
    new angle of attack.  From there, the title track coalesces into a multilayered machine of a song,
    tossing in a disconcerting synth noise here and an understated piano line there.  Anybody recall
    4AD's the Wolfgang Press in their heyday?  Weird, I know, but <i>Some Voices</i> makes me do just
    that.  Crow's lyrics exude a similar low-register darkness-- sort of a David Lynch-ian, lost soul
    tale that ends up making narrative sense in that borderline senseless Rob Crow way.</p><p>
    
    ""Trainer"" follows, furthering the impression that the loose and itchy recording tendencies of
    their 1999 self-titled LP have tightened into the cleaner digital warmth of very modern, very
    inexpensive production.  The opening lyric, ""Rubber wings/ Butterflies/ Tangled strings/ Choke the
    victim,"" places this track squarely at the end of a Rob Crow timeline; the same can be said of
    its more basic quartet of guitar/bass/drum/piano.  ""Trainer"" comes out exuberant and spooky; if
    one of these four songs is a holdover from 1998's <i>To the Innocent</i>, this is it.</p><p>
    
    ""Manchuria"" and ""June"" round out this short set in dramatic fashion.  A speck of overblown rock
    opera sparkles in these two pieces.  The grandiose lyrical war metaphors of floating along in a
    waterproof capsule read like bricks in someone's heightening wall.  And the too-sincere emotion
    of Crow's ""Why must all those pretty things be sad, somehow?"" catch the sing-a-longer in you with
    the disturbing pointedness of near-megalomaniacal Roger Waters efficiency.  But where Waters ended
    big records poignantly, Pinback go for off-kilter beauty; guitar, piano, and horn trundle out
    towards silence after reflecting: ""It's up to the trees with the firestorm.""  Pretty enough for
    the words not to matter.</p><p>
    
    Too often, EPs could easily be titled <i>Some Songs We Didn't Get Around to Recording Until Now</i>.
    But <i>Some Voices</i> exhibits a rare mix of cohesion and experimentation that defies the ""throwaway""
    label.  Very good things decorate the future of two musicians who toss this many ideas into an
    otherwise minor four-songer.  Pinback's 16 minutes grow more lush and complex as they become 32,
    and 48, and 64, and...</p></div>"|6295.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6295-some-voices-ep/|7.1|Judson Picco

    <i>The Friends of Rachel Worth</i>.  Before Papa Roach, before the Presidents of
    the United States of America, before even the Toadies, the likes of the Lightning
    Seeds, Lloyd Cole, and the Blue Aeroplanes dominated the alternative airwaves.
    I'm not going to attempt some kind of authoritative history of the era, since I
    didn't get a chance to exercise my 12 year-old critical skills that often before
    Nirvana broke.  As I recall it, though, there were lots of keyboard-augmented,
    mid-tempo British (and faux-British) bands, tempered only by the occasional
    Jane's Addiction outburst.</p><p>
    
    The Go-Betweens were better than that scene, and content to be Australian.  But
    their sound wasn't fundamentally different from many bands in the post-new wave/
    pre-grunge era.  When Robert Forster and Grant McLennan released the first
    Go-Betweens album in 1981, their smart, organic approach to pop was no doubt
    refreshing.  Still, by the time they disbanded in 1989, there were numerous
    aspirants to the clever pop throne, and even if those bands never wrote songs
    quite as well as the Go-Betweens, they often sold more records.</p><p>
    
    The album opens on a high note with McLennan's ""Magic in Here,"" a tuneful,
    bittersweet anthem with a propulsive bass line.  But while 11 years have 
    passed since the last Go-Betweens album saw release, the band's sound hasn't
    changed significantly.  Yes, Forster and McLennan recruited a good percentage
    of the northwest indie scene to appear on this record (Elliott Smith, Corin
    Tucker and Carrie Brownstein of Sleater-Kinney, Sam Coomes of Quasi, and Janet
    Weiss of, erm, both), but their presence is largely undetectable.  ""The Clock""
    is a notable exception, beginning with an unmistakable edgy Brownstein riff,
    but the song quickly retreats into wistful jangle-pop.  Even when Tucker
    contributes her normally explosive vocals to ""Going Blind,"" her harmonies with
    McLennan evoke Papas Fritas more than punk rock.</p><p>
    
    I'm not deluded.  I didn't expect the Go-Betweens to start rocking just because
    they hung out in Portland for a little while.  In fact, ""German Farmhouse,"" the
    most aggressive song on the album, is easily its least appealing.  When the aging
    Forster makes a shaky attempt at bravado and earnestly croons, ""There was a rumor
    that Pavarotti would sing there/ To raise funds for a music school, but then the
    whole thing just vanished into thin air/ I said, thin air,"" it's just too much
    to take.</p><p>
    
    Forster's songwriting, in fact, proves consistently disappointing.  ""Spirit""
    and ""When She Sang about Angels,"" a tribute to Patti Smith, strive for meaningful
    sentiment, but Forster's awkward phrasing makes it difficult to listen to without
    a smirk.  ""When she sang about a boy/ Kurt Cobain/ I thought what a shame/ It
    wasn't about/ Tom Verlaine.""  Uh, what?  It's dispiriting to see the composer of
    gems like ""Spring Rain"" and ""The House That Jack Kerouac Built"" in such poor
    form.</p><p>
    
    For a band returning from a decade-long sabbatical, these guys are surprisingly
    spry.  Their consistency is also, to some degree, their downfall, since they
    still sound uncannily mid-'80s.  And whereas past Go-Betweens records, like 1984's
    <i>Spring Hill Fair</i> and 1988's <i>16 Lovers Lane</i>, have maintained their
    charm after the passage of more than a decade, <i>The Friends of Rachel Worth</i>
    comes off as a relic of another era.  New generations of Aussie pop bands have
    emerged since those early days, and the wit and harmonies of the Lucksmiths and
    the subtle melancholy of Sodastream sound fresher and more relevant now.  But
    even past their prime, the Go-Betweens are still better than anything on present
    alternative radio playlists.</p></div>"|3475.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3475-the-friends-of-rachel-worth/|6.5|Meg Zamula

    proper, <i>Ghost of David</i>, masterfully sum up the record in both tone and
    subject: ""It just so happens I have many concerns,"" Jurado delivers, taking
    the listener by the hand and calmly curating an album-long tour of woe.
    Jurado's grip is as matter-of-fact as his lyric, as subtlety is, perhaps
    paradoxically, his most outstanding trait.  Jurado isn't here to batter
    listeners with social commentary or to weave heavy-handed themes into his
    arsenal of character-driven story-songs.  Thank god.</p><p>
    
    With <i>Ghost of David</i>, Jurado more than makes up for his last effort:
    the silly, if not pointless, <i>Postcards and Audio Letters</i>.  Ancient
    tape-recorded conversations acquired from thrift store bins were assembled
    onto a CD and packaged as Jurado's own to form one of the most bloated
    ""concept"" pieces 2000 saw.  Bereft of music, the album seemed a cop-out,
    and an unworthy follow-up to Jurado's previous studio gem, 1999's
    <i>Rehearsals for Departure</i>.</p><p>
    
    Regardless, Jurado is in top-form on <i>Ghost of David</i>, bettering his
    previous sound.  Gone is the folk-pop hybrid that often had the effect of
    mixing brownish canned peas with lumpy mashed potatoes.  Instead, for the
    first half of the record, Jurado cooks up toothsome, bare-boned, mostly
    solo-acoustic folk.</p><p>
    
    Too important to be considered a mere side dish are Jurado's eloquent and
    accomplished lyrics.  Often, he takes the traditional route of
    folksinger-as-storyteller to great success.  The album's opener, the bleak
    ""Medication,"" tells the story of a man who must divide his attention and
    affection between his married lover and his mentally ill brother.  On
    ""Tonight I Will Retire,"" he assumes the role of a man about to commit suicide
    as he sings over a whisked beat and eerie piano.  Jurado laments, ""If I should
    taste fire/ Save me not, I deserve to die,"" tenderly straining his voice.
    It's doubtful that Jurado, the fine Christian chap that he is, has been in
    either of these situations personally, but his empathetic delivery and
    avoidance of sappiness propel the tracks to a sincerity that even the most
    confessional, soul-bearing songwriters often fail to deliver.</p><p>
    
    Jurado dives into more experimental territory during the second half of the
    album-- an interesting move after playing it so straight.  I can't knock him
    for his initiative, and his shunning of sing-along pop is dually commendable.
    However, the second half of the album is largely hit-or-miss. ""Parking Lot""
    is lulling and pretty but sports Sarah McLachlan-esque lead vocals by Rose
    Thomas.  Why Jurado chose not to grace the song with his own molasses-coated
    pipes is a mystery, as it could have been the record's best track.  ""Paxil""
    is a grinding, garage-rocker that only reinforces Jurado's strength with
    folk-based material.  Still, the organ flourishes on ""Rearview"" and ""December""
    add an ethereal quality that surprisingly complements the folk components of
    the tunes.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, the last half of <i>Ghost of David</i>, while sometimes as
    stunning as the first, gives the album a slightly inconsistent feel.  And
    though this record proves that Jurado has yet to release a masterpiece,
    Jurado is aware of his flaws.  In ""Great Today,"" he sings, ""I could be so
    much better.""  I don't know about the ""so much"" part, but with that attitude,
    a perfect album can't be too far away.</p></div>"|4328.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4328-ghost-of-david/|8.2|Richard M. Juzwiak

    named Goldfrapp, I'd have told you to pack your bags for an
    all-expenses-paid trip to my fist.  But writing this review, all I can
    think of is Goldfrapp. Sweet, sweet Goldfrapp. Mmm... Goldfrapp.</p><p>
    Before I get accused of any level of chauvinism here, I feel I should
    defend myself. I am, after all, only a male variant of the human species.
    And what sane, sexually functional guy could resist a woman who whispers
    in a throaty voice, ""No time to fuck/ But you like the rush?"" Not me!
    What's more, she's English! English from England! And she hangs out with
    Orbital! C'mon, now!</p><p>
    Taking cues from apparent influences ranging from Marlena Dietrich to
    Siouxsie Sioux to Björk, Alison Goldfrapp has constructed an album that's
    simultaneously smarmy and seductive, yet elegant and graceful. Describing
    the sound of <i>Felt Mountain</i> comes easy not because it's a simple
    album, but because the devices used throughout are so ingrained in our
    musical vernacular.</p><p>
    If <i>Austin Powers</i> had been a film noir flick, its soundtrack would
    probably sound something like <i>Felt Mountain</i>. The hushed vocals, the
    crying analog synthesizers, and the sustained seven chords all evoke
    amazingly strong images of things past. Still, the album manages not to
    sound dated, kept fresh by occasional journeys into more experimental
    electronics and Goldfrapp's always-engaging vocals.</p><p>
<i>Felt Mountain</i> opens with ""Lovely Head,"" a track that juxtaposes a
    shuffling drum beat and whistling that sounds like it could be 50 years
    old with futuristic analog beeps. Goldfrapp's voice, with all its warmth
    and expressiveness, sounds instantly familiar.  And it retains this
    familiarity over the course of the album, excepting a throaty,
    Siouxsie-esque yelp or two in ""Human,"" and a bizarre passage at the end
    of ""Deer Stop,"" in which her voice is made to sound eerily childlike.
    Creepy, especially considering the sexual undertones present.</p><p>
    All this taken into account, <i>Felt Mountain</i>'s greatest strength
    lies in its overall elegance as a record. While certainly not ""poppy,""
    it never has a truly weak moment. And while the songs aren't all that
    different from one another, the flow from track to track makes perfect
    sense.</p><p>
    To summarize, <i>Felt Mountain</i> is a really swell record, and I am
    madly in love with Alison Goldfrapp. I'd have her name tattooed on my
    arm, but... you know.  There just isn't room in this world for a man
    with ""Goldfrapp"" inscribed in his flesh.  Luckily, there's always room
    in the world for a damned fine record.</p></div>"|3504.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3504-felt-mountain/|8.0|Matt LeMay

Some people, on the other hand, will parade
    through life to the applause and acclaim of all around them. Carl Craig is one
    of those people.  Since he stepped out onto center stage of Detroit techno,
    whatever he's released has been graced with universal acclaim. And while it's
    true that much of what he's produced is noteworthy, he's far from being able to
    turn muck into brass.</p><p>
    I've found that it's Craig's work under aliases that merits the real props. His
    69 and Paperclip People guises give him the freedom to funk and get the floor
    buckling; as Innerzone Orchestra, Craig seriously indulges in his Sun Ra fantasies
    and I can't help but be sucked in.  But the two albums released under his birthname
    seem awkward, stilted, and striving for ""art"" status.</p><p>
<i>Designer Music: The Remixes</i> is an awkward compilation of Carl Craig's remixes
    of other musicians' material and as such showcases both his strengths and his
    indulgent arty weaknesses. On this disc, Craig veers from excellence to insouciance,
    and expects not to be called on it.</p><p>
    United Future Organization's ""Planet Plan"" is first up, setting the tone for the first
    half of the collection. The remix sounds as though the extent of the additional
    production was appending his own name to the track credits. As for his reworking of
    conguero Johnny Blas' ""Picadillo,"" Craig has stripped the Havana party horn blasts
    and let the congas rumble on for eight minutes. To be fair, ""Picadillo"" works as a DJ
    tool, and in doing so, harkens back to the original Designer Music 12"" Craig released
    for the long since defunct Planet E subscription series. ""Picadillo"" could easily serve
    as a transition disc from one Nuyorican effort to the next, but I question the need for
    it to be compiled.</p><p>
    However, Craig's Planet E Special mix of Incognito's ""Out of the Storm"" more than deserves
    inclusion on every techno compilation.  Yes, every one.  Craig takes Incognito's smooth,
    radio-friendly vocal jazz and transforms the band's oh-so sophisticated schlock into
    unadulterated techno soul. This is the track you should play to those who claim that
    music made by machines (e.g. techno) is devoid of soul. Out of a slopping, slinky
    downtempo rhythm, Craig develops a whirling dervish of ARP lines capable of transporting
    even the most stolid heart.</p><p>
    Unfortunately, the high induced by ""Out of the Storm"" is robbed from us by the mix of
    Telex's ""Moscow Diskow.""  But to his credit, Craig isn't working with great material to
    begin with here. Contrary to what the Belgian cultural attaché might have you believe,
    Telex never did anything to disabuse the rest of the world of the notion that Belgium is
    an artistic vacuum. ""Moscow Diskow"" is an excruciating, Ed Wood Jr.-esque attempt at aping
    the glories of Kraftwerk. Telex's abilities are so minuscule that Craig is left to extend
    the track by four minutes or so, plopping in some extra-spacy blurps and blops, and
    collect his large honorarium check.</p><p>
    By the time you've reached this point in the album, you're praising whoever designed the
    skip forward button. Why bother with Craig's mix of Inner City's ""Buena Vida,"" which is
    little more than an a cappella or the directionless Urban Affair mix of BT's ""Moment of
    Truth?""</p><p>
    Of course, Craig forces us into enduring such brackish gruel in order to reap our reward:
    the final three tracks.  Here, he showcases the dancefloor, where he's inarguably most
    secure and expert. The remixes of Spacetime Continuum, Alexander Robotnik, and Ron Trent
    each exude the no-nonsense nous Craig demonstrates whenever he produces a Paperclip People
    track. Yes, these remixes are minimal-- there are no jazzy tropes, no Latin flourishes. But
    in their stead, you get the pure sound of mechanical funk that sets Detroit apart from the
    rest of the world.</p><p>
<i>Designer Music: The Remixes</i> just about makes a case for remixing being more than a
    mere marketing ploy.  But only just.</p></div>"|1655.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1655-designer-music-the-remixes-vol-1/|5.8|Paul Cooper

    character with a ball bouncing around in its torso and protruding through its
    elastic skin.  It might also be a Pokémon existing in multiple realities
    simultaneously-- a plural-mon, if you will.</p><p>
    It's fitting, then, that in some ways, Pluramon (aka Marcus Schmickler of the
    A-Musik family of Cologne) music is the aural equivalent to those humorous and
    outrageous visualizations.  <i>Bit Sand Riders</i> is not technically a
    Pluramon release, of course.  It's a remix album of tracks from Pluramon's
    first two albums, <i>Pickup Canyon</i> and <i>Render Bandits</i>. Nevertheless,
    the analogy is apt in describing the contents of the record.</p><p>
    The lineup of remixers here is impressive in both caliber and diversity.  It
    isn't everyday that you see Mogwai, the High Llamas, and FX Randomiz credited
    as having participated in the same project.  And while it might appear that
    such disparity between contributors would be a detriment to an album's
    coherence, <i>Bit Sand Riders</i> maintains a surprisingly consistent feel
    throughout its progression.</p><p>
    Sensorama opens the record with a remix of ""Flicker.""  Prior to obtaining this
    disc, I had no idea that Sensorama even existed.  It was a pleasant surprise
    that their involvement in this project turned out to be a relatively impressive
    exercise in digital processing, similar to that of the Viennese Mego camp.
    Music like this is often written off as coldly intellectual or pretentious,
    but the truth is that the sonic palette and overall texture of the track
    are more immediately appealing than most pop songs, despite the lack of rhythm
    or melody.</p><p>
    Mogwai turn in a much more conventional interpretation of ""Hintergrund,"" from
    the <i>Render Bandits</i> album.  The original material is transformed into a
    half-goth/half-shoegazer groove hybrid, complete with trip-hop drum loop and
    tension building bridge.  It's definitely a catchy tune, but it tends to become
    a little tedious after repeated listens, since there really isn't much meat to
    it aside from what's apparent on the first listen.</p><p>
    The decidedly quirky San Franciscan duo Matmos take a stab at ""Hintergrund"" as
    well, to a greater degree of success.  In fact, the remix, entitled
    ""Pluramonthermatmos,"" is one of the album's standouts.  In addition to the
    source material from <i>Render Bandits</i>, Drew Daniel and Martin Schmidt
    incorporate toy piano and banjo, among many other things, into their reworking.
    The result is an extremely dense drum-n-bass track with all the funny/interesting
    sound combinations we've come to expect from Matmos.  The song is complex
    enough to provide hours of entertainment as an audio puzzle alone, but to top
    it off, it's also engaging and fun.</p><p>
    Other notable moments on the disc include Lee Ranaldo's breezy
    acoustic-riff-turned-frenetic-electronic-number, which employs material from
    the entirety of <i>Render Bandits</i> and, consequently, wins the prize for
    most hilarious song title for ""Microchip, Shit! My Cock is Analog.""  SND, the
    Sheffield dyad, offer a catchy, bouncy track of glitches and overloads that's
    refreshingly straightforward.  And providing the most annoying track on <i>Bit
    Sand Riders</i> is Mego's own Hecker, who comes through with the most grating
    (but lovable) sounds this side of Pita.  But then, who could top Merzbow in
    the exasperating noise department?</p><p>
    If there's any noteworthy downside to <i>Bit Sand Riders</i>, it's that there's
    a lot to digest.  David Byrne has been known to say that it isn't easy for
    anyone to listen to more than six tracks in one sitting, and he might even
    lower that figure when the concept is applied to IDM fare.  The upside, of
    course, is that every track stands on its own as an individual presentation
    of the material that inspired it.  Even if you're unfamiliar with Pluramon's
    discography, <i>Bit Sand Riders</i> is an absorbing and, more importantly,
    enjoyable listen, regardless of genre specificity.</p></div>"|6352.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6352-bit-sand-riders/|7.6|Michael Wartenbe

    guitar. Or, at least, I think so. In explaining how Dean Wareham, Damon
    Krukowski and Naomi Yang formed the seminal Galaxie 500 while at Harvard
    in the mid-1980s, the liner notes of Rykodisc's reissues of their only
    three albums state that Naomi began only as the ""graphic advisor."" After
    a failed search for a bassist, ""Naomi announced that she would play bass
    (something she had never done previously).""</p><p>
    
    While at first I assumed that ""graphics"" referred to technical production--
    that is, as in ""graphics equalizer""-- I became confident in my present
    conviction after noticing that she's credited for the design of the Galaxie
    500 albums, and <i>Damon and Naomi with Ghost</i>.  So, why does this matter?
    Because everything about the latter album's artwork is incredibly deliberate.
    I don't feel myself stretching when I say that Naomi Yang probably envisions
    the new album's ""look"" as a reflection of its sound.</p><p>
    
    If these are her thoughts, she's quite right. The manner in which <i>Damon &amp;
    Naomi with Ghost</i> appears on the front and side of the jewel case is the
    first of many telling visual signs; for ""Damon &amp; Naomi"" is printed in standard
    black ink while ""with Ghost"" is given a silvery gray that almost disappears
    when viewed at certain angles. In other words, like an incarnation of the
    fantastic, Ghost's influence is often imperceptible, though it's always
    around.</p><p>
    
    Since Masaki Batoh aided in the album's production, and since he, Michio
    Kurihara and Kazuo Ogino provided background instrumentation, Japan's Ghost--
    or at least its core members-- had a hand in every song here. One would think
    that, coming off of last year's rich <i>Snuffbox Immanence</i>, the psych-folk
    collective would add profound depth and originality to Damon and Naomi's dreamy
    folk. Ghost were just what the duo needed to put the ""core"" back in the
    slowcore; it had been noticeably absent in their post-Galaxie output.</p><p>
    
    But, regardless of who's to blame, Ghost's role isn't large enough to alter
    Damon and Naomi's sound. The tasteful shiver of a pedal steel on the opener,
    ""The Mirror Phase,"" could be attributed to Ghost, as could an accordion-esque
    undercurrent. But even if they're the work of Ghost, these and other less
    identifiable atmospheric sounds are by no means overt. Instead, they're
    buried frustratingly deep below the simple drums, acoustic guitars and
    vocals, and often inaudible without intense scrutiny.</p><p>
    
    The only moments when Ghost's influence on Damon &amp; Naomi's material takes
    centerstage-- other than the album's four conspicuous electric guitar solos--
    is on ""The New World,"" the music for which was composed solely by Ghost. And
    it shows: the acoustic guitar steps aside to make room for a sprightly
    harpsichord, orchestral keyboards, haunting choir-chords and, beneath it all,
    metal that clanks, clashes, shatters and splashes. Other than these few
    exceptions, Ghost never unleash the lush, varied instrumentation-- not to
    mention Batoh's distinct voice-- that makes their work so unique.</p><p>
    
    But just because this is essentially another Damon &amp; Naomi album doesn't
    render it unlistenable. Damon Krukowski's off-key falsetto works nicely
    alongside Yang's simpler, more consistent vocals; by sharing the microphone,
    they prevent either voice from becoming unbearable. And tracks such as ""The
    Mirror Phase,"" ""Judah and the Maccabees,"" and ""The Great Wall"" are beautiful
    songs, even if they do contain simplistic, pseudo-proverbs such as ""The ocean
    is wide, the tides run deep,"" and, ""These heights will rise faster than they
    fall."" And then there are songs like the conveniently-titled ""Don't Forget,""
    which are as forgettable as they come.</p><p>
    
    The photographs in the album artwork are of a moss-covered hillside bathing in
    sunlight, a bamboo shaft against mud-packed reeds, a parabolic shadow in the
    sand, and a slant of light against an interior barn wall-- all of them nearly
    surreal pastoral scenes that are pleasant to the eye. The well-focused images
    contain significant detail, but there are only a few distinct objects to focus
    on. After looking over them a few times, there's nothing else to be gained.
    One must accept them for their elevated warmth alone. The same could be said
    for the music, which is why <i>Ghost with Damon &amp; Naomi</i> would have made
    for a more compelling listen.</p></div>"|2156.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2156-with-ghost/|6.2|Ryan Kearney

    began to endure the vicious cycle of having its authenticity tainted by
    commercial compromise, then redeemed, however fleetingly, by some ""underground""
    roots movement. And it's a relief to hear so many of those redeeming qualities
    in the voice of Laura Cantrell, a city gal who celebrates country tradition in
    her music even as she augments it.</p><p>
    
    Cantrell reclaims the essence of country songwriting, but she also puts subtle
    twists on familiar slice-of-life songs about whiskey drinkin', relationships
    gone sour, livin' on the road, and simple girl-wants-boy longing. Her music,
    whether inherently sad or jubilant, is always delivered with convincing
    sincerity.  She's also not afraid to explore uncomfortable psychological
    truths in intimate and eloquent detail. Such affecting down-home realism, of
    course, is always glossed over by the homogenous evil of the ""new"" Nashville
    country.  But contrary to country tradition, Cantrell sings no songs about
    blowing away her spouse with a shotgun 'cause she loved him.  It's just not
    her style.</p><p>
    
    Anyone who's heard Cantrell's weekly WFMU New Jersey radio show, ""Thrift Shop
    Radio,"" knows she has impeccable taste in country songwriters. On <i>Not the
    Tremblin' Kind</i>, she chooses to filter great songs by George Usher, Amy
    Allison, and Joe Flood through her supple vocal cords. And although her own
    writing talents are evident, this album contains only four originals-- the
    standout, ""Queen of the Coast,"" is a tear-jerker about a small-town singer
    whose vague dreams of stardom succumb to routine, old age, and bungled
    marriages.</p><p>
    
    Comparisons to a young Dolly Parton or Kitty Wells seem justified enough, as
    Cantrell possesses a heartbreakingly sweet voice without being cloying in the
    way, say, Olivia Newton-John was during her frightening early 70's country
    phase. True, Cantrell may not have the voluminous pipes of a powerhouse
    vocalist like Tammy Wynette or Rosanne Cash, but we're not talking about the
    feeble peep of some Dixie Chick here, either.</p><p>
    
    In fact, on ""The Whiskey Makes You Sweeter,"" Cantrell floors with her lilting
    phrasing-- singing of the strange aphrodisiac effects of that favorite
    country-song libation.  This could easily be an answer to Loretta Lynn's
    ""Don't Come Home a Drinkin' (with Lovin' on Your Mind)."" A Byrdsy 12-string
    flourish prefaces ""Do You Ever Think of Me?,"" which is more a conventional
    60's pop tune than anything else, with its lively, un-country Farfisa lines
    bouncing around the verses. The title track could be the anti-""Stand by Your
    Man,"" considering defiant sentiments like: ""You want me to get down on my
    knees, and beg for just a little sympathy/ You want me to go to bed defeated
    and resigned/ Oh, no, I'm not the tremblin' kind.""</p><p>
    
    Then there's the rousing country-rock of ""Pile of Woe,"" whose bright orange
    sunrise chords and uptempo rhythms reinforce faint hope of deliverance from
    the world's misery: ""This whole world's a mess a trouble,"" she sings, just
    before that great refrain, ""But I'm lookin' out for rain in every grain of
    hope I sow, plowin' this pile of woe."" Pure gen-u-wine country-fried poe'try,
    friend.</p><p>
    
    Instead of applying the old-school production ethic of distancing the singer's
    voice with lonesome reverb, producer Jay Sherman-Godfrey lays off the effects
    board and goes for stark intimacy. This approach accentuates and isolates
    Cantrell's voice, so that at times, you get a sense of her delivery being
    tentative, as if she's unsure of her range. Ultimately, though, this heightened
    vulnerability seems to work in Cantrell's favor: even her slight vocal
    inadequacies become endearing after awhile.</p><p>
    
    And too bad Cantrell couldn't employ multi-instrumentalist Jon Graboff's weepy
    steel guitar more often.  His style is lifted right off <i>Sweetheart of the
    Rodeo</i> and could've made up for the less-than-inspired electric guitar.
    Graboff also turns in some impressive Doc Watson-style acoustic flatpicking.
    And his ubiquitous mandolin playing is as easy on the ears as Cantrell's
    singing, as its accompanying melodies frolic endlessly behind the vocals. For
    the most part, <i>Not the Tremblin' Kind</i> features the sort of
    instrumentation and arrangement you'd find on the most classic of
    traditionalist country albums-- the focus being mainly on the voice and
    lyrics, with unobtrusive acoustic guitar and mandolin carrying most of the
    lead instrumental duties.</p><p>
    
    But again, this is not 50's Nashville or even the 60's Bakersfield sound being
    faithfully updated.  The spirit of Gram Parsons, and the influence of other
    country-rock innovators like Emmylou Harris can be heard as well, as Cantrell
    juggles her neo-hillbilly roots (hell, she was actually born in Nashville)
    with her more cosmopolitan pop/rock instincts.  Although not a flawless album,
    <i>Not the Tremblin' Kind</i> can still measure up pretty well to most of the
    revered alt-country releases of the last decade: albums such as Freakwater's
    <i>Old Paint</i>, the Blood Oranges' <i>Corn River</i>, and Victoria Williams'
    <i>Loose</i>.  And it damn sure beats any neo-country slop Son Volt, the
    Jayhawks or the Handsome Family could ever shovel up, no matter how hard those
    college-rockers try to sound hick.</p></div>"|1286.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1286-not-the-tremblin-kind/|7.4|Michael Sandlin

I wasn't
    afraid of the dark itself, it's just that I couldn't bear having the lights
    turned out and witnessing an ominous residual glow imbue my stuffed animals
    with a sinister impression of life.  I got rid of my <i>E.T.</i> poster because
    it looked absolutely horrific in the moonlight.</p><p>
    
    It seems as though Pram's entire recorded career has focused on this childhood
    fear, characterized mainly by an otherworldly eclecticism in approach and an
    alien tentativeness in execution. And Pram's ballooning number of band members
    has articulated their work's quirky effervescence over the years.  The opener
    on this, their fifth album, is titled ""The Owl Service"" after a children's
    horror story by Alan Garner.  Pram courts the actively uncanny with a delicate
    balance of childlike irreverence and apprehension.</p><p>
<i>The Museum of Imaginary Animals</i> frames Rosie Cuckston's schoolgirl vocals 
    within an intricately homespun dream jazz symphony.  Less sparse than their 
    previous releases, the flute, clarinet, and trumpet contributions are more 
    pronounced, and the songs are stylistically denser.  ""The Owl Service"" is
    almost funky in its avant-jazz-pop amblings, while ""Bewitched"" bludgeons the 
    conventional pop song, blossoming into a shadowy anti-anthem while Cuckston 
    subversively intones: ""From certain corners where I used to hide/ I could act 
    as a satellite spying on my own life/ Decode the message in the space between 
    the words.""  The greater instrumental dexterity runs the risk of overwhelming 
    Cuckston's Moe Tucker-by-way-of-Britain vocal capacity, but her voice remains 
    Pram's secret weapon.  In the swoops of her delivery, and her cracked straining
    for high notes, one finds a detached expression of the vaguely fascinated in
    the face of the surreal.</p><p>
    
    One of the first Too Pure signings, Pram was, in many respects, the first 
    Broadcast, offering a distinct take on the French-pop core manifest in early 
    Stereolab.  Both Pram and Broadcast hail from Birmingham, and the drummer on 
    this album even drummed for an earlier incarnation of Broadcast.  But what
    distinguishes the two is that Pram continues to showcase the foggy insular
    quality of their work while Broadcast has buffed its approach to a glossily
    synthetic sheen.  Pram remains caught up in a loosely crafted fairy tale of
    its own making, a musical Brother's Grimm hell-bent on examining the puzzlebox
    of a child's dark imagination.</p></div>"|6445.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6445-the-museum-of-imaginary-animals/|7.7|S. Murray

    tastes and love for ""all kinds of music, except country.""  You've probably heard
    it, too. Hell, I bet you've gone around saying it yourself. At least until that
    alt-country hype gave you hope that you weren't necessarily too cool for it, 
    and didn't even have to buy boots or take line-dancing classes to indulge.</p><p>
    
    Sixteen Horsepower might be ideal country music for those who think themselves
    too hip for twang, but are too nauseated by Son Volt's slide-guitar fluff.
    Rather, this band inhabits the same dark corner once occupied by the Geraldine
    Fibbers, where goth and southern gothic intersect without much to interest
    purists of either form.</p><p>
    
    David Eugene Edwards is the son of a preacher man and claims that his lyrics 
    come to him from a higher power. So why isn't his band working that angle for 
    the hard sell, opening for DC Talk or, at the very least, releasing records
    on Tooth &amp; Nail?  Well, for starters, Sixteen Horsepower's music is scarier
    than any rock n' roll Antichrist you can name.  In fact, if there's anything
    Edwards' holy rants bring to mind, it's an enraged Jules Winnfield reciting
    <i>Ezekiel 25:17</i> with his gun's barrel bruising your temple.</p><p>
<i>Secret South</i> blasts forward with a pump of fuzz bass that immediately
    puts emphasis on one of Sixteen Horsepower's more distinctive but less obvious 
    defining traits: a massive low end. Bassist Pascal Humbert and the groaning 
    cello occasionally supplied by guest string players suggest the kind of 
    floor-rattling hum more closely associated with Jeeps than the horse-and-buggy 
    that would make the band's ideal touring vehicle.  Jean-Yves Tola completes
    the formative rhythm section, anchoring the surrounding banjo, fiddle, and
    bandoneon flourishes with galloping beats that not only serve as the foundation
    for these songs, but also justify the band's moniker-- they provide a relentless
    engine to Edwards' songs while dragging them away with wild horses.</p><p>
    
    But at the moment, Sixteen Horsepower are knee-deep in the awkwardness that
    follows being dropped from a major label.  After reaching a plateau of quality
    with 1998's <i>Low Estate</i>, their doomed contract with A&amp;M; Records reached
    its inevitable conclusion. So now they're not only operating on a smaller label 
    with less promotional reach, but they're also facing an inability to raise the
    stakes and satisfy the remaining fanbase.</p><p>
<i>Secret South</i> is a characteristically strong showing, but ultimately, it
    pales in comparison to its predecessors.  The self-produced album retains
    the band's unique sound, but fails to measure up to the perfect match they
    found in guitarist John Parish for <i>Low Estate</i>'s crisply rustic
    atmosphere. Even without any of the droning squeezebox ballads that accounted
    for <i>Low Estate</i>'s few weak spots, it somehow lacks the momentum and fury
    that made that album such an engaging listen.</p><p>
    
    Whereas <i>Low Estate</i> could be cleanly divided between the upbeat back porch
    sing-alongs, rambunctious quasi-cowpunk bursts, and the aforementioned dirges,
    <i>Secret South</i> almost wholly falls into a middle ground with less consistent
    results. The one mode that is most often in stock here is the slow burn, patiently
    building but never accelerating past a frustrating mid-tempo. Sometimes it works,
    as with the teasingly incomplete crescendos of ""Poor Mouth."" But elsewhere, the
    formula borders on unbearable, best evidenced by the overwrought wailing of
    ""Cinder Alley.""</p><p>
    
    With Edwards' songwriting in a bit of a slump here, it's not surprising that
    the album's most enjoyable moments are covers. The traditional ""Wayfaring 
    Stranger"" suits him as well as any of his originals, with a tinny vocal tone 
    giving the song an honest, folksy rendering. Even better is ""Nobody 'Cept You,""
    a gorgeous vow of dedication from Bob Dylan's <i>Bootleg Series</i>.  And
    even if the lyrics aren't his, the song still shows Edwards in rare form,
    laying aside his usual rhetoric for earthly love and naked sincerity.</p><p>
    
    Ultimately, <i>Secret South</i> shows Sixteen Horsepower nailing their trademarks
    perhaps too well.  With no ironic crutch or overtly modern traits (aside from a
    vaguely post-grunge sensibility), there's little to save them from niche, or
    worse, caricature. For the most part, they fend off these concerns with material
    that demands to be judged on its own merits. But let's face it, ""Praying Arm Lane""
    resembles the theme from ""Rawhide"" just a little too closely to be taken seriously.
    Nonetheless, Sixteen Horsepower remains a breath of fresh air for those of us who

    turn to Frank Capra movies. I wonder whether that venerated director's view
    of humanity has ever been fully validated. Can one point to a person as
    compassionate as those so memorably portrayed by James Stewart? I also think
    about the premise of <i>It's a Wonderful Life</i>. What would be the ripple
    effects of anyone of us not ever having existed? Would I experience a
    quantifiable depreciation in my hedonic quotient if your mom and dad
    had never procreated?</p><p>
    
    Rather than directly answering that specific question, I prefer (for social
    reasons of politeness) to consider the effect of certain celebrities'
    non-existence. I'd like to think that I wouldn't miss Calista Flockhart.
    But I rather enjoyed her self-mockery on a recent episode of ""Saturday Night
    Live."" Would I feel a nagging tug if Lou Diamond Philips had never walked
    this Earth? Probably not. I certainly wouldn't have missed <i>Bats</i>.  The
    only justification I can discern for Kevin Bacon is that the parlor game
    Six Degrees of Charlie Sheen wouldn't be half as much of a brain-teaser.</p><p>
    
    In music, while I wouldn't hesitate to scream for the births of Miles Davis,
    Dr. Alex Patterson, Stephen Patrick Morrissey, the Hartnoll Brothers, Kate
    Bush, Grace Slick, Zoltan Kodaly, and Fela Kuti, I have to think long and
    hard about Elizabeth Fraser, Seal, Norman Cook, and Sarah Cracknell. In the
    cases of Elizabeth Fraser and Seal, I have to grudgingly consent to their
    conceptions on the grounds that many of my friends have had very successful
    sexual encounters soundtracked by this pair's unique, orgasm-encouraging vocal
    talents.</p><p>
    
    Sarah Cracknell, though a marginal candidate for existence, would have passed
    the test-- just.  But that was before I heard <i>Kelly's Locker</i>.  Never
    the brains behind St Etienne's glossing of long since abandoned bachelor pad,
    girl-group, three-minute pop, she provided a convenient dolly head for Pete
    Wiggs and Bob Stanley to proliferate their Xeroxed fanzine-esque adoration of
    a load of old thrift-store tat.</p><p>
    
    And for a while, I was hooked. ""Avenue"" and ""California Duvet"" still rank
    among my favorite Brian Wilson rip-offs. I can overlook the boys' dumping of
    original vocalist, Faith over Reason's Moira Lambert, when I remember fondly
    David Holmes' skull-crushing acid remix of ""Like a Motorway."" And come to
    think of it, I rather enjoyed <i>Sound of Water</i> when I last paid attention
    to it.</p><p>
    
    However, stripped of the Croydon lads who long for a walk-on part in a Nick
    Hornby novel, Cracknell comes severely unstuck. Far more dire than a One
    Dove-less Dot Allison, Cracknell minus Wiggs and Stanley exposes her own
    childish dream to be Julie Christie in <i>Billy Liar</i>. Except Cracknell
    would be filmed stumbling over her shopping bags, ending up arse-over-tit in
    a gray-skied shopping precinct, confused, embarrassed, and cursing the world
    for being so unfair to her.</p><p>
    
    In an attempt to disbuse us of this image, Instinct Records, fresh from
    causing no stir whatsoever with a new Marianne Faithful album, release a
    companion b-sides EP to the lousily selling Cracknell album, <i>Lipslide</i>.
    Which, by the way, was released a donkey's age ago in the UK and has been
    re-jigged for American audiences. Notice? I hardly even cared.</p><p>
    
    So I'm presented with the splatty back end of Instinct's campaign to get a
    little Cracknell into every home. Do I really wish to describe the pallid
    piano ballad that is ""Judy, Don't You Worry,"" or the Euro-dance dreck that
    Cracknell calls ""Taking Off for France?""  Nico's Liquid Steel remix of
    ""Anymore"" adds a modicum of drum-n-bass excitement to the original but not
    enough to excuse the Vengaboys-for-Uptown-Soirees statement of vacuity,
    ""Penthouse Girl, Basement Boy."" How about if I skip the would-be anthemic
    were-it-not-so-Michael Bolton ""How Far?""</p><p>
    
    Thank you for your consideration of my feelings and not pushing me to describe
    this purposeless release any further. Just like the characters in a Capra
    flick, I feel I've learnt a great moral lesson. I feel your warmth and
    humanity, and your concern for my well-being humbles me. I am now very glad
    you were born. You have improved my life substantially. There's a place for
    you at my Thanksgiving table. Do stay a while, friend.</p></div>"|1653.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1653-kellys-locker-ep/|2.4|Paul Cooper

    time. But there are those who never seem to be able to live it down; they're
    stuck in that moment, unable to achieve escape velocity from an emotional
    black hole. Some such people cling desperately to anyone who passes by in
    the hopes that they can be pulled out; others wallow, becoming permanently
    embittered and cynical. And then there are those who learn to live
    comfortably in that moment, even going so far as to do a little interior
    decorating-- matching drapes, throw rugs, comfy chairs, and the like. You
    can probably guess which category the Softies fall into.</p><p>
    
    For five years and four albums now, Rose Melberg and Jen Sbragia of the
    Softies have remained ensconced firmly in their sweet, sad little universe;
    with just two guitars and two voices (not counting the occasional xylophone
    or piano overdub), they've taken a setup that would otherwise be used for
    Indigo Girls-style coffeehouse-folk evil and spun dreamily melancholy
    indie-pop songs from it</p><p>
<i>Holiday in Rhode Island</i> isn't exactly an ambitious artistic leap
    forward from their previous albums, but so what? As far as rainy Sunday
    morning hangover listening goes, it fits the bill perfectly. On top of a
    bed of willowy guitars, Melberg and Sbragia exhale cherry blossoms with
    every cooing sigh. Generous amounts of reverb slathered over every sound
    ensures that nothing hits harder than a hail of cottonballs, not even the
    drums that tiptoe their way through ""Me and the Bees.""</p><p>
    
    But the Softies temper all this precious prettiness from the very outset;
    the first lyrics you hear on <i>Holiday in Rhode Island</i> are, ""If I beg
    you will you smother me / Just to put me out of this constant misery,""
    followed by lines like, ""I wish I had never known/ A heart that beats just
    like my own""; ""Take it downstairs/ No one here cares""; and ""Now my empty
    arms are of no use to anyone."" The combination of happy melodies and sad
    lyrics is by no means an innovation, but lesser bands often get the balance
    between the two wrong, ending up sounding either coy or overwrought.  The
    Softies take a page from the Magnetic Fields' fakebook and sing as straight
    and as dispassionately as possible, and it works, lending an emotional
    authenticity to otherwise undistinguished lyrics.</p><p>
    
    Despite the sameness of instrumentation and mood, though, the songs don't
    all sound alike; the Softies aren't repetitive so much as consistent. Not
    all the songs here are about heartbreak or depression, either; the title
    track and ""You and Only You"" express the inverse-- love gained rather than
    lost. Is it any surprise that they sound much the same as the other songs on
    <i>Holiday in Rhode Island</i>? Perhaps the Softies understand that there
    actually isn't much of a difference between the feelings of falling into and
    out of love. It's still a sensation of falling, except on <i>Holiday in
    Rhode Island</i> it feels more like floating. And as much as the word ""nice""
    is overused, it's quite nice. Just like the Softies themselves. Nice.</p></div>"|7316.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7316-holiday-in-rhode-island/|7.4|Nick Mirov

They've worked on solving
    the difficulties inherent in performing techno live. Or performing techno
    live at arenas or festivals, anyway. The first time I saw the band play out,
    just before <i>Dubnobasswithmyheadman</i> was released, was at a twisted
    club called the Soundshaft, which adjoined the famous London boite, Heaven.
    That night (a Good Friday, I almost recall), the owners of the two clubs
    opened up the doors that partitioned the very different styles. The
    Soundshaft Drum Club techno massive shimmied and sashayed with the amyl
    house of Heaven. After a few hours of DJ sets, a band took the small,
    almost ad hoc stage, and stylistic divisions in the area immediately
    vanished.</p><p>
    
    Underworld, for it was they, performed extended versions of songs off
    <i>Dubnobasswithmyheadman</i>, liquidly morphing from ""Mmm Skyscraper,
    I Love You"" and ""Rez"" to ""Cowgirl"" and ""Dirty Epic."" I didn't know any
    of these classics at the time, but after a two-hour set and having been
    a part of the euphoria this band concocted, they became my most precious
    band.</p><p>
    
    And rarely have they, in the years since that club gig, disappointed. I
    saw them perform before <i>Second Toughest in the Infants</i> saw
    release. Their set at the mid-sized Astoria mixed the familiar sounds
    of <i>Dubno</i> with the breakbeats the band had been experimenting with for
    the album. That set sounded like evolution, and the audience participated
    in the rolling out of the new style Underworld.</p><p>
<i>Everything, Everything</i> documents the live stage that followed
    breakbeat Underworld. <i>Beaucoup Fish</i> hinted at trance and electro,
    but depicted a more melancholy Underworld. <i>Beaucoup Fish</i>
    recapitulated the styles of its predecessors but struck them through
    with a palpable mourning.  That Darren Emerson-- the member who took
    them from third on the bill opening for the Eurythmics to dance music
    icons-- would leave the band after that album, and their largest U.S.
    reception to date makes it all the more poignant.</p><p>
    
    Though <i>Everything, Everything</i> is unquestionably a swan song for
    the Emerson years, it's far from a mopey affair. In fact, it tackles
    early tracks like ""Rez"" and ""Cowgirl,"" and pumps them up with megawatt
    power. It also serves as a greatest hits package, including their most
    famed numbers, ""Pearl's Girl"" and ""Push Upstairs,"" among others.</p><p>
    
    Vocalist Karl Hyde predictably reserves his loudest delivery for the
    ""Shouting Lager! Lager! Lager!"" line in the 12-minute, bone-buckling
    rendition of ""Born Slippy Nuxx.""  But as with all live albums, one
    misses the being-there. Sure, <i>Everything, Everything</i> documents
    the crowd's loopy joy when the piano vamps of ""King of Snake"" break
    though the filthy Giorgio Moroder-inspired bass line. But we miss the
    visuals.</p><p>
    
    The sine qua non component of Underworld is Tomato, the experimental
    graphic design firm of which Hyde and Smith are members. The cut-up,
    scraggly, ugly beauty of Tomato's type solutions are matched and
    amplified in Hyde's Byron Gisin-ish lyrics (e.g. ""Got my 501s freeze-
    dried with a new religion"").  Underworld are aware of the significant
    piece missing from <i>Everything, Everything</i> and will soon release
    a DVD version, which will insert Tomato into the live document.  Looks
    like these lads really have thought of everything.</p></div>"|8348.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8348-everything-everything/|7.7|Paul Cooper

Each is capable of crafting subtle music that's not afraid to be warm and pretty, but they shade the tender melodies and hints of violence and loss. With now-familiar techniques like malfunctioning technology (Neina's Oval-style glitch is the sound of the digital world colliding with nature) and clipped vocal fragments (Takemura's ""Kepler"" traps Tsuyuko's innocent voice inside a machine), the pretty music becomes something more complex.</p>
<p>Susumu Yokota made his name in Japan as a House DJ and producer, and this functional background could explain why his ambient music is the most outwardly ""pleasant"" of the artists mentioned above. <i>Sakura</i> is his latest home-listening entry, a placid display of slow, careful movement with a few unexpected twists.</p>
<p>Much of this album features Yokota's dreamy, processed guitar as a distinctive sound tool. On the lush, cascading ""Saku"" and ""Tobiume"" he drowns the electric strings in reverb, and the plucked melodies are hard to trace to their source. The faint guitar melodies work well against the synthetic drones, offering a subtly percussive counterpoint to the electronic tapestry. On ""Genshi,"" Yokota pulls out his this-old-House tools, wielding a gentle, steady kickdrum and shimmering high-hat to push along a gurgling guitar pattern reminiscent of Manual Göttsching. Adding further variation to the six-string texture, ""Hagoromo"" loops an acoustic guitar pattern to hypnotic effect.</p>
<p>Despite its use in the above tracks, this is by no means a ""guitar album,"" not even in the Fripp &amp; Eno sense of the word. Each of the elements, the guitars, the occasional beats, the vocal samples (heartbreaking on ""Azukiio No Kaori,"" which reminds me of Nobukazu Takemura's amazing remix of ""Proverb"" on <i>Reich Remixed</i>) and the flowing synthesizers, are used to further the dreamy, contemplative mood. There are a few missteps, most notable the oddly jazzy ""Naminote,"" which seems to strive for Amon Tobin territory but mucks up the flow of the album considerably. Still, this is a worthy artifact from what seems to be an incredibly fertile scene.</p></div>"|8874.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8874-sakura/|8.4|Mark Richard-San

    the past, they have a wonderfully selective memory. They move through
    classic rock, prog and Krautrock and then hop directly to new wave,
    leapfrogging over the naive simplicity of punk.  By virtue of the
    churches where they worship, Trans Am make the listener confront his
    or her own musical prejudices.  To fully appreciate Trans Am, you must
    concede that there's nothing inherently terrible about Led Zeppelin or
    Thin Lizzy; all that's required is for you to hear this band in a way
    that either ignores or pokes fun at the horrible specter of classic
    rock radio. Which brings up the second great thing about Trans Am:
    their killer sense of humor, even more impressive considering 90% of
    their music is instrumental. The laughs stem from both the great song
    titles, and from a purely musical source: those quirky, unusual glimpses
    of misunderstood genres.</p><p>
    
    As befits a band so devoted to pre-CD rock, Trans Am's albums have
    always been designed with vinyl in mind (each side of the <i>Surrender
    to the Night</i> LP artfully spiraled into a noisy locked groove).
    And though the 73-minute <i>The Red Line</i> is packaged as a single CD,
    it serves as Trans Am's first real double album.</p><p>
    
    We're all tired of bloated CDs where one song is needlessly piled atop
    another simply to flesh out running time.  But the brilliantly sequenced
    <i>The Red Line</i> is something different altogether. This is the double
    LP done right, with bizarre interludes, lengthy experiments and direct 
    statements that serve as punctuation.</p><p>
    
    I dare say <i>The Red Line</i> makes better use of its running time than
    any long album since the Olivia Tremor Control's <i>Black Foliage</i>.
    And like OTC's masterpiece, there seems to be an overriding concept here.
    I've heard that the title refers to a Metro line, and that the album is
    meant to be taken as a ""musical journey"" (to quote Larry Mullen Jr.) of
    sorts. If that's true, it's a bit of a circular trip-- one that shuttles
    you to the outskirts of rock's proving grounds and then drops you back
    home, dazed, confused and happy.</p><p>
    
    The trip begins with a shimmering, train-like synth on the brief ""Let's
    Take the Fresh Step Together."" This leads to ""I Want It All,"" a crunching
    tune with Moog and vocoder that ranks among Trans Am's catchiest pop songs
    yet.  And that's no mean feat considering the entire melody consists of two
    notes.  ""Casual Friday"" is a short transition consisting of nothing but the
    sound of pounding, tribal drums (a recurring motif on <i>The Red Line</i>).
    Meanwhile, ""Polizei (Zu Spat)"" is dense, oscillating Krautrock that beats
    Add N to X at their own game.</p><p>
    
    There's a slight dip in quality in the next few tracks, but ""For Now and
    Forever"" contains some pretty backwards guitar feedback that almost sounds
    like bagpipes. ""Play in the Summer"" is definitely the early album highlight,
    a punishing blast of rhythmic rock distantly related to Zeppelin's ""The
    Immigrant Song."" ""Play in the Summer"" is also notable for a straightforward
    melody sung without vocal processing, a new wrinkle Trans Am explores
    throughout this record.  But it's ""Where Do You Want to Fuck Today"" that
    offers the first peek into Trans Am's newfound interest in ambient
    electronics: it consists of a keyboard drone, a chorus of whispering voices,
    and glitchy digital percussion.</p><p>
    
    ""I'm Coming Down"" is the next plateau, featuring ominous guitars processed to
    sound like synthesizers churning beneath a gothic vocal melody (again,
    delivered sans processing), like something off Depeche Mode's <i>Black
    Celebration</i>.  And on its heels come <i>The Red Line</i>'s longest cut,
    the nine-minute instrumental centerpiece, ""The Dark Gift."" It begins with a
    stately acoustic guitar and morphs into a folk-rock groove before building in
    intensity and busting into full-throttle rock mode; as it reaches the breaking
    point, ""The Dark Gift"" slowly cools into a dazzling roller-rink synthesizer
    coda. It's like the essence of all Trans Am distilled into one epic song.</p><p>
    
    After that, the group offers fine slabs of Pan Sonic-style digital squirm
    (""Talk You All Tight"") and a bit of shoegazing (the lovely ""Slow Response"")
    before returning us home with ""Shady Groove,"" a track which reprises the
    opening synth drone before building steam and cutting off just prior to
    climax.</p><p>
    
    Though Trans Am once seemed a band that ping-ponged between two distinct
    musical personalities, they come into their own as a band that's mastered a
    dozen on <i>The Red Line</i>. Even better, this time it's hard to tell
    where one ends and another begins.</p></div>"|8136.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8136-the-red-line/|8.7|Mark Richard-San

    Eleventh Dream Day opening for Thrill Jockey label mates Tortoise. All
    the look-alike post-rock Tortoise followers, sporting the fluorescent
    rave garb and matching backpacks seemed genuinely flummoxed by the band.
    As these grizzled, perennially underrated veterans roared through an
    uptempo rocker, frontman Rick Rizzo laid into his guitar strings for an
    eyebrow-singeing solo. My girlfriend at the time, senses previously
    dulled by hours of French techno, exclaimed, ""Wow, this is rock 'n'
    roll!""</p><p>
    
    Yes, for all those kids brainwashed by the hi-tech hijinx of late-'90s
    Pro Tools-manufactured and sonar blip-rock, Eleventh Dream Day must have
    sounded pretty anachronistic. After all, they're veritable alt-rock
    dinosaurs: along with Sonic Youth, and Yo La Tengo, Eleventh Dream Day
    are one of the precious few surviving bands from that mid-to-late '80s
    pre-grunge milieu of college-rock ruled by long-expired bands like the
    Godfathers, the Blasters, the Replacements and the Feelies. Hey, that's
    way back when Kurt Cobain was still a roadie. Yep, this was before youth
    culture embraced Tony Bennett, and before ""alternative"" became a
    media-whore buzzword to mean ""anything except Boyz II Men.""</p><p>
    
    To his credit, math-whiz John McEntire does an agreeable production job
    on <i>Stalled Parade</i>. And granted, it would be kinda difficult to
    turn Eleventh Dream Day into Gastr del Sol or Tortoise. Luckily McEntire
    hasn't really disciplined Rizzo's disobedient guitar all that much.</p><p>
    
    As on 1997's McEntire-produced <i>Eighth</i>, Eleventh Dream Day seems
    more concerned with texture and atmosphere than song form and melody.
    Which is fine, but as a result, they never quite rock with the kind of
    manic intensity they did on earlier efforts like 1990's <i>Beet</i> and
    1991's <i>Lived to Tell</i>. Those early Atlantic recordings, as
    under-produced and shoddy as they often were, held some of the finest and
    most overlooked guitar moments of the decade. And featured, arguably, the
    best male/female vocal interplay in rock since X.</p><p>
    
    The title track and opener, probably the album's high point, fades in with
    a dramatic flood tide of distortion engulfing the rhythm section. Its slow
    dirge-friendly pace sets off, with Bean and Rizzo's distanced, ghostly
    vocal tracks making for some eerie but beautiful synchronized singing:
    ""Save yourself,"" they urge, ""'Cause you might save me.""</p><p>
    
    And possibly taking a cue from their more successful cousins, Yo La Tengo,
    Rizzo and company are beginning to write songs showcasing the blond chick
    singer with the angelic voice-- the one who also happens to be the drummer.
    In this case, it's Janet Beveridge Bean, sounding like a proper No Depression
    alterna-country gal on ""Valrico74."" She's paid her dues singing in Freakwater
    for the past few years, so she's certainly earned her place in front of the
    mic.</p><p>
    
    ""Ice Storm"" and ""Interstate,"" more than anything else on <i>Stalled Parade</i>,
    are fairly standard Dream Day numbers. Rizzo's Neil Young-meets-Tom Verlaine
    guitar heroism is still in evidence, especially on ""In the Style Of...""
    giving a sampling of the swarm of angry hornets he's capable of conjuring
    from his axe when inspired. McEntire himself adds some droning keyboard that
    fits in well enough, mainly because it's barely conspicuous much of the time.
    Although on Bean's near-perfect vocal number, the sparse, mid-tempo ""Bite the
    Hand,"" McEntire's keyboard sounds like a chainsaw slicing through sheet metal,
    and explodes into a needless frenzy towards the end.</p><p>
    
    The Thrill Jockey-era Eleventh Dream Day has, unfortunately, lost some of
    its songwriting focus at the expense of tinkering with their overall
    sound-- mainly under the pretense of some sort of progress, I'm guessing.
    Yet, they still can't approach the awesome combination of squalling guitar
    rock tempered with pristine Pretenders-worthy melodies, and simply great
    songwriting on 1993's <i>El Moodio</i>.</p><p>
    
    Eleventh Dream Day seem caught between Rizzo's irrepressible instincts for
    <i>Live Rust</i>-style garage-rock and a gradual shift to a more advanced,
    studio-processed sound. Creeping towards a slightly more experimental sonic
    philosophy has, I suppose, become necessary for a profitable existence
    amongst all the Tortoises and Trans Ams.  This somewhat ""new"" direction is
    refreshing in some respects, and it may even help attract a larger, more

In spite of
    it all, I like Bettie Serveert.  When I say ""it all,"" I'm referring to the
    banal rock drums, the overused pop hooks, and the cute, ""light,"" lyrics that
    are almost too appropriately executed by a charming Dutch tomboy vocalist.
    Carol Van Dijk's (no, her name isn't Bettie) appeal has always been her
    ability to load her vocals with palatable sentiment.  They ooze with earnest
    spunk, comfortably shallow yearning, and a naïve idealism rarely present in
    American rock n' roll-- complete with a sincerity that might be harder to
    stomach coming from this side of the Atlantic.  I can't explain why this
    nostalgic pop cocktail doesn't make me puke.</p><p>
    In fact, Bettie Serveert usually makes me smile.  I'm convinced that the
    whole ""Dutch"" thing is a cover to stave off questions.  They claim that
    their first three albums were imported from the Netherlands by Matador.
    But don't be fooled; Bettie Serveert were shipped in from one of those
    daydreams where everything is okay.  In this daydream-- or rather ""the
    Netherlands""-- rock bands still have fun playing simple songs that tell
    modest stories.  Mentions of the Alesis SR16 or Roland 808 meet quizzical
    faces as the people here have only heard of <i>real</i> drums.  And the
    bands are capable of writing songs with jangle-guitar hooks sticky enough
    to linger after the snap-back into the land of taxes, face-lifts, and
    MTV.  Every once in a while, that's enough.  But most of the time, I'd
    rather invest my money and time in bands producing more creative and
    challenging material.</p><p>
    To be blunt, one is enough.  When it comes to the Serveert Catalog,
    the completist plays the fool, and this one has just confessed her sins
    so that others can learn from her dirty example.  If you're going to
    pick one, put your money down on the now classic 1992 debut,
    <i>Palomine</i>.  From the dreamy questions posed in the title track
    to the perfectly heart-warming head-bobber, ""Tom Boy,"" <i>Palomine</i>
    is considerably stronger than <i>Lamprey</i> or <i>Dust Bunnies</i>,
    which are stylistically similar, yet lacks the ""kid sister you never
    had in a jewel-box"" quality.</p><p>
    However, <i>Private Suit</i> shows the band taking some risks.  They
    continue to write catchy and cute guitar rock songs, but also experiment
    with backing vocals and strings, a noble ambition that raises the bar
    higher than ""the little band that could"" is able to reach.  Satisfied
    is a dark track with lyrics like, ""Callous on the soul/ There's a tale
    untold/ About how you spend your life/ In a place where no one goes.""
    Just when it becomes clear that Bettie Serveert are treading on
    territory best left to... well, anyone else, the song laughably
    breaks down when it ""breaks it down"" into a funky counterpoint that
    sounds exactly like part of the Lovin' Spoonful's  ""Summer in the
    City.""</p><p>
    The title track wears a serious hat, too; with lyrics like, ""We're half
    seas over/ In a nostalgic mood.../ But on top of everything, it sounds
    absurd/ That I tried to fit my life into a word/ And it still turned out
    the same.""  For a brief moment, the resigned tone of the lyrics marks a
    reflexive maturity, but then the song lapses into depressing nostalgia
    as the chords-- almost a decade later-- retrace those of <i>Palomine</i>.
    The tired progressions don't know any other way, yet they must be
    aware of their own shame as they're loosely disguised with fluttering
    strings and slightly different timing.</p><p>
    ""White Tales"" unfortunately sounds ""very Natalie Merchant.""  As in,
    ""Now why can't we stay here for a why-ee-eye-ee-eye-ee-ile/
    Why-ee-eye-ee-eye-ee-ile,"" and later, ""I never felt this way
    before-ee-or-ee-ore.""  So, the self-aware nostalgia for naïve American
    rock songs has evolved into a naïve nostalgia for marketing-savvy
    American trash, starting with Natalie Merchant and moving on to the
    last dance craze you want your daydreams or little sisters to take
    part in:</p><p>
<i>""Don't just stand there, let's get to it<br/>
    Strike a pose, there's nothing to it<br/>
    Vogue, vogue""</i></p><p>
    Keep the style and pacing, but replace the lyrics of Madonna's cultural
    phenomena with ""Forget about your weakness/ Forget about your pride/
    Everybody is sane on the innocent side,"" and you have the conclusion of
    ""Healer,"" <i>Private Suit</i>'s finale.  I'm doing that modified funky-
    chicken dance to it right now and crying.  Listening to this album is
    so far from that innocent guitar-rock daydream-- the one that made me
    like Bettie Serveert in the first place.  But I guess that's what
    happens to a band that refuses to wake up.  Speaking of which, Bettie
    Serveert open for Counting Crows and Live this October.</p></div>"|673.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/673-private-suit/|4.9|Kristin Sage Rockermann

Well, that all depends. If you're Thom Yorke, you
    shatter expectations by burning the rulebook and creating something completely unique and groundbreaking.
    If you're Kevin Shields, you become a fucking hermit.  And, apparently, if you're Stephin Merritt, you
    don't.  Since the release of 1999's critic's darling, <i>69 Love Songs</i>, Merritt has revived two of
    his side projects-- the 6ths and Future Bible Heroes-- thus, providing him with the opportunity to
    release an abundance of material without actually facing the dreaded follow-up to his three-disc box.</p><p>
    
    While Future Bible Heroes provided Merritt with a songwriting collaborator, the 6ths consists of a
    motley crew of guest vocalists covering a batch of all-new Merritt tunes. And, like 1995's <i>Wasps'
    Nest</i>, <i>Hyacinths and Thistles</i> seems to be in keeping with Merritt's musical style du jour.
    Whereas <i>Wasps' Nest</i> contained brilliant synth-pop gems much in keeping with <i>The Charm of
    the Highway Strip</i>'s better tracks, <i>Hyacinths and Thistles</i> contains more organic material
    reminiscent of <i>69 Love Songs</i>, along with the occasional synth-driven throwback.  But the
    biggest difference between the two 6ths records is obvious: <i>Wasps' Nest</i> allowed some of indie
    rock's finest vocalists to lend their talents to a grade-a batch of Merritt tunes; <i>Hyacinths and
    Thistles</i> pairs remarkably average Merritt songs with largely substandard vocalists.</p><p>
    
    The record kicks off with ""As You Turn to Go,"" a run-of-the-mill, baroque Merritt ballad, with fellow
    synth-pop purveyor Momus providing vocals. Aside from the addition of a British accent and a few added
    notes in the upper register, Momus and Merritt are virtually indistinguishable from one another.  But
    like Puffy Combs attempting the resurrection of ""Kashmir"" with Jimmy Page on guitar, it's a long way
    off from the real thing.</p><p>
    
    But while ""As You Turn to Go"" is far from brilliant, the worst of <i>Hyacinths and Thistles</i> is
    about as much fun as a glass shard enema administered by a spastic mental patient. Melanie's rendition
    of ""I've Got New York"" is the sound of an alcoholic grandmother picking warts off her feet.  As her
    voice twists and grates, you can't help but wonder what exactly Merritt was thinking when he asked for
    her ""help"" with his record.  Why choose a 1970s flash-in-the-pan over Low's Mimi Parker, Stereolab's
    Laetitia Sadier or Movietone's Rachel Brook?  Jesus, even Ana Voog would be better suited!</p><p>
    
    Bob Mould offers up another awkward moment on the ballad, ""He Didn't,"" a song that fits Mould about
    as well as leopard-print spandex.  Admittedly, his discomfort is somewhat endearing for a few brief
    moments, but it's not the kind of thing that makes for repeated listens.  But the album's nadir
    comes with the album's mind-numbing closer, ""Oahu,"" which ends with a synthesizer looping the same
    few bars for nearly 10 minutes.</p><p>
    
    But despite its glaring flaws (Gary Numan among them), <i>Hyacinths and Thistles</i> is still graced
    by the inherent decency of Stephin Merritt's songwriting.  His witty take on life and love, while
    dampened by the lack of his trademark delivery, is still present.  Besides, there are only so many
    side projects Merritt can toss off before the next true Magnetic Fields record is released.  Maybe
    after one more Gothic Archies album, Merritt's fans will finally get what they deserve.</p></div>"|7214.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7214-hyacinths-and-thistles/|6.0|Matt LeMay

    band Whiskeytown, is from North Carolina. As chance has it, I happen to be
    from North Carolina, too.  Adams hails from a city you've probably never
    heard of, a little pit-stop on the way to the beach called Jacksonville.
    I've lived most of my life in a tin-shack of a town called Lumberton, only
    two hours from Jacksonville by highway. Both towns are small geographical
    afterthoughts, and about as ""southern"" as any place you're likely to find
    in modern-day America.</p><p>
    You have to understand, ""southern"" no longer means cotton fields, plantations
    and beautiful belles waiting to escort you to Big Daddy's formal ball. Still,
    despite all the changes history has brought us, three things remain true about
    the south:</p><p>
    1) It's boring here. There's nothing to do, nowhere to go.<br/>
    2) The south is beautiful, all small towns and miles of lush, green fields.<br/>
    3) It's where all the good music you've ever heard was born. Soul, rock,
    country, blues, all of 'em from south of the Mason-Dixon line.</p><p>
    In the south, the good music is like sunshine-- you just can't escape it.
    This is the place Ryan Adams and I both call home-- this boring, but melodic,
    pit of despair. So is it any wonder that Adams, a young man of only 27 years,
    is able to craft an album as stark and as enjoyably bleak as <i>Heartbreaker</i>?</p><p>
    Singing in a voice that's just filthy with despair, Adams delivers his first
    solo album with the practiced swagger and genuine hurt of a veteran country
    crooner. A startling 15-song masterpiece, <i>Heartbreaker</i> is a drinker's
    album, an ode to sadness that deals exclusively with all the dark and dirty
    corners of the human heart. It's music written in the language of loneliness,
    depression, and, above all, heartbreak, in all its varied forms.  And it
    makes perfect sense that this should be Adams' first solo album, as-- aside
    from a couple of notable collaborations-- the material here is far too
    personal and focused to have been produced by anything but one man with one
    soul.</p><p>
<i>Heartbreaker</i> shows Ryan Adams sweeping all of the clichés of mass-
    produced, ""new country"" under the rug and tapping into everything that makes
    genuine country music unique and beautiful: raw emotion, deep groove and
    clever storytelling.  There are no simple, melodramatic, commercial-ready
    ballads here; the music is too deeply rooted in old-school country music,
    folk-rock songs and bluegrass jams to produce anything that predictable. With
    that musical philosophy firmly in place, it stands to reason that each track
    on the album is a gem, showcasing Adams' considerable songwriting ability and
    a way with words that most musicians would sell their spines to possess.</p><p>
    The record begins with the misleadingly upbeat ""To Be Young (Is to Be Sad, Is
    to Be High),"" a swinging bluegrass number that wouldn't sound out of place
    in a honky-tonk. But Adams gets to the business of bringing us down soon
    enough. When Adams sings, ""I just want to die without you,"" on ""Call Me on
    Your Way Back Home,"" orphans run out into the street and weep. For ""Damn,
    Sam (I Love a Woman That Rains),"" Adams calls on the patron saints of sparse
    folk music and lyrical tomfoolery while channeling the troubadour vocals of
    early Bob Dylan to produce one of <i>Heartbreaker</i>'s lighter, but better,
    tracks. Still, even this stylistic similarity is superficial, as the blood-
    and-guts of the song are all his own.</p><p>
    Adams continues his winning streak by making great use of a rare cameo by
    country-rock legend Emmylou Harris on ""Oh My Sweet Carolina,"" as Harris'
    trademark falsetto blends beautifully with Adams' own rich vocals for a
    simple, affecting song about one man's longing to return home. ""Come Pick Me
    Up,"" a track about a man struggling with a bad relationship and pining for his
    cheating girlfriend weighs in as the album's most affecting moment.  Gluing
    crushing lyrics to undeniably catchy drum riffs, greasy guitar work and
    soulful harmonica playing, the song is five minutes and thirteen seconds of
    damn near perfect music.</p><p>
    There's nothing terribly complex or tricky about <i>Heartbreaker</i>. In fact,
    it's probably one of the simplest, most straightforward albums you'll hear all
    year. But this album wasn't written to be complex. It isn't electronica designed
    to tickle your cerebral cortex.  It isn't music to figure out.  It's music to
    feel to.  It's music to drink alone to.  And it's sadder than witnessing your
    grandmother's burial.</p><p>
<i>Heartbreaker</i> is the soundtrack to the last ten minutes of any relationship
    you've ever watched crumble before your eyes.  It's music for the ruined romantic
    in all of us. Usually, that little romantic simply sits quietly, tearfully
    watching everything disappear without so much as a single complaint.  But on
    <i>Heartbreaker</i>, Ryan Adams has not only convinced that voice to speak,
    he's taught it to sing.  The result is an album of astonishing musical
    proficiency, complete honesty and severe beauty.</p></div>"|36.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/36-heartbreaker/|9.0|Steven Byrd

    outside opinion. ""An attorney who acts as his own defense,"" goes the old
    saying, ""has a fool for a client.""  The same goes for bands.  Generally
    speaking, it's not such a hot idea for a group-- especially a young group
    still feeling out a sonic identity and songwriting style-- to produce its
    own album.</p><p>
    Enter the producer. Ah, yes, the <i>producer</i>, that enigmatic specter
    behind the crisp boom-boom-tap, the wicked guitar skronk, and the
    buttery-smooth fade-out.  The producer is usually conceptualized as either
    the antagonist attempting to impose his serpentine Svengali will on the
    naïve genius of the hapless band members, or as a fix-all mercenary
    commissioned to make wine from water.  But though these scenarios clearly do
    occur from time to time, independent bands generally choose someone that
    sees their grand vision.  The idea, of course, is that the producer, with
    the band's best interests in mind, will set them on the path towards
    self-realization and help them to exhaust their potential. This is a good
    thing.</p><p>
<i>Com Plex</i> is not such a good thing, though, in fairness, it isn't quite
    terrible.  It aptly showcases Benjamin Weikel and Brandon Summer's respectable
    songwriting skills, though it's more an exhibition of potential than something
    you'd want to rush out and buy.  Sadly, like the self-advocating lawyer, it's
    an ambitious performance doomed from the start by a lack of perspective.</p><p>
    The opening track, ""Stracenska 612,"" sets the bar a little too high for the
    eight songs that follow. Raspy guitar feedback, clean, reverbed guitar lines,
    suggestive, ghostly whispering, and beautiful keyboard sequences braid into
    one another, making for a truly blissful six minutes.  What follows begins
    to steer things toward the recipe for disaster spelled out in the Helio
    Sequence's press release: ""the band is a unique blend of Beatles-esque melodies
    crossed with My Bloody Valentine's wall of sound noise layering."" Hmm.  Uh,
    sure.  Equal parts.  Lennon/McCartney and <i>Loveless</i>. Right.</p><p>
    Whatever Helio Sequence is, timid they're not. ""Just Mary Jane (Calypso)"" is
    the first of many embarrassing moments on <i>Com Plex</i>, wherein the boys
    reveal how much they long to be the Beatles.  And at times, it can be almost
    endearing to hear the boys incorporate lyrics like, ""Lucy's lost diamonds.""
    Okay, that's a lie.  Musically, though, they're still on solid ground.</p><p>
    Until song three. ""Transistor Radio"" mixes a hackneyed attempt at
    <i>Revolver</i>-era Beatles with modern British psychedelia. To his credit,
    Brandon Summer's voice sounds as close to John Lennon's as could be hoped for
    from a guy from Beaverton, Portland.  ""My Heart,"" on the other hand, is far
    more successful. Beatles-esque flourishes (well...) are filtered through that
    liquid, delay-heavy production they likened to My Bloody Valentine. But
    ""Sassafras"" attempts the same with shoddier results, coming off like some
    Bono-esque hybrid of Duran Duran and the Swirlies.  Still, it's not a bad
    place for these guys to start-- they'll come around.</p><p>
<i>Com Plex</i>'s crowning moment comes two tracks later when the Helio
    Sequence lean heavily on the stretchy membrane of Unnecessary with a cover
    of an old classic by-- take a guess, go on-- yes, the Beatles! ""Tomorrow Never
    Knows,"" to be specific. Though comparably as vital to the world as the Egg-Wave
    or unsold Power Rangers merchandise, I suppose they do a fair enough job of
    it.  But, again, why?</p><p>
    ""Big Jet Sky"" is the second-to-last track and a final chance for the boys to
    play a breathtaking round of ""how sincere can we be before it becomes
    self-parody, and how self-parodic can we be until it comes around to sincerity
    again?""  Take in a deep breath, and then these lines:  ""Now is the time to
    make up your mind/ Now is the time to break these ties/ Now is the time to
    shut things down/ Now is the time to shut things down."" Ringo!  Ringo, wake
    up!</p><p>
    The finale, ""Demographics,"" is <i>Com Plex</i>'s second best track after the
    opener, situating their best material like bookends.  And you know what?
    These guys can actually write a nice tune when they put forth the effort.
    Their production skills are pretty impressive, too, considering they recorded
    this album by night, in the one-room music store at which they were employed.
    <i>Com Plex</i>'s two standout cuts are beautiful, heavily electronic,
    space-pop, which will hopefully be the focus of future releases.  Assuming
    they bury their Beatles record next time out, I'll be the first in line to
    hear what they've come up with.</p></div>"|3804.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3804-com-plex/|6.6|Camilo Arturo Leslie

    animatronic Wild West saloon, with the Pinetop Seven's <i>Bringing Home the
    Last Great Strike</i> stuck on a perpetual loop. We'll be nothing but a
    kickline, a poker game, and a roomful of hard luck stories. Everything will
    be dusty. The anachronisms will be lost on our descendents. We'll have been
    an empire of cowboys. It's not such a bad obituary.</p><p>
<i>Bringing Home the Last Great Strike</i> would definitely not count as
    insurgent country; there isn't a punk bone in its body. It's an incredible
    line-up of bruised and tired music where folk, bluegrass, Louisville
    post-rock, Eastern music and electronics all drink side by side. As pristine
    and complex as the arrangements sound, the album's been kicked around and
    beaten up. Brimming with unglamorous stories of circus freaks, drifters,
    stranglers, ghosts, and drunks, Pinetop Seven have crafted a rich, melancholy
    work of music for the unemployable.</p><p>
    
    And vocalist/lyricist/multi-instrumentalist Darren Richard seems to play
    barkeep to the whole lot of them, telling their stories as if he'd eavesdropped
    on them, sometimes even assuming the voice of their own confessionals. The
    record store guy warned me about the vocals: too white, too nasally, too
    haunted, he said. But in truth, I've come to adore them; a dire, warbling
    falsetto somewhere between Jeff Magnum, Jeff Buckley and Jeremy Enigk. The
    bizarre instrumentation and languid arrangements lend the music an almost
    timeless quality, drawing you in while the searching vocals repel. You may
    come to love them as I have but many will be discouraged. After all, they're
    quite white, nasally, and irremediably haunted. Fair warning, in any case.</p><p>
    
    The introductory fanfare, ""As the Mutiny Sleeps,"" is a somber homage to the
    Band's ""Theme from the Last Waltz,"" twittering with bells and glockenspiel
    while a muted trumpet whimpers and dour clarinet calls the album's plodding
    approach. ""On the Last Ride In"" is a lazy, twanging tale of departure. The
    drifter's regret is a familiar theme, but Richard's evocative lyrics lend
    color and depth to the sketch: ""From under the clouds/ His father's face/
    Promising rain, rain, rain/ And all sides came crashing down."" One of the
    more traditionally instrumented tracks on <i>The Last Great Strike</i>, the
    acoustic strum melds with the soft Fender Rhodes, upright bass and distant
    violin. ""An empty trunk no longer full of all that trust,"" Darren intones as
    the music recedes.</p><p>
    
    ""A Black Eye to Be Proud Of"" is one of the record's standouts; emerging from
    electronic loops, fat vaudeville piano stomps out the melody. Darren Richard
    assumes the first-person narrative of a young man who's fallen in love with a
    whore: ""But Leah, I think that could change/ I've got money for you to teach
    me."" The narrator is a boy compared to the brothel's other clientele: ""My own
    black eye to be proud of never came/ I'm a coward still the same/ Skinny arms
    and watery eyes."" The Pinetop Seven have cited director Jim Jarmusch as an
    influence, and in ""Black Eye,"" that influence becomes apparent, rewriting the
    conventions of the unrequited love song with humor and subtle sadness.</p><p>
    
    ""Ten Thousand to Carlisle Came"" opens with an alarum of Middle Eastern horns
    and proceeds into a profoundly disturbing country-western ballad about a
    deaf-mute girl that's become a roadside attraction: ""To spite us in car loads/
    They came to see this sadness displayed."" The song's final verse is
    particularly horrific, but sung with the slight distance of the greatest
    storytellers: ""Cut the lights off/ Pull the car close/ Let the gasoline run/
    Beneath the locked door/ Throw the match down/ Let her sleep.""</p><p>
    
    ""At His Kitchen Table"" executes a rustbelt tribute to Slint's ""Breadcrumb
    Trail""; a dead, insistent guitar-lick, the blank spoken-word narrative. Vibes
    punctuate the monologue as a maelstrom of howling electronics blows beneath.
    The bored observational candor is pure Brian McMahan as Richard intones: ""A
    sound outside finally caught his attention and he looked out the window
    across the street to where a young mother was yelling.  She was yelling at
    her little boy who had found a dead bird and brought it into the house."" The
    narrative goes exactly nowhere.</p><p>
    
    Wheezing Keen-O-Tone keyboards and skillet percussions mark the final song
    with a vocal track, ""A Friend to the Minnesota Strangler,"" a sketch of the
    relationship between a fugitive serial killer and the bird he ""kept in a hat
    box by his bed."" Richard plucks the nylon guitar strings like plucking on the
    nerves themselves in pointed, rhythmic pops.  ""The Minnesota Strangler"" fades
    into the final track, ""Buried in St. Cloud,"" a funereal procession of bass
    clarinet, flugelhorn, accordion and cello winding all stories down to their
    inevitable conclusions.</p><p>
<i>Bringing Home the Last Great Strike</i> is unique in trafficking so
    liberally in human misery without ever approaching angst. Richard deftly
    avoids every inclination to wallow in his characters' misfortunes as a cipher
    for his own, while also never deriving the kind of morbid thrill in the rustic
    bizarre like a certain sister-/mountain-fucking Kentuckian whose music is
    often strikingly parallel. <i>The Last Great Strike</i> is a jukebox anthology
    of American unhappiness. All its nostalgia seems directed toward a more
    miserable time. This, in the end, seems to be the West worth remembering.</p></div>"|6305.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6305-bringing-home-the-last-great-strike/|8.9|Brent S. Sirota

Such is the
    question posed by this edition in the series of
    at-home-with-[insert name of flavor of the month dance act] compilations,
    <i>Back to Mine</i>.  Previously, Danny Tenaglia rifled through his dustier
    boxes and tempted us with nothing too revelatory. Faithless, in the most
    recent installment, reveal that they listen to little else but Faithless
    tracks and the band members' solo efforts. But even before you press play
    on your hi-fi-- with one glance at the Chardonnay-quaffing track listing--
    you'll yawn, collapse, and curse yourself for shelling out beer money for
    such meager slurry.</p><p>
    Just how self-absorbed can Tom Findlay and Andy Cato be that they start
    with their own poo-stik acoustic rework of A Tribe Called Quest's
    ""Description of a Fool?"" Granted, they're not as solipsistic as Faithless,
    but you'd be hard-pressed not to agree that the two have long since begun
    to believe all the hype about their band.</p><p>
    From then on, all you have to do is imagine the least offensive, least
    un-Groove Armada-ish records you could hear if you were, against all the
    odds, invited back to their pad. By the way, does this compilation really
    imply that Findlay and Cato live together, like Bert and Ernie? Hmm...</p><p>
    So it is with no astonishment that track #2 is a hugely stringed Barry
    White number (""Playing Your Game, Baby""), trendily followed by some
    Mancunian hip-hop courtesy of Grand Central Records. While I'm thrilled
    to hear BBG's summery ""Snappiness,"" I can't say the same for Mica Paris'
    ""I Should've Known Better.""</p><p>
    Rather than moving out of (or getting off) their tight little box and
    spinning some psychedelic nuggets or a snippet of a Richard Strauss
    tone poem, the lads persist in flying their faker flag higher and higher.
    Al Green's less than shamanic take on ""Relight My Fire"" is as forgettable
    as the woefully Ibizan dreck that constitutes Schmoov's ""Destination
    (Beachtowel Remix).""</p><p>
    So I'm disappointed-- what did I have a right to expect? Well, seeing as
    how one of these guys is a fairly accomplished trombonist, I would have
    liked to hear at least a little Curtis Fuller, J.J. Johnson, or Kai
    Winding-- 'bone players with more soul than most of the copyist slags
    compiled here. But I'm being naïve. <i>Back to Mine: Groove Armada</i>
    is just another foot soldier in the corporate army dedicated to removing
    all that's incendiary and revolutionary about modern music. I can give
    no reason for the record's existence-- it's the equivalent of a token
    ""style"" article in an airline magazine, copies of which are kept by
    the sick bag without irony.</p><p>
    Groove Armada, judged by this compilation, are musically conservative
    and infuriating. If I ever had the fortune to be invited <i>back to
    theirs</i>, the least I'd hope to find propped up against the turntable
    would be a dog-eared copy of Gram Parsons' <i>Grievous Angel</i>. I'd
    then have a nice little chat with them about how they spent the money
    this obnoxious guff netted them.</p></div>"|3577.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3577-back-to-mine/|3.2|Paul Cooper

    is to be released on April 16, 1996 A.D. By clicking on the astronaut you can warp to my
    official Experiment Zero Countdown Page. Thank me later.""<br/>
    --Surflyer's Astro Site</i></p><p>
    
    It says something about Man or Astro-Man that, of the seven fan pages listed on the band's
    official website, three of them no longer exist, and three of them haven't updated since
    1996.  There's a reason for this.  The band released the pinnacle album of their career,
    <i>Experiment Zero</i>, that year.  After that, it seemed to become more about the packaging
    than the actual music contained within.  Star Crunch left the band, as did Dr. Delecto,
    who was replaced by Dexter X, who has also since departed.</p><p>
    
    Realizing that their members were as interchangeable as Duplo bricks, the remaining
    members of Man or Astro-Man launched their Clone Project Alpha Phase One Tour.  The
    concept was to send out three ""clone"" bands on separate tours to play the band's music
    for them.  While this gesture would be completely ineffective for any other band, Man
    or Astro-Man understood that it didn't take a genius to replicate their instrumental
    surf-rock sound verbatim.</p><p>
    
    Over the next few years, Man or Astro-Man released 1997's forgettable <i>Made from
    Technetium</i> and 1999's utterly disposable <i>EEVIAC: Operational Index &amp; Reference
    Guide</i>.  Of course, that hasn't stopped them from releasing another.  No, they're
    not letting their nine other seemingly identical full-lengths slow them down.  They
    won't be undersold!  But, hey, if nothing else, you have to give them credit for
    keeping at it.  How many other surf-styled instrumental bands have lasted eight
    years?</p><p>
    
    With two original members (Coco the Electronic Monkey Wizard, Birdstuff) and two
    surrogate guitarists (Trace Reading, Blazar the Probe Handler) intact, Man or Astro-Man
    advanced to the nearest studio to record <i>A Spectrum of Infinite Scale</i>.  Rarely
    has there been an album so seemingly mistitled; the spectrum of this band's sound has,
    until now, had all the range of a casually tossed sheet of paper.</p><p>
    
    But something's changed here.  Though the band still sticks faithfully to their trademark
    sci-fi surf gimmick, they've omitted the annoying science film samples, and actually show,
    for the first time in years, traces of creativity.  <i>A Spectrum of Infinite Scale</i>
    integrates abrupt time changes, sudden halts, and actual memorable melodies.  In fact, the
    mutation is so dramatic that it's safe to say no one has ever made surf-rock like this
    in the history of music.  Granted, it's still surf-rock, but now it comes with unexpected
    twists and turns, and moments of genuine inspiration.</p><p>
    
    When <i>A Spectrum of Infinite Scale</i> opens with a crescendoing electronic gong and a
    woofer-shattering snare/cymbal combo, followed by a synthesized orchestra submerged in
    reverb and a mammoth drum sound-- all underscored by subtle, menacing effects-- it's
    immediately apparent that this is anything but the same record they've made a million
    times since 1993. The band's new incorporation of faux-ambient electronic textures
    suggest they've grown tired of their scratchy Ventures LPs and now search for new
    territory to conquer.  And considering the sheer sonic wallop this album packs, they've
    found it in post-punk instrumental ensembles like Trans Am and Pittsburgh rockers Don
    Caballero.</p><p>
    
    Even their song titles reflect a hazy image of Don Cab, with such numbers as ""Curious
    Constructs of Stem-Like Devices Which Now Prepare Themselves to Be Thought of as Fingers,""
    ""Many Pieces of Large Fuzzy Mammals Gathered Together at a Rave and Schmoozing with a
    Brick,"" and the possibly cocaine-inspired title, ""Multi-Variational Stimuli of Sub-Turgid
    Foci Covering Cross Evaluate Techniques for Cognitive Analysis of Hypersignificant Graph
    Peaks Following Those Intersubjective Modules Having Biodegradable Seepage.""</p><p>
    
    Particularly of note is ""Within One Universe There are Millions,"" easily one of the best
    tracks of the band's repertoire.  In just under three minutes, it achieves Astro-perfection
    with head-scrambling feedback, a dizzying stop/start introduction, a killer chord
    progression, and Macintosh vocals.  The squelching ""Spectrograph Reading of the Varying
    Phantom Frequencies of Chronic, Incurable Tinnitus"" barrels out of even the tiniest
    speakers like a discharged bullet.  And ""A Simple Text File"" is the song you knew the
    future would eventually produce-- an ASCII text file written as music for a dot-matrix 
    printer.  Naturally, the sound of an ancient Apple Imagewriter II in action doesn't
    exactly make for a symphonic masterpiece, but the amount of time that went into making
    this decrepit device sing, and Albini's beautiful mic job are, at the very least,
    commendable.</p><p>
    
    Of course, in the end, this is still surf-rock, albeit a very unusual hybrid.  But it's
    nice to know that after all this time, Man or Astro-Man are finally trying to sound
    original and, perhaps most surprisingly of all, succeeding.</p></div>"|5060.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5060-a-spectrum-of-infinite-scale/|7.8|Ryan Schreiber

    out as a particular pet peeve. Granted, it was a chance to see the game's finest playing
    their best. But, as an idealistic young fan, I couldn't get over the fact that it didn't
    really matter. I couldn't bear to see players who spent the rest of the year cursing and
    beating the shit out of each other playing on the same team. Despite a few coast-related
    rivalries, the game was really just a trap for fans and their money.</p><p>
    
    At first, <i>All Most Heaven</i> struck me as not too different from the all-star game.
    The credits gracing the back of the record are a who's-who of indie recording artists,
    including Jim O'Rourke, Bill Callahan, Archer Prewitt, David Grubbs, ""recorder"" Steve
    Albini and, of course, Will Oldham. So how did Chestnut Station frontman Rian Murphy
    manage to recruit all these illustrious names for assistance on his record, including the
    notoriously feuding Grubbs and O'Rourke?  Well, not only is Murphy a big shot at Drag
    City Records, but he's also lent his production talents to artists like Edith Frost (who
    also appears on this record), the Silver Jews, and Palace Music.  Plus, this was recorded
    in Chicago, a place known for its artist collaborations.</p><p>
    
    It's a good thing, too, because it's the presence of Murphy's stellar collaborators that
    truly makes the four-song <i>All Most Heaven</i> a relatively tasty morsel. Jim O'Rourke's
    instrumental arrangements are both lush and refreshing, augmented no doubt by the amazing
    pool of players O'Rourke had to choose from. Indeed, every instrument here is played and
    arranged almost perfectly.  <i>All Most Heaven</i>'s few serious flaws lie not in
    instrumentation or production, but rather in a few songwriting missteps that prevent the
    record from approaching the sum of its contributors.</p><p>
    
    Within the first few seconds of ""Fall Again,"" a duet between Oldham and Bill Callahan, Oldham's presence is made quite clear by the
    very Oldham-ish piano arrangement, not to mention his vocals. And while the song
    may bear quite a striking resemblance to an Oldham solo tune, it lacks that inexplicable quality
    that makes him one of the great songwriters of the moment. Rarely does the song, or any of
    <i>All Most Heaven</i>, hit a sour note, but it somehow lacks the significance and emotion
    of Oldham's work. Of course, there's a good possibility that my listening has been slanted
    by the way Oldham's voice sounds on this record.  In the past, the shaky, warbling tones of Oldham's voice have given him a unique personality.  And
    at a few points, such as on the chorus of ""Song of Most,"" this holds true.
    Unfortunately, his voice seems to be lacking both the relative tonality and the emotion found on previous works.</p><p>
    
    But if <i>All Most Heaven</i> doesn't get credit for its vocals, it certainly does for its lyrics. While I
    initially thought that Oldham was just singing incoherently, a quick glance at the album's liner notes
    revealed that the line, ""Ess for da beda/ Basted ada deedle eye/ For the way to be hated/ Is
    abated audobye,"" is written exactly as spoken.  With so many painfully self-aware lyrics
    being penned these days, guttural sounds such as this are, if nothing else, a welcome change.</p><p>
    
    So perhaps my initial assessment of <i>All Most Heaven</i> was wrong. Had this truly been an
    all-star record, it would have been marketed as such. As it stands, <i>All Most Heaven</i>
    marks a very shrewd move by Rian Murphy-- with a little help from his friends, he and Will Oldham have managed
    to turn a batch of four merely average songs into an above-average record.</p></div>"|5512.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5512-all-most-heaven-ep/|6.4|Matt LeMay

Years ago, some Michigan
    salaryman decided Kellogg's Wheats were just too large to handle for an accelerating
    American culture.  Born soon were the Mini-Wheats, painted in glucose shellac for a
    still further accelerating American culture.</p><p>
    As time passed, the old culture-accelerating pedal was kept firmly to the floor, and
    before long, Americans demanded a cereal that could at least fit on a spoon or be
    poured directly into a mouth held agape.  Kelloggs' marketing department already had
    their Mini-Wheats; where could they go from there?  Consulting the office Thesaurus,
    Kellogg's thinktankers fiddled with Bantam Wheats, Lilliputian Wheats, Teeny Wheats,
    and Microscopic Wheats.  Caffeine-burned and frustrated, they finally realized they'd
    exasperated their Wheats scale decades earlier.  The marketers threw in the towel and
    went with ""Spoonsize.""  Lesson learned: consider the future before throwing adjectives
    at a product.</p><p>
    If only I'd taken more Marketing classes or gotten past page four of <i>Tony the
    Tiger Was Hunted and Killed for the Medicinal Purposes of His Ground Penis: The
    Downfall and Mis-Marketing of Kellogg's Cereal in Late 20th Century Asian Markets</i>,
    I might have learned from this modern fable in regards to my continual critical
    relation to Joan of Arc.  <i>Live in Chicago, 1999</i>, the predecessor to <i>The
    Gap</i>, struck me as ""horrible,"" ""abysmal,"" and perhaps, ""the worst record I've
    ever heard.""  How could I fail to consider another album?!</p><p>
    Yet, Tim Kinsella and Joan of Arc are back with the minimal, random <i>The Gap</i>.
    <i>Live in Chicago, 1999</i> was certainly ""abysmal,"" but that word implies a
    ""bottomless,"" ""fathomless,"" or ""infinite"" depth of horrible.  How can one proceed
    further than the infinite?  But let's skip all this classification and reification
    of ""horrible"" and cut to the chase: Joan of Arc make unlistenable faux-art records.</p><p>
    Tim Kinsella has embraced ProTools editing and David Grubbs in a similar technology/hero
    fetish as Harmony Korine with his digital camcorder and Dogme 95 directors.  Both
    jet-haired, unwashed-looking pretenders name-drop John Cassavetes and Assata Shakur--
    Kinsella in the title to <i>The Gap</i>'s brief drone instrumental, ""John Cassavetes,
    Assata Shakur, and Guy Debord Walk into a Bar...""; Korine in his tossed-off, cut-and-paste
    ""novel,"" <i>A Crackup at the Race Riots</i>-- while wrapping their hollow ideas in
    whatever formless movement currently licks the lobes of the <i>Village Voice</i>.</p><p>
    Lightweight absurdity runs throughout their work with intended irony, but true humanity
    is never injected to raise the work even a half-notch above pure absurdity.  Thus, song
    titles like ""(You) [I] Can Not See (You) [Me] as (I) [You] Can"", despite whatever in-jokes
    or winking, merely frustrate.  ""Another Brick at the Gap (Part 2)"" (there's no part one)
    and ""United Colors of the Gap"" similarly hint at satire, but offer quiet wank.  The
    silhouettes against white that comprise the record's packaging fittingly sum up its
    empty ingredients.</p><p>
    There are two discernable songs on <i>The Gap</i>-- the first and the last-- which are
    interchangeable.  Gentle, haphazard acoustic and/or clean electric guitar pickings trickle
    over rodent percussion.  With the aid of computer editing, the music's spinal matter is
    spread even thinner.  Consider it the first Free Emo record.  ""Freemo,"" if you will.  The
    scatterbrain blips and digital hum follow no pattern which would imply a floating,
    associative stream-of-consciousness concept.  But the music is being associated to
    nothing other than overused post-rock/emo clichés, and is arguably unconscious to
    begin with.</p><p>
    ""(You) [I] Can Not See (You) [Me] as (I) [You] Can"" abruptly cuts into awkward silence
    throughout.  The sound of sneakers in a dryer rumbles underneath.  Welcome to the future!
    Of music!  Somewhere in the middle of the utterly indistinguishable tracks 3 to 7, a
    lifelike police siren rises.  Perhaps Tim Kinsella realizes his crime, but it's neither
    amusing or interesting.  Jeremy Boyle, playing the ""Computer,"" erodes each track into
    near nothingness, which is frankly a step up from the previous record.  Kinsella's lyrics
    remain refreshingly absent for the most part.</p><p>
    Joan of Arc comprise a tiny, relatively new niche in underground music.  A so-called ""art
    band"" on a disrespected, bleached, college-boy pop label that impresses few <i>Wire</i>
    subscribers, the Arc will never shake their whiny emo roots.  Nor do they deserve to.
    Kinsella might remain the token ""difficult"" artist in the indie pop collection of
    University students, but Joan of Arc are as Chicago, low-class, unknown, and unappetizing
    as Green River cola.  <i>The Gap</i> will be their Spoonsize Horrible album.</p></div>"|4270.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4270-the-gap/|1.9|Brent DiCrescenzo

    pretty damned hard on it. What I didn't let on in that review was the fact that I, like
    so many of those who later wrote me to tell me that I ""fucking suck,"" experienced an
    extended tenure as a GBV fanatic. For years, I spent a good chunk of my spare cash on
    the band's releases, swallowing up pretty much everything from their early LPs to <i>Mag
    Earwhig!</i></p><p>
    
    And then things started to fall apart. <i>Kid Marine</i> was the first undeniable sign that
    all was not well in Dayton, Ohio. For perhaps the first time ever, Pollard struggled to find
    a catchy melody, instead tossing off an entire full-length of uninspired basement jams. Still,
    I eagerly anticipated <i>Do the Collapse</i>. Unlike many, I was intrigued by the concept of
    a fully produced Guided by Voices album. Unfortunately, the record was <i>not</i> a fully
    produced Guided by Voices album-- it wasn't a Guided by Voices album at all.</p><p>
    
    I dare anybody to disagree that a glossy studio album with songs like ""Motor Away"", ""Gold Star
    for Robot Boy"", and ""Smothered in Hugs"" wouldn't go down in the rock annals as timeless.  The
    arena rock hooks in those tracks would have lent themselves perfectly to clean, reverb-drenched
    studio treatment. But instead of upping the ante and rocking out, <i>Do the Collapse</i> wound
    up limp, closer in nature to a collection of 80s monster ballads than any of their preceding
    efforts.</p><p>
    
    Perhaps sensing the relative level of disappointment attached to the new material, Bob Pollard
    has now released <i>Suitcase</i>, a multi-decade-spanning collection of 100 alternate versions,
    album outtakes, and other unreleased material. Though the majority of the songs in this
    four-disc box set have never seen formal release, many of them will be familiar to fanatics.
    An alternate version of the excellent ""Ha Ha Man"" appeared on <i>Tonics and Twisted Chasers</i>,
    a fanclub-only release from a few years back. ""James Riot"" has been a staple of the band's live
    shows for years that has cemented itself as a fan favorite and a song title for all true
    obsessives to blurt out during shows.</p><p>
    
    The alternate version of ""Buzzards and Dreadful Crows"", as well as an alternate take of ""Damn
    Good Mr. Jam"", both appeared as brief soundbytes on <i>Propeller</i>'s ""Back to Saturn X Radio
    Report"".  And much of the material on <i>Suitcase</i> is the stuff of GBV legends, including a
    track taken from the famed <i>Power of Suck</i> concept LP, originally to be recorded with
    Kim Deal and Jim Greer.</p><p>
    
    The material on <i>Suitcase</i> ranges from ""Little Jimmy the Giant"", a 1974 Pollard solo
    track, to early-90s Pollard/Sprout collaborations such as ""Mr. Japan"", to 1998's ""Shrine to
    the Dynamic Years (Athens Time Change Riot)"", which features current Guided by Voices guitarist
    Doug Gillard and ex-Breeders drummer Jim MacPherson.  But despite the vast amount of time
    covered, every track on <i>Suitcase</i> is decidedly a Bob Pollard song. With titles like
    ""Invest in British Steel"" and ""My Feet's Trustworthy Existence"", Pollard's trademark oddball
    lyrics are in prime form here. And amazingly, so is his songwriting.</p><p>
<i>Suitcase</i> is crammed with classic Pollard moments-- those unique occasions where
    poorly recorded, sloppily delivered songs somehow become transcendent pop genius. It's
    moments like this that have made Pollard the veritable indie rock icon he is today, and
    the severe lack of moments like this that have plagued his recent work.</p><p>
    
    Yet, despite the generally excellent quality of the songs here, there are, of course, a few
    outstanding flaws that prevent it from achieving the same level of excellence the <i>Bee
    Thousand</i> era managed. For starters, the insert included is shamelessly self-indulgent,
    tossing in press quotes that basically amount to ""Bob Pollard is fucking awesome."" Odds are,
    if you're willing to drop $60 on four discs' worth of outtakes, you already think Pollard is
    a pretty nifty guy.</p><p>
    
    But perhaps the greatest problem with <i>Suitcase</i> is simply its size. At 100 songs, it's
    practically impossible to digest in one sitting.  Of course, the box set isn't designed
    to function as a singular album.  Rather, it's a treasure trove for GBV completists who won't
    mind scouring hundreds of minutes of boombox recordings for diamonds in the rough.  Listening
    to <i>Suitcase</i> reminds me why I became obsessed with Guided by Voices in the first place--
    Pollard's immense talent as a songwriter simply could not be denied.</p><p>
    
    There's something inherently bittersweet about this massive compilation, in the sense that even
    the worst of its 100 tracks sound better than, say, ""Zoo Pie"", ""In Stitches"", or ""Dragons Awake"".
    Of course, I still hold on hope that Pollard will one day regain his title as king of the pop
    song.  Until then, at least we can take comfort in the fact that he probably has enough decent
    material floating around his basement to keep us satisfied for years to come.</p></div>"|3590.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3590-suitcase-failed-experiments-and-trashed-aircraft/|7.9|Matt LeMay

    expectations.  On 1993's <i>Debut</i>, she got off the Sugarcubes, trading

    Benediktsson for a slightly more laidback songwriting approach.  On 1995's

    electronics with an almost prodigious ease on <i>Homogenic</i>, her darkest
    and most cohesive album to date.</p><p>
    Given Björk's past reputation for burning pop rulebooks, <i>Selmasongs</i>
    should expand on her disregard for traditional song structures, and challenge
    listeners with inventive sounds and unconventional uses of new technology.
    It doesn't.  In fact, <i>Selmasongs</i> breaks no new ground whatsoever for
    the Icelandic composer, instead dwelling in more comfortable regions already
    mapped by <i>Homogenic</i>.</p><p>
    The album begins promisingly with the beautifully arranged instrumental,
    ""Overture.""  Muted horns echo distantly and gradually swell into a brief,
    subdued triumph.  Tympani pounds beneath the gigantic sound, seemingly
    announcing the arrival of Arthur Clarke's <i>2001</i> monolith.  But what
    comes next is far from evolution.</p><p>
    ""Cvalda"" opens with roughly a minute of busy industrial machinery, which gives
    way to rhythmic tapping and Björk's overzealous refrain, ""Clatter, crash, clack!/
    Racket, bang, thump!/ Rattle, clang, crack, thud, whack, bam!""  ""It's music,""
    she whispers.  ""Now dance!""  As the tapping morphs into a generic hip-hop beat,
    vibes cascade eerily over Björk's trademark crooned vocals.  Sadly, the melody
    is lifeless and predictable, and song's chorus, bad enough the first time around,
    is beaten into oblivion.</p><p>
    ""I've Seen It All,"" a duet between Björk and Thom Yorke, diverts attention from
    the incessant clattering, crashing and clacking of ""Cvalda"" with utter malaise.
    But the song's very premise is a cliché, expressing such overwrought sentiments
    as, ""I've seen a man killed by his best friend/ And lives that were over before
    they were spent.""  The paired vocalists also seem an odd match here; when Björk's
    soaring, intense delivery meets Yorke's general disinterest, the chemistry is far
    from convincing.</p><p>
    Fortunately, <i>Selmasongs</i>' closer saves the record at the last minute with
    what is easily one of Björk's best works thus far.  ""New World"" opens with a muted
    pulse, and slowly resurrects the melody and horns of the sublime ""Overture.""  As
    the song builds, the beat floats to the surface until it becomes practically
    crystalline.  Björk croons, ""I'm softly walking on air/ Halfway to heaven from
    here/ Sunlight unfolds in my hair.""  Strings scream while the horns climax to a
    victorious crescendo.  Then, without warning, the drums theatrically give out and
    the song calms to a satiated hum.</p><p>
    So, the record definitely has its great moments.  The problem is, there are only
    two of them.  Yes, the arrangements are absolutely stunning; yes, the production
    is truly incredible.  But ultimately, it's the songs that matter, and these ones,
    for the most part, fail to live up to Björk's past offerings.</p><p>
    I'm willing to give her the benefit of the doubt on this one, though, and here's
    why: <i>Selmasongs</i> is a soundtrack to Lars von Trier's <i>Dancer in the Dark</i>,
    a film in which Björk, as you undoubtedly already know, makes her acting debut.
    Artists are notorious for tossing off uninspired fluff when Hollywood calls.
    (Reference Billy Corgan's work on <i>Stigmata</i> or Mel Gibson's <i>Ransom</i>,
    or John McEntire's score for <i>Reach the Rock</i>.)</p><p>
    Also, the album is actually a collaborative effort, rather than a lone Björk
    project.  Only one of its seven songs is credited as having been written solely
    by Björk; the rest were co-written by Sjón and Lars von Trier, with occasional
    assistance from LFO's Mark Bell.  Bell also co-produced <i>Selmasongs</i> with
    Björk, with the exception of ""Overture"" and ""New World,"" the record's two finest
    moments.  Stack all this on top of the fact that the lyrics and music were all
    created specifically to fit the style and substance of the film, and it suddenly
    doesn't seem all that bad.</p><p>
    Björk's official follow-up to <i>Homogenic</i>, <i>Domestika</i>, is due out
    next year.  And of course, it could go either way.  If <i>Selmasongs</i> is the
    side project it appears to be, we can still expect great things in 2001.  After
    all, the capabilities of computer software grow more astounding each day, and
    Björk has remained on the crest of that wave.  But I'm not going to stand here
    and try to predict the future.  All I know is, <i>Selmasongs</i> is a decent
    album, but pretty average compared to Björk's other stuff.  And right now,
    that's what matters.</p></div>"|729.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/729-selmasongs/|7.4|Ryan Schreiber

Painters,
    poets, writers, and filmmakers have been providing fodder for some of the best, and
    worst, rock songs ever written. But isn't it about time that rock musicians began
    seeking out influence from another source?  How about those oft-forgotten but
    nevertheless vital entertainers, stand-up comedians.</p><p>
    Why stand-up comedians?  Well, for starters, comedy is perhaps the only form of
    entertainment in which the performer must perpetually be in direct connection with
    the audience. Comedians don't have pretension to hide behind; they can't argue that
    their comedy is boring because it's ""art."" If they aren't getting laughs, they simply
    fail. Similarly, they don't have any kind of glossy production to hide behind. If a
    comedian were to run his voice through a reverb pedal and put Steve Albini at the
    mixing board, no one would notice.  That's why there are no famous comedy club sound
    guys.</p><p>
    But perhaps the greatest single element found in comedy that seems to be sorely lacking
    in rock music these days is the element of surprise. Now, I've always taken nothing
    short of personal offense at the notion that rock music is dead. But the almost complete
    lack of absolute, startling originality that currently plagues the majority of rock music
    cannot be denied. Don't believe me? Well, let's take a quick quiz: three fill in the blank
    questions, ranging from the extremely easy to the more advanced:</p><p>
    1) Guitar, _______, and drums.<br/>
    2) Verse, chorus, verse, _______, chorus.<br/>
    3) F, C, D, _______.</p><p>
    Granted, the last one was a bit esoteric. But odds are, you figured out the first two with
    very little effort. The archetypal ""rock song"" has become a complete cliché, utilizing the
    same structure, sound, and instrumentation as 99% of the other rock songs ever written. By
    the time you've heard the first thirty seconds of almost any song on the radio, you could
    finish the song as well as the person who actually wrote it.</p><p>
    If the rock song were a joke, comedy would have died out years ago, or at least been severely
    injured due to hurled projectiles. Too often, rock musicians forget that in order to elicit
    any kind of genuine response from an audience, you have to keep them on their toes. Sure, some
    comedians, such as Neil Hamburger, are under the impression that telling the same ancient
    jokes over and over again is funny. But when's the last time somebody said to you, ""Oh, man!
    You've got to check out this new Neil Hamburger album!""</p><p>
    Like the best stand-up comedians, <i>It Was Hot, We Stayed in the Water</i> makes a point of
    never letting on where it's going next. It's one of those rare albums that obliterates your
    expectations of a traditional rock album, yet remains potent and accessible. It's not a record
    that can be passively listened to-- the constant, drastic shifts in structure and dynamics
    simply demand your full and undivided attention.</p><p>
<i>It Was Hot</i> opens with lightly-strummed acoustic guitar switching rhythmically from the
    right to left channel of your speaker-- a subtle effect, but one that sounds remarkably cool,
    and lends a whole new dimension to an already good song.  Suddenly, a small click echoes in the
    background. A low-level, barely audible hiss lingers just below the fluttering guitar and
    frontman Phil Elvrum's angelic voice. It's a most subtle change, but it hints perfectly at the
    oncoming sonic blast. Reverb-drenched snares drive with three times the force of a steam engine,
    and twice the volume. Fuzz-soaked electric guitars blast slightly off-key. But despite the
    dissonance and the atypical song structure, the track never breaks down into complete anarchy--
    it's still a rock song, just not the one you're used to.</p><p>
    The album's next track, ""Ice,"" plays out kind of like its predecessor in reverse, starting with
    a cacophonous blast of huge-sounding percussion, bass and guitar, before dissipating into
    strummed acoustics, with K Records songstress Mirah providing backing vocals. The track is a
    short-lived affair, leading up perfectly to the album's climax, the laid-back yet riveting charms
    of the Microphones' otherworldly cover of Eric's Trip's ""Sand,"" and the epic ""The Glow."" The
    former utilizes a shuffling drum sample, and layer after tasty layer of indistinguishable
    instrumentation and harmonizing vocals, before cutting off abruptly mid-verse. The latter, which
    stands up there with Summer Hymns' ""New Underdressment"" as one of the most brilliant psych-rock
    songs of the year, weaves several loosely connected segments together into a disjointed, yet
    brilliantly self-referential epic. Most important of all, perhaps, is the quality of songwriting
    demonstrated throughout-- as out there as the construction of the songs may be, the essential
    elements of melody, chord structure, rhythm, and instrumentation never suffer.</p><p>
    The rest of <i>It Was Hot</i> is similarly awesome, culminating with the ominous swell of guitar
    and keyboards that closes the record. It's a perfectly fitting ending to a brilliant album--
    dynamic and complex, yet fragile and strangely beautiful.  The album is a shining example of the
    fact that the best rock songs are those that don't go out of their way to be rock songs.</p></div>"|5268.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5268-it-was-hot-we-stayed-in-the-water/|9.2|Matt LeMay

    genre will be paid homage? Lounge? E-Z Listening? Krautrock? Salsa?
    Krautrock played as salsa? True to form, Ladytron indeed are working the
    retro angle. They're two guys and two girls in love with the early 80s,
    a time when several flavors of pop music discovered electricity all over
    again and began to channel the machine pulse of Kraftwerk. And who can
    blame Ladytron for this love affair? We came of age in the 80s, after
    all, so we can expect the sounds from this era to cycle through our lives
    continuously until we all bite the dust. The 1980s were our 1950s, a
    statement that makes a lot more sense if you grew up watching ""Happy
    Days"" with your pre-Baby Boomer parents. So we may as well get used to
    it.</p><p>
    
    Fortunately, there's more to Ladytron than a moonwalk down memory lane.
    They slavishly ape ancient production techniques on <i>Commodore Rock</i>,
    but also apply them in the service of catchy pop songs. So while ""Play
    Girl"" cops the instrumental signifiers of early New Order (cheap drum
    machine, sweeping faux-string synth washes, prominent, bouncing bass),
    it also measures up in melody, and that's saying something.  Helen
    Marnie's voice is perfect for the song; inviting and warm, yet just
    bored enough for new wave.</p><p>
    
    The slightly more original title track features the appropriately
    Rhinelandish speaking voice of Bulgarian Mira Aroyo. Somewhere behind
    a fuzzy 303 bassline and choppy electrified drums, Aroyo wields her
    commanding tongue in a way that will remind Krautrock aficionados of
    Kluster's 1970 debut, <i>Klopfzeichen</i>.  But the oddest moment of
    this compelling track comes at the three-minute mark, when beautiful,
    ghostly sheets of feedback drift in and overtake the song completely,
    transforming it into epic drone music with cheap beats. I don't remember
    hearing <i>that</i> fusion on the early days of MTV. Bravo.</p><p>
    
    The second side of this four-song EP isn't quite as strong. ""Miss Black""
    is a synth instrumental (the only voices are a phalanx of giggly girls
    that sound like the models from Duran Duran's ""Hungry like the Wolf"")
    that steals the organ hook already lifted by DJ Shadow for ""Organ Donor"".
    Meanwhile, ""Paco"" unconvincingly reaches for the darker, colder sonic
    realm of Gary Numan, and the lyrics (again recited by Aroyo), which
    detail the layout of a department store, make it a bit difficult to take
    seriously.  Still, though uneven, <i>Commodore Rock</i> remains a
    worthwhile listen and should be counted as a promising debut.</p></div>"|4632.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4632-commodore-rock-ep/|6.5|Mark Richard-San

    living. ""Survivor"" has come to mean vanquishing all opposition and standing
    tall, but entirely alone, on a pile of dirty cash. By this revised definition,
    Pete Astor, frontman of the Wisdom of Harry, is not a survivor; he is a
    subsisting hanger-on.</p><p>
    
    Astor cannot be judged in such starkly totalitarian terms. As a member of the
    Loft, he created a band that permanently teetered on the edge of utter
    collapse. A song like ""Up the Hill Backwards"" belongs in the permanent
    collection of precipitous art. Like the Fire Engines' Davey Henderson,
    Astor's work has a subdued surrealism to it, and as such, is so destined for
    esotericism. The Weather Prophets, Astor's next band, achieved little but
    acclaim before two band members went off to join country-rock chancers
    the Rockingbirds.</p><p>
    
    So will the Wisdom of Harry commercially succeed where Astor's other acts have
    sunk?  Initial signs are hardly hopeful. The fact that the band's early
    material (compiled later as <i>The Stars of Super 8</i>), was issued by
    labels tinier than TV dinners and garnered virtually no support isn't exactly
    encouraging.  But to those attuned to quirky soundscaping and compelling
    verbal juxtapositions, <i>House of Binary</i>-- the Wisdom of Harry's second
    album-- is a lo-fi mansion of Newport opulence.</p><p>
    
    Throughout <i>House of Binary</i>, Astor's long-recognized appreciation for
    Lou Reed's lyrics and garage-band musical forthrightness is blended with an
    appreciation of the Rephlex roster. Two tracks immediately arrest you with
    their skewed pop confection-- the very Beta Band and exceedingly compilable
    ""Coney Island of Your Mind,"" and the sickly scheming psychedelia of ""Caesar
    Boots."" That these two tracks are sequenced back-to-back, and so early in
    the album, confirms Astor's confidence in his talents.</p><p>
    
    ""March of the Otaku"" follows them, and bountifully exhibits Astor's supremacy
    of keyboards and twisted ambionics. As slow and low as the track is, you'd
    never want to hear it on a chill out compilation-- the Dead Can Dance choir
    and fairground organ melodies exhume too many repressed memories of
    childsnatchers, spiked cotton candy, and ""Tales from the Crypt""-induced
    nightmares. ""Quite an achievement, Mr. Astor,"" the critic mumbles, as his mom
    coaxes him out from behind two lacrosse sticks, a pile of dirty Converses,
    and the broken power supply of an Atari 7200, abandoned to the relentless
    entropy of his bedroom closet.</p><p>
    
    As if to redeem himself for the previous terror, ""Theme from Eggboy"" channels
    the mojos of Lee ""Scratch"" Perry, Augustus Pablo, Robert Johnson, and the
    Boards of Canada, and is just overwhelming in its beguiling voodoo pull. Astor
    gets confessional during the ambient torch song, ""Boxed"": ""Looks like I'm
    boxed again/ But it's okay,"" sounds less like an assessment of a poorly
    parked vehicle than it does Astor's resignation to being sparsely acclaimed,
    pigeon-holed, and woefully unrecompensed for his gift for writing genuinely
    sympathetic songs.</p><p>
    
    During the deep, rolling glamour of ""Disco C,"" Astor lets us in on a hush-hush
    secret-- the Bates' Motel has been throwing Summer of '88 house parties!
    The lonely, mama-lovin' Norman shows himself to be quite a connoisseur of
    bass-heavy garage classics like Don Carlos' ""Alone,"" Kym Mazelle's moody
    ""Useless,"" and Jamie Principal's ""Baby Wants to Ride."" With such a snappy
    hook, marketing execs surely can't withhold publicity funds by confusing
    <i>House of Binary</i> with another Rusted Root release, can they?</p><p>
    
    It's not within my power to send <i>House of Binary</i> up to the cash-raking
    heights of Destiny's Child's own definition of ""Survivor""-- and I get the
    sense that Astor wouldn't want that, anyway.  I can only recommend that we,
    as listeners, make the effort to send it up there.  Whatever the accountants'
    bottom line will finally show, Astor's concerns, surreally masked or not, are
    far loftier than the banal accruing of disposable funds. Towards the close of
    the album, Astor states, ""I'm going to make my life right/ Going to write to
    everyone/ Tell them what I've done/ Gonna make my life right/ Gonna stand on
    a high building/ Gonna scream against the sky/ Gonna beg for forgiveness/ Try
    to make it all right."" Hey, Pete, no need for apology, mate. We know what
    you've done: you've done just fine.</p></div>"|8719.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8719-house-of-binary/|8.2|Paul Cooper

    As a member of 808 State, he masterminded the first credible British responses
    to the techno being imported from Detroit. <i>Newbuild</i>, 808 State's debut,
    created the kind of catch-up energy that few albums have ever generated. I
    would even argue that it's dance music's <i>Nevermind</i>: it defined a whole
    new musical landscape and depicted, in huge sweeps, an entirely fresh mode of
    expression. The Roland 808, the TB303, and the other rudimentary machines and
    devices used to create <i>Newbuild</i> have all become fetish items of late,
    and were it not for Simpson's departure, 808 State would have become the
    pioneering electronic act without equal.</p><p>
    But he did leave, and has done pretty well for himself since. He wrote the
    warehouse anthem ""Voodoo Ray"" before realizing that the voodoo within the tune
    was blighting him. He turned his attention away from thrashing Derrick May at
    his own game and took to the polyrhythmic expanses of jungle. Released on his
    own Juicebox label, <i>28 Gun Bad Boy</i> and <i>Black Science Technology</i>
    prove that when focused, Simpson is capable of disciplined soulful electronic
    masterworks.</p><p>
<i>Essence</i>, however, showcases his distracted, settle-for-almost-anyone
    self-- the one that gets record companies interested and involved. The last
    time he let a company control him, they refused to release the album (<i>High
    Life Low Profile</i>, nixed by Sony). Before that, the company had messed
    around with <i>Automannik</i> and left a meager husk of a reportedly vee vee
    special record.  Studio !K7 release <i>Essence</i> probably with a heap of
    reverence in their hearts, and that's why they can't tell him that Lady Miss
    Kier doesn't belong on a cigar-lounge trip-hop album that criminally disguises
    its avant-jungle artistry.  They apparently also can't bring themselves to tell
    Simpson that <i>Essence</i> actually deserves rejection.</p><p>
    Geffen once sued Neil Young for producing un-Neil Young albums. And while I
    appreciate that artists must have the freedom in which to break down boundaries
    and public perceptions, I do feel that record companies should tell revered and
    honored artists when they're producing sub-standard stuff. And infuriatingly
    sub-standard <i>Essence</i> is.</p><p>
    The dead giveaway is the opener, ""The Universe,"" an awkwardly delivered spoken
    word piece about the universe within our bodies and the spirituality that we
    house in the micro-universes of our atomic make-up. This undisciplined,
    unsubstantiated new age clap-trap would be far more at home in the coffeehouses
    of UC Berkeley than they are on <i>Essence</i>. ""Could You Understand"" strives
    for the emotional power of ""Finley's Rainbow,"" Black Science Technology's
    crucial reworking of Finley Quaye's version of Bob Marley's ""Sun is Shining,""
    which also borrows from Jacob Miller's multiply versioned ""Baby, I Love You
    So."" Lamb's Louise Rhodes, potentially the most compatible collaborator, gives
    a sterling performance of the psychobabble ""Humanity,"" which is as galling a
    session of fatuous ego-stroking self-actualization as anyone might hear outside
    of an anger-management seminar conducted by a lapsed and self-loathing cleric.</p><p>
    Sad to relate, there are plenty more lyrics gleaned from Borders' Self-Improvement
    Section.  On ""Universal Spirit,"" Wendy Page trills, ""Universal spirit elevates
    your soul/ When your heart perceives it/ Love is in control/ Dive into the
    ocean/ Energize your love.""  At least when former Deee-Liter Lady Miss Kier
    steps up to the mic, she's downright strange: ""Something's really happening/
    Smoking sassafras/ Grass is on her arse/ Wearing out her slippers.""  No one
    can withhold the Adam Ant Award for Utter Whibble from Lady Miss Kier for such
    baffling cobblers!</p><p>
    Throughout <i>Essence</i>, Simpson valiantly attempts to compensate for his
    vocalists' inadequacies. The music he sets their Aquarius-Age warblings to is
    invariably some of the most sincere and artful that a drum-n-bass producer has
    ever committed to hard disk. Even the Bukem-ish ""First Breath"" remains
    unimpeachable due to the accurate and faultless position of each beat and
    sub-bass boom. ""Humanity,"" lyrics aside, initially shuffles in a samba before
    Simpson's heavily echoed toms prepare us for the subtle rush of his processed
    breakbeats.</p><p>
    ""Final Call"" revisits rave's undeniable glories-- from the Cabaret
    Voltaire basslines to the Pet Shop Boys orchestral stabs, and the jack track
    hand claps and rimshots. The track is unashamedly nostalgic, but since Simpson
    pretty much invented the style, it'd be churlish to reprimand him for it. If
    ""Fever or a Flame"" were versioned (sans Wendy Page), it would doubtless reside
    in junglist DJs boxes for months; cleansed of insipid vocals, the track would
    be an unstoppable peaktime roller.</p><p>
    What makes <i>Essence</i> such a gadfly is that, had Mono or Hooverphonic
    released it, I'd have been thrilled that they'd escaped from the Serge
    Gainsbourg-sampling, goatee-stroking gulag they wandered into quite voluntarily.
    But as <i>Black Science Technology</i> unquestionably proved, a Guy Called
    Gerald is matchless in his ability to create faultless techno soul.</p><p>
<i>Essence</i> mocks its creator's reputation.  I can hear elements of an
    outstanding, possibly even genre-opening album amongst the jumble of guest
    vocals and conventional verse/chorus/verse structures. It's as though Simpson
    needs more than to create another soulful masterpiece of machine music; he
    needs the fleeting pleasure of being a one-hit wonder. If Simpson is mad keen
    on collaborating, why not hook up with Me'Shell NdegéOcello, an artist who
    would be equally soulful and more than capable of understanding and
    complimenting his exemplary machine-soul aesthetic. Until then, we must either
    use a mental filter to erase the inanities, or return <i>Black Science
    Technology</i> to the disc tray and wait for another five years to pass before
    Simpson releases another comeback.</p></div>"|3616.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3616-essence/|5.6|Paul Cooper

    Mogwai is one of those rare bands that elicits opinions as bipolar as the
    music it creates, be it either Islamic-fundamentalist-style fanatical
    devotion, nonplussed perplexity (often to the point of outright hostility),
    or both. The true Mogwai listening experience is a fragile, tempermental
    thing; listen to an album of theirs in the wrong setting and it comes off as
    pretentious, repetitive, and banal. But under the right circumstances, it
    can wield a power as strong and inexplicable as gravity, holding one
    completely in epiphanic thrall.</p><p>
    I've had plenty of both kinds of experiences with Mogwai and I'm still no
    closer to really understanding how they do what they do. On paper, their
    formula seems moronically simple: agonizingly slow, quiet, repetitive
    instrumental figures slowly building layer upon layer of tension until
    either the song snaps, overflowing with monstrous cascades of alien noise...
    or it doesn't. Perhaps this more-than-occasional lack of release is what turned
    people off to <i>Come On Die Young</i>, an album whose tension building over
    the course of its entire length proved too frustrating, even for hardcore
    fans. So this (sort of eponymous) six-song EP immediately succeeds where
    <i>Die Young</i> fails: it's not as long, so it's a bit easier to get a handle
    on, and it contains both the really quiet parts and the really loud parts.
    Somewhat less superficially, it also happens to contain some of Mogwai's
    finest work to date, as the band continues to refine and innovate from
    within the narrow confines of their formula.</p><p>
    ""Stanley Kubrick"" is, for lack of a better word, excellent. A willowy organ
    drone hovers gently yet ominously, while what sounds like a human voice
    slowed down to quarter-speed snakes between the sustained bass and guitar
    notes. Perfectly arranged, the song simmers enticingly but never boils over;
    like the best Mogwai songs, it seems almost inconceivable that it could have
    been created by mere mortals. The next few tracks return the proceedings to
    earth with more conventional instrumentation: ""Christmas Song"" is a pretty
    piano-and-strings piece that bears some resemblance to the <i>Twin Peaks
    theme in places, and ""Burn Girl Prom Queen"" drifts along for eight minutes
    on the strength of a melancholy horn section.
    </i></p><p>
    The noisy climaxes kick back in on ""Rage: Man"" and ""Small Children In The
    Background,"" but here they don't overwhelm and mangle the main melodies of
    the songs. It could be that the band has learned to write themes that can
    withstand pummeling, tsunami-sized guitar distortion, or that they've
    learned how to use white noise as an instrument unto itself, or perhaps a
    little of both. But the bottom line remains the same: Mogwai is getting
    better. Much, much better.
    </p><p>
    But how can it be that Mogwai is improving even when their songs continue to
    sound the same? What can they possibly do with soft/loud instrumental music
    that hasn't been done a hundred thousand times before? I honestly don't
    know. I'd like to see them release an album consisting of a single hour-long
    track. Or perhaps a symphony, complete with movements. It may sound
    ambitious and bombastic, but Mogwai's mission has always been to imbue
    guitar rock with the kind of emotional landscape previously reserved for
    classical music. The fact that they've succeeded maybe 25% percent of the
    time so far is reason enough to call them, as Stephen Malkmus has, the best
    band of the 21st century.

    the age of 35 or so has been basically skewered by media. This is not
    revelatory.  Whether its effects are in toto good, bad or neutral, the
    simple fact is that we are all run through by media and marinated like
    shish kabobs in its sticky substance.</p><p>
    
    Fine. And one of the byproducts of this is that there are many of us who
    feel naked without a soundtrack. Without accompaniment, we're everyday
    kids going to work or school, wearing backpacks and sneakers-- we're
    unremarkable.  But with the right stuff in our headphones, we're arms
    dealers, spies, deep-sea divers, ninjas. Ninjas! With a soundtrack,
    we're badasses, and what's so wrong with that?</p><p>
    
    If any possible good has come from MTV, it's that it has raised a
    generation of synesthetes. With a song playing, we compose a
    corresponding scene. We choose characters and setting, lighting, palette:
    play the purple of some gangster's tie off a mahogany baluster in late
    afternoon sunlight, maybe. We mentally rack focus from the main action
    to significant details. It's all surface sheen, but we do it well. Sure,
    you can say media has turned us into desensitized, inarticulate,
    possibly dangerous thugs, but at least we're thugs slash art directors
    slash cinematographers.</p><p>
    
    So you need something to keep you ninjafied on the bus, to keep your
    infiltration of Yoyodyne's secret underground laboratory from revealing
    itself as cubicle-bound fantasy.  And Thievery Corporation are there for
    you. <i>The Mirror Conspiracy</i> has everything you need: espionage,
    chases, thinly veiled deception, shady dealings in back rooms, canasta.
    Muted earthtones, washed-out tundra scenes, lurid tropical flourishes.
    Pungent soil odors, the reek of triple-canopy jungle, whiffs of patchouli.
    Sure, it's just acid jazz with disco and bossanova inflections; naturally,
    the arrangements are less than surprising; <i>of course</i> the beat could
    use some variation.  But this is about transference, not transcendence.
    <i>The Mirror Conspiracy</i> provides the soundtrack your mediated soul
    requires, and that's all that's important.</p></div>"|8004.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8004-the-mirror-conspiracy/|7.2|Zach Hooker

    testament to John Coxon and Ashley Wells' considerable talent and
    originality. Drum-n-bass acts can rarely boast even seven 12"" releases
    before they fall foul of their own copycat inadequacies or jump onto
    the <i>Mixmag</i>-sanctioned style of the month. Spring Heel Jack care
    not that the Manumission mongoloids won't dance a day-glo strut to their
    cerebral works, nor that the Hoxon Square Mafia have a whole new set
    of sneaker aesthetics by which to judge nu-jazz crews.</p><p>
    
    It's Coxon and Wales' self-assurance that has seen them through being
    just another dub-cavernous junglist act picked up by a major label, to
    being dropped by that major, to signing to an indie that welcomes their
    abstract proclivities and relishes their installation-enabled audio.</p><p>
    
    Unlike the <i>Oddities</i> album, <i>Disappeared</i> stays pretty much
    clear of <i>Simfonias for Four Turntables</i> and <i>A Concrete Block</i>
    or clanging homages to La Monte Young. The only starling avant-gardisms
    come in the form of guest bass clarinetist (and hugely gifted Devonian)
    John Surman.</p><p>
    
    For the two takes of the title track, Surman adjusts his
    instrument from the autumnal gold-drenched tones he showcases on his
    <i>Coruscating</i> release, to the percussive, embryonic capsules of
    distortion. It's quite an effect and it sounds like Coxon and Wales are
    unsure what to make of Surman's contribution.  So, they cop out and
    plant Surman's seeds in a heavy ambient soil, hoping something will
    germinate. It's a shame because rather than wowing <i>The Wire</i>
    collective, the duo could have directed the avant-garde to a fresh,
    untilled tundra of possibilities.  But, hey.  I should have the luxury
    to complain when so many drum-n-bass acts fail to reach beyond the
    mediocre.</p><p>
    
    Spring Heel Jack have rarely relied on the well-worn breaks so
    brainlessly incorporated by many others. For instance, the battery
    that powers ""Rachel Point"" sounds like the Latin massive that propelled
    the Pet Shop Boys' ""Se a La Vida;"" the bass that grainily slides through
    ""Mit Wut"" seems to have slipped out from one of those hydroponic sessions
    Adrian Sherwood arranged for Primal Scream a few vanished years ago.
    Coxon and Wales even find time to have some light fun with big beat
    on ""Trouble and Luck"" before returning to dub for a clicks n' cuts
    rinse out Cole Porterishly titled ""To Die a Little.""</p><p>
    
    Released almost exactly five months after their previous proper album,
    <i>Treader</i>, how has the band developed?  Not all that much.  But
    then again, Spring Heel Jack have never been bombastic and
    headline-grabbing. Some expected this album to be an abandonment of
    junglism for the splenetic classicisms and noisebursts that
    blunderbussed through <i>Treader</i>.  But if anything, <i>Disappeared</i>
    reestablishes Spring Heel Jack as drum-n-bass experts, gifted at
    layered percussion, and erudite at unsettling listeners with an
    uneasy ambience.</p><p>
    
    Over the years, they've let go of the laboratorial digitizing of the
    sounds around us for richer, more organic statements.  They have not
    imagined the Earth populated by cyborgs or composed soundtracks for
    straight-to-video <i>Matrix</i> rip-offs.  And even if Spring Heel Jack
    may have their records played during donor-evenings at the Tate Modern,
    at least they don't think they live there.</p></div>"|7439.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7439-disappeared/|7.7|Paul Cooper

    stoner. When young and in the throes of psychedelic experience, the mind
    automatically focuses on the heavens, wondering if it is really possible
    that, like, dude, check it: what if there's a whole universe like the
    one out there inside of a single blackhead? Sagan had this same experience
    at some point and ran with it; next thing you know, he's loading albums
    onto the Voyager probes for distant civilizations to rock to. (Fact: the
    Voyager probes, which will continue to move in a line away from Earth for
    the next 40,000 years, were outfitted with gold-plated turntables and
    records cut with sounds from Earth. Among the sounds are Chuck Berry's
    ""Maybelene"" and a greeting from Jimmy Carter. Sagan selected the tunes,
    making him by far the most out-there DJ of the pre-remix era.) Whatever
    powered Sagan's imagination, it should serve as inspiration for us all.</p><p>
    
    Like the Voyager probes, San Jose's Duster has been known to travel the
    spaceways. It's unclear if the root of it all lies in astronomy or
    neurology, and maybe it was just the song titles (""Moon Age,""
    ""Constellations,"" ""Docking the Pod"") or the Cold War-era reverb on the
    guitars, but Duster's first album evoked a slow, drifting journey
    through the void-- one to be taken in either a space capsule or a plush
    four-poster canopy bed. <i>Contemporary Movement</i> is something a
    little bit different.</p><p>
    
    While the band sees this as the album where they shed some excess guitar
    layering, move the vocals up in the mix, and focus on the songs, the
    sound here isn't all that different. True, there's nothing here nearly
    as abstract as the buzzing drone construction that was <i>Stratosphere</i>'s
    title track, but Duster still has a way with the slow tempo and the
    beautifully distorted guitar noise. And from the first washed-out strum
    on ""Operations,"" it's clearly Duster all the way.</p><p>
    
    No, the major change on this album is in bringing the thematic focus
    back to earth, over the mountains, through the city, and into the
    bedroom. Continuing a trend they began on their <i>1975</i> EP, Duster
    show some vulnerability and refuse to mask feelings in cosmic metaphor.
    For contrast, Duster's first 7"" single, <i>Transmission/Flux</i>, featured
    a sad, dreamy song that repeated the refrain ""all my friends are
    cosmonauts""; <i>Contemporary Movement</i> has a song that says, ""Goddamn,
    I wish I was a little bit smarter"" (on ""Contemporary Breakups""). In the
    titles and lyrics, these are intimate songs about real emotion.</p><p>
    
    What carries these fragile (and easily mocked) sentiments across is the
    absolutely fucking gorgeous guitar music they're riding on. Ewing Parton
    and Canaan Amber (Duster's co-leaders) are wonderful musicians, though I
    doubt they could play with any real speed or dexterity, even if they
    wanted to. Their skill lies in finding the perfect guitar to go with just
    the right amp, so that the sound coming out of the speaker bears all the
    prickly warmth of your favorite wool sweater-- a tone so detailed you want
    to rub it between your fingers.</p><p>
    
    Parton and Amber can only sing three notes between them (and sometimes
    they miss one), so the melodies here have to be simple. This apparent
    limitation gives the melancholy tunes on <i>Contemporary Movement</i> a
    haiku-like clarity, and leaves plenty of gaps for the lovely chords to
    seep through. Aware of delicate humanity with their eyes trained on the
    stars, Duster has done Carl proud.</p></div>"|2493.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2493-contemporary-movement/|8.4|Mark Richard-San

    spawned from the same New Zealand indie label, Flying Nun, as the Verlaines,
    the Chills, and the Clean. If you're unfamiliar with these bands, call up
    Steve Malkmus, Lou Barlow, Ira Kaplan and countless others who've learned
    plenty from Knox and his Flying Nun mates. Along with other hugely influential
    but semi-obscure lo-fi innovators such as Young Marble Giants, Knox has done
    more with merely a voice, synthesizer, simple guitar, and drum machines than
    most could do with an orchestra. Knox, however, is no longer notorious for
    onstage self-laceration (he used to carve himself up with whatever jagged
    objects happened to be lying around); at 47, he rarely puts himself under
    the knife anymore.</p><p>
    
    These days, Knox often tours in support of the bands he and the Tall Dwarfs
    helped to inspire, like Yo La Tengo, for instance.  In concert, he dresses
    like your average beach bum. He wears that executive secretary/Madonna-esque
    headgear with the portable microphone. This way he can float freely, sometimes
    crooning dementedly to individual audience members. Knox will even persuade
    fans to come up and play his simple songs while he dashes off for a quick
    piss. These healthy bits of forced egalitarianism make the Chris Knox live
    experience a shared one, whether you like it or not. And that's a good thing.
    Iggy would be proud.</p><p>
    
    Upon hearing Knox's latest, <i>Beat</i>, it seems he's still most happy when
    exploring the shadowy nooks and crannies of the human psyche. Knox revels in
    the dark psychological spaces that most songwriters, even those considered
    ""confessional,"" conveniently avoid. But there's an element of humor
    underpinning all this too, sick as it may sometimes be.</p><p>
    
    As expected, the music itself is just about as minimal as straight tonal
    composition will allow. Knox uses his limited technical abilities to great
    advantage, banging out a few chords on the electric piano or guitar. The
    beat is usually supplied by a drum machine, or sometimes nothing at all.
    Knox loves getting across simple pop melodies, too, which serve as a great
    foil for his pessimistic lyrics. Occasionally, he'll interject some
    stabbing fuzz guitar into the mix, or hang a nice, thick feedback curtain
    over a verse or two. What more do you really need?</p><p>
    
    The subject matter Knox tackles is, on the surface, what you might expect
    of a mad genius pushing 50: twisted love songs, ruminations on aging, human
    nature, mortality.  Sometimes the lyrics conform to the overall minimalist
    ethic, as Knox may simply repeat a couple of lines, as on ""It's Love.""
    (""I need you/ I need you every single day."") Often, though, he juxtaposes
    the complex, extended lyric with conventional pop changes, like on ""What
    Do We Do with Love,"" a cute little song about the myriad ways people
    exploit and abuse this strange and often dangerous phenomenon known as
    ""love."" ""Everyone's Cool"" examines the human animal's self-deluding
    assumption that we're all so damn special and unique. Knox suggests that
    we're basically all just a slightly different version of the same
    self-obsessed, egotistical, over-emotional wanker.</p><p>
    
    But the most affecting song has to be ""Becoming Something Other,"" about a
    man coming to terms with his father being a wheelchair-bound vegetable: the
    old man is paralyzed, unable to speak coherently, and trying to express to
    his son that he's dying. Knox spares none of the ugly details of this
    encounter, and it's damn disturbing to say the least.  There's nothing more
    than an eerie keyboard drone in the background, and the chords shift in
    achingly slow increments-- aptly representative of the father's slow but
    steady mental and physical deterioration.</p><p>
    
    As you can see, Knox can be just as cynical, bitchy and depressing as he is
    charming. But, hey, that's why we love him. So don't count on Knox becoming
    the new guest host on <i>Live with Regis</i> anytime soon. Free of the
    debilitating, art-killing curse of mainstream success, Knox proves he's
    still a vital voice reverberating from rock's fertile underground-- much
    like he was twenty years ago. What's next?  Hard to say.  Maybe someday
    he'll learn to play an instrument. But let's hope not.</p></div>"|4501.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4501-beat/|7.9|Michael Sandlin

Where     the leading lights of the indie rock nation have to affect an air of     triumphant boredom so they can conceal their true colors as solo-ridden     guitar-god aspirants Buffalo Tom: 1) named themselves after their drummer     and Neil Young's first band because it'd have been too much trouble to come     up with anything really new; 2) played assorted variations on the strummy     post-pop that filled collegiate airwaves throughout the 1980s because     innovation is overrated; and 3) wrote sharply observed conversational lyrics     because it was too hard to be obscure.</p>
<p>Score one for the losers.  The band's albums, of course, were spotty affairs     at best-- noise-tune gems riddled with poorly thought-out throwaways.  But     when distilled to their ""hits,"" they're actually revealed to be a mighty,     mighty singles band.  <i>A-Sides</i> arranges the songs by tone rather than     chronology, and not surprisingly, ends up as their greatest album.</p>
<p>Singer, guitarist and principle songwriter Bill Janovitz isn't abashed about     his influences on these tracks. In the liner notes, he cops to the Stones'     ballads, Dinosaur, Hüsker Dü and... Aerosmith.  From the classic rock side,     the band learned how to demonstrate soul and use an acoustic guitar, while     picking up the concept of gain-to-11 distortion from their more contemporary     ascendants.</p>
<p>The best songs on <i>A-Sides</i> play that tension perfectly. ""I'm Allowed""     builds from bluesy, haunted verses into ragged-throated blare. Despite the     liner notes' anxiety about the song, Buffalo Tom's early epic ""Larry"" masses     countryish strumming and punkish fury.  And even a baldly imitative sketch     like ""Birdbrain"" works, thanks to its wealth of powerful hooks. Unlike their     better-respected peers and descendents, the band was unafraid of the obvious     guilty pleasure, instead exploiting their innate melodic smarts and direct     approach to bring it all home.</p>
<p>The most pleasant surprise here is the consistency. Where watching the slow,     sorry flameout of Dinosaur or Hüsker's too-quick self-destruct was saddening     and obvious, a late-date Buffalo Tom single like ""Summer"" rings with just as     much sincerity and care as the tentative classic ""Taillights Fade."" Because the     band, completely unconcerned about coolness or timeliness or complexity, is     willing to give up the goods over and over again, the Tom-ist agenda remains     as fresh today as it was ten years ago.</p></div>"|1011.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1011-a-sides-1988-1999/|7.9|Sam Eccleston

    shame.  Some past secret, perversion, like, or dislike that has been kept
    hidden, for fear of embarrassment and public stoning.  But listening to the
    Starlight Mints, I feel I must now make my horrible, horrible secret known
    to the world:</p><p>
    
    I hate mint.</p><p>
    
    This may come as a shock to those of you chewing violently upon your 18th
    stick of Wrigley's Spearmint today.  But those that have taken mint for
    granted have no idea how difficult it is to go through life barely being
    able to stand the stuff. Until a few months ago, I was still using Sesame
    Street toothpaste.  And don't even get me started on candy.  Finally,
    though, I've found a mint I can tolerate. A firm, robust mint that's
    remarkably palatable, if, at times, a bit too saccharine.</p><p>
<i>The Dream That Stuff Was Made Of</i> is a short, well-sequenced offering
    of punchy orchestral pop.  And orchestral pop can be risky business, which
    is why ""string section"" is a favorite rock and roll punchline. But when
    <i>The Dream That Stuff Was Made Of</i> is at its best, it manages to
    reap all the benefits of the genre-- a full, expansive sound, and layers
    of contrasting melodic lines-- while avoiding the self-indulgence that so
    often foils their orch-pop contemporaries.</p><p>
    
    ""Submarine #3"" kicks off the record with a small quartet accentuated by
    an intensifying drum beat, summoning the spirit of Bacharach past. But
    aside from some distorted falsetto vocals that might be better suited
    for fellow Oklahoma natives the Flaming Lips, there isn't much to discuss.
    Frontman Allan Vest possesses a down-to-earth voice that seems perfectly
    suited to this kind of music: relatively expressive, and always on key.</p><p>
    
    ""The Bandit"" is a similarly structured song, relying upon big, open major
    chords and string accents to create a thoroughly charming pop sound. But
    the not-so-amusingly titled third track, ""Sir Prize,"" breaks away from
    this formula slightly, by implementing fractured song structure and
    quirky slide guitar riffs.  This element of quirk also makes its presence
    known on stronger tracks like the suspiciously Flaming Lips-esque ""Valerie
    Flames,"" as well as chewed-up bubblegum numbers like the aptly titled ""Sugar
    Blaster.""</p><p>
    
    As a whole, <i>The Dream That Stuff Was Made Of</i> sounds great-- Enon
    and System of a Down producer Dave Sardy gives it a studio punch that
    may pale in comparison to the work of Dave Fridmann, but is nonetheless
    impressive. So, yeah, I'll happily listen to the Starlight Mints every
    once in a while, even if they haven't reached the point where I feel
    comfortable brushing with them.</p></div>"|7466.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7466-the-dream-that-stuff-was-made-of/|7.7|Matt LeMay

    himself to blame. Despite early promise, IQU has stumbled badly in
    establishing any kind of momentum, a trend that continues with this,
    their second consecutive ho-hum EP stuffed with remixes. Last year's
    <i>Girls on Dates</i> EP was a noble experiment, attempting to weld the
    surreal spoken word performance of Miranda July with IQU's rhythmic
    backdrops.  But it was also a failed one that got boring after a few
    listens. And this new effort is only slightly more successful.</p><p>
    
    Here, IQU have taken a single new song, the admittedly great ""Teenage
    Dream,"" and offered it up to a half-dozen remixers, most of whom
    couldn't muster the energy to re-think the original track. Some of the
    mixes are decent, but most are average, at best. As this release comes
    more than two years after IQU's last full-length, it seems like nothing
    so much as annoying filler.</p><p>
    
    But we still get IQU's ""Teenage Dream,"" which sums up everything that
    makes the band interesting in a single seven-minute track. Starting with
    a 4/4 bass thump that's more techno than anything they've released in the
    past, the song folds in standup bass and primitive, electro-style synth
    lines. But the kicker comes when IQU transforms a sample of a Japanese
    children's choir singing what sounds like a traditional folk song into
    a brilliant vocal hook, and then drives home this inspired pop moment
    with forceful power chords. It's a fantastic track, and one can only hope
    that their next full-length contains other cuts of similar caliber.</p><p>
    
    But then come the six remixes. Stuart David of Looper is certainly a
    kindred spirit, so his take is interesting, though ultimately too similar
    in tone and execution to the original. Fat Cat recording artist
    Lexaunculpt hands in a very abstract, Autchre-style mix-- complete with
    harsh laptop tones-- that feels too heavy-handed, despite its skillful
    programming. Seattle's Team 714 streamlines the beat and adds some Middle
    Eastern accordion drones.  DJ Tomas piles on the percussion and mixes it
    with some groovy piano to his radically reworked ""Dub ID"" mix. The
    laidback, spacy cut by Take One &amp; Red Clay is straight-outta-Ninja Tune
    hip-hop. And finally, Concentrick (the electronic handle for Fucking
    Champs guitarist Tim Green) offers perhaps the most interesting
    interpretation-- a dark, claustrophobic piece that employs the sampled
    voices of the original for ghostly contrast.</p><p>
<i>Teenage Dream</i> also contains two versions of ""Can't You Even Remember
    That"" from IQU's first album. One is a head-nodding downtempo take by K.O.,
    the other a more abstract and chilling interpretation by Sonic Boom. That's
    one (great) new track and eight (okay) remixes for those keeping score at
    home, which makes this one a bit hard to recommend.</p></div>"|4047.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4047-teenage-dream-ep/|5.5|Mark Richard-San

    valued by artists on either end of the scale of sophistication-- from hitmakers
    to sound scientists-- the acoustic guitar hasn't been given a lot of love lately.
    It's still a ubiquitous object in society and a universally embraced songwriting
    tool, but the fact is, it just doesn't make as many appearances on stage or screen
    as it used to.</p><p>
    
    For all their tendencies toward traditional songcraft, the Posies have been
    unexpected odd men out of the last crazy decade. Rubbing elbows with R.E.M. and 
    Big Star has helped them earn a modest share of commercial success and cult 
    worship, but the reception the music world has offered them has been stingily 
    disproportionate to the amount of talent and effort they've put forth.  So it's
    fitting that the Posies' latest incarnation is purely acoustic, a leap that few
    contemporary acts would dare to take.  After all, who wants to give up all those
    cool distortion pedals and samplers?</p><p>
<i>In Case You Didn't Feel Like Plugging In</i> is the latest in a surprisingly 
    prolific posthumous re-examination of a band that hasn't written many new songs
    since 1994, and supposedly broke up in 1998. And since a lot of their recent
    releases have been somewhat redundant and inessential-- like the recent best-of 
    collection and the overwhelmingly comprehensive four-disc box set due out soon-- 
    it just might be the best among the glut.  Here, founding singer/guitarists Ken 
    Stringfellow and Jon Auer get down to business with the aid of a loving local 
    audience.</p><p>
<i>In Case</i> serves as a fine counterpart to the Posies' other live release,
    last year's electric <i>Alive Before the Iceberg</i>. It also makes for an
    unavoidable comparison between the two sides of the Posies. On <i>Alive</i>,
    they were still cranking the amps and attempting to reconcile the chasm between
    their power-pop roots and their Pacific Northwest rawk breeding.  And, as proven
    by that documented moment, they fared pretty well, belting out admirable harmonies 
    while amply fulfilling the distortion quota.  But here, the songs are stripped
    bare and performed as they were written.</p><p>
    
    Appropriately enough, the strongest performances come with songs culled from
    1989's <i>Failure</i>, the initially self-released debut album the duo recorded
    before growing into a full-on rock combo.  When they flub the lyrics on ""I May
    Hate You Sometimes,"" the old school fans show off a memory of the Posies'
    repertoire superior to even that of the band with an impromptu sing-along. Later,
    more aggressive material-- like ""Please Return It"" and an ineffectively slowed
    ""Grant Hart""-- is presented less flatteringly without the benefit of a chugging
    rhythm section to propel it.</p><p>
    
    The record's song selection might not warrant as much criticism if the performance
    hadn't been mercilessly pared down to a mere 10 songs. Considering that the shows
    in support of <i>In Case</i> have easily pulled past the two-hour mark, covering
    nearly every song from the the Posies' sizable catalog of songs, the stingy
    treatment is plain inexcusable.</p><p>
    
    With no need for throaty delivery over raging amps, Auer and Stringfellow's voices
    sound more crystalline and perfectly matched than ever.  Instead of just singing the
    same lyrics simultaneously and just hoping they come together, the two compliment
    each other with every melodic twist.  The a cappella intro to ""Suddenly Mary""
    transcends the polish of its studio counterpart by proving that, yes, they can really
    do that in person.</p><p>
    
    The magic of any great pop song is that it presents a series of pressure points,
    stringing together fleeting moments of ecstasy to resemble a narrative or train of
    thought. A catchy chorus or a clever lyric isn't as important as allowing all the
    ideas to shake hands and work together. The Posies' true skill is a consistent
    ability to do just that and sustain it for the entirety of each song, with those
    pressure points serving as the structure's foundation.</p><p>
    
    One of the prime examples of this comes with the minor hit, ""Solar Sister."" As I
    listen to the song's stunning solo as performed here, I detect a voice in the
    background screaming ""Yes! Yes! Yes!"" as Auer pulls the song off the ground and
    sends it into the stratosphere with gorgeously ascending triplets. But for the first
    time, it's an audience member-- another person screaming in absolute elation-- and
    not just a happy little voice in my head.  Oh, good.  So, it's not just me.</p></div>"|6425.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6425-in-case-you-didnt-feel-like-plugging-in/|7.5|Al Shipley

In the     face of dwindling commercial returns, the group struggled earnestly in the     first part of the decade to define itself outside the shadow of Brian Wilson.     These attempts were abandoned after the success of 1974's greatest hits     collection, <i>Endless Summer</i>, which established the group as the world's     most successful oldies act.  1976 found the group attempting to maintain its     revived fortunes in the recording studio as well as on the concert stage.     While many of the other recent Beach Boys ""twofer"" releases contained music     of similar tenor and approach, these two albums, issued during the most     conflicted time period in the band's history, are immediately striking in     their dissimilarity.</p>
<p>For these albums, one of the most crass marketing ploys in a group history     dominated by crass marketing ploys was devised: the return of full control     of the group to once-great bandleader Brian.  Unfortunately, Wilson had     spent most of the '70s descending into an abyss of paranoia, addiction,     and obesity.  He hadn't been in charge of a Beach Boys session since 1966,     and that the group sought in 1976 to restore Wilson to the control that     they had fought to wrest from him 10 years earlier is painfully ironic.</p>
<p>Given Brian Wilson's fragile state, it's difficult to understand what the     group expected to achieve through this arrangement.  The result of these     sessions, 1976's <i>15 Big Ones</i>, is a wreck of an album.  The production     is muddy and confused, the material largely comprised of uninspired covers     and outtakes from earlier albums.  ""Susie Cincinatti"" was a 1970 b-side.     The group's covers of standards like ""Chapel of Love"" and ""In the Still of     the Night"" are notable only for the morbid fascination they hold (the vocals     on the former are truly cringe-inducing).  Brian's once-sweet falsetto is     reduced to a hoarse crackle; as a result, Mike Love's painful nasal whine     is the dominant voice on the record.</p>
<p>Only a few cuts stand out from the mess.  Of the originals, ""Had to Phone Ya""     and ""Back Home""-- both of which are based on songs first written in the early     1960s-- are the best.  Only those cuts, along with a truly inspired version     of the Righteous Brothers' Spector-produced classic ""Just Once in My Life""     (actually benefiting from Wilson's raw vocals) save the album from being     completely unlistenable.  Strangely, <i>15 Big Ones</i> was a huge hit upon     its initial release, but to say that it hasn't stood the test of time is     an understatement.</p>
<p>After the tour for that record, Brian Wilson planned a solo release, but     the group quickly latched onto the project in an attempt to maintain their     momentum.  The product, <i>The Beach Boys Love You</i>, is totally Brian's,     and is the last album produced under the group's name to be written and     produced solely by him.  It's nothing if not idiosyncratic, and sounds like     literally no other Beach Boys album from any period.  The record is dominated     by Wilson's newfound infatuation with the Moog synthesizer, and his hoarse     but heartfelt vocals.</p>
<p>There are a couple throwaways-- the early '70s outtake ""Good Time,"" and the     inscrutable Roger McGuinn co-write ""Ding Dang""-- but for the most part,     Brian's songwriting and arranging talents are intact and in full force.     The format of the album recalls Wilson's first truly memorable LP, <i>The     Beach Boys Today</i>, by placing uptempo, upbeat numbers on Side One, and     a suite of slower, romantic songs on <i>Side Two</i>.</p>
<p>The lyrics here tend toward the childlike (""If Mars had life on it/ I might     find my wife on it"") to the simply bizarre (""Johnny Carson's a real live     wire"").  It's the ballads in the album's second half that elevate it to     the level of a great Beach Boys album.  ""The Night Was So Young,"" with its     beautiful harmonies, sounds like it could have been a <i>Pet Sounds</i> outtake, were it not for the bleating synths. ""Let's Put Our Hearts Together""     features a duet with Wilson's then-wife, Marilyn Rovell. This is Wilson's most     personal set of songs, and he weaves a shimmering web of sound on them, his     vocals as strong as they ever were.</p>
<p><i>The Beach Boys Love You</i> stands in sharp contrast to the albums that     preceded and followed it, because it was a product of genuine inspiration     on Brian Wilson's part, with little outside interference.  Soon after its     release, both Brian and the Beach Boys resumed their separate downward     trajectories: the group into mediocrity, disco mixes, and obscurity, and     Brian back into addiction and mental instability.</p>
<p>That Brian Wilson has, in recent years, reclaimed some     small measure of his sanity and now performs regularly,     presiding over his rich legacy, can be considered a small miracle.  Still,     one can't help but regret that he has never again created music as original     and individualistic as presented on this release in the ensuing years.  It's     a credit to the Beach Boys that for one brief, final moment, they allowed     Brian Wilson the freedom to create the music he wanted, and the resulting     album is, like its creator, frazzled, delicate, and beautiful in its     sentiment.</p></div>"|11669.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11669-15-big-oneslove-you/|1.5|D.

    9.  The advent of coprophilic pirate metal<br/>
    8.  An indie rock Gentle Giant tribute<br/>
    7.  Nude gymnasts (don't you think it's about time they lived up to the name?)<br/>

    4.  Universal health care<br/>
    3.  Peace in the Middle East<br/>
    2.  An end to world hunger<br/>
    1.  Mansun releasing a pop/R&amp;B; album</p><p>
    Okay, so maybe not.  But it's certainly up there with Bachmed on my list.</p><p>
    After all, Mansun went from brooding glam-ish guitar rock on their 1997 debut,
    <i>Attack of the Grey Lantern</i>, to all-out prog song structures and
    abstrusities on the astonishing follow-up, <i>Six</i>.  They haven't exactly
    been pointing the way to <i>Little Kix</i>.  This isn't a 180.  This isn't
    even a 90.  This is almost shifting onto another plane of music.  But that's
    not to say the shift is dramatic enough for comparisons to become meaningless.
    The band has expressed a taste for the Bee Gees, ABBA, and mid-'80s Prince,
    and this record is probably the result of such affinities.</p><p>
    All the same, not much of <i>Little Kix</i> could be classified as filler,
    even if two tracks-- ""Fool"" and ""Goodbye""-- exhibit a slight dip in quality
    from the surrounding material.  The band seems to be painting with muted
    colors, though, especially in contrast to the manic off-kilterness of
    <i>Six</i>.  Perhaps this has something to do with the seeming disinterest
    of the band members backing frontman Paul Draper.  <i>Little Kix</i> could,
    at times, be mistaken for a Draper solo album for all the effort the other
    guys appear to be investing.  Guitarist Dominic Chad contributes some nice
    lead touches occasionally, but bassist Stove King and drummer Andie Rathbone
    seem content with just laying down a nice pocket.</p><p>
    The album's largest detractor lies with its lyrics.  The complete lack of
    irony prevents it from reaching its potential as a genuinely satisfying
    production.  Sure, honesty and directness are nice and all, but with no bite,
    lines like, ""We are the boys, think about nothing and/ We are the boys, boys
    have got feelings, too,"" fall flatter than the late Bill Hicks at this year's
    Republican National Convention.  Everything is so amazingly darling and
    clichéd.  Even the chorus of ""Soundtrack 4 2 Lovers,"" a fine ballad by any
    measure, could've been culled from the new age compilation, <i>Pure Moods</i>.</p><p>
    If you're a real wonk for deep, original sentiments, <i>Little Kix</i> will
    probably wear like steel underwear.  But as a collection of love-themed
    songs, the record has a lot to offer for listening in the car, boudoir,
    or singing in the shower.</p></div>"|5091.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5091-little-kix/|6.8|Craig Griffith

On Portastatic's delicious new EP, Superchunk's Mac McCaughan takes cues
    from Brazil's tropicalia new wave of the late '60s, who at the time were taking cues from the 
    acid and pop movements of America and England.  And now, thirty years later, college kids can
    interpret the lyrics with help of online translation engines as they sit in an Internet café
    munching on cashew satay sticks.  Portastatic's homage to the fuzzed-out Brazilian pop of the
    peace era borrows heavily from the trippy sounds of Os Mutantes in particular.  McCaughan flecks
    Gilberto Gil's ""Lamento Sertanejo"" with scratchy guitar leads mimicking the Mutantes' ""A Minha
    Menina,"" originally a Jorge Ben number.  It's this mix of tribute and bastardization that gives
    the genre playful flavor and soul, and McCaughan sounds well studied and infatuated.</p><p>
    Caetano Veloso's ""Baby,"" another song covered by the Mutantes on their debut, simply stands as
    one of the greatest songs ever by one of the greatest songwriters ever.  Impossible to ruin,
    ""Baby"" even receives one of its greatest versions here.  Plunking double bass bops the tune
    along.  Soft, cherubic keyboard subtly melt over the chorus.  Slow trombone and wah-juiced
    guitar inflect a dreamy, gooey mood.  It's reassuring to know that the modest lyrics of ""Baby,
    baby, I love you"" still sound so knee-weakening.  ""I Fell in Love One Day,"" an English tune
    from Mutante Arnaldo Baptista's 1982 solo album, extends the boat-on-a-river hallucinogenic
    motif.  A creepy speed-altered, double-tracked vocal lurks beneath the surface as lethargic
    static- and reverb-laden snares splash along.  On another Caetano Veloso cover, ""Não
    Identificado,"" Mac leaves the tale of admirer and wishes to professes his unrequited love for
    flying saucers, and in ""Anticomputador,"" odes in the native Portugese, as with the majority of
    the EP.</p><p>
    Joyce's ""Clareana"" closes the too-short foray in Bahian romance with programmed samba rhythms
    and more horn.  Mac's trademark boyish soprano grants these tunes an ideal naivety and
    androgynous passion.  Certainly some of the native shuffle and boogie is missing, as to be
    expected from a Chapel Hill fellow, but <i>De Mel, De Melão</i> remains a freshing and

    been involved in the development of the mammoth as an instrument.  In
    my earliest experiments, a trio of courageous musicians produced the
    most remarkable assortment of sounds from a single properly tuned and
    securely tethered beast.""</i></p><p>
    
    Lately, author/illustrator David Macauley's been hosting a PBS series
    on architecture.  Pretty smart, talented guy.  That last bit's from
    1988's <i>The Way Things Work</i>, his tome of plain-talk and illustrated
    explanations of commonplace devices.  Could Macauley have known that so
    many of his juvenile-aimed jaunts describing a fictional cartoon mammoth's
    integral place in technology's advance might so aptly comment upon Toe's
    <i>Variant</i> some twelve years hence?</p><p>
    
    Apparently, Toe's been on that ""mammoth-as-instrument"" trajectory Macauley
    wrote about for some time.  Here, leader David Pavkovic's ""securely
    tethered beast"" is Yoko Noge, whose Japanese avant-nightclub rants render
    <i>Variant</i>'s opener, ""Absolutism 2,"" a tribal-- some might say
    ""pachydermal""-- throwback to art-rock's pre-history. ""Vacation"" again
    features Yoko, this time woolier still as the nonsense-spewing, blue
    velvet-sporting chanteuse fom a bar scene I'm relieved David Lynch had
    the good sense not to film.  Pavkovic's drums stop and start jazzily
    enough in the dark heart of this number and his Oval-esque keys trickle
    along congruently.  But when Yoko lumbers into Pavkovic's pauses, the
    experimentalist tone is punctured in ways all too familiar to those of
    us who never preferred John Lennon's ""better half.""</p><p>
<i>""Although the instruments often grew restless during rehearsals, the
    twelve musicians, comprising four tusk-tappers, four stomach-thumpers
    and four tail-twangers, became highly proficient at playing them.""</i></p><p>
    
    Hmm... a fantastical modern mammoth orchestra.  Toe (formerly Toe 2000--
    modern!) comprises an ensemble just about as esoteric as Macauley
    envisions, but much less interesting to listen to.  Pavkovic and Noge
    are joined by Tortoise phenom and consistently listenable Jeff Parker
    on guitar.  His loose and understated phrasework opens ""Absolutism 1,""
    but is brutally stampeded by Yoko Noge's unaccompanied intrusion just
    after the four-minute mark.  The ubiquitous Doug McCombs contributes in
    your basic ""guy from Tortoise"" mode, his talents lost to over-sampling
    on ""Vacation,"" and later, to Yoko's mewling.</p><p>
    
    And how sure were you that Tim Kinsella had already wasted enough of
    your time?  <i>Variant</i> also manages to squeeze in his vocal
    panhandling.  His pitiable melodrama masquerades as art on no fewer
    than three of these tracks, most notably ""Totalism.""  A barely audible
    Kinsella whispers exactly the type of drivel I never want to hear again,
    timing his utterances to fill the sections of drum-machined lounge
    dirge not made hideous by Noge's croaking inane howling: ""You will
    perform a manuever/ To satisfy your reintroduction.""  If I'm not
    trying very hard to translate exactly what Tim and Yoko are singing
    about, it's because, given the context, I couldn't give a shit less.</p><p>
<i>""The popularity of massed mammoth music reached its peak with the
    creation of the Mammoth Tabernacle Choir.""</i></p><p>
    
    Right now, you're annoyed by my reliance on this gimmick to underscore
    the pointlessness of Toe's <i>Variant</i>.  I'm guessing that's because
    you haven't actually heard Toe's <i>Variant</i>. Its vague and thinly
    composed drums-and-synth architecture sways in the wind of Noge's breathy
    pretensions, and topples due to its essential songlessness.  Of ten
    tracks, only ""New"" commands any attention, a tinkled piano melody dusted
    over undulating bass and drums.  The track recalls Sam Prekop's solo work,
    but is hardly on par with it.</p><p>
    
    The same way David Macauley's idiotic, mastodon-concerned sidebars
    pointlessly interrupt an otherwise informative children's book, Toe
    (and Yoko Noge's avant-garbage, in particular) contributes nothing
    to the cause it aligns itself with.  Like a joke you have to explain,
    <i>Variant</i> is very little effort, effortlessly wasted.</p></div>"|8093.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8093-variant/|0.8|Judson Picco

First of all, they call themselves
    part of a ""collective."" When I think of a ""collective,"" my geeky mind immediately turns
    to the Borg. And while, as far as I know, the Elephant 6'ers aren't planning any kind of
    sinister interplanetary takeover, the comparison is quite appropriate. Elephant 6 artists,
    especially the Olivia Tremor Control, have managed to assimilate the better aspects of
    several genres-- from '60s pop and rock to electronica and R&amp;B--; into an easy-to-stomach
    pop-tinted form.</p><p>
    Still, ""collective"" may not be quite the right word.  It's just too technical and non-
    descript. I looked it up, and Merriam-Webster defines a collective as ""a cooperative unit
    or organization."" Big deal. A bunch of my friends and I could sell lemonade on the street
    corner and call ourselves ""The Citrus 3 Collective."" That's no fun. No, the Elephant 6
    Collective should be called ""The Cult of the Six Elephants."" That's right, cult.</p><p>
    So what makes the Elephant 6 collective a cult? Mystery and intrigue. Almost every aspect
    of the Elephant 6 is a mystery wrapped in an enigma wrapped in a jewel case. Neutral Milk
    Hotel frontman Jeff Magnum has now supposedly joined the circus. A band called Frosted
    Ambassador, which I understand to be Olivia Tremor Control drummer Eric Harris' band,
    released an album which was supposedly discovered in a potter's shoebox. (Yeah, I know!)
    But as for the Olivia Tremor Control themselves, they've been relatively free of scandal.
    Frontmen Will Cullen Hart and Bill Doss have never shrouded themselves in any kind of
    mystery. Until now.</p><p>
    For months now, rumors of an Olivia Tremor Control breakup have spread like wildfire. The
    band has stopped touring, Bill Doss is now working on his Sunshine Fix Project, and Elephant
    6 message boards are buzzing with ""direct from the band"" breakup statements. And as if all
    this weren't a compelling enough argument that Olivia is about to bite the dust, the band
    has now presented their fans with <i>Singles and Beyond</i>-- a compilation of hard-to-find 
    EPs, singles, and compilation appearances-- to remind us just how much Will and Bill will
    be missed.</p><p>
    For relatively new Olivia-obsessives, <i>Singles and Beyond</i> is great. Highly sought-after
    early EPs such as <i>The Giant Day</i>, and the band's first release, <i>California Demise</i>,
    which dates back to when Jeff Magnum was still a member of the OTC, are compiled onto a single
    $12 CD. Also included are countless singles and compilation appearances, many of which have
    been all but unavailable until now.</p><p>
    ""Love Athena"" and ""Today I Lost a Tooth,"" both from the <i>California Demise</i> EP, kick off
    <i>Singles and Beyond</i> with some of the best pop tunes ever written by the Olivias. Fuzzy
    guitars play indelible hooks while Hart and Doss sing abstract lyrics in heavenly harmonies.
    <i>California Demise</i> proves to be a record in the same vein as the group's first full-length,
    <i>Dusk at Cubist Castle</i>-- excellent lo-fi pop songs with a few well-placed bits of
    electronics and found noise. Additional highlights come with ""Beneath the Climb,"" from a long
    out-of-print Cassiel Records compilation, and ""I'm Not Feeling Human,"" from the <i>Giant Day</i>
    EP.</p><p>
    Unfortunately, the odds-and-sods nature of <i>Singles and Beyond</i> prevents it from packing
    the same punch as the band's two full-length albums, <i>Dusk at Cubist Castle</i> and <i>Black
    Foliage</i>. Both of those records, particularly <i>Black Foliage</i>, were well-hinged epics,
    centering on indecipherable though clearly present themes. With each track, these records drew
    you in with a perfectly balanced blend of pop melodies and noisy arrangements. Adding to the
    overwhelming depth was the multi-faceted collage nature of the recordings. Bizarre sounds were
    referenced multiple times throughout the records, making familiar friends of these decidedly
    alien noises. Now, for the first time on an Olivia Tremor Control album, we're presented with
    a collection of songs instead of a full album, and the result is suitably less compelling.</p><p>
    While <i>Singles and Beyond</i> may just be a collection of songs, it is nonetheless a collection
    of Olivia Tremor Control songs, and a must-have for any fan. For the first time in ages, fans can
    command a relatively complete collection of the band's singles and EPs without taking out a second
    mortgage. As for me, I'm stashing away the $12 I was planning to spend on the <i>Giant Day</i> EP
    in the desperate hope that someday soon there will be a brand spankin' new Olivia Tremor Control
    record for me to purchase. Unfortunately, my psychic inclination senses that this may be the
    band's final release.</p></div>"|5981.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5981-singles-and-beyond/|7.8|Matt LeMay

    to meet up with a few alumni friends at the college we graduated from last
    year. We ended up sitting around in once-familiar (now unfamiliar) campus
    houses, without even a buzz to speak of. While in one of these houses, I
    actually resorted to watching TV. VH1 was offering their, ahem, definitive
    list of the 100 Greatest Bands of Hard Rock, complete with James Hetfield and
    Henry Rollins, among others, waxing critical about the historical significance
    of second-rate tripe like Alice in Chains and Stone Temple Pilots.</p><p>
    While I was nicely surprised by some inclusions-- Fugazi (#95), the Pixies
    (#81), Hüsker Dü (#68), and Jane's Addiction (#35), for instance-- I was
    mostly appalled.  Like I didn't see it coming.  First, there was the problem
    of order. Mötley Crüe are #29, while the Rolling Stones were covered only
    briefly at #67. Good one! There was also a noticeable lack of coherent
    determining criteria.  Judging by their list, I'd guess the editors at VH1
    consider the Red Hot Chili Peppers (#30) and Foo Fighters (#72) ""hard rock,""
    but not David Bowie. There were, of course, countless other omissions,
    particularly in the area of punk.  New York Dolls, the Stooges, and the Sex
    Pistols appear at numbers 60, 27 and 12, respectively.  But Wire, Gang of
    Four, and Television-- all left out.</p><p>
    And left out in favor whom?  I've already mentioned four poor choices, and
    there are plenty more. Korn (#53), anyone?  Looking down the list, it becomes
    apparent that VH1 really means ""heavy metal"" when it says ""hard rock"": Iron
    Maiden (#24), Pantera (#45), the Scorpions (#46), Slayer (#50), Megadeth (#69),
    Ratt (#79)-- and that's just a few. But people, please.  Do I really need to
    continue after Ratt?  Okay, one more: Quiet Riot (#100).</p><p>
    The way some critics have drooled over Cave In's second true full-length,
    <i>Jupiter</i>, you'd think the band would be destined to make this list when
    VH1 revises it in 2010. Some company this Boston four-piece would have.  But,
    in all seriousness, they'd fit right in-- from their music all the way down to
    their pomposity: visiting their website, you'll be met by a Shockwave Flash
    intro that reads, ""The future of music is on <i>Jupiter</i>.  Perception will
    be altered. Preconceptions will be shattered. <i>Jupiter</i> has landed.""  I
    believe Damon Albarn said it all with his timeless phrase, ""Woo-hoo.""</p><p>
    I wish I could tell you what the site says after that, but it's so
    graphics-heavy that it ground my computer to a halt. Now replace ""site"" with
    ""album,"" and ""my computer"" with ""my brain"": this is how I responded to
    <i>Jupiter</i>.  The album might betray fans of Cave In's earlier albums,
    1999's <i>Beyond Hypothermia</i> (a collection of various sessions) and
    <i>Until Your Heart Stops</i>. Their metal roots are still apparent, but
    their new sound will, uh, shatter preconceptions. Their last release, the
    <i>Creative Eclipses</i> EP, hinted at this development, but only now have
    Cave In fully suffused their music with heavy prog and space-rock
    flourishes.</p><p>
    Admittedly, the opening title track isn't much of a departure.  ""Jupiter"" rips
    open with some standard chunky riffs while frontman Steve Brodsky gives it his
    trademark high-school talent show best with lines like, ""The metronome is wrong
    again/ My heart has surely gone and skipped a beat."" Only with the vocal
    mirroring of a Middle Eastern-style guitar lick does it become apparent that
    things are different this time around. The next track, ""In the Stream of
    Commerce,"" straddles the line. The chorus remains derivative hard rock,
    stuffed with present-day Weilandisms, but the verse offers lofty, reverberated
    guitar stylings and even a hackneyed falsetto. We all know who also sounds
    like this, so I'm not going to say the R-word. (Rush; #28)</p><p>
<i>Jupiter</i> moves further away from its metal leanings as it progresses.
    The seven-minute ""Big Riff"" contains just that, along with some guttural,
    ""I'm going to eat your children"" vocals, but, as suggested by its length,
    there's plenty of heads-down string-picking. During these moments, Cave In
    resemble a directionless version of Hum.  Meanwhile, ""Innuendo and Out the
    Other"" is like a long, drawn out version of ""Black Hole Sun"" with no chorus;
    the nine-minute ""Requiem"" is more self-indulgent, um, post-metal-- only longer;
    ""Decay of the Delay"" is an angular, if overly consistent instrumental. And
    the closer, ""New Moon,"" moves from an acoustic opening to a raucous, metal
    climax.  Which, as you know, has never been done before.</p><p>
    If you still have a soft spot for heavy metal, but can't bring yourself to dig
    up those old Def Leppard (#31) records, <i>Jupiter</i>'s just what you've been
    searching for. It's metal without the guilt; in other words, it's arty metal--
    which is why some critics have embraced it (this, by the way, is also why
    Queens of the Stone Age have received so much undeserved press). But
    <i>Jupiter</i> actually makes me yearn for those old Leppard records, if only
    to hear the real thing.</p></div>"|1362.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1362-jupiter/|4.9|Ryan Kearney

    and a music producer is. After thinking it over for a few seconds, I responded,
    ""Film producers are rich and provide financial backing. Music producers are geeks and
    provide knob twiddling."" Granted, my response doesn't quite capture the complex roles
    of either film producer or music producer.  Shit, I could be completely wrong, for all
    I know.  But it sounded good at the time.</p><p>
    Perhaps my image of a typical music producer/engineer has been tainted by Steve Albini.
    Due in no small part to his reputation, as well as the interviews I've read, I've always
    pictured him sitting behind a recording console, muttering obscenities to himself,
    encouraging bands to their faces and dissing them behind their backs.  ""Great take, Gavin.
    I can tell this record is going to be huge. You're a fucking genius."" That night: ""Can
    you believe I'm recording an album by fucking Bush? These guys are fucking idiots. They
    don't know the first thing about recording an album. They probably think a compressor
    is something you put your garbage in!""</p><p>
    Albini's career as a musician hasn't done anything to discourage his image as a total dick.
    With Big Black and the oh-so-classy Rapeman, he recorded songs about pedophilia, self-
    immolation, and alcoholism. Albini has always played the sarcastic fuck on his records,
    his abrasive guitar and unpolished vocals egging on the listener. But <i>1000 Hurts</i>
    confirms what previous Albini records have only hinted at. Behind the cynical, hypocritical
    façade is a pissed off geek.  And with this record, Albini has finally given his inner
    Elvis Costello a voice.</p><p>
    For starters, the album's title is a geeky in-joke. <i>1000 Hurts</i> = 1000 hertz, or 1
    kilohertz. The album's inner sleeve is printed to look like an oscilloscope.  Its opening
    track, ""Prayer to God,"" begins with a deep voice running through the technical specifications
    of the album's recording.  And then the rocking begins.  Steve Albini's guitar blasts pure
    distorted treble as he pleads, ""To the one true God above/ Here is my prayer... / There are
    two people here/ And I want you to kill them."" As fellow producer Bob Weston on bass and
    Todd Trainer on drums bust the track open, Albini delves into the specifics of his request
    for the death of his ex. ""Her, she can go quietly/ By disease or a blow/ To the base of her
    neck."" Her new beau is not spared: ""Him, just fucking kill him/ I don't care if it hurts/
    Yes I do/ I want it to.""</p><p>
    What Albini's voice and lyrics convey here is a combination of anguish, self-importance, and
    helplessness. He's not going to kill his ex-girlfriend and her new flame; he asks God to do
    his dirty work for him. By the end of the track, ""Fucking kill him"" has become a mantra.
    Weston and Trainer pound their instruments like doped-up gorillas.  The intensity makes
    ""primal"" sound like something British people drink with breakfast.</p><p>
    The rest of <i>1000 Hurts</i> shows Shellac in prime form. Since the release of <i>Terraforms</i>,
    they seem to have realized that 12-minute rock songs don't rock. This record's longest track,
    ""Mama Gina,"" clocks in at an appropriate 5:44, long enough to fully flesh out the song, but not
    so long that the groove gets tired.  The only major objection here comes with the uninteresting,
    pretentious, but mercifully short ""New Number Order.""  At 1:40, the track could easily have been
    left out.</p><p>
    But as harsh and abrasive as it sounds, <i>1000 Hurts</i> is an undeniably strong release. This
    album rocks hard, despite the fact that the man behind it is a squishy A/V club member with a bad
    attitude.  So it seems that Albini's success as a producer hasn't greatly improved his personal
    life.  Luckily, the same can't be said for his records.</p></div>"|7107.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7107-1000-hurts/|8.3|Matt LeMay

Mark Twain himself translated it to     English, although I doubt it made it to the bedside of too many American     kids. This illustrated book is comprised of short lyrics describing the     horrific things that happen to naughty children: Cruel Frederick is attacked     by his own maltreated dog; Pauline plays with matches and burns to death     while her cats watch; Conrad the thumbsucker winds up with his thumbs cut off     by the red-legged scissor-man. I don't need to go on. There's something so     downright un-American about the whole grisly affair, something alien about     the gleeful proximity of children to violence and mutilation. Fortunately, I     was a college German student when I encountered <i>Struwwelpeter</i>, and it     freaked me out even then. Yet <i>Spirit They're Gone, Spirit They've Vanished</i>,     the incredible but bizarre release by Avey Tare and Panda Bear brings the     fates of those luckless kraut kinder back to mind.</p>
<p>The marriage of psychedelia and fairy-tale imagery goes back at least to ""Lucy     in the Sky with Diamonds""; Pink Floyd's <i>Piper at the Gates of Dawn</i>, the     Dead's <i>Aoxomoxoa</i>: the first flowering of psychedelia was joyously     regressive, celebrating juvenilia as the antidote to modern rationality. Yet     what was indelibly excised was menace-- what the gnomes and newspaper taxis     conceal. Remember the boat ride through the tunnel in the movie <i>Charlie and     the Chocolate Factory</i>? In the middle of this sucrose wonderland, there's     something fucking awful.</p>
<p>Don't choke on the references.  Forget them.  Avey Tare and Panda Bear's <i>Spirit     They're Gone, Spirit They've Vanished</i> is a masterful piece of electro-acoustic     fairy-tale music; yet its squealing electronics, and vitrified rhythms suggest     something darker. Like a Snickers bar with a razorblade in it.</p>
<p><i>Spirit They're Gone</i> is Avey Tare's album; he sings, and plays guitars,     pianos, and electronics.  Panda Bear, meanwhile, mans the crumpled percussion.     The album opens with the high-frequency squall and delicate vocals of ""Spirit     They've Vanished,"" offering little clue about future directions. However, the     second track, ""April and the Phantom"" is crystallizing: expert acoustic guitars,     fierce drumming and Daltrey-esque screams resemble the Who resurrected as the     seventh member of the Elephant 6. Tinkling toy pianos, organs and exclamations     of digital noise round out the track, while Tare perilously insists, ""She ran     out of nature,"" again and again.</p>
<p>The wistful ""Penny Dreadfuls"" lays simple piano over needled electronics     reminiscent of Pita or Christian Fennesz in a kind of lysergic dirge on the     end of childhood. ""Chocolate Girl"" is dubbed-out calliope music, swirling and     swirling: a strange meditation seemingly on sexual awakening, awkward but     erotic in the midst of an enchanted forest of an album. The interstellar     Nintendo drone of ""Everyone Whistling"" is irresistible space-pop, backed by     some incredibly nimble jazz drumming. The twelve-minute ""Alvin Row"" is an epic     closer, emerging from free-noise clatter, insect electronics and demented     piano into sunny Beatlesque psych-pop. ""Can you hear me, troubadour?"" Tare     asks before the eruption of furious ivories. Schlock horror organs abound and     the cymbals crash like storms. The album collapses into the crackly sample of     a child (Alfalfa from the Little Rascals?) saying, ""My singing voice is gone...     My singing voice is gone... My singing voice is gone...""</p>
<p><i>Spirit They're Gone, Spirit They've Vanished</i> is not only outstanding,     but one of the most original sounding albums out there. This record, as I've     said, marries the pleasant and the violent and is not for timid ears: the     sparkling pop never strays far from the lacerating noise. The lyrics are     largely indecipherable but occasional gems and wonderful turns of phrase     emerge from the bright din. Two mysterious fellow travelers (one-half of the     four-man Animal collective) seem to have stumbled upon each other and created     something truly beautiful. The only question is: which one of them is the     walrus?</p></div>"|7940.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7940-spirit-theyre-gone-spirit-theyve-vanished/|8.9|Brent S. Sirota

    Within the first moments of <i>In a Different City</i>, it becomes clear that Bablicon's music
    will be all but impossible to lump into any particular genre.  Soprano sax spits pure treble,
    thumping rock bass rumbles like the San Andreas Fault, and Jeremy Barnes' manic barrage of
    drummery beats you into rhythmic submission.  The elements combine to create a sound both
    artful and agreeable. Whether grooving on an ever-repeating bassline (""Francis Locrius"")
    or going off on an improvisational tangent (""The Green Line""), Bablicon toss almost Koufaxian
    curveballs, throwing the unexpected your way at the last second.</p><p>
    
    Even with all the stylish improvisation, unconventional sounds, and throbbing bass guitar,
    the single most riveting aspect of Bablicon's sound remains Barnes' drumming.  Barnes doesn't
    play the drums-- he assaults them.  I saw Bablicon play live a few months ago, and at regular
    intervals, Barnes stood up, walked around to the back of his kit, and pummeled the shit straight
    out of it.  By the end of the band's 45-minute improv jam, a pool of Barnes' sweat had
    accumulated in his snare, splashing up in his face with every beat.</p><p>
    
    But despite their wealth of musical expertise, Bablicon never succumbs to pretentiousness. From
    the communal yelps and hollers of ""At the Birthday Party"" to what sounds like a distorted
    theremin on ""Rhinoceros,"" these guys never take themselves too seriously. The result is some of
    the most fun, generally wacky music that could ever be labeled ""experimental.""</p><p>
    
    To the world, Bablicon will likely remain just one of a seemingly infinite number of Neutral
    Milk Hotel side projects, despite <i>In a Different City</i>'s complete dissemblance to Jeff
    Magnum's nightmarish opuses.  Instead, imagine a 15-foot tall yeti, with 18 drumstick-brandishing
    arms, a soprano sax in its mouth, and huge feet crushing every pretentious jazz musician in its
    path...</p></div>"|509.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/509-in-a-different-city/|8.2|Matt LeMay

    transcendentalists of the 19th century. You know how it would it go: ""In
    <i>Walden</i>, his masterpiece of transcendent ideology, Henry David Thoreau
    wrote, 'I went to the woods because I wished--"" I don't even need to finish
    the sentence, do I? Quoting from Ralph Waldo Emerson's <i>Nature</i> might be
    more tactful, but barely. His lecture, <i>The Transcendentalist</i>, is a more
    obvious, if less-cited source, but the quotes are all too vague.</p><p>
    
    Invoking these writers would be too easy, too obvious, and certainly too
    academic, not to mention slightly inaccurate: ""Transcendentalism"" was a
    spiritual movement; Steve Earle simply has ""transcendental blues,"" which is
    quite different. Therefore, I'm not going to start my review in such a way.</p><p>
    
    Now, I could pull out <i>Webster</i> and define ""transcendental"" for you, but
    that wouldn't suffice because the definition, by its very nature, precludes a
    definitive definition. Earle, likewise, struggles with the idea of
    transcendence in his liner notes. He humorously contests one definition--
    ""the act of going through something""-- by writing, ""Ouch. I see plate glass
    windows and divorces."" Finally, he arrives at the conclusion that
    ""transcendence is about being still enough long enough to know when it's time
    to move on.""</p><p>
    
    But I don't want to start with liner notes, either.</p><p>
    
    So maybe I should tell a personal story of dubious relevance, as is my wont.
    There's the time I awoke at midnight at 11,000 feet on Mt Rainier. The full,
    blue moon ignited the top layer of the endless cloud a few hundred feet below
    us-- a sight I've never seen outside of an airplane. Or maybe I could tell
    the story about when I hallucinated atop a cemetery hill. I walked in a tight
    circle for almost an hour because, as I explained later, ""I needed to reassure
    myself of my physical presence in the world.""</p><p>
    
    But that's my literary crutch, so I musn't indulge.  Which leaves me with a
    final instance of transcendence: the album itself.  The title track opens the
    record with a harmonium that's quickly interrupted by-- yes-- a bleep. But
    after some soft thumping reminiscent of Yo La Tengo's latest, the song
    progresses into the exemplary roots-rock that one expects from Earle, replete
    with lines like, ""Happy ever after 'til the day you die/ Careful what you ask
    for, you don't know 'til you try.""</p><p>
    
    Maybe because he doesn't want to surprise the listener, Earle waits a bit
    before displaying his expanded sound. The next two tracks continue in a
    similar roots-rock vein, although each is decidedly unique. Then, in a single
    stroke of apparent ease, Earle delivers ""I Can Wait,"" a dead-on excursion into
    the reflective, laid-back country groove the Jayhawks have made a career of.</p><p>
    
    Earle finally breaks out with the Cash-ian ballad ""The Boy Who Never Cried.""
    As Earle's unaccompanied voice establishes the story of the boy, a harmonium
    again rises up, soon joined by a unobtrusive 12-string. But as the song builds,
    Earle slowly infuses it with perfectly placed, emotive orchestral hooks. Then,
    all is stripped down as he delivers the clincher in a strained, Dylan-esque
    fashion: the boy lived alone until death, at which point, ""He shed a single
    tear for a boy who never cried.""</p><p>
    
    After a couple of Irish jigs (of sorts), the pace slows down again for
    ""Lonelier Than This,"" which, in its subtle power, is on par with early
    Springsteen. Likewise for ""Halo 'Round the Moon,"" a song that checks in after
    a few more top-shelf roots-rockers. ""Until the Day I Die"" is another valiant
    attempt at creating a bluegrass classic worthy of Mr. Monroe (one of Earle's
    professed goals). After ""All of My Life,"" an invigorating italicized <i>rock</i>
    song, the album is rounded out by ""Over Yonder (Jonathan's Song),"" a plaintive,
    mandola-sprinkled epitaph of sorts with a fitting, regretful conclusion:
    ""Shinin' down on all of them that hate me/ I hope goin' brings 'em peace.""</p><p>
    
    Earle's music doesn't simply mirror the transcendence of its creator; it
    lends transcendence to the listener as well, as all excellent music will.
    But what truly makes this one of Earle's best records is that he refuses to
    be pulled down by musical decisions. It's as if he never faced a problem of
    whether or not to add this or that instrument, or to veer off in this or that
    direction. He simply had the idea and went with it. This is one manifestation
    of transcendent thought: there's no such thing as indecision because an idea
    necessarily ignites action.</p></div>"|2645.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2645-transcendental-blues/|8.1|Ryan Kearney

    what the bastard offspring of David Bowie and Robyn Hitchcock might sound like.
    To try to quell my obsession, I've done everything from pasting pictures of
    Hitchcock's head onto Bowie's body, to hacking into hotel computers to make their
    reservations coincide. My plan almost worked, too, as Bowie did make obvious
    advances towards Hitchcock. Unfortunately, Hitchcock replied with a firm ""sod
    off"".  Maybe it was the bum eye.</p><p>
    
    Luckily, this infatuation of mine has finally come to a halt. It's a good thing,
    too; my next plot involved somehow irradiating the two pop legends, which might
    have proven harmful to both of them (and probably myself).  Instead, I've
    settled for Destroyer, who have finally proven what months of madcap antics
    only suggested: a Bowie-Hitchcock hybrid would kick ass.</p><p>
    
    Of course, this particular hybrid isn't perfect. At his best, frontman Daniel
    Bejar sounds like Robyn Hitchcock singing David Bowie songs with Guided by Voices
    lyrics.  At his worst... well, at his worst he sounds exactly the same, only
    worse.  (How's that for critical insight?)  The portions of <i>Thief</i> that
    prominently feature Bejar's talents as a vocalist and songwriter never fail to
    please, but when his bandmates step into the spotlight, it's the listener that
    gets burned.</p><p>
<i>Thief</i> opens with the very Hitchcock-esque ""Destroyer's the Temple"", a
    track which has already reached cult hit status on college radio stations
    across the country. Over plucked nylon guitar and rumbling bass, Bejar yelps
    lines like, ""Though the solitudes have won, I cannot begin to crave you/
    Please spring us, Madeline, from the rusty jails of lust we live in."" What's
    he talking about? I don't care. He sounds like Robyn Hitchcock's demented
    Canadian half-brother, and that's pretty damn cool.</p><p>
    
    But just when you think you've got Destroyer pegged as a Soft Boys cover band,
    strands of Bowie DNA begin to pop up in Bejar's genome.  ""Canadian Lover/Falcon's
    Escape"" is a perfect example of Bejar's formula, going from a laidback Hitchcock
    acoustic number to an (early) Bowie sonic barrage, with added bits of harpsichord
    and heavily altered guitar sounds.</p><p>
    
    Yes, the first five songs on <i>Thief</i> rock. Unfortunately, the sixth, ""Every
    Christmas"", shatters any shot the album had at being all-around excellent, and
    from that point on, the record is a mixed bag. High points like ""In Dreams""
    mesh with wanky instrumental filler like ""I.H.O.J."" and ""M.E.R.C.I."" It's hard to
    believe that someone capable of cranking out an excellent pop tune like ""The Way
    of Perpetual Roads"" cannot realize that these songs sound like shit.  My advice
    to Bejar: keep the band.  Just don't let them out of their cages.</p></div>"|2292.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2292-thief/|7.9|Matt LeMay

    the insipid cavalcade of decorative fiberglass bovines that now decorates the streets of
    the city. Much has been said degrading these motionless beasts, but in all honesty, I
    rather like the cows. Sure, they're ugly. Sure, the majority of them amount simply to
    cow-related corporate plugs. Shit, I can even get over the fact that the entire Cow Parade
    concept was snatched from Chicago, who originally stole it from Stockholm.  But I like the
    cows because they make tourists look stupid.</p><p>
    
    Of course, I'm looking at this from the point of view of a stuck-up native New Yorker. Yes,
    I realize that people who don't live here want to enjoy all that the city has to offer. But
    when it's Monday morning and I'm on my way to work, few things are more irritating than some
    asshole from Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan in an I Love New York t-shirt stopping directly in front
    of me and pointing in amazement at some completely uninteresting structure as if to say, ""Look!
    A moderately tall building! I've never seen one of those before! I must stand here directly
    in the middle of the street, taking many, many pictures!""  But though tourists look foolish
    having their pictures taken in front of even legitimate New York landmarks, nothing is less
    dignified than having your picture taken in front of a painted fiberglass cow.</p><p>
    
    Just as fiberglass cows make tourists look stupid, ""Cow"", the 30-minute long b-side to Smog's
    <i>Strayed</i> single makes Drag City Records look stupid. When you started reading this,
    you probably thought <i>we</i> were stupid for running a review of a single from a record that
    we already covered several months ago. And believe me, I damn near passed up <i>Strayed</i> when
    I saw it for sale at my local indie record store. But upon examination of the disc, I was quite
    surprised to find-- denoted in small print on the back of the jewel case-- that the sought-after
    instrumental tape, ""Cow"", originally self-released in 1989, was featured as an extended b-side.
    So why didn't Drag City just issue ""Cow"", an eight-track instrumental noise epic, separately from
    <i>Strayed</i>?  Who knows?  Maybe after selling so many copies of Neil Hamburger's <i>Left for
    Dead in Malaysia</i>, they needed to stop making money for a while for tax purposes.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunate business decisions aside, ""Cow"" is a thoroughly interesting listen. It can best be
    described as a guitar-centered romp through atonal improvisation. Sound textures range from
    brain-melting, low-frequency feedback to trashy plucked guitar strings. Over the course of its
    30 minutes, ""Cow"" finds Bill Callahan extracting nearly every sound possible from his guitar.
    And while other sounds, such as sparse percussion, are occasionally added to the mix, ""Cow""
    remains an entirely organic-sounding piece, unadulterated by cheesy synthesized instrumentation.
    For such a generally low-key recording, there's an inherent enthusiasm present here-- when
    Bill Callahan milks a great riff or feedback blast from his guitar, he exploits it for all its
    worth, applying slight variations in tone, texture, and timing, but maintaining the sound's
    general framework.</p><p>
    
    I find it kind of amazing that ""Cow"" was released back in 1989.  Two years before <i>Spiderland</i>,
    Bill Callahan was hinting at the complex guitar textures and drones that would become such an
    integral part of the post-rock scene. The touches of avant-garde experimentalism found on Smog's
    recent LPs have often been attributed to producers Jim O'Rourke and John McEntire. ""Cow"" makes it
    clear that Callahan himself is capable of piling on the experimentalism without the aid of a
    producer.</p></div>"|7279.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7279-strayed-ep/|7.7|Matt LeMay

Oxes?  Technically, it should be ""Oxen,"" but if the band gave a shit     about things like grammar, they'd probably be teaching 10th grade English,     not recording split EPs with Big'N.  And speaking of Oxes, here's a band     that's pure grit-- a band that cuts through the crap and gets right to the     essence of what music is about: direct communication.</p><p>Spawned from the depths of Baltimore, Oxes capture the toughness of a city     that isn't cosmopolitan or flashy, and has an overwhelming distrust of anything     pretentious.  The rock is raw-- ain't no two ways about it.  Combining the     more Storm and Stress side of Don Caballero's polyrhythmic finger-tapping,     the balls-out roar of Big'N, and U.S. Maple's affinity for acoustic space and     deconstructed riffs, Oxes have invented their own unique style of in-your-face     rock.  And I mean <em>literally</em> in your face-- they play wireless.</p><p>Oxes make music that defies their being pigeonholed into existing genres, and     by doing so, they defy the physical laws of punk rock.  You won't find them     hugging their amplifiers.  In fact, you probably won't even find them in the     same <em>room</em> with their amplifiers.  The guitars rock with all the sharpness     of Shellac, but these guys can do it while stepping outside for a little fresh     air, or while pounding a few back at the bar. Wires are just another way for The     Man to keep them down, and Oxes ain't havin' none of it.</p>
<p>If this EP were comprised solely of Oxes material, it would have been a pretty     flawless release.  From the pulsing, siren-like screeching of the guitars on     ""And Giraffe: Natural Enemies"" through the highly amusing, self-referential     metaconversation on ""China, China, China"" (which features discussion about     ""vintage"" candy bars, layered atop an ambient soundscape of feedback and     noise), these Charm City ruffians have coughed up the most thoroughly enjoyable     rock of recent memory.</p>
<p>But mama said you should always share, and thus Oxes' three songs are countered     by three from Chicago's now-defunct Big'N.  Even though Big'N could throw down like     a bloodier-throated Shellac, their songs just sound a bit dull in comparison with     those of Oxes.  Not bad by any means, but the teacher has once again been     overshadowed by the student.  If anything, these two bands complement each other     brilliantly as an example of where this variety of raw rock has been, and where     it's headed.</p>

    sold off in college have a dependable friend in Royal Trux.  The band has the Drag
    City stamp of hipster approval, yet they get to make strutting, ballsy guitar rock
    that channels British Invasion blues, <i>Nuggets</i>-era garage, and mid-70s
    Aerosmith, all the while pretending that punk never happened. How did Royal Trux get
    so lucky, to have their ""Brown Sugar"" riff and play it, too? Maybe it's because some
    still look at what they do as some kind of ""commentary"" on tired rock conventions,
    so they slip under the post-modern radar.</p><p>
    
    If earlier, more difficult Royal Trux albums drew from non-mainstream skronk
    traditions, the albums they've made since leaving Virgin and returning to Drag City
    have been taking dramatic strides toward Freedom Rock territory. <i>Pound for Pound</i>,
    their second full-length in less than a year, continues this trend. Oddly, it's both
    Royal Trux's most consistent record in some time and their least interesting. This
    means that while they avoid godawful eight-minute jams like ""Blue is the Frequency""
    (from last year's <i>Veterans of Disorder</i>) that always seemed tacked on to court
    the <i>Wire Magazine</i> set, they also fail to produce any breakout, ass-blowing
    songs like ""I'm Ready"" or ""Yo Se!"". Instead, we get a capable, uninspired homage at
    FM rock history.</p><p>
    
    And it is homage, never theft. The circular chord progression, Latin-tinged bass and
    goofy conga fills of ""Small Thief"" bear striking similarities to Santana's ""Black Magic
    Woman"", true, but Neil Hagerty and Jennifer Herrema put their own unmistakable spin on
    the formula and make it their own. Same goes for the long, spacy ""Deep Country Sorcerer"",
    which borrows bits of its melody from ""House of the Rising Sun"".</p><p>
    
    But these so-so tunes aren't going to be popping up on anyone's mix tapes in three or
    four years, so all we're left with is a handful of memorable riffs: ""Platinum Tips"" has
    one almost Page-ian in its epic reach, but it lacks the round bottom of the master's
    finest. ""Sunshine and Grease"" spotlights chords that almost make you forget the banal
    lyrics.  (Almost.)  And ""Dr. Gone"" closes the album with a restatement of thesis, as
    the Trux drop a two-minute <i>drum solo</i> into the middle of a song the Carter-era
    J Geils Band would have been proud to call its own.  My memory has just been sold...</p></div>"|6856.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6856-pound-for-pound/|5.6|Mark Richard-San

    music to come along in the last ten years, and with his full-time band in their prime, Mason
    seems brimming over with new ideas.  The Beta Band are, thus far, best known for their 1999
    compilation album, <i>The Three EPs</i>.  Its borderline-folk melodies, inventive sampled and
    live percussion, acoustic guitar strumming, and bizarre special effects provided an airy,
    spacious foundation for Mason's warm, lazy vocals and infectious hooks.</p><p>
    Detractors insist <i>The Three EPs</i> falls apart around the halfway mark, when the seven-minute
    jam ""The House Song"" and the colossal fifteen-minute montage ""Monolith"" materialize.  But these
    songs, while far from being the band's most accessible pieces, exemplify the group's love for
    collage and their quest to map the unexplored regions of popular music.  And if these songs
    initially seem overwhelming, the entirety of the album's third EP, <i>Los Amigos del Beta Bandidos</i>,
    offers the record's finest example of the band's capabilities to fuse unique technological
    experimentalism with rootsy, sing-along choruses.</p><p>
    The band's self-titled, full-length debut came later in 1999, and while somewhat spottier
    than <i>The Three EPs</i>, it contains the band's greatest accomplishments.  It's worth slogging
    through the sampled body-noise and unfocused dance beat of ""Dance O'er the Border"" and the
    overlong, if joyous, chant of ""Number 15"" to reach such apexes of musical innovation as the
    dark, reflective psychedelia of ""The Hard One"", and the blissful, ingenious beauty of ""The
    Cow's Wrong"", both impossibly beautiful works.</p><p>
    But before all this, there was King Biscuit Time, frontman Steve Mason's less evolved, but
    equally sophisticated, solo project.  In 1998, the group's own label, Regal, released Mason's
    first four-track EP, <i>King Biscuit Time Sings Nelly Foggit's Blues in ""Me and the Pharoahs""</i>.
    Now, after languishing in obscurity, <i>Nelly Foggit's Blues</i> has been reissued in America
    as the second half of the new King Biscuit Time EP, <i>No Style</i>.</p><p>
<i>Nelly Foggit's Blues</i> opens on what initially seems like a startlingly dated note,
    with a spastic jungle beat and quaking bursts of bass.  But within seconds, Mason's distinct,
    casual baritone floats to the surface, soaked in boundless reverb and drug-haze.  In under
    three minutes, he delivers a rapid sung/spoken novel with the ease and fluidity of the
    Dismemberment Plan's Travis Morrison.  The track is balanced with muddy, nebular production.</p><p>
    The sparse ""Little White"", which consists of a simple keyboard part and layered vocals,
    spotlights the detached emotion in Mason's lyrics that is often buried under piles of
    exploding effects.  His indifference in the delivery of lines like, ""I'd love to love you/
    But I'll never know you,"" is the secret ingredient that makes them so affecting.  <i>Nelly
    Foggit's Blues</i> closes with ""Eye o' the Dug"", an early prototype of the Beta Band
    approach to creating music.  Mason recorded four separate, sped-up vocal parts that
    harmonize and play off one another as if they're all different people practicing a song
    they're still learning the lyrics to.</p><p>
    Of course, two years have passed since <i>Nelly Foggit's Blues</i> was released, and the
    intensive studio experience Mason gained while recording the massive Beta Band catalog
    is immediately identifiable.  <i>No Style</i> is a decidedly less-Beta affair than <i>Nelly
    Foggit's Blues</i>-- it showcases Mason's knack for incorporating incomparable melodies
    into ethereal and surreal drugscapes, and for blending organic and treated sounds into
    a seemingly innate marriage of technology and nature.</p><p>
<i>No Style</i>'s leadoff, ""I Walk the Earth"", is an upbeat excursion through labyrinthine
    dance rhythms and understated, multi-layered vocal parts that builds over six minutes into
    a highly melodic orgy of keyboard flourishes and attenuated chimes.  The record's instrumental
    track, ""Untitled"", is far more focused than <i>Nelly Foggit's Blues</i>' meandering ""Niggling
    Discrepancy""-- it extracts a crystalline melody from warm, electronic pings more closely
    associated with \xB5-Ziq and early Squarepusher.  ""I Love You"", on the other hand, takes all.  The
    best of these eight songs, it features Mason professing his devotion over cascading xylophones,
    gently picked guitar, and hallucinogenic acoustics.</p><p>
    Still, these EPs are less for the casual listener than they are for the die-hard.  Though
    they feature a great deal of top-shelf material, the two Beta Band full-lengths attempt

Correct me
    if I'm wrong, but to my knowledge, there hasn't been a violent outbreak in
    Seattle since that overzealous Granola-muncher threw a brick through a Starbucks
    Coffee window in 1997.  And why am I asking you?  Like you know, or give a shit.</p><p>
    
    Well.  The Murder City Devils are a gore-obsessed group of aspiring homicidal
    maniacs-turned-Computer-Age-sensitive hard-rockers-- not to mention the official
    spokespunks of the American Nightmare. They're also an image-conscious band of
    splatterpunk method actors hammering out riff-heavy generic punk-metal designed
    with the intent to inflict serious bodily harm.  'Course, if these songs caused
    even slight allergic reactions in lab mice, the world might be better off.
    Instead, the Devils force you to reconsider the worth of forgotten early 90s
    grungepuppies like Helmet and Alice in Chains. True, though, these phony
    prophets of urban apocalypse and doom do have their cute side.  So, with that
    said, we'll proceed with a thorough autopsy of the bloodied, mangled stiff of
    the album that is <i>In Name and Blood</i>.</p><p>
    
    Singer Spencer Moody fuses the angry growls of Billy Idol, James Hetfield, Layne
    Staley, and the Cult's Ian Astbury into a single vocal amalgam that defies all
    logical possibilities of style appropriation and synthesis.  The songs-- none of
    which are especially distinct-- all sport the same arrangements, chord progressions,
    and static tempos bumped along by clumsy drumkit-bashing. And, in a miraculous
    feat of economy, the Murder City Devils manage to squeeze out twelve 'different'
    songs from the same song.  Even more amazing is how two guitar dudes riffing on
    the same heavy-duty power chords manage to sound like only one guitar dude
    riffing on heavy-duty power chords.</p><p>
    
    What are the songs about? Just what you'd expect: kindergartners overdosing on
    refined sugar, a baseball player's suicide by baseball bat, beheaded babies,
    fatal paper cuts, amateur sheep-shearing contests, and unwanted puppies being
    doused with gasoline and set ablaze. They document the Devil's handiwork on
    Earth during the last 2000 years: all the carnage, famine, war, bestiality, and
    abject human suffering you can possibly imagine.</p><p>
    
    That would be great wouldn't it?  Sorry, kids.  The lyrics are as harmless as a
    disgruntled school cafeteria lady wielding a gravy ladle. Just check out the
    gut-tearing sentiments of ""Lemuria Rising"": ""I wish you could have been a fly on
    the wall/ When I was twelve years old/ I would slit my wrists if it weren't for
    rock n' roll,"" roars Moody. For further enjoyment, here are some more memorable
    Moody word-power moments: ""She was the prettiest girl in an ugly town""; ""Every
    time I put my oars in your water/ I do it for the sailors""; ""You built a ship/
    Put it in a bottle/ Then we watched it roll away.""  Uh, like, when do all the
    bloody entrails and gouged eyeballs come into play, guys?</p><p>
    
    I was shocked to learn that ""Somebody Else's Baby"" is not about a prison inmate
    whose wife just had another man's baby (see Merle Haggard).  In reality, it's
    just another innocuous song about some dork getting dumped.  As compensation,
    though, there's more mention of The Dark One on this record than in all of Ozzy
    Osbourne and Robert Johnson's output combined.  And that's a lot of Dark One.</p><p>
    
    These poor doomed souls simply get bogged down in too much muddy sludge-rock--
    not to be confused, of course, with that elusive phenomenon known as <i>punk</i>
    rock. Hence, <i>In Name and Blood</i> whips little-to-no ass.  In fact, most of
    these songs don't rock much harder than ""Rebel Yell,"" and many even seem to pay
    homage to it.  Leslie Hardy's spooky Farfisa-toned organ does give the songs a
    certain camp-sinister ""Munsters""-theme quality, I suppose.  But the only time
    the Devils live up to their namesake and commit actual murder is with their
    irony-laced disemboweling of Neil Diamond's ""I'll Come Running.""  The nugget
    goes to show that the band actually does have a sense of humor, and a damned
    clever one, at that. It's a totally fresh concept: crappy neo-metal band does
    awful cover of unlistenable easy listening song. Hilarious! Get in line behind
    Screeching Weasel, boys.</p><p>
    
    Conceptually, I'd say the Murder City Devils are pretty memorable.  But the
    music?  Well, I just finished listening to <i>In Name and Blood</i> about 10
    minutes ago, and I've already forgotten what it sounds like.  And that's pretty
    sad considering that I haven't even finished this review yet.</p></div>"|5509.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5509-in-name-and-blood/|3.1|Michael Sandlin

    It can be enticing, particularly when your judgment is impaired, but it's not
    enough to base a long-term relationship on.  Sean Tillmann (aka Har Mar
    Superstar) can normally be found releasing cynically emotive music as Sean
    Na Na.  Here, he adopts another silly alias (supposedly belonging to his
    younger brother, ""Harold Martin"") in order to release an album of R&amp;B; songs
    with titles like, ""Girl, You're Stupid"".</p><p>
    
    Har Mar comes off as the unholy offspring of New Edition's Ricky Bell, one
    of the less attractive members of 98 Degrees, and MC Paul Barman.  Amazingly,
    it's not as unpalatable as it sounds.  There's certainly plenty to poke fun
    at the ""urban"" genre, although the number of practitioners doing an adequate
    job of inadvertent self-parody makes this album somewhat gratuitous.  One of
    the great overlooked R&amp;B; twelve-inches of the past couple of years, TQ's
    ""Fuck Your Sister"", comes to mind.  Its smooth love-jam stylings seemed
    innocuous enough until the chorus, when it became clear that TQ was actually
    soliciting his girlfriend to hook him up with her sister.  Funnier still was
    the fact that the record included an instrumental version of the song.  With
    competition like that out there, Har Mar is a bold project for Tillmann to
    undertake.</p><p>
    
    The first track, ""Baby, Do You Like My Clothes?"" is an uncanny emulation of
    Color Me Badd, only in this case the sexing-up is on hold until baby improves
    her dated wardrobe.  ""Hypercolor tells me where my baby is hot,"" Har Mar croons,
    ""'cause I can see her sweatpants getting dark in the crotch.""  ""I Admit"" updates
    Berlin's late-80s hit ""Take My Breath Away"" with even cheesier keyboards and
    confessional boy/girl vocals, in which Har Mar and cohort Mandar come clean
    about brake-tampering and secret vasectomies.  ""Brand New Day"" is Har Mar at
    his poppiest, an enjoyable concoction of xylophone, wacky samples, and plenty
    of Minnesota references.</p><p>
    
    Despite the assistance of a number of collaborators-- most notably The Busy
    Signals, whose danceable beats serve as a foundation for Har Mar to rhyme
    over-- this album comes off fun but insubstantial. It's fundamentally a
    novelty record.  In other words, you may want to take Har Mar Superstar home
    for a night or two, but there's not much chance you're going to be playing
    him for your parents a few months from now.</p></div>"|3737.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3737-har-mar-superstar/|5.8|Meg Zamula

    and a couple of Beastie Boys, and dedicate this record review to those in
    Uzbekistan practicing the teachings of Sun Myung Moon.  Yes, these 843 words
    mark my commitment to the Unification Church's struggle for Religious Freedom
    in the former Soviet Territories.</p><p>
    Excuse my ridiculous gesture; it was inspired by the liner notes of Sinéad
    O'Connor's <i>Faith and Courage</i>, which state:</p><p>
<i>""Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit as it was in
    the Beginning. Is now and ever shall be. World without end. Jah! Rastafari!
    Read I!  This record is dedicated to all Rastafari people...""</i></p><p>
    From Michael Stipe's sporting of a different politically correct t-shirt each
    time he took the stage to accept another award for ""Losing My Religion"", to
    Sting watering the rainforest with song, pop icons who self-righteously espouse
    over-simplified global politics bug me.  I wasn't sure who ""the real enemy""
    was-- and I don't know if Sinéad did, either-- when she thrilled the MTV
    newsdesk by tearing up a photograph of Pope John Paul II and shouting ""Fight
    the real enemy!"" after her a capella performance of ""War"" on an October, 1992
    episode of <i>Saturday Night Live</i>.   But a decade later, the
    Roman-Catholic-lesbian-priestess seems as confused as ever.</p><p>
    While <i>Faith and Courage</i> is not as obviously embarrassing as Perry Farrell
    muttering, ""Like, torture is, like, <i>crazy</i>, man! Like, mothers are being,
    like, tortured!"" over the airwaves of the K-Rock-sponsored ""Radio Free Tibet""
    broadcast, the album does begin with the line, ""I have a universe inside me,""
    ends with, ""Christ have mercy,"" and somewhere in the middle, proclaims, ""I feel
    real cool and I feel real good/ Got my hair shaved off and black thigh boots.../
    And I feel real hot when my makeup's nice.""</p><p>
    Many adolescents go through mixed-up times, but most have the sense not to
    let Wyclef Jean remix their accounts of first love into a four-minute bowl
    of mush called ""Dancing Lessons"".  And sure, many teens fight the power of
    standard English by using replacements like ""U"" for ""you,"" but they most
    likely didn't get the idea after cashing in on a Prince song.  Most teens
    smash old hard-drives and burn their diaries in modesty and 20/20 hindsight;
    this diary is sold for $15 a pop to budding Earthmothers who quietly lurk
    in American suburbs, not quite fulfilled by Sarah McLachlan's last effort,
    but not quite ready for Juvenile.  And Sinéad O'Connor is 33.</p><p>
    The music is completely unremarkable, so let's discuss the lyrics.  The opening
    track, ""The Healing Room"", is the lyrical witness to a spectacular biological
    feat: ""I have a healing room inside me/ The loving healers there, they feed me.""
    I remember when I first heard Whitney Houston sing about having the ""greatest
    love of all"" inside of her, thinking it sounded like a tumor.  But that was the
    80s-- it's a new millennium now, and Sinéad, in an attempt to be part of the
    solution, is womb to an entire hospital.</p><p>
    The second song is titled ""No Man's Woman"".   It's not like anyone thought
    she was a ""man's woman"" before.  This song is similar to fellow countrywoman
    Paula Cole's work, only without the hilarious horsey antics, ""Yippy-eye,
    Yippy-yo!""  Those could have added a lot.</p><p>
    ""Daddy I'm Fine"" is based on the premise that ""fine"" equals wanting to ""stand up
    tall with my boobs upright,"" while delivering a yearning whine that unconvincingly
    tries to be Neil Young, in a rhythm unfortunately similar to R.E.M.'s ""It's the
    End of the World as We Know It."" ""The Lamb's Book of Life"" states: ""If we listen
    to the Rasta man/ He can show us how it can be done.""  Yes, Sinéad really says
    ""listen to the Rasta man."" Meanwhile, ""Emma's Song"" serves as the ultimate
    new-age cliché, involving goddesses, lovemaking, birthgiving, apologizing,
    Brian Eno's piano and production work, and <i>more</i> mentions of the healing
    room.</p><p>
<i>Faith and Courage</i> closes with the traditional ""Kyrie Eleison"", albeit
    ""radicalized"" with layers of rap and spoken word by Ghetto Priest, Junior
    Delgado, and Bonjo I.  The music which accompanies it is Sinéad's standard
    fare of 80s torch balladry updated with some canned slow-jam beats courtesy
    of R&amp;B; producer Kevin ""She'kspere"" Briggs (of Destiny's Child fame), and
    feathery symphonies of ""ooh-ahh's"" courtesy of market pressure and Lilith
    Fair influences.</p><p>
    The cover art features pastels, contemplation, a trinity of little fires,
    and a glowing portrait of Sinéad.  Remember how the aliens in the movie
    <i>Cocoon</i> glowed before they peeled off their skin at that geriatric bath
    house?  That was cool.  Sinéad's glow here warns of an inevitable Brian
    Dennehy-esque skin-peeling, and when it happens, she'll be putting her hand
    on the pulse of the Rasta man and transferring her life to him in a golden
    neon glow.  All this faith, and courage for you, Rastafari people.</p></div>"|5944.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5944-faith-and-courage/|3.8|Kristin Sage Rockermann

    Jeremy Barnes is a member of Neutral Milk Hotel), nobody's going to
    compare Bablicon to the Olivia Tremor Control or the Apples in Stereo.
    They're primarily an instrumental outfit that thrives on energetic
    improvisation, so more apt '60s comparisons would be Frank Zappa or Captain
    Beefheart's Magic Band. Even the Beefheart resemblance, which evokes an image
    of wide-ranging experimentation, is probably too limiting as Bablicon dabble
    in thoroughly modern ambient music and noise textures as well, working their
    way through a huge library of musical toys with both joy and skill. This
    kid-in-a-candy-store approach to raw sound is a huge part of this record's
    appeal, as the obvious pleasure Bablicon derive from making music together 
    carries over to the listener.</p><p>
    
    But if enjoying this record is easy enough, describing it is a bit tough.
    The elements that the trio deploys in the studio are many-- bass, piano,
    drums, xylophone, organ, electronics, saxophones, melodica, and surprisingly,
    no guitars-- and they use them all in unconventional ways. Drums sound
    beaten with hammers, piano strings are plucked by hand, keyboards are run
    through distortion pedals, and the arrangements are all screwy. The amazing
    thing, though, is that while this sounds like a formula for chaotic noise,
    it actually coalesces into highly listenable music with catchy melodies, deep,
    jazzy drumming and wide dynamics.</p><p>
    
    ""Anne on an Infibulus"" is a good example of the band's range. It begins with
    a random mish-mash of sound, then steers subtly toward a three-note bass pattern
    that propels the song into driving trance rock territory.  Finally, it fades into
    some kind of dreamy thumb piano coda. ""An Orange Moon"" swings almost as hard,
    working through squelching electronics over a fuzzy bass riff and forceful
    drumming, arriving at a dark, brooding organ pattern vaguely reminiscent of
    Booker T. and the MGs.</p><p>
    
    Variety is the order of the day throughout <i>The Orange Tapered Moon</i>,
    from the Carl Stalling horn figures of ""210(2)"" to the gorgeous prepared
    piano on ""The Well Tempered Alligator."" And, like true showmen, the band
    saves the best for last. The latter half of ""An Orange Pumpkin Glowing
    Music Ensemble,"" the album closer, is a glorious saxophone symphony that
    gazes skyward like spiritual free-jazz icon Albert Ayler.  It's a moving
    finish to an excellent record.</p></div>"|508.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/508-the-orange-tapered-moon/|7.8|Mark Richard-San

For whatever reason, these
    records tint every thought with their own unique spirit. I was born and raised in New York
    City. I've never been farther south than D.C. But when <i>Voice Brother and Sister</i> plays,
    I think back to days I spent as a child of seven years, sitting in a rocking chair on the back
    porch of my grandma's house in Georgia, spitting watermelon seeds through the gap between my
    two front teeth.</p><p>
    
    Up until now, the majority of Athens, Georgia musicians have been about as far removed from
    true ""southern music"" as a Canadian hip-hop DJ.  On <i>Voice Brother and Sister</i>, though,
    Summer Hymns fuse the dense pop stylings of fellow Athens musicians the Olivia Tremor Control
    with a distinctly southern, banjo-tinged flavor. The result is one of the most accessible
    albums to come out of the Athens psychedelic scene in a long time.</p><p>
<i>Voice Brother and Sister</i> opens with a very Olivia Tremor Control-inspired 48 seconds of
    impenetrable sound collage. Thankfully, those few seconds quickly give way to a series of
    spectacular country-tinged psychedelic rock tracks.  Summer Hymns' music is characterized by
    plucky banjo motifs, layered instrumental textures, dramatic dynamics changes, furious
    percussion, and singer Zachary Gresham singing schoolyard melodies in his laid-back, vaporous 
    tone.  But what really sets the band apart is their meticulous attention to detail. As
    carefully arranged as these songs are, <i>Voice Brother and Sister</i> never feels cold or
    calculated. On tracks like ""Mr. Brewer (Crackle, Crackle),"" and ""Stick Your Tail in the Wind,""
    gentle banjos, guitars, and xylophones join together in a hazy backyard jam session. You can
    almost see the fog coming out of your speakers.</p><p>
    
    The album's highlight comes with ""New Underdressment."" The song opens with a simple guitar part
    and vocal melody before bluegrass violins and additional vocal tracks slowly penetrate the mix.
    The number of individual melodies buried just beneath the song's surface is astounding.  A
    lesser band could have picked apart each beautifully dense track on the album into about
    20 generic psych-pop tunes.  But Summer Hymns made a conscious decision not to release a album
    until they felt that each song lived up to its full potential, and <i>Voice Brother and
    Sister</i> is that much better for it.</p></div>"|7563.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7563-voice-brother-and-sister/|8.8|Matt LeMay

    The man accentuated his cheesy influences-- Barry White, Prince, lounge pop-- with
    in-your-face concoctions of spliced foreign film and blaxploitation soundtracks.
    And he topped it all off by looking like Beck's emaciated Polish cousin and riding
    a white stallion to gigs.  What's more, Tenor had buckets of credibility from
    electronic mainstay Warp Records and was poised to bring his vision to the masses
    with a Matador distribution deal.  Last year's <i>Organism</i> was pretty good.
    This year's <i>Out of Nowhere</i> relatively sucks.  Where, one might ask, did it
    all go wrong?</p><p>
    
    It may have something to do with the fact that Tenor tucked away his sampling 
    equipment for this one, opting instead to command a <i>55-piece orchestra</i> (as
    the promotional packaging so proudly boasts) to realize his lofty pseudo-soundtrack
    ambitions.  Where's the blatant intergalactic funk?  You'd think he'd stick to what
    he's good at, but whatever.  Let's judge his wares.</p><p>
    
    The title track slides along quietly, almost trying not to draw attention to itself;
    it's ambient for the most part.  The <i>55-piece orchestra</i> only occasionally rears
    its ugly head to blare a few powerful notes, overwhelming the slight choral backing
    that appeared to help the track on its way.  It becomes ominous by the end, but not
    to momentous effect.  The skittering tabla rhythm and sitar swing of ""Hypnotic
    Drugstore"" follows, and is the first occurrence of a pronounced Bollywood influence.
    It's got groove potential, but Tenor's sorry vocal-- never his secret weapon-- pulls
    the rug from under its shoddy feet.  Piano tinkles herald the humdrum white-soul
    ambience of ""Paint the Stars,"" less a showcase of Jimi's compositional assets than
    of his orgasmic vocal pretensions.</p><p>
    
    An understated sax track later, we come to the first bonafide highlight of this
    ""ambitious"" and ""cinematic"" work, ""Blood on Borscht.""  While Tenor is no John Barry
    or Ennio Morricone, this track does provide <i>Out of Nowhere</i> with its one
    suitably insistent, memorably cinematic theme, apparently for a film that could
    have used a lot more blood-spilling.  As an added bonus, it exploits the latent
    potential of the <i>55-piece orchestra</i> moreso than any of the previous tracks.
    ""Backbone of Night"" relapses into Bollywood atmospherics, heightened by some late
    orchestral flourishes upon which Tenor lays a heavily treated but perfunctory vocal.</p><p>
    
    ""Spell"" finally cuts the crap and delivers the funking ass-swing.  The most welcome
    and catchy vocal on the album, Tenor coos, ""And I knew you'd be my baby/ When I saw
    the mole on your thigh,"" over a velvet party track.  There may be a string section
    lingering somewhere in the background, but the song is the solid product of some
    elastic bass, a tight hip-swinging backbeat, and a disco chorus.  Damn fine.</p><p>
    
    One of the final lyrical salvos on <i>Out of Nowhere</i> is ""Bear with me, baby/
    I'll keep it together.""  I only wish that were true.  Having braced myself for some
    shocking sci-fi porno-funk-- or, at the very least, some deft <i>Shaft</i>-esque
    usage of the mammoth <i>55-piece orchestra</i>-- I was ultimately greeted with the
    most boring, least outrageous album Jimi Tenor has produced.</p><p>
    
    A bewildering, unconvincing piece of work, it's hard to determine exactly what 
    the point of this record is.  Put simply, a personality like Jimi Tenor has no 
    right to be this unremarkable.</p></div>"|7972.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7972-out-of-nowhere/|5.3|S. Murray

    John Samson is a couple records deep into his career as strongest of the
    Weakerthans, a band who are punk politically, but emphatically pop
    aesthetically.  Regardless, the ""punk: dead or alive?"" quandary will likely
    dog him forever. Samson played bass in Propagandhi who were either lame-o
    peace-punk latecomers or brilliant protest rock of the first order, depending
    on your position along several endlessly complicated cultural and personal
    axes. If you're inclined to call ""Nailing Descartes to the Wall/(Liquid) Meat
    is Still Murder"" a great idea for a song title, you probably love the Props,
    but it's just as likely you prefer to get your politics explained and/or
    affirmed by people other than rock bands, in which case Propaghandi may well
    have grated on your nerves. In either case, Propaghandi may have answered the
    ""alive or dead"" question, but it's impossible to say uniformly which answer
    they indicated.</p><p>
    
    Samson, who writes, sings and plays a host of instruments in the Weakerthans,
    seems to have shed most of his previous band's preachy trappings, as well as
    their punky ones. Cynical wags might like to call the Weakerthans emo, since
    <i>Left and Leaving</i> is ass-deep in ballads about ""the outstanding bills of
    my heart."" But, despite a critic's deepest categorical longings, the tag
    doesn't exactly fit. Where emo emphasizes baroque song structures and
    wall-of-sound dynamics, Samson and company produce what often sounds like
    de-fanged pop-punk. All midtempo rhythms and three-note hooks, <i>Left and
    Leaving</i> is unwilling to give up the mohawked ghost. Emoizers like to talk
    a lot of game about elevating or artifying punk rock, but the Weakerthans are
    more preoccupied with using the form's greatest strengths. Even the weirdest
    stuff here speaks with gut-level urgency.</p><p>
    
    Though the band's work so far does bespeak boredom with punk's formal
    constraints, the Weakerthans don't experiment for the sake of experimentation
    alone, which is both their saving grace and greatest flaw. Thankfully, none of
    the arrangements on the album seem motivated by the need to prove that Samson
    is a savvy, sophisticated guy after all (even on the one that starts out kinda
    sounding like Cat Power), but that contentedness with middling ambition can
    make the record sort of a trudge to sit through. Without ideas oozing from
    every pore, <i>Left and Leaving</i> remains a well-executed, acceptably
    anthemic rock record with its share of hooks and pleasantries. And unless a
    listener is positively convinced they don't have enough of those, it's not
    quite worth endless spinning.</p><p>
<i>Left and Leaving</i> isn't a new world to visit and explore; it's a postcard
    from a friend on vacation.  Which is why it might be worth it to put the
    question to Samson and his distinguished panel whether punk survives into the
    present day. The Weakerthans seem to imply it's somewhere in between. Punk
    remains a frustratingly limited genre, but from its calcifying rules and
    orders, people are crafting oddball pleasures like this one. Whether punk is
    dead, alive and well, or not yet born doesn't really matter here.  You can
    take your pick. Just throw it a wake, a birthday party or a baby shower.
    And whatever you do, sing along.</p></div>"|8594.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8594-left-and-leaving/|6.1|Sam Eccleston

    EP.  I was under the impression that when a label releases an ""EP""
    consisting of a single, a remix of that single, a few remixes of
    another track on an already-released full-length, and one unreleased
    single, the purpose is simply to hype the given single and give club
    DJs some more danceable variations on tracks they've already been
    spinning.</p><p>
    
    But Amon Tobin is a special case. In many ways, his music could be
    characterized as a remix of music in general, taking what he considers
    to be the most interesting elements of everything ranging from
    cheeseball spaghetti western soundtracks to blistering funk, and
    combining them to create something uniquely his own. Such is the
    case with the best remixes-- artists work with original music they
    didn't create to leave their own indelible mark on it.</p><p>
    
    Roots Manuva's remix of ""Saboteur"" is a prime example of the remix
    as an artform. By weakening the rhythmic skeleton that held up the
    track in Tobin's original mix and adding a vocal track, Manuva has
    turned ""Saboteur"" into a song that, while completely different, is
    true to the original in spirit.</p><p>
    
    UK DJ Bonobo's remix of ""4 Ton Mantis"" is equally compelling. Like
    Manuva, Bonobo has reworked the track from the rhythm up, shifting
    accents and re-shaping the song's percussive elements into a familiar
    yet decidedly original soundscape. The fact that these remixes work
    so well is testament to the amazing density of Tobin's music-- there
    are enough sonic nooks and crannies in his tracks that multiple DJs
    can remix them and come up with completely original results.</p><p>
    
    Not to be shown up, Amon himself contributes one track to this EP,
    the excellent ""Yards."" ""Yards"" is classic Tobin-- hyperactive,
    rhythmically complex, and funky as all hell. I find it deliciously
    ironic that Tobin has recently become the poster boy for intelligent
    dance music. Tracks like ""Yards"" make it abundantly clear that no
    intelligent human being would ever attempt to dance to this type of
    music, at the risk of winding up with a severe case of whiplash.</p><p>
    
    So perhaps I misjudged this type of remix EP. Sure, like anything,
    the remix can be a tool of evil. But when left to an experienced
    professional, a remix can provide a fresh take on already-fresh
    material, and it just doesn't get much better than that.</p></div>"|8087.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8087-4-ton-mantis-ep/|8.0|Matt LeMay

    found myself sitting with a few friends at a wooden picnic table somewhere in 
    Washington. It was Saturday, but kids weren't playing on the nearby field, and
    no adults strolled by. The uniform gray concrete at our feet was a mirror to
    the sky. We were damp and heavy, buoys suspended in the thick cold fog. I picked
    at the peeling green paint on the sodden table; thick splinters of wood came up
    instead. I'd never been in that town before, but it seemed eerily familiar.  ""What's
    this place called again?"" I asked. A friend replied, ""Aberdeen.""  Where had I heard
    that? The table slowly deteriorated before me. I'd created a miniature canyon in
    its surface before realizing I was in Kurt Cobain's hometown.  So this is why he
    killed himself...</p><p>
    
    After grunge hit the mainstream, there was so much discussion of the Pacific
    Northwest's supposed depression-inducing effects on local music that the area's
    gloomy conditions became synonymous with the music scene.  But when a bunch of
    bands with similar sounds all come from a particular area, I don't buy that it
    has anything to do with the temperature and humidity.  Sure, the more recent bands
    to emerge from the region (Built to Spill, Elliott Smith, Modest Mouse, Death Cab
    for Cutie, etc.) share some similarities with the climate, but had I never heard of,
    say, Quasi, and someone played them for me, asking where I thought they hailed from,
    I wouldn't have known.  And if I had, it'd have been based on a resemblance to other
    artists from the area, not the 7-day forecast.</p><p>
    
    But ah! An exception. 764-HERO is the perfect soundtrack for their homeland.  Maybe
    the band knew this when they formed, and named themselves after the Washington state
    hotline to report carpool lane violators to firmly establish their geographic origins.
    But they were different back in those days-- just a two-piece with drums, a guitar and
    vocals on their 1996 debut, <i>Salt Sinks and Sugar Floats</i>. In 1998, they picked
    up Red Stars Theory bassist James Bertram and joined Built to Spill producer Phil Ek
    in the studio to record the more varied, but occasionally aimless, <i>Get Here and
    Stay</i>.  Now, on their third full-length, <i>Weekends of Sound</i>, the band showcases
    their strengths and improves upon their weaknesses, making it their most accomplished
    work to date.</p><p>
    
    Vocalist/guitarist John Atkins still sings as if fatigued by emotion, and the band's
    sound isn't remarkably different, but various touches make them sound richer than ever.
    The crisp production also remains, thus proving to those still unsure that Phil Ek is
    one of indie rock's best. On ""Out like a Light,"" Atkins is backed during the chorus by
    Bertram's cascading vocals, making the lines, ""It's your turn to listen/ Yeah, you
    will,"" sound not just casually antagonistic, but cathartic, too.  Atkins' distant
    howl on ""Leslie"" and the accompanying soft, reverberating guitar strums raise the song
    from a potentially forgettable lull to an otherworldly drift.</p><p>
    
    764-HERO's critics often label them as a moodier, lazier Built to Spill, and that
    seemed somewhat accurate on <i>Get Here and Stay</i>. But on <i>Weekends of Sound</i>,
    the band aspires to new heights, best illustrated by their nine-minute epic, ""Left
    Hanging.""  The track begins with quiet chimes and casual note picking, and slowly
    builds until a rising guitar takes over for a chorus that makes room for both poppy
    handclaps and Atkins' distorted larynx-thrashing.</p><p>
    
    Even Atkins' often maudlin lyrics have been refined. ""Summer takes your hand/ 'This 
    part's scary,'"" he sings sarcastically on the title track. He retains the sincere
    lyrics that endeared him to many fans, but he no longer sounds helpless or despondent,
    as exemplified by the song's next lyric: ""We're so tired of weekends of sound/ And you
    will sit down, shut up and keep it honest."" And for those who crave it, a couple of
    songs here-- ""You Were the Long Way Home"" and ""Something Else""-- are standard,
    sentimental 764-HERO, with Atkins singing on the latter, ""October came too soon/ And
    I'm left wondering why.""</p><p>
    
    That the band has improved, and that they still fit their home climate, is apparent
    from the very first track, ""Terrified of Flight."" The song opens with a drumbeat that
    pistons back and forth, a high hat like rushing water, and a submerged, beguiling
    bassline.  ""Night keeps going/ We keep standing still,"" sings John Atkins in tonal
    alignment with his guitar.  Soon thereafter, he narrates, ""Minutes later, we don't
    hear a sound.../ We don't notice all the passing time/ We were in the sight/
    Terrified of flight.""  This music is Washington as dark sets in: the fog dampening
    all sound, and melancholia seeping into our every pore.</p></div>"|7079.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7079-weekends-of-sound/|8.0|Ryan Kearney

It's the summertime, and we're coming off of a decade-long      re-evaluation of the Beach Boys' legacy.  It just doesn't stop.  If you      thought it began and ended with <i>Pet Sounds</i>, keep thinking, buddy.     The long out-of-print Beach Boys albums of the '70s have finally been     salvaged and remastered by Capitol from the dregs of the Reprise/Brother     catalog.</p>
<p>Without question, the resurrection of the Beach Boys in a vibrant critical     and commercial capacity was a significant retrospective development of music     in the '90s.  <i>Pet Sounds</i> becomes, now that we think about it, arguably      the greatest pop production ever; a box set commemorating the album and the      group's legacy are released and uniformly lauded; pop groups everywhere      shamelessly draw inspiration from the acid-tinged barbershop quartet     arrangements; a handicapped Brian Wilson even manages to release something     of a comeback.  With this extensive overhaul, it's right to expect some chafe      only zealots with fat wallets could feel compelled to purchase.  But such is      not the case with this particular release, which pairs up the two first and      best artifacts of the slow, golden sunset of the Beach Boys' decline.</p>
<p><i>Sunflower</i> marked a fresh start for the band as they left Capitol and      established their own label with Reprise, eager to capitalize on the     arrangement and recapture an audience that had deserted them.  Perhaps the      strongest album they released post-<i>Pet Sounds</i>, the group dynamic     (no longer as Brian Wilson-focused) reinvigorated the production and     songwriting remarkably.  The thematic and lyrical content is suitably     eccentric and cheesy at times, but that element is as much a part of the     work of the Beach Boys as musical innovation.</p>
<p>Dennis Wilson demonstrates impressive songwriting range from rockers ""Slip     On Through"" and ""It's About Time"" to beaut-ballad ""Forever"" and the oddity     ""Got to Know the Woman,"" where his lasciviousness gets a bit unruly.  Brian     Wilson hadn't become completely marginalized at this point, however.  He     still makes most of the songwriting contributions here, standouts of which     are the proto-shoegazer ""All I Wanna Do,"" the driving ""This Whole World,"" and     ""Add Some Music to Your Day,"" which manages to sound nothing like Fugazi but     whose sentiment is the most punk-rock the group recorded.  But despite     <i>Sunflower</i>'s merits and critical acclaim, it was not a financial success,     which didn't bode well as the inauguration of the Beach Boys' brand new era.</p>
<p>Some say out of strife and tension comes the best music, and while this doesn't     apply to the band's follow-up, <i>Surf's Up</i>, at least it can be said that     they got one last good record in there before they really started sucking.     <i>Surf's Up</i>'s cover art says all that needs to be said about the mood:     painted in mournful blues and greens, a Don Quixote-like figure slouches     heavily on an emaciated horse.  Underscoring the irony of the title, <i>Endless     Summer</i> this is not.  The most interesting moments of musical texture are     provided by an occasional use of synthesizers.  Content-wise, the album     ostensibly addresses pressing environmental, social and health concerns, but     songs like ""Don't Go Near the Water"" and ""Lookin' at Tomorrow (A Welfare Song)""     are as much a reflection upon the group's fortunes as they are upon the world's.</p>
<p>Most touching about the album is Brian Wilson's suite-like three-song contribution     as the album's closing, clearly influenced by Paul McCartney's suite on <i>Abbey     Road</i>.  By now truly marginalized, the first two tracks document his resignation     to fall away.  ""A Day in the Life of a Tree"" opens with the lines, ""Feel the wind     burn through my skin/ The pain, the air is killing me,"" and on the organ driven     ""Til I Die,"" he laments being ""a cork on the ocean/ Floating over the raging sea.""     The magnificent title cut closes the album, a track salvaged from the legendary     aborted <i>Smile</i> sessions.  ""Surf's Up"" was intended as the ""A Day in the Life""     of the classic album that wasn't, and here it shines through in all its glory, from     Van Dyke Parks' skewed lyricism to the celestial ""child is father to the man"" coda.     It's likely to be the best reissued track you hear all year.</p></div>"|11665.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11665-sunflowersurfs-up/|8.9|Hefner Macauley

    been privy to the group's absolutely incredible live show have registered
    the same complaint: they've never managed to capture the mania of their stage
    show on a record.  Until Tim Harrington's essence can be distilled into
    convenient CD form, the intensity of the Les Savy Fav live performance can be
    revealed only to those who actually get a chance to see it with their own
    eyes. On <i>Rome (Written Upside Down)</i>, it appears that the band themselves
    have finally reached this conclusion as well, and the result is without a doubt
    their most compelling and engaging record yet.</p><p>
<i>Rome</i> marks Les Savy Fav's first release since the departure of guitarist
    Gibb Slife. As a result, the majority of the EP is much tighter than any of the
    group's previous outings. But while the absence of a second rhythm guitar does
    occasionally thin out their sound, impeccably placed synthesizers and overdubbed 
    vocals fill in the gaps, resulting in a double-barreled assault of concentrated,
    fiery energy that Les Savy Fav were never able to achieve with their previous
    two-guitar lineup.</p><p>
    ""I.C. Timer"" kicks off the EP with multi-tracked vocals, broken rhythms, and
    synthetic bleeps. As Tim Harrington sings, ""God bless the cyborgs at your door.../
    It feels like it's been here se-se-seventy times before,"" he opts not to attempt
    a Daltrey-esque stutter, instead applying a digital skip effect.  While the band's
    previous records have featured some electronic manipulation on a much smaller scale,
    this unpredictable break in the band's natural flow comes as a very welcome surprise.</p><p>
<i>Rome</i> also marks the first time Les Savy Fav have managed to pull off some 
    genuinely moving-- as opposed to merely ass-moving-- moments. The lack of a second
    guitarist has driven Tim Harrington's vocals even farther up in the mix, and his
    singing here is more versatile than it's ever been. On ""Asleepers Union,"" Harrington
    delivers the line, ""It broke the backs of the trees in the forest/ It brought the
    rats to their knees in the city,"" with a masterfully executed whimper, and every
    minor imperfection in his voice contributes to a remarkably warm, organic delivery.</p><p>
    ""In These Woods"" and ""Hide Me from Next February"" are classic Les Savy Fav, complete
    with fractured beats, driving basslines, and fragmented guitar parts.  The record's
    title track and closer combines rigid, distorted drumming and controlled feedback,
    and ends the disc at new, previously unreachable heights with jagged riffs and a
    blissful cymbal crash.</p><p>
<i>Rome (Written Upside Down)</i> presents this Providence, Rhode Island four-piece
    with a beautiful future-- one in which their records present an experience which,
    though an alternate dimension away from their live shows, is every bit as fascinating.
    We've seen Les Savy Fav the ranting maniacs.  Now we get to see Les Savy Fav the art
    students.</p></div>"|4747.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4747-rome-written-upside-down-ep/|8.7|Matt LeMay

    ""night,"" ""slow,"" ""crawl,"" or ""late."" 35% of the songs on the record contain the word
    ""love."" So, if you're expecting <i>Will You Find Me</i> to be a collection of tired
    love songs, you're correct on many levels. Not only does the record act as a powerful
    sedative, it also stands as a perfect example of how conscious attempts to construct
    a specific type of album can suffocate a band. Ida try to be pretty like the Dwarves
    try to be badass, replacing power chords and the word ""fuck"" with male-female harmonies
    and lyrics about butterflies.</p><p>
    
    ""Down on Your Back,"" one of the <i>Will You Find Me</i>'s many appropriately titled
    songs, is a perfect thesis statement for Ida's bland audio tranquilizer. High-pitched
    female and falsetto male vocals sing over delicately plucked guitars as if to clarify
    that the music is, in fact, very, very pretty.  But even those delicate harmonies can't
    save a lyric like ""all your secrets collide"" from its Bonnie Tyler overtones.</p><p>
    
    Ida is a model case for style over substance.  Throughout this record, their goal is
    solely to be pretty.  They attempt to achieve this through singing in major 3rds, 4ths,
    and 5ths, a techinique which could have had decent results if they'd varied their chord
    progressions.  This gets especially tiring during a 6+ minute-long epic like ""Maybelle,""
    when the overwhelming prettiness fades into a completely innocuous, unaffecting backdrop.</p><p>
    
    The majority of <i>Will You Find Me</i> does nothing to break this mold. A slow-to-mid
    tempo is maintained for the album's entire hour-long duration, with flourishes of guitar,
    piano, and occasional keyboards piping up once in a while. Sadly, these temporary brushes
    with interest are minuscule, and fail to rouse the listener from their comatose slumber.</p><p>
    
    At times, the album does grab your attention, but never for the right reasons. The album's
    indisputable low point comes with ""Past the Past,"" a song whose title could have been
    penned by the Promise Ring or Bright Eyes. It's an appropriate comparison, too, as the
    track suffers from sometimes-singer Daniel Littleton's excessively emotional vocals.
    I use the term ""emotional"" loosely, though.</p><p>
<i>Will You Find Me</i> could have been a record brimming with genuine emotion-- an album
    made by four people truly interested in getting their feelings down on tape. But I'm
    inherently suspicious of a record which tries <i>so</i> hard to be this sensitive.  From
    the soft-focus pictures of shy-looking band members on the cover art, to songs with titles
    like ""Don't Be Sad,"" Ida never miss an opportunity to remind you that they are, as <i>All
    Music Guide</i> puts it, ""the best band in the country at writing those pretty songs that
    make you want to get cozy with your sweetie.""</p><p>
    
    To make matters worse, occasionally passionate lyrics are met with the same bland musical
    treatment as those that actually fit Ida's sonic Demerol. ""We were like kids with a shotgun/
    Blowing up words till there were none,"" is given the same musical treatment as, ""I could
    watch you sleep for hours/ Without noticing that it's getting really late.""  But despite
    the fact that the band seems to have set out to create a mature, affecting record this time
    around, the painfully self-aware nature of their endeavor has rendered any stirring impact
    the album might have harbored dead on arrival.</p></div>"|4051.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4051-will-you-find-me/|5.9|Matt LeMay

    sings John Vanderslice. ""But you'll never get mine/ It's not that bad/ It
    could never justify my life.""  Having followed Vanderslice's musical
    activities for the past few years, I've learned a couple of things about
    him-- not the least of which is that you should take anything he says with
    a grain of salt, as his penchant for Negativland-style media pranks all but
    equals his zeal for exceptionally well-crafted pop songs.</p><p>
    
    As frontman for the underrated and largely unknown (outside of the San
    Francisco area, at least) MK Ultra, he's pulled fast ones on the local news
    outlets such as claiming that the band's 1996 release <i>Original Motion
    Picture Soundtrack</i> was actually meant to be a soundtrack to a never-
    released independent film, or that he once bought a 16-track recorder
    directly from Brian Wilson. And for <i>Mass Suicide Occult Figurines</i>,
    Vanderslice's first release since MK Ultra's demise in mid-1999, he
    manufactured a pretty little hoax about being sued by Microsoft for copyright
    infringement stemming from the song ""Bill Gates Must Die.""</p><p>
    
    So why do I find the above lyrics so oddly intriguing? At first glance, it
    appears as if Vanderslice is taunting us playfully, self-deprecatingly; he
    won't tell us who he really is because his personal life isn't all that
    interesting anyway. This initially makes sense, since this is a guy who's
    written songs about bombing the post office, joining the Red Cross,
    reminiscing about life during wartime, and stalking the president, among
    other things.  It seems relatively clear that it's not really John himself
    talking here.</p><p>
    
    But if he was inventing characters and stories in all those instances, how
    do we know he's not doing that here as well?  Could this apparently
    straightforward, honest declaration be just another invention? Or have I
    simply spent way too much time listening to <i>Mass Suicide Occult Figurines</i>
    and am reading too much into it? Obviously, the answer is yes, but my point
    is this: Vanderslice is not only developing into a brilliant pop-song
    craftsman, but he's an adept storyteller as well, blurring the boundaries
    between truth and fiction so thoroughly that, in the end, the difference
    doesn't even matter. After all, a good song is still a good song, whether
    or not it actually tells a true story.</p><p>
    
    A background check on <i>Mass Suicide Occult Figurines</i> shows the album
    to be a patched-together affair, incorporating songs culled from the final
    days of MK Ultra and Vanderslice's solo studio work. And while it's pretty
    clear which songs fall into which category-- the MK Ultra songs sound more
    like a live band, and the solo stuff is more lush, a bit moodier, and more
    intricately arranged-- the track ordering is such that the different songs
    work to complement each other nicely, resulting in a surprisingly well-paced,
    varied-sounding (yet still cohesive) album.</p><p>
    
    There's no overarching theme to <i>Mass Suicide Occult Figurines</i> as there
    has been on past MK Ultra releases, but it does contain some of Vanderslice's
    finest work to date. ""Confusion Boats"" smoothly switches gears between ominous
    murkiness and a gently swaying verse melody; ""Josie Anderson"" is a swell-and-
    recede ballad-about-a-girl with a curious naval-warfare motif (""You are steamboat
    hips/ Gunpowder lips/ Blue bonfires on the shore"").</p><p>
    
    For some, the fabulously titled ""Bill Gates Must Die"" would be the centerpiece
    of this album, but I cast my vote for ""Speed Lab"" as one of the finest pop
    songs of the year; it's certainly the catchiest song ever written about illegal
    drug manufacturing. The terse, jagged riffing is enough to cement it into your
    brain for weeks, but Vanderslice outdoes himself with the lyrics, spinning an
    evocative tale of Denis Johnson-style California noir in less than 150 words.
    While the snarling guitars of ""Bill Gates"" musical equally those of ""Speed Lab,""
    the lyrics seem vague where those of ""Speed Lab"" are sharply imagined; allusions
    to paranoia about Internet security loopholes and federal eavesdropping don't
    quite coalesce into the damning, righteous indictment of Microsoft that the
    title would suggest. For this particular computer geek, it's a bit of a letdown.</p><p>
    
    Clocking in at under 35 minutes (and that includes five minutes of not-unwelcome
    filler), <i>Mass Suicide Occult Figurines</i> is maddeningly short, but it's also
    in no danger of wearing out its welcome. It's just long enough to not feel
    lightweight, and short enough to leave you craving more as the ""Slow Nerve
    Action""-esque ""Foothills of my Mind"" dissolves into an extended coda of processed
    orchestral swells. And with this album being the first Vanderslice-penned record
    to receive decent national distribution and promotion, he could be well on his
    way to becoming the Next Big Indie Thing.</p></div>"|8401.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8401-mass-suicide-occult-figurines/|8.1|Nick Mirov

    From the implant fantasies of B12's <i>Electro-soma</i> and Insync vs.
    Mysteron's <i>Android Architect</i>, to the cyber sheen of Justice's jungle
    (always more Detroit than Denmark Hill), British techno exponents, when not
    attempting to surpass the original sound, have always been conscious to pay
    homage to it. This is ironic, since the Motor City founders of the genre were
    actualizing their respect not only for Kraftwerk, but also for Sheffield-based
    industrial/synth-pop acts such as the Human League, Heaven 17, and the
    colossal Cabaret Voltaire.</p><p>
    
    The two members of Plaid, Ed Handley and Andy Turner, rode in on Warp's
    groundbreaking <i>Artificial Intelligence</i> compilation as members of Black
    Dog Productions. Many of the acts compiled on sampler have gone on to achieve
    greatness (Autechre's demo song was on the disc, as was-- in various disguises--
    material by Richard D. James, Richie Hawtin, and the Orb). It's true that
    Black Dog Productions haven't survived to the present day, but this demise
    was not due to unoriginality or record company mergers: the third member of
    Black Dog, Ken Downie, pushed his obscure hip-hop/techno fusion too vigorously
    for Handley and Turner's tastes, and the personality clash caused Ed and Andy
    to break away and record on their own.  However, the duo didn't totally
    discard b-boy-isms and throw-down attitude in their matchless version of
    techno.</p><p>
<i>Trainer</i> is a two-disc archive of Plaid's deft manipulations of the
    techno blueprint, beginning with the Second Summer of Love (1989) and ending
    with the solidification of the IDM sound in 1995. Whether released under
    their Plaid, Balil, Atypic, or Turic monikers, let there be no doubt, Handley
    and Turner's achievements during these years are, to this day, astonishing.
    In fact, their albums subsequent to this period (1997's <i>Not for Threes</i>
    and 1999's <i>Rest Proof Clockwork</i>) sound slack by comparison.</p><p>
    
    The immediate benefit of <i>Trainer</i> is that it contains the long lost
    <i>Mbuki Mvuki</i> album. Originally released in 1991, the record's seven
    tracks broadly sketch the Plaid sound-- ambitronically modified, near-Latin
    rhythms are tightly locked by rock-steady hip-hop nous and a visionary Third
    Wave attitude. On that <i>vida tecnologica</i> vibe, ""Scoobs in Colombia""
    wiggles its linen-panted Fania All-Star arse with such giddy joy that it
    stomps upon the po'-faced, furrowed-brow stereotype that's restricted so many
    techno artists' social lives. ""Bouncing Checks"" revels in a beatbox meltdown
    and a synth string stampede. Each maddeningly unquantized element totters on the
    brink of collapsing into a synthetic stammer.</p><p>
    
    1989's  ""Uneasy Listening"" is
    pre-Chemical Brothers big-beat redrawn for a less flatulent, more cultivated
    audience. 1991's ""Chirpy"" is an edgy first draft for what would eventually
    become trip-hop. The classically Detroit ""Prig"" follows, juxtaposing Eno-esque
    ambient washes with piercing industrial stabs. You can imagine Derrick May
    grinding his teeth in annoyance at just how perfectly the two contrasting
    elements are blended. And just to confound Dr Alex Paterson, ""Eshish"" out-Orbs
    the Orb during its blissful, floating, far-too-brief four-minute run.</p><p>
<i>Trainer</i>'s second disc covers tracks recorded between 1992 and 1995, and
    one can clearly perceive the influence of electro and, significantly, jungle.
    Some chroniclers of techno have traced jungle's genesis to the <i>Mbuki
    Mvuki</i> album.  And while I can't endorse that notion entirely, it's not
    without some appeal.  Still, fanciful genealogical excursions take us away
    from the confident poise and-- I have to say it-- <i>perfection</i> of Plaid's
    work during these years.</p><p>
    
    As one skims <i>Trainer</i>'s tracklist, two things are missing. One is a
    minor omission-- namely ""Parasight,"" recorded for a Balil EP on Rising High
    Records, which remains one of the most emotional and compelling voyages of
    the Roland TB-303 to this day.  But the other absence is far more significant:
    nowhere will you read the word ""remix."" The tracks here need no adjusting;
    they're as complete as one can imagine they could ever be. Whether recording
    as Plaid or as Balil, Atypic or Turic, Handley and Turner effortlessly welded
    the unpredictable to the accustomed. As the bathetically titled <i>Trainer</i>
    bountifully demonstrates, Handley and Turner never succumbed to the pull of
    their influences throughout this rich period.  And in so doing, they became
    one of the most influential bands of their genre.</p></div>"|6331.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6331-trainer/|8.5|Paul Cooper

    clamoring for a live Arab Strap album when Go! Beat first released a limited-
    edition run of this album, shortly before the UK release of <i>Elephant Shoe</i> 
    in 1999.  Back in the day, this record would have cost $25. I suppose the
    powers-that-be decided the quality of this document was valuable enough
    to be released stateside for a cheaper price.  A wise decision, given the
    momentum lost in the year it took for <i>Elephant Shoe</i> to hit American
    shores.</p><p>
    Perhaps best known for Aidan Moffat's gloomy, debauched tales of booze and bad 
    sex, the real meat-and-potatoes of Arab Strap has always been the tension 
    between his spoken/sung narratives and Malcolm Middleton's intricate musical
    backdrop.  For all the attention lavished upon Moffat's references to cocks
    and cunts, some have maintained that any of the band's albums could also serve
    as an instrumental work in the spirit of most Scottish post-rock.  This 1998
    set, recorded in its entirety with minimal interaction with the audience, melds
    the finer points of their best work into a potent display.</p><p>
    Things kick off quietly enough with a chiming rendition of ""My Favourite Muse,""
    but by ""New Birds,"" the strength of this release is evident: the rhythm section
    asserts itself more boldly than on any of the band's studio efforts, and
    Middleton's weaving guitar rocks harder and more skillfully than ever before.
    Every time he hits the distortion pedal, the speakers become enveloped in a
    dense instrumental swell-- you wouldn't expect the group's loud/soft dynamics
    to sound this organically vital live.</p><p>
    What's more, the instrumental virtues that shine in this live setting serve to 
    heighten the dramatic tone of the vocal.  Aidan Moffat doesn't content himself 
    with simply rehashing his by now well rehearsed confessionals without spirit-- 
    on the contrary, an added gloss of pathos accentuates the performance.  With 
    virtually no onstage dialogue to dilute the atmosphere, an extra note of loss 
    and emptiness resounds at each song's end, Moffat's accent-drenched brooding 
    demanding sympathy.</p><p>
    Standouts here include the Adele Bethel's guest vocals on ""Afterwards"" and
    worthy b-side, ""Toy Fights,"" and a blood-curdling rendition of ""Girls of Summer""
    that manages to inject a dance rhythm into its rollicking finale.  Arab Strap's
    output is impressive enough, but this succinct live recording stands as their
    most direct and effective release to date.</p></div>"|273.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/273-mad-for-sadness/|8.2|S. Murray

    covers was the forgotten novelty band Dread Zeppelin. Fronted by the profoundly
    obese Tortelvis, Dread Zeppelin had all the moronic college kids laughing along
    to their reggaeized Zeppelin-meets-Elvis shtick way back in 1990. (I can't
    front: I was one of them.) The formula for both Señor Coconut and Dread Zeppelin
    is simple: just take an overexposed batch of songs and graft them onto an exotic
    and seemingly incompatible genre. Instant novelty item.</p><p>
    And like the Fart-in-a-Can, the ""Damn Pigeons"" fake shit-encrusted baseball hat,
    and Grandma's First Dildo, this sort of Emperor Norton kitsch would, if there
    were any justice, be sold at Spencer Gifts.  It's utterly disposable trash
    without a shred of artistic merit, an album that winks cheekily while nudging
    ribs, dying to impress with its cleverness. For me to encourage the purchase of
    <i>El Baile Aleman</i> when there's so much great music that will never be heard
    is downright irresponsible. A crime, even.</p><p>
    But that's exactly what I'm going to do. Because, goddammit, this album is
    entertaining.</p><p>
    Señor Coconut is actually German electronic music prankster Uwe Schmidt,
    better known as Atom Heart. Schmidt is reportedly hiding from the fascist
    German music underground in sunny South America (Santiago, Chile to be
    exact), much as his fellow countryman Adolph Eichmann once hid from the
    Nuremberg prosecutors. While taking in the local culture, Schmidt was
    struck with a vision: why not take the songs of Florian Schneider and
    Ralf Hütter and jazz them up to sound like they were performed by Ricky
    Ricardo's orchestra?</p><p>
    It's not hard to come up with some arguments against the idea, but
    fortunately, Schmidt made some good decisions along the way. The first
    was choosing to pay homage to Kraftwerk.  Their pioneering use of
    synthesizers, and their role in helping to define machine music is
    undebatable--  they were great songwriters who created some fantastically
    catchy melodies.  And their stated affection for the Beach Boys really
    shows when you strip songs like ""Autobahn"" and ""The Robots"" from their
    vocoder'd voicings; hearing these songs on <i>El Baile Aleman</i> as sung
    by Argenis Brito and Jorge Gonzalez reveals just how strong the kraft
    of the music really was.  Even without the cheese.</p><p>
    Schmidt's second masterstroke was in selecting the record's instrumentation.
    The bulk of the musical background is clattering, danceable Latin percussion,
    a production decision that translates the original synthesizer arrangements
    perfectly. The instrumental melodies are primarily handled by vibraphone, and
    the sound is fleshed out with cowbells, fish, bongos, congas, and the
    occasional horn or accordion accent. It's a tasty rhythmic stew that plays up
    the groove and keeps the party moving, a must for any novelty record.</p><p>
    Then there's the fine song selection. Schmidt wisely favors the bigger hits
    with the most distinctive melodies: ""Showroom Dummies,"" ""Trans-Europe Express,""
    ""Neon Lights,"" and ""Tour de France"" are all highlights.  The puzzling exclusion
    of ""The Model"" is a bit of a bummer, partly because it's so catchy and would fit
    in well, but mostly because it would have been the fifth version of the song I
    own (in addition to Kraftwerk's original, there's the punishing take by Big
    Black, one by oddball Resident Snakefinger, and a gorgeous chamber translation
    by the Balanescu Quartet). But still, despite the absence of ""The Model"" and
    the base nature of this project, I have to doff my sombrero to Señor Coconut
    for creating such a fun little diversion: Felicitaciones, Señor Coconut, para
    un trabajo hecho bien.</p></div>"|7070.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7070-el-baile-aleman/|6.0|Mark Richard-San

    dearth of intelligent female voices in indie music.  I'm too smart for
    Lilith, too boy crazy for Mr. Lady bands, and too sane and reality-based
    for Cat Power or Mary Timony.  So, where's a girl to turn in her more
    contemplative moments?  Lately, a good option has been K Records, which has
    brought us Marine Research/Heavenly's Amelia Fletcher, Rose Melberg and
    Jen Sbragia of the Softies, and now Mirah.</p><p>
    
    Although this album marks Mirah's full-length debut, it's already evident
    that she's an accomplished songwriter with a distinctive lyrical bent.  At
    times, Mirah has a Liz Phair-esque libidinous bluntness, but she lacks Phair's
    cynicism.  Instead, Mirah maintains a charming naivete which perfectly
    compliments her girlish voice.  These elements may seem contradictory, but
    as the album title suggests, there's more to Mirah than it may first appear.
    Her juxtaposition of these two qualities allows her to deliver lines like,
    ""If we sleep together will you be my friend forever?"" with poignant sincerity.</p><p>
    
    The opening track, ""Million Miles,"" an account of small town life with acoustic
    accompaniment, might lead listeners to expect the rest of <i>You Think It's
    like This but It's Really like This</i> to be of a similar minimal, folky
    nature.  But again, we've been misled.  ""Of Pressure,"" one of the album's
    highlights, begins with a simple drum machine beat and gradually layers on
    organ, handclaps, tambourine, fuzzed-out guitar, real drums, and additional
    vocal tracks as Mirah asks, ""Is this a release or/ A build up of pressure?""
    The clever production answers the question.  The rest of the record similarly
    rewards careful listening, whether based around heavily reverbed guitar and
    murmured backing vocals like ""La Familia"" or the delicate violin arrangements
    of ""Archipelago.""</p><p>
    
    Whereas most female singer/songwriters leave me either ambivalent or vaguely
    embarrassed, Mirah has crafted an album that thankfully lacks standard Sarah
    McLachlan hippie antics.  She transcends the ""female artist"" ghetto without
    being afraid to write about boys-- a rare accomplishment, indeed.  I never
    suspected Calvin Johnson would be ever a pivotal force in women's music,
    but his signings prove me wrong.</p></div>"|5327.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5327-you-think-its-like-this-but-really-its-like-this/|8.0|Meg Zamula

    concepts with the likes of veterans Lambchop and Palace. Unlike the great
    Lambchop, however, Clem Snide's contribution to the Snore-core movement
    features little but silly, oblique wordplay with music as mere afterthought:
    lethargic bass lines, barely-strummed C, G and F chords, maybe some morbid
    violin accompaniment.  In the end, you're left with a boring, vague abstraction
    of country music. I'm not saying these guys have to necessarily choose between
    complete sincerity and over-the-top Ray Stevens parody. But can't we be
    entertained without forcing ourselves to accept these overbearing attempts at
    being ""different?""</p><p>
    
    Yesiree, NYC's Clem Snide seems targeted for Next Different Thing greatness.
    They've also been ludicrously compared to both Hank Williams and Jonathan
    Richman. <i>Your Favorite Music</i> has even been likened to the Velvet
    Underground's eponymous 1969 album. Insane! And sorry, but dopey, meandering
    songs like ""The Dairy Queen,"" featuring mundane slices of small-town teen life,
    can't even compare to the best of Don Williams, much less the worst of Hank.
    As for the Richman comparisons?  Listen to <i>Jonathan Goes Country</i>, then
    see if you can keep a straight face while discussing Clem Snide's inherent
    genius.</p><p>
    
    It seems Clem Snide have squeezed themselves into the perfect hip micro-genre.
    Uh, let's say... lo-fi post-irony country vaudeville. Much like the empty
    conceptualist/visual ironist Damien Hirst, the band thrives simply on their
    acquired Next Different Thing status. The lead singer even has a ""different""
    name: Eef. And enduring his grating faux-country nasal drone, coupled with
    the band's constant struggle to merely change chords, is like being subjected
    to the never-ending slow drip of a leaky faucet.</p><p>
    
    Lyrics like ""Tonight we're gonna party like its 1989,"" and ""How's that Deep
    Purple record I hummed in your ear/ Like a fight song whispered through a
    pillow,"" beg for laugh tracks.  Worse yet, Eef sings all this nonsense with
    utmost deadpan detachment and exaggerated apathy; which, in the indie
    community, is often confused with charm.  Funny thing about Eef, though: he's
    misanthropic and cynical as hell, albeit in his own insidiously subtle, ""aw,
    shucks"" sort of way. Take the sarcastic ""African Friend,"" for instance.  The
    singer intimates that his girlfriend is insecure with her pigmentally-challenged
    self. She becomes interested in a more ""exotic"" person of color. Be yourself,
    says the threatened boyfriend, and come back to the sensitive everyday white
    dude: ""Come lay on the couch with me/ We don't have to work on our tans.""  I
    ask you, America, is this funny?</p><p>
    
    ""I Love the Unknown"" pokes fun at a drifter type whose excuse for eluding
    responsibility and relationships is found in the song's title. The title
    track is, for lack of a more obnoxious critical categorization, repetitive
    irony-drenched neo-folk trip-hop. Here, Eef, ever the elitist gonzo philosopher,
    derides a female whose tenuous hold on individuality is wrapped up in listening
    to sad, obscure music: ""Your favorite music/ Well, it just makes you sad/ But
    you like it/ 'Cause you feel special that way.../ I can't teach you to learn
    to love yourself.""  Ahh.</p><p>
    
    The lyrics, at best, seem coughed up in a random stream-of-semi-consciousness:
    ""roads paved with liver and onions""; ""your heart's a muscle, that's all"";
    ""jumping jacks could ease your mind""; ""you smell like bread""; ""cutting my
    teeth on her shoulders."" And once you've made it as far as their seemingly
    faithful cover of Richie Valens' ""Donna,"" the album's relentless
    tongue-in-cheekiness has warped your judgment: should I be enjoying this as
    a serious cover?  And if I like it, will I be secretly mocked by the band?</p><p>
<i>Your Favorite Music</i> is nothing more than a bad joke; one your favorite
    neighborhood hipsters pretend to get, for fear of being ostracized by whatever
    indie-centric social milieu their lives depend on. If you're an outcast like
    me, you don't mind admitting these songs aren't even as childishly amusing as
    your roommate's new architecturally-unsound haircut.  You really wonder, then,
    how a band this dreadful can be deemed to possess such genius, and gain such
    a following. Then again, consider how we ended up with Jim ""Ernest"" Varney as
    our president. The Age of Idiocy is upon us, folks. We've got 'ol figurehead
    Dubya, his band of faux-Christian lunatics, and pseudo-musicians like Clem
    Snide all on the same path to world domination, fooling the easily-duped
    masses every step of the way. Big time.</p></div>"|1498.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1498-your-favorite-music/|2.1|Michael Sandlin

Not because it
    teaches children state capitals or multiplication tables, but because of the one
    truly invaluable piece of information you can attain from it: life is unfair.
    Adults can be completely indifferent or downright evil. Your worth as a human
    being can be judged entirely on spelling bees and long division, and your
    intelligence can be your own worst enemy.</p><p>
    Sure, one of the tenets of education is the encouragement of natural intelligence.
    But being pegged a ""brain"" can be devastating, and not just because of the impact
    it has on your social life. No, when you're a ""brain"", a certain level of work is

    like a college dissertation-- everything you ever write after that will be held to

    Had <i>The Spectrum Between</i> been released by anybody other than David Grubbs, it
    would garner instant critical acclaim for its impeccable songwriting and instant
    accessibility. The artist would be declared the new John Denver, and whimsical yuppies
    around the world would instantly make it a best-selling record. But this is David Grubbs.
    This is the man responsible for Gastr del Sol and 1998's brilliant <i>The Thicket</i>.</p><p>
    As much as any other musician to come along in the past ten or so years, Grubbs has
    pioneered new ground for pop music by combining inventive instrumentation and dynamics
    with cryptic, staggeringly intelligent lyrics and always-impeccable songwriting. With
    <i>The Spectrum Between</i>, Grubbs breaks away from any kind of avant-garde aesthetic,
    leaving him with his voice, his acoustic guitar, and 36 minutes' worth of delightful pop
    songs. And while the record is thoroughly enjoyable, one can't help but feel that Grubbs
    is capable of something more.</p><p>
    Even if a bit flimsy in comparison to other Grubbs releases, <i>The Spectrum Between</i>
    provides us with a liberal dose of amazing moments. ""Gloriette"", the record's undeniable
    standout, begins innocently enough, with Grubbs strumming his acoustic guitar and singing
    a pretty vocal melody at a relaxed pace. About halfway through the song, John McEntire
    contributes his patented inventive drumming, increasing the song's tempo two-fold and
    completely shifting its groove. McEntire's welcome entrance is followed by a brief,
    squealing saxophone solo from Swedish reed player Mats Gustafsson and some additional
    guitar meandering courtesy of jazz guitarist Noël Akchoté. Somehow, all these distinct
    elements combine to create a blissful and compelling song. ""Whirlweek"" and ""Show Me Who
    to Love"" follow a similar formula to a lesser extent, due mainly to McEntire's percussion.</p><p>
    The rest of <i>The Spectrum Between</i> consists largely of mellow acoustic numbers such as
    ""Seagull and Eagull"" and ""A Shiver in the Timber"", and experimental, drone-laden instrumentals
    like ""Stanwell Perpetual"" and ""Preface"". The acoustic tracks never fail to please, with
    Grubbs' expressive guitar work and occasionally John Denver-esque vocals always remaining
    agreeable.  And the more streamlined nature of these songs make them instantly enjoyable.
    The two instrumentals are quite good as well, but seem extraneous and displaced in comparison
    to the rest of the record.</p><p>
    It's hard to find any outstanding flaws in <i>The Spectrum Between</i>. It's a lovely record,
    and perhaps the first David Grubbs album that your parents will like as much as you do-- maybe
    more. Still, rather than forging a new future for pop music, the record's roots are firmly
    planted in the past, relying on more traditional arrangements and verse/chorus/verse structures.
    Thus, this thoroughly enjoyable piece of work receives a 7.9, with a heartfelt ""I know you can
    do better"" attached.</p></div>"|3581.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3581-the-spectrum-between/|7.9|Matt LeMay

This is a lie.  The
    Powerpuff Girls inspire 30 minutes of glued-to-the-set, TV-watching action for
    nine-year-olds.  Nothing more.  Why do marketing execs stretch truths like this?
    My personal favorite example of this kind of blatant dishonesty came with Atlantic
    Records' release of <i>Music from and Inspired by Jesus</i>.  <i>Jesus</i>, if you'll
    recall, served as last year's annual biblical mini-series extravaganza.  The music on
    the soundtrack was not ""from"" Jesus, himself, as the title implied, but rather, from
    LeAnn Rimes and DC Talk.  How disappointed Jesus' fans must have been when they
    discovered he didn't perform his legendary vaudevillian opus, ""Just a Closer Walk
    with Me.""</p><p>
    
    The packaging of <i>Heroes and Villains</i> contains a similar mistruth: these songs
    were not inspired by The Powerpuff Girls; they were commissioned by the Cartoon Network.
    I find it difficult to believe that Frank Black and Cornelius were viewing, say, the
    ""Monkey See, Doggie Do"" episode of this lovable children's show, and became so moved
    by the eloquent metaphors and primary colors that they simply could not resist the
    urge to write.</p><p>
    
    That said, this companion piece to the animated series is highly indie-friendly,
    as series creator Craig McCracken is obviously a counter-culture pop fan.  The
    title, <i>Heroes and Villains</i>, was inspired by The Beach Boys hit of the same
    name. The record also features songs by The Apples in Stereo, Shonen Knife, Cornelius,
    Olivia Tremor Control's Bill Doss (performing here under the guise of The Bill Doss),
    and appropriately, Kindercore recording artists Dressy Bessy.</p><p>
    
    The disc opens with ""The Powerpuff Girls (Main Theme)"" (just in case you absolutely
    had to have it on CD), before launching into Devo's hyperactive ""Go Monkey Go"", written
    in honor of the simian Mojo Jojo, the Powerpuffs' central nemesis.  It makes sense that
    Devo would appear on this album, as frontman Mark Mothersbaugh has been penning cartoon
    music for <i>Rugrats</i> and other series since the mid-1990s.  Of course, Devo are
    laughably past their prime, and this track is just another nail in the coffin.  Yes,
    it's time to disband.  Again.</p><p>
    
    Frank Black's ""Pray for the Girls"" marks his first track featuring actual production
    and overdubbing since 1995's <i>The Cult of Ray</i>.  It also heralds the addition of
    Eric Drew Feldman-- producer of Black's self-titled solo debut and <i>Teenager of the
    Year</i>-- to his backing band's line-up.  By far the greatest song on <i>Heroes and
    Villains</i>, ""Pray for the Girls"" perhaps offers a glimpse into Black's next album.
    The song is insidiously catchy, and gives these characters his trademark lyrical
    treatment with lines like, ""Downtown to have a talk with the mayor/ He told my masters,
    uh-oh, can't you see/ What we have here is a prophecy/ Cross your fingers, people, say
    a prayer/ I'm not a religious dog but I say that/ Better pray for the girls/ Ain't no
    other hope in this whole world.""  If Black can toss off a song this great about a topic
    as restrictive as Blossom, Buttercup and Bubbles, his next album has the potential to
    parallel some of his early solo work.</p><p>
    
    The Apples in Stereo offer ""Signal in the Sky (Let's Go)"", a track that's not nearly
    as awful as some of their recent work.  However, cringe-worthy lyrics abound, especially
    during the chorus when Robert Schneider sings, ""A signal in the sky-oh/ That's when you
    know you have to fly-oh.""  But let's be honest-- this soundtrack is targeted more at
    kids than teenagers and adults.  Little kids aren't gonna give a shit about the lyrics.
    Plus, they'll eat up the song's simple melody.</p><p>
    
    You know what the Shonen Knife song sounds like.  We'll skip that one.</p><p>
    
    As for The Bill Doss... sorry, Bill.  You <i>have</i> to practice pitch before you start
    singing on your own records.  It's not endearing.  Even infants will be sent running
    in terror from this one, as Doss howls tunelessly over warbled piano and a drum machine
    beat sporting all the creativity of a metronome.  Also, the kids will disagree with the
    lyric, ""Mojo Jojo's making evil plans.../ He'll only win in the end/ When he can begin
    to be friends.""  Bill, <i>watch an episode</i> of this show before you write a song about
    it.  Mojo Jojo never wins, for any reason, and the Powerpuff Girls would never befriend
    him because he's <i>evil</i>.  Like Kindercore!</p><p>
    
    Bis close out the record with ""The Powerpuff Girls (End Theme)"".  Now, I hate Bis as much
    as the next cynic, but I have to give them this one.  I mean, sure, it doesn't take a lot
    of talent to write a catchy song-- The Promise Ring have proven this time and again.  In
    fact, ""catchy"" often has a repellent effect.  But for some reason, I kind of enjoy Bis'
    super-charged cartoon anthem.  It's one of the better TV theme songs going right now.  I
    also kind of enjoy the theme to <i>Diff'rent Strokes</i> and the one from <i>The Jeffersons</i>,
    but I wouldn't listen to them in my car.  The same holds true for Bis, of course, but as
    far as theme songs go, this one's up there with <i>WKRP in Cincinnati</i>.</p><p>
    
    Now, I'm not going to encourage you to buy this album, especially not for your own personal
    use.  It's the Powerpuff Girls!  Did you honestly need my input on this?  However, it is
    a lot better than I suspected it might be.  I will say that if you have children in
    elementary school, they'll love it.  But since parents account for a very small percentage
    of the Pitchfork readership, I can really only recommend this to die-hard Frank Black
    worshipers and you creepy Kindercore fanatics out there.</p></div>"|1964.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1964-the-powerpuff-girls-heroes-villains/|6.3|Ryan Schreiber

I'm
    capable of putting on a stoic smile when confronted with friends' Dave Matthews records.  Korn
    and Limp Bizkit can induce a twinge, nothing more.  But listening to 12 Rods' newest release
    makes me hurt.  Bad.  <i>Separation Anxieties</i> is the ear infection that antibiotics can't
    cure fast enough.  It's the headache that half a bottle of aspirin just won't alleviate.  It's
    the splinter you can't pull out of your foot without the assistance of heavy-gauge needles or
    sufficiently pointy tweezers.  This record is acid reflux, gastroenteritis, and dysentery all
    rolled into one.</p><p>
    
    But the stomach-turning pain this record causes me doesn't stem from any particularly grating
    noise or gut-wrenchingly awful sonic mishap to be found on the record.  Rather, it comes from
    the knowledge that a band I once considered to be one of the absolute greatest bands in modern
    music could produce a record that sounds so bad.  What's even more perplexing is that the same
    band could call such an obviously terrible-sounding record ""the record we wanted to make and
    that sounds like us.""</p><p>
    
    12 Rods' 1998 debut LP, <i>Split Personalities</i>, rocked ass from here to Bangladesh by
    showcasing a band in peak form.  With Ryan Olcott's robotic whine, Christopher McGuire's
    maniacally inventive drumming, and Olcott brother Ev's keyboard talents and studio noodling,
    this band had finally figured out how to translate its unique elements into a well-oiled
    machine.  The record sounded nothing short of perfect.  Every chord, every melody, every
    synthetic bleep, every pathetically self-deprecating word Olcott spat out-- it all fit together
    so perfectly. 12 Rods were a band who not only played great songs, but knew how to listen to
    their own sound and refine it to the point of absolute perfection.  Which is all why this
    record comes as such a shock.</p><p>
<i>Separation Anxieties</i>' opening track, ""Kaboom"", begins with a stupid, but not overly
    offensive barrage of gratuitously poppy guitars, drums, and synth bursts. But any hopes for
    a salvageable song are instantly shattered when the sound dies down and Ryan Olcott shouts
    ""Sex!/ It's a regular practice,"" just in time for a hokey and completely displaced power-chord
    progression that simply sounds wrong.</p><p>
    
    This is followed by ""What Has Happened"", which may very well be the album's worst. Over yet
    another generic power-chord progression, Olcott whines: ""My ex thinks she's so tough/ She
    flicks her cigarettes before she puffs/ I think she's a man when she wears Adidas/ She lost
    her libido then dumped me for a punk/ Who's in a band, sounds like Korn/ But pretentiously
    aggressive/ Not too impressive.""  Yow.  As the song segues into the marginally less offensive
    chorus of ""What has happened?/ What has happened to the one that I love,"" the listener's
    sentiment mirrors Olcott's verbatim. After only the second song, almost all hope is lost,
    replaced only by a sickening sense of disappointment and bewilderment.</p><p>
    
    Perhaps the most frustrating aspect of <i>Separation Anxieties</i> is the fact that every time
    it seems like the guys might stumble upon a patch of decency, it all goes awry. ""Astrogimp""
    is musically incredible, but the worst lyrics you may ever be exposed to taint the song's
    relative virtue (the title is all the proof you need).  Two less offensive tracks, ""I Think
    I'm Flying"" and ""Your Secret's Safe With Me"", are followed by the album's single most
    intolerable moment, the distressingly horrid jack-in-the-box and quivering falsetto
    introduction to ""Marionette"", a song with a chorus consisting of yet another overused,
    run-of-the-mill chord progression-- and what the fuck are these lyrics?!  Augh!!!!</p><p>
    
    Since I bought <i>Separation Anxieties</i> over a week ago, I've been attempting to convince
    myself that the alarming decline in quality from the last record is not the fault of 12 Rods
    themselves-- or rather Ev and Ryan, the only two remaining members of the ""new"" incarnation of
    12 Rods.  It's easy to blame producer Todd Rundgren, whose production work with Hall &amp; Oates
    is eclipsed only by his vocal arrangements for Celine Dion.  Certainly, the man had his day in
    1987 with XTC's <i>Skylarking</i>, but his insipid overproduction on this album is far more
    typical of his recent efforts.</p><p>
    
    Another easy way out is to blame the record company.  Some of the material on <i>Gay?</i> and
    <i>Split Personalities</i> had been around for a while-0 maybe V2 forced the band into releasing
    a record full of material the band wasn't comfortable with.  They did title the last song on
    their own record ""Glad That It's Over""...</p><p>
    
    But no matter whose fault it is, nothing changes that <i>Separation Anxieties</i> is a huge
    letdown-- especially considering the fact that I've patiently waited for its release for the
    better part of a year. I marked its release date on my calendar. I bought it the day it came
    out. I was expecting an album in the spirit of <i>Gay?</i> and <i>Split Personalities</i>--
    a record that would instantly cement a place among my favorites.  Obviously, it didn't happen
    like that.</p><p>
    
    It saddens me that this record barely warrants a 2.0.  Nothing would have made me happier than
    to issue my first rating above a 9.5 to one of my absolute favorite bands. But on the plus side,
    I can now throw <i>Separation Anxieties</i> on the fire and spend the next couple of months
    convincing myself that it was all a bad dream, and that 12 Rods are still one of the greatest
    bands in the world.</p></div>"|8201.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8201-separation-anxieties/|2.0|Matt LeMay

    indie missionaries.  It was 1996, in a small Australian town.  Roughly 100 Slayer and
    Metallica fans had gathered, mostly against their will, to see the Archers of Loaf.
    The longhairs initially responded to the set with deformed sneers and abuse, yet the
    gig ended amidst tears of revelation and recognition.  Such was the power of the Loaf.</p><p>
    
    That year, the Archers released <i>Vitus Tinnitus</i>, an EP that adequately captured the
    coarse might of their live shows. Their recorded output had always threatened to bring
    them wider exposure, but after the release of their fourth LP, <i>White Trash Heroes</i>,
    lead guitarist Eric Johnson departed, and by the start of the new millennium, the Archers
    had disbanded, leaving only Eric Bachmann's Crooked Fingers to carry on the legacy.</p><p>
<i>Seconds Before the Accident</i> records one of the Archers' final shows in their
    hometown of Chapel Hill, North Carolina, and the vocal crowd reflects the affection
    with which their fans regarded them. The liner notes explain that the songs were chosen
    ""based on listenability,"" and indeed, the tracks function to highlight the brighter points
    of the band's career. ""Dead Red Eyes"" opens the record, setting Eric Bachmann's dry,
    melodic vocal line over sedated keyboards and a punchy, distorted bass.  The track
    segues nicely into <i>Vee Vee</i>'s ""Fabricoh"", one of the band's many signature skewed,
    dirty rock songs. The pop classic ""Web in Front"" is followed by Bachmann's heartfelt
    warning to his crowd: ""If I have an aneurysm tonight, it's out of gratitude.""</p><p>
    
    ""Fashion Bleeds"" showcases the confident interplay between Bachmann's driving rhythm and
    Johnson's unique atonal lead. Their energetic, distorted drone is focused throughout by
    Bachmann's intelligent if somewhat angry lyrical reaction to consumer society. His drawl
    on <i>Icky Mettle</i>'s ""You and Me"" is welcomed by a cacophony of drunken voices shouting
    along with the first verse.  At the close of the set, Bachmann returns to the stage
    unaccompanied to bid farewell with the beautiful piano ballad, ""Chumming the Oceans"".
    Even through the sterile bits of digital technology, there's an undeniable sense of
    sadness emanating from the crowd as one of the great Chapel Hill bands of the 90s
    departs for possibly the last time.</p><p>
    
    The collection of moments that comprise <i>Seconds Before the Accident</i>, and the live
    spectacle itself, will elicit the same reaction from anyone familiar with the Archers'
    eight-year commitment to incredible rock music.  Perhaps the roughness of the live sound
    would rule this album out as a proper introduction to the band's work-- especially with
    their monumental 1993 debut, <i>Icky Mettle</i>, filling that niche appropriately.  But
    to fans, this will prove a fitting swansong, and excellent documentation for an experience
    lost to another time.</p></div>"|278.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/278-seconds-before-the-accident/|7.0|Pete Nicholson

Come on, all of you.  Don't worry, I'm not going to make you
    hold your hat to your heart and sing our national anthem.  You're standing-- okay,
    probably not-- to salute an American folk hero: Woody Guthrie.  Indisputably one
    of our best singer/songwriters ever, Guthrie was the voice for those who didn't
    have one: the abandoned poor and the hard-working middle class, the despondent and
    the dreamers. In fact, Woody Guthrie is so historically important that the
    Smithsonian currently has an exhibit about him, named after his most famous song,
    the anti-""God Bless America"" number, ""This Land Is Your Land"".</p><p>
    
    But as the existence of such an exhibit would suggest, Guthrie is a cultural
    icon only to older generations or the well-informed. The exhibit's video
    presentation shows how desperately the curators are trying to expose a new
    generation to his work. The video opens with Billy Bragg praising Guthrie as a
    ""lyrical poet"" who brought a personal edge to his socio-political songs. Then
    comes Billy Bragg &amp; Wilco's version of ""California Stars"", culled from the first
    <i>Mermaid Avenue</i> album. Throughout the video, we also hear from Bono, Ani
    DiFranco, Corey Harris, Bob Dylan, and The Bruce (as in Springsteen). Of the
    twelve songs on the video soundtrack, only four are actually performed by Guthrie,
    including a repeat of ""This Land Is Your Land"".</p><p>
    
    This attempt to contemporize Woody Guthrie began in the spring of 1995 when his
    daughter, Nora, approached British singer/songwriter Billy Bragg with over 2,000
    sets of lyrics her father never put to music before dying of Huntington's Disease
    in 1967. She asked Bragg, a politically charged musician himself, if he would
    like to choose a handful of songs and put them to music.  Naturally, Bragg
    accepted the honor, asking Wilco's Jeff Tweedy to collaborate with him (Tweedy's
    background in the alt-folk/country/rock group Uncle Tupelo made him a perfect
    candidate). The result was 1998's rightfully critically acclaimed <i>Mermaid
    Avenue</i>, named after Guthrie's street on Coney Island.</p><p>
    
    Between the two of them, Billy Bragg and Wilco had twelve songs left over from
    the <i>Mermaid Avenue</i> sessions. So now, in 2000, they've decided to issue
    a second volume, only three songs of which were recorded since the original
    sessions. Perhaps this explains why the sound isn't much different this time
    around, and why the songs aren't on par with the previous album. <i>Volume II</i>
    is like an unnecessary b-sides compilation, and for the most part, there's a
    reason why these songs didn't make the cut the first time around.</p><p>
    
    Since Guthrie's lyrics are just as exceptional on this album, ranging from the
    romantic to the playful to the political, one must look solely at the music for
    comparison.  Unfortunately, nothing on this album is as beautiful as ""California
    Stars"", as saddening as ""At My Window Sad and Lonely"", or as touching as ""Another
    Man's Done Gone.""  In some cases, the songs on <i>Volume II</i> are the embarrassing
    cousins of songs from the first album. As an album opener, ""Airline to Heaven"" gets
    the foot stomping just as well as ""Walt Whitman's Niece"", but you can't sing along to
    it. And in the battle of songs about cultural icons, the plodding ""Joe DiMaggio Done
    It Again"" makes ""Ingrid Bergman"" seem much more pleasant than it really is.  What's
    more, the weak moments here are even less passable than they were on volume one.</p><p>
    
    Nonetheless, the album does have its high points. Driven by an unvaried, chantey
    organ straight off Dylan's <i>Time Out of Mind</i>, ""Hot Rod Hotel"" is a haunting
    auto-biographical song about Guthrie's dreary jobs as a youth.  On ""My Flying Saucer""
    and ""Secret of the Sea"", Bragg and Wilco use lofty, wandering guitar notes to
    capture the fantasy in Guthrie's lyrics.  On ""All You Fascists"", Bragg is accompanied
    by a driving guitar and raucous harmonica.  When he belts out, ""I'm gonna tell all
    you fascists you may be surprised/ The people in this world are getting organized/
    You're bound to lose,"" he does so with an intensity that befits the lyrics. And on
    the final track, ""Someday Some Morning Sometime"", Tweedy's vocals are perfectly
    paced with Guthrie's lyricism.</p><p>
    
    If it weren't for the first album, I might really enjoy <i>Volume II</i>, but as it
    is, I'm corrupted by the greater artistic success of its predecessor.</p></div>"|902.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/902-mermaid-avenue-vol-ii/|6.3|Ryan Kearney

He's built a career on making people guess
    whether or not he's joking, and even his most vocal supporters hold differing opinions on the
    subject from song to song.  For twenty years and at least three bands, the man has been playing
    the Shell Game with his tongue and cheeks, like this:</p><p>
    
    David Lowery: ""Now, thadies and jdendlemen, waj clodely and keep your eye on da thung, but
    ruhmember, da thung is fadser dan de eye!  Now, thadies and jdendlemen, where joo you thuppothe
    the dung is now?""</p><p>
    
    Listening Public:  ""It's right there, David, in your left cheek.""</p><p>
    
    David Lowery:  ""Ah!  Wrong!  It is, in fact, on the bookcase to your left, hidden behind that
    dusty bottle of Unicum, the national liqueur of Hungary!""</p><p>
    
    Listening Public:  ""Sure, David.  Sure.""</p><p>
    
    Camper Van Beethoven-- criminally underrated during their existence and disingenuously lauded
    after having disbanded-- just couldn't shake the perception that they were somehow a novelty
    act, because nobody was able to determine when they were actually being serious.  So Lowery
    went and formed Cracker, a band that can't shake the perception that they're really Blues
    Traveler, because now nobody can tell when they're <i>not</i> being serious.</p><p>
    
    David Lowery is the David Eggers of rock-- critics and listeners generally admit there's
    something to his work but keep their distance nonetheless, afraid of being lured into some
    mean-spirited trick.  That whole noncommittal thing was Lowery's long before anybody else
    tried it, though, and to many of us, it's clear that his past is peppered with heartbreaking
    works of staggering... well, something.</p><p>
    
    Now, more than ten years after Camper Van Beethoven's demise, Lowery and cohorts Victor
    Krummenacher and Jonathan Segel have decided to release, through Lowery's own Pitch-a-Tent
    Records, an album of outtakes, live performances, demos and rarities.  Sounds like a bad idea
    to you?  It probably was.  But some of us really miss Camper Van Beethoven.  And to those of
    us who've found ourselves, despite our best efforts, thinking that maybe Cracker's chicken-fried
    shtick has passed over the better bits of Camper's sensibility, it's a bad idea whose time has
    come.  Somehow, the boys make it sound alright.</p><p>
<i>Camper Van Beethoven Is Dead, Long Live Camper Van Beethoven</i> is shrouded in the usual
    Camperian mystery.  The idea, evidently, was to release an album of ""leftovers"" that didn't
    sound like one.  To this end, the various live bits, partially completed songs and demos have
    been cut-and-pasted together, smeared with an obfuscating layer of samples and sound effects,
    and had their origins generally obliterated.  The whole thing bleeds together, with unfamiliar
    bits starting out blurry, coming into focus, and then resolving into more familiar melodies
    before suddenly disappearing.  It's an interesting approach, and it helps smooth over the
    cracks in what is, by its very nature, some uneven material.</p><p>
    
    None of this stuff is revelatory, of course, but a lot of it's better than it really has any
    right to be.  The live material includes an excellent cover of Zappa's ""Who are the Brain
    Police?""-- which sounds more like it's being performed by the Soft Boys than by these guys--
    and ""S.P. 37957"", a medley which exemplifies the sort of Camper Van strangeness that so
    bewildered people in the 80s: the track careers wildly from an original Eastern European-tinged
    instrumental to a spot-on recreation of Zeppelin's ""Dazed and Confused"". Other highlights are
    the possibly partly maybe new ""Klondike"", which features a sample of the violin melody from
    Camper's own ""The Fool"" and an orchestral version of what is, quite simply, one of the finest
    songs ever put to record, ""All Her Favorite Fruit"" from 1989's <i>Key Lime Pie</i>.</p><p>
    
    Sure, this is pretty much a cult-fodder release, and it's naturally much thinner than the
    band's proper albums-- especially their last two.  Still, it hangs together remarkably well.
    The album's real value, of course, is that it hints that Lowery, Krummenacher and Segel are
    still in touch with their snotty, inscrutable weird sides-- and with each other's snotty,
    inscrutable weird sides, too.  And in that there is hope for the future.</p></div>"|1264.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1264-is-dead-long-live/|7.2|Zach Hooker

    Guitar and Synthesizer. Guitar and Synthesizer loved to play together. They went
    to the park, ate ice cream, and made lots of music together. They were the best
    of friends.  But as they got older, Guitar and Synthesizer began to drift apart.
    Synthesizer had stopped playing with Guitar, and began hanging out with a lot of
    Germans in black turtlenecks, going to art galleries and upscale dance clubs.
    Guitar fell in with a seedier crowd, and though he did his best to maintain the
    friendship, Synthesizer wanted little to do with Guitar's wicked ways.</p><p>
    Guitar was sad. While Synthesizer was hanging out with a bunch of cool, avant-garde Europeans,
    Guitar wasn't getting nearly the acclaim he felt he deserved. Pretentious music critics were
    declaring Guitar's music ""dead,"" no matter how hard he tried.  But one day, Guitar got an idea.
    He would get two of his indie rocking friends, Jean Phillippe Freu and Patrice Carrie, to beat
    Synthesizer at his own game-- they would make house music using only the sounds of Guitar!</p><p>
    At first, Jean Phillippe, Patrice, and Guitar had a lot of fun with their musical experiment.
    But as they continued working, they realized that something was wrong. By its very definition,
    house music cannot be made with only Guitar's sounds. Guitar knew what he had to do. He
    called his old friend Synthesizer, and convinced him and his friend, Johnny Palumbo, to help
    him and his friends with their house music. At last, Guitar and Synthesizer had found a project
    they could work on together.</p><p>
    But before long, tensions between Guitar and Synthesizer began to surface. Synthesizer became
    resentful of the repetitive, sonically uninteresting parts Guitar was playing. Synthesizer
    would burst in on Guitar while he was recording and yell, ""I could do that!"" Guitar was mad at
    Synthesizer, as well. Guitar, used to working with real drummers, was angry at Synthesizer for
    spitting out trite drum machine beats. Synthesizer responded by telling Guitar he was just a
    gimmick, designed to lure unsuspecting hipper-than-thou indie kids into buying a mediocre house
    record.</p><p>
    Guitar, Synthesizer, and their three French friends finished their record, and titled it
    <i>Installation Sonore</i>, French for ""gimmicky shit."" But things were never the same between
    them. Synthesizer moved to Germany and was kidnapped by an avant-garde artist, who poured
    sulfuric acid and pig shit on him, turning him into a ""sculpture."" Guitar moved to New York
    City's East Village, hit the bottle pretty hard, and whored himself to pay for his heroin
    addiction. He's since recovered, and is taking it one day at a time...</p><p>
    As for Phillippe, Patrice, and Johnny, they continued to make ""conceptual"" house music under
    their &lt;&lt; RixF4çérôse &gt;&gt; moniker. <i>Installation Sonore</i> found an adoring audience among
    insecure music fans who assumed that any band with that many accents in their name must be
    brilliant. They're currently planning another record of house music made entirely with baroque
    instruments.</p></div>"|6791.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6791-installation-sonore/|6.2|Matt LeMay

That's ""okay, go,"" not ""oakgoo.""  ""OKGO"" sounds more like a
    He-Man villain, and therefore seems more suitable as a name for a math-rock band.</p><p>
    
    Ok Go have been masterfully collecting hype by plastering their flashy posters on <i>Exito!</i> newspaper
    dispensers and opening for <i>every single band</i> in Chicago over the last year, including Don Caballero,
    The Promise Ring, Elliott Smith, and OMD.  (Yes, Orchestral Maneuvers in the Dark.)  It's actually been
    fascinating to watch their inevitable rise. Local press now invariably strokes the band's egos; in a city
    still sadly yearning for their next ""Pumpkins,"" these guys seem to have become the prime candidates.</p><p>
    
    Image counts, kids, and a flashy www.okgo.net website with press photos was born even before these guys
    had-- oh, right!-- a record.  But now that their meticulous, year-long recording sessions can finally be
    heard, however briefly, the band can get on with gathering devoted fans and lukewarm reviews.</p><p>
    
    This sub-10-minute EP was crafted in <i>five</i> studios, including the spiffy workplaces of Dave Trumfio,
    Steve Albini, and Butch Vig.  (At this point, it should be noted that Ok Go have trust funds.)  And despite
    minor songwriting triumphs, it can be difficult to wrap your head around the fact that five studios, two
    producers, and five assistants worked to create a Weezer knock-off called ""Bye Bye Baby"".</p><p>
    
    On stage, Ok Go play the shiniest gear, filtered through electronics and a laptop.  The silicon sound offers
    pinches-- tiny pinches-- of Brainiac moments, most notably on their tune, ""This Is Not the Sound of a Train"".
    Sadly, that's not included here.  Instead, we get the lithe acoustic throwaway ""It's Tough to Have a Crush
    When the Boy Doesn't Feel the Same Way You Do"".  Jeremy Jacobsen of Five Style and The Lonesome Organist,
    and The Coctails' Mark Greenberg supply some nifty vaudevillian twinkling underneath, but it fails to detract
    from the fact that everything the song has to offer is handed over in the title alone.  Quick, guess the
    chorus!  Reading the sleeve can be just as melodic, and at least saves you from the line, ""Who ever knew
    such hullabaloo?""  ""We Dug a Hole"" opens with ""Strawberry Fields"" organ and hides pleasant choruses.
    However, the verses serve up layers of ""loops"" and ""rapping"" that could only make Amy Heckerling wet,
    and their anal studio attention dominates every guitar chug and vocal harmony.</p><p>
    
    Of course, considering the competition, Ok Go have a brilliant future.  Even this beats the living lisp out
    of The Promise Ring. (Oddly, Jade Tree turned Ok Go down-- this could have been their retirement fund.)
    Still, the band fully embraces the cheddar pleasures of major label pop, and for every crispy curveball
    thrown, there's a lyric like, ""C-C-C-Cinnamon lips and candy kisses on my tongue.""  And if these sound like
    bitter, grizzled complaints, it's only because I'm trying to brace you for the moment they ditch self-released
    CDs and come to your town with Fruit-by-the-Foot's Generation Flav'R Fest.</p></div>"|5957.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5957-bye-bye-baby-ep/|5.4|Brent DiCrescenzo

    heralding the new breed of old-school with <i>My Vinyl Weighs a Ton</i>.  The
    album, his solo debut, featured an impressive number of MCs from the thriving
    San Francisco hip-hop scene.  One of its first tracks, ""Styles Crew Flows Beats,""
    features the Lootpack crew.  The group passes the mic dexterously, each doing his
    part to heighten the flava until the groove suddenly shifts and an eerily high-
    pitched voice strolls into the proceedings.  Quasimoto, he calls himself, and
    the remainder of the track is little over a minute of the finest underground
    hip-hop on record.  He seems hyperactive and ready to burst, yet his rhymes are
    laid-back and his tone remains almost resolutely monotone with limited
    inflections.</p><p>
    Let it be known, then, that Quasimoto is no mere mortal.  He is the brainchild/
    alter ego of Lootpack member and producer Madlib, a sped-up manipulation of his
    own twisted rhymes.  But injecting a little self-reflexive post-modernism into
    music never hurt anybody.  Just ask David Bowie what it can do for a career.</p><p>
    Instead of recording a proper solo album for Peanut Butter Wolf's Stones Throw 
    imprint, Madlib decided to give his other persona top billing, and he pulls it 
    off to a degree.  His production generally mixes sparse loops of spoken samples
    with obscure funk and R&amp;B; overtones, grounded by tight, snappy beats.  ""Return
    of the Loop Digga"" is an engagingly funny paean to his mad production skills.
    Here, Madlib steps up to document his rise from stealing records from his auntie
    to laying down tracks for his man Quas.</p><p>
    The 'Moto, for his part, starts strong as the ""bad character"" of the project: 
    \x93I smoke a nigga with a brick/ Talking out of place/ Like I was sniffing paint/
    Laced/ Lining up outta space.""  Damn!  The delivery of lines like ""dropping shit
    like some horses/ Irritate your mindstate/ Have you split like divorces/ Of course
    this is the new breed/ Fuckin' up the mainstream"" are pure gold, but by the
    middle of the album, it becomes clear that Madlib decided to cheat his alter-ego
    out of ontological priority rather than simply let him <i>be</i>.  As the man
    behind the boards and the squeaky little man up front, Madlib accords himself
    too many shout-outs, too many poorly disguised pats on the back, and makes too
    many appearances as himself for a character album.  And while by no means fatal,
    this is the primary fault of the project.</p><p>
<i>The Unseen</i> is an above-average contribution to the resurgence of the old-
    school aesthetic, but it could have been better.  The record is littered with 
    great moments-- such as the sci-fi manifesto of ""Astro Black"" and the moving 
    musical backing of ""Come on Feet""-- that make me hope this isn't the last we'll
    hear from Quasimoto.  But for Quasimoto to convince, Madlib has to chill.  Let
    him record his own album.</p></div>"|6610.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6610-the-unseen/|7.3|S. Murray

    Hebden (Four Tet) each created an original track, and then each remixed
    the other's work. I was half-ignorant when I put this one on the turntable,
    since I still hadn't heard a Four Tet full-length. I had, however, heard
    some of Hebden's remixology. His outstanding reworking of Aphex Twin material
    is probably the only track off the mediocre <i>Warp 10+3: Remixes</i>
    compilation I still listen to. And since I'm already a fan of Pole's
    post-iron-curtain dub, getting these two together sounded intriguing.</p><p>
    
    First, the originals. Pole's ""Heim"" is a solid, undulating cracklefest
    that's not too far from the material off <i>3</i>-- it actually would have
    been among that record's better tracks.  It veers more toward faint melody
    and steady bass groove, and away from abstract ambience relative to his
    first full-length. ""Heim"" is not going to win Pole any new converts-- it's
    hard to imagine what he might do that would at this point.  But if you
    have his kind of itch, it scratches nicely.  Four Tet's ""Cload"" is a fast,
    upbeat track with a bit of rock and some dub-style production. The drums
    are typically precise, with the overall energy of the piece compensating
    for its lack of melodic development.</p><p>
    
    The EP's standout, by far, is Four Tet's remix of Pole's ""Heim."" Whatever
    elements remain of the original are slight; some vinyl crackle, maybe. (It
    could just be my copy.) But the beauty comes in the added material: Four
    Tet adds a crisp, penetrating beat to anchor the track, and working against
    the confines of this ridged pulse is a sampled piano passage consisting of
    impressionistic piano flourishes.  In any other context, the piano might
    come off melodramatic, at best.  But after the tension builds in this Old
    World v. New World battle, loops twisting and expanding, the piano
    finally emerges alone for a sad, delicate, and truly affecting coda.</p><p>
    
    The record closes with Pole's brief remix of ""Cload,"" adhering fairly
    closely to his formula, but maintaining interest through the subtle
    weaving of the source material. This short one-off EP may not be easy
    to track down, but with three solid tracks and one really great one,
    it's got my recommendation.</p></div>"|6369.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6369-pole-v-four-tet-ep/|7.8|Mark Richard-San

    were doing their best Oedipa Maas impersonation.  There they were, locked in some motel room
    with Jim O'Rourke, likely wrapped in untold layers of protective clothing, and
    engaged in elaborate tricks to avoid actually giving anything up.  That release, while
    occasionally enjoyable, was hobbled by its unwillingness to make good on any of its promises.</p><p>
    
    Thankfully, <i>Sound of Water</i> manages to pull off exactly what <i>Places to Visit</i> hinted
    at.  The album follows the EP's trajectory by marrying Saint Etienne's signature pop smoothness
    with a slightly more avant-garde spirit.  But where its predecessor was thin, rough and square
    <i>Sound of Water</i> is entirely the opposite.  It's a fully realized implementation of
    <i>Places to Visit</i>'s frustrating, if enticing, unfinished experiment.</p><p>
    
    Don't go getting crazy ideas in your head, though.  We're talking about Saint Etienne here, not
    Nurse with Wound.  There are no 15-minute stretches of eldritch rattling noises here.  When I 
    say ""avant-garde spirit,"" what I really mean is ""glossy avant-garde sheen.""  This isn't to say
    that their version of experimentalism is false, hollow or cautious, but they're not going to
    forget what they're all about.  Which, as we all know, is style.</p><p>
    
    The end result is an album filled with great pop songs that have been augmented with some fairly
    non-standard beeps, clunks and whirs.  The album is cohesive enough to allow that conceit, and
    none of those non-standard noises sound forced or tacked on.  The songs flow effortlessly along,
    and even the instrumental tracks are fully developed-- none suffer from the half-finished feel
    that made <i>Places to Visit</i> so dissatisfying.  Much of the credit for this can probably be
    attributed to the band's collaborators To Rococo Rot and Sean O'Hagan who provide squirm-style
    effects and string arrangements, respectively.</p><p>
    
    The record's standout moments come with the borderline balladry of ""Sycamore,"" with its
    naturalistic acoustic guitar and backwards cymbals, the especially beepy-clunky-whirry (but
    still hooky) ""Don't Back Down,"" and the nine-minute opus ""How We Used to Live.""  Beyond that,
    the record is generally enjoyable, if still somewhat similar to previous efforts.</p><p>
    
    As with past Saint Etienne albums, <i>Sound of Water</i> is ear-candy all the way through.
    Still, they've managed to add a layer of subtlety and novelty beneath the glossiness-- or at
    least they've managed to coat their stylish exterior with a couple extra-thick layers of
    varnish.  Either way, the result is the same as always: a pretty tasty album, even if its
    shelf-life may not eternal.</p></div>"|6970.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6970-sound-of-water/|7.7|Zach Hooker

    by time and place. It's not Caustic Resin's fault that I do not happen
    now to be sitting in a hazy, beer-soaked college dorm room circa 1992--
    they have no control over that-- but, frankly, that is the climate in
    which <i>The After Birth</i> would flourish.  My present moment-- being
    spent in a quiet room in an unassuming, Scandanavian-dominated suburb of
    Seattle, circa 2000-- is rocky, fallow ground where <i>The After Birth</i>
    can find no purchase.  The air is clear, there is no wet towel stuffed
    into the crack under the door, and the only thing in the immediate
    vicinity which even remotely resembles a bong is an Ikea table lamp.
    The past has been left far, far behind.</p><p>
    Not that this album is clichéd or simple.  And it's not that it's textbook
    grunge or only suited to stoned, post-cafeteria get-togethers.  It's just
    that the time's not quite right for <i>The After Birth</i>.  The zeitgeist
    has modulated just a little-- just enough to make the album seem a bit off.
    The Screaming Trees posters have been taken down and we've all started
    preferring to sit in chairs rather than on the floor.  We've begun to take
    the importance of housekeeping and punctuality seriously.  It's not that
    we've grown up... well, maybe it is that we've grown up.</p><p>
    This album could have received pretty heavy rotation had it crossed time
    and space and found itself in Farrand Hall in 1992.  The opening <i>Live
    Rust</i>-ish instrumental would have gotten people nodding their heads and
    saying, ""Yeah.""  The rest of the album would keep them interested in a
    friendly but slightly impersonal way: maybe inspiring comments like, ""Hey,
    skip ahead to number seven!"" or ""I like it when the guitar does that
    jenka-jenka-jenk thing there.""</p><p>
    But when it's over, nothing much remains of <i>The After Birth</i>, other
    than a feeling of uncertain nostalgia.  It's like fondly remembering a night
    on which you're positive you had a great time, but can't at all remember
    what happened.  The album's sound is just as blurry: is it Wayne Coyne
    fronting a Grateful Dead cover band, or is it Jerry Garcia and Crazy Horse?
    Does anybody know what this song is about?  Or even what it's called?
    Where did all the Captain Morgan's go?  Who wants a pizza?</p><p>
    But again, it's not Caustic Resin's fault.  They just wrote some rock songs,
    went into the studio and played their instruments as well as they could, and
    offered the results in good faith.  I honestly hope there are some guys out
    there somewhere with a hackysack, no shirts, and the need for some tune-age
    who could give this album the warm welcome it seeks.</p></div>"|1359.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1359-the-after-birth/|5.6|Zach Hooker

    Besides having its own language, flag, and cultural heritage, Wales has given the world Tom
    Jones, Richard Burton, and the world's longest-named train station,
    Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwyll-llantisiliogogogoch. Damn!</p><p>
    For a place with so much to its name, Wales' music has gone relatively unnoticed, until recently.
    As bands like the Manic Street Preachers and Super Furry Animals gain in popularity, the new
    ""Cool Cymru"" is drawing worldwide attention. Apparently, record executives scouting in the UK
    now spend as much time searching for new talent in Wales as they do in the rest of Great Britain.
    Super Furry Animals hold a special place among the new wave of hip Welsh bands. Whereas bands
    like Gorky's Zygotic Mynci and Catatonia might as well be English, Super Furry Animals have
    always shown an affinity to their native language, demonstrated by the occasional lapse into
    the Celtic tongue on past albums. <i>Mwng</i> (pronounced ""moong"") is the result of two weeks,
    £6000, and a bunch of Welsh-language songs Super Furry singer Gruff Rhys has been writing since
    the band's conception in 1995. The result is a charming batch of stripped-down rock songs that
    isn't as fully realized or inventive as last year's <i>Guerrilla</i>, but still makes a damned
    enjoyable listen.</p><p>
<i>Mwng</i>'s opening track, ""Drygioni,"" may very well be its weakest moment.  On <i>Guerrilla</i>,
    Super Furry Animals milked seamless pop songs to their full potential with ingenious electronic
    arrangements-- ""Drygioni"" feels almost forced.  But the album quickly redeems itself with
    ""Ymaelodi \xC2'R Ymylon,"" a charming pop ditty complete with acoustic and electric guitars and
    overdubbed vocal harmonies. It's a summery pop song with all the trimmings, but it lacks the
    optimistic energy that made <i>Guerrilla</i>'s poppier tunes so great.  <i>Mwng</i>'s high
    point, though, comes with ""Ysbeidiau Heulog,"" a decidedly retro number that combines the
    swingin' sounds of the '60s with some high-tech vocal effects. It's easy to see why ""Ysbeidiau
    Heulog"" was chosen as the first single from an album that's already reached #11 on the UK
    charts.</p><p>
    The North American edition of <i>Mwng</i> comes with a bonus CD (called <i>Mwng Bach</i>),
    which consists of six tracks that are, strangely, every bit as good as the bulk of <i>Mwng</i>,
    if not better. Why the band didn't replace weaker tracks like ""Drygioni"" with obviously stronger
    outtakes such as ""Sali Mali,"" we'll never know.</p><p>
    As far as I'm concerned, <i>Mwng</i> isn't Super Furry Animals' true follow-up to <i>Guerrilla</i>.
    The fact that these songs have been around for so long, and the fact that the band didn't put
    too much time or money into the record, suggests that <i>Mwng</i> might be better regarded as a
    prequel to the band's other three records, like Chuck Norris in ""Missing in Action II: The
    Beginning.""  <i>Mwng</i>'s relative strength as a record demonstrates Rhys' talent as a
    songwriter, but also demonstrates how much Cian Ciarân's electronic wizardry enhanced the
    band's other records.</p><p>
    The lack of time and energy put into <i>Mwng</i> seem to have detracted from the fleshing-out
    of the album's better tunes, surely making it somewhat more difficult to create the kind of
    all-out pop masterpieces found on <i>Guerrilla</i>.  Of course, Super Furry Animals have proven
    their talents beyond the shadow of doubt-- <i>Mwng</i> couples cultural pride with unforgettable
    melodies in a way few bands have ever attempted.  That the band is capable of cramming a songs
    with names like ""Pan Ddaw'r Wawr"" and ""(Nid) Hon Yw'r Gan Sy'n Mynd i Achub yr Iaith"" in your
    head is commendable, if not downright astounding.  But, as they say in the old country, ""Heb

    \t\t\t
    I check out the disc I just popped into the CD-ROM in my cubicle's computer.  It's the first
    half of a 2xCD called <i>Home is Where You Hang Yourself</i>. The second song, ""Snakecharmer,""
    begins. Her Space Holiday's audio-Prozac begins to melt the abject flatness of a corporate law
    office into a slow, dreamy space-rock haze.  Things seem different. I take a look around the
    place.</p><p>
    I vaguely remembered photographs of the corporation's partners framed and mounted on the
    reception area wall.  In their place now were photographs of Bedhead, Codeine, and Low.  I
    heard one of the secretaries whispering that they kept a photo of Yo La Tengo in the desk to
    look at now and then, but didn't display it in the reception area as the photo was too dirty
    and ""loud,"" even as it had softened with age and sunlight.  The receptionist had a soft, airy 
    voice with a dragging but measured tempo that made his words blend into meaningless syllables.
    The clock's ticking became a lethargic percussive track, hypnotizing with its smooth regularity.</p><p>
    In the conference room, they flatly discussed passion while swilling balanced tracks of layered
    narcotics. This album's lyrics are mostly about the fragile optimism that is produced when love
    interacts with things like suicidal tendencies and anorexia, but the production, songwriting,
    and emotionlessly dreamy tone are all pill-pushing slow-core opiate clichés.</p><p>
<blockquote><b>THIS IS A DEAD-END TEMP JOB ON HER SPACE HOLIDAY'S REMIX DISC.</b></blockquote></p><p>
    This is the law office's space-themed holiday party.  Her Space Holiday's Marc Bianchi sent
    invitations to Aspera Ad Astra, Bright Eyes, and Duster.  He sent two invitations to himself.
    This party is over-produced, fancy and boring, but it's faster and more awake.  There are trays
    of dehydrated space food hors d'oeuvres which the host serves to the guests with preprogrammed
    rhythms. Rather than slipping into detached daydreams, you are awake and aware of your
    surroundings.  In fact, you're having small-talk with Bright Eyes!  Just say no!</p><p>

    teeth.  Maybe it's the music.</p><p>
    
    Sony Pictures' attempt to cash in on the burgeoning rave culture with the
    plotless feature, <i>Groove</i>, succeeds, in a way.  The film's soundtrack
    sits nicely alongside the other dozens of ""continuous mix"" compilations that 
    see release every year.  Of course, this probably says more about electronic
    music that it does about Sony's shot at street cred.</p><p>
    
    The film's music supervisor, DJ Wish FM, assembled each of the album's 14
    tracks into a seamless mix. This proves to be no large feat, as the entire
    first half of the disc shares almost the exact same BPM.  And truthfully, for
    the record's entire first half, it would take a watchful eye on the disc player
    display to determine where one track ends and the next begins. Sure, some slight
    variations appear, but none are substantial enough to stir interest, and the
    others are too predictable to be subtle. Every five or six minutes, a new bassline,
    synth sweep, or percussion flourish arises, with little consideration to
    composition or cohesion.  Yes, it's dance music.</p><p>
    
    Fortunately, the second half the album is a little more interesting.  Orbital
    drops an ethereal female vocal over ""Halcyon + On + On"" to better effect than
    the over-the-top vamping of the album's earlier vocal samples.  Big-beat mainstay
    Bedrock's ""Heaven Scent"" is poised as the high point of the film and the big
    single off the soundtrack, but it stands out from the other tracks less than it
    brings the homogenous elements to pounding new heights with a splashy synth
    melody and monolithic bass pumping. The track also paves the way for <i>Groove</i>'s
    true standout.  As ""Heaven Scent"" segues into Hybrid's ""Beach Coma,"" the beat
    dissolves almost entirely, replaced by a fizzing ambience of jazz sax and distant
    hi-hat sizzle.  Slowly, the tension rebuilds into a straightforward house beat
    flanked by whirring basslines and minimalist piano flourishes.</p><p>
    
    The album ends on another high note with Scott Hardkiss' mix of Alter)Ring's
    ""Infinitely Gentle Blows."" Sweeping in with oddly manipulated vocal textures, 
    the track sports a crisp beat whose bass boom actually makes room for a tight
    snare on the upbeat. As with the Hybrid track, ""Infinitely Gentle Blows"" really
    shines when the beat drops out and leaves the textures sputtering into each other,
    one gorgeous layer on top of the other in a dizzying free fall.</p><p>
    
    Like any mix worth its salt, <i>Groove</i> has enough exceptional moments to 
    occasionally overcome the underwhelming sameness, but is ultimately much more
    suited to the dancefloor than the home stereo.</p></div>"|7864.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7864-groove-ost/|5.7|Al Shipley

His voice doesn't
    gracefully arc up to touch glorious high notes or frolic easily through melodic fields; it's
    grating, laborious, and a bit slurred. But a more earnest, volatile, emotionally charged voice
    cannot be found. The utter sincerity behind that which he writes, the perfect inflection and
    expression from the far-from-perfect vocal chords, the brains evident behind the guitar brawn:
    these things are what make Kasher's voice sound gorgeous.</p><p>
    
    I've come to the conclusion that the worst thing about Cursive's new record is that it's
    actually called <i>Cursive's Domestica</i>, which is painfully reminiscent of the maligned
    <i>Mad Season by Matchbox Twenty</i>. Excepting this small item, <i>Cursive's Domestica</i> is
    the bands most mature, cohesive work to date. The announcement of a new Cursive album should
    have come as quite a shock to the band's fans in light of the litany of reports detailing their
    breakup. If this were so, then the brilliant <i>Storms of Early Summer: Semantics of Song</i>
    would have been Cursive's <i>A Series of Sneaks</i>: a dazzling, albeit tragically ignored
    swan song.</p><p>
    
    Instead, scarcely a year and a half later, we have <i>Cursive's Domestica</i>, an album which
    continues the profound dialogue left off at the close of <i>The Storms of Early Summer</i>, but
    steers the band in an entirely new direction: concept album territory. No, don't hit the Back
    button! Cursive actually pull it off in style, faithfully cataloging their interpretation of 
    the politics of love and the unraveling of a relationship.</p><p>
    
    Kasher, recent divorcee, claims that
    <i>Domestica</i> is not at all autobiographical. It's times like this that I wish that I knew
    how to scoff at something in multiple languages. Let's examine the evidence at our disposal:
    the album sleeve is brimming with pictures of a couple engaging in the throes of domestic life,
    each one depicting the woman conducting herself with complete sincerity as the male gazes
    despondently into the distance. The lyrics are fiery and bitter, or utterly jaded, making a
    mockery of the words we say and the lies we fabricate in relationships; things that one must
    experience firsthand in order to write about them so accurately. Let's never speak of this
    non-autobiographical tomfoolery again.</p><p>
    
    The Cursive sound has evolved alongside the sentiments of its frontman. Cursive have retained
    their razor edge, creating pulsing, rapidly evolving guitar-based music, yet they're now fueled
    and guided by the meaning behind the music. The cohesion of lyrics to musical intensity and
    songwriting is at its peak on <i>Cursive's Domestica</i>, as the expressiveness of the music is
    as volatile as any relationship, swooping down from furious to somber in a fraction of a second.
    The addition of new guitarist Ted Stevens has changed the candor of the rhythm section, making
    it more dissonant and varied in its attack. Crunching guitars and throbbing bass dominate the
    record, arranged shrewdly beneath Kasher's anguished screams and urgent whispers.</p><p>
<i>Cursive's Domestica</i> is certainly one of the finest hard indie rock releases of the year
    thus far and has established an impressive staying capacity in my CD rotation. Kasher's
    intelligent, thought-provoking lyrics resonate perfectly inside the head of anyone who's ever
    seen love go sour. ""The Martyr"" is a standout anthem to those jilted with the finer sex and
    their perceived emotional volatility, with the ingenious refrain: ""Sweet baby don't cry/ Your
    tears are only alibis."" Songs like ""A Red So Deep"" rock hard while keeping emotions firmly
    attached to sleeve, asking bitterly, ""Are you satisfied tonight?""  At only nine tracks,
    <i>Cursive's Domestica</i> suffers from brevity, but not much more. If you're happily linked 
    with a member of the opposite sex, stay away from this record. Otherwise, the world needs
    Cursive.</p></div>"|1700.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1700-cursives-domestica/|8.0|Taylor M. Clark

    in step with the album-naming trend started by the band Chicago, it's
    called <i>CD 3</i>. The cover of Pole's first release was solid blue,
    the second was bright red, and this one is all yellow. From the outside,
    this is all that differentiates the three CDs, and many might say that 
    there's even less difference in the music.  These people have a point 
    about the sameness; hell, even Betke would admit that Pole has a pretty
    narrowly defined sonic trademark. He makes vaguely rhythmic, dub-wise music
    constructed in part using the crackles from a defective pole filter, a
    device used when mastering vinyl LPs. Static pops, electrical buzzes,
    surface noise-- these are a few of Betke's favorite things. And what most
    people consider the annoying by-products of a retro music storage fixation,
    Betke considers instruments.</p><p>
<i>CD 3</i> is a good news/bad news kind of record. The good news is, if
    you've been unsure about Pole, understandably reluctant to spend your money
    on quiet, crackly ambient music, your prudence has been rewarded. This is
    definitely Pole's best record, and it's by far the most ""pop"" (as opposed
    to just ""click-and-pop"") of the three. The familiar scrapes, snaps and
    hisses have been relegated to the background here, as opposed to being the
    focus of <i>CD 1</i>, and the accessibility factor has definitely been
    upped.  The first five tracks in particular should appeal to any open-
    minded fan of dub, as Betke meets the rockers uptown with deep, melodic
    bass, reverberating keyboard refrains, and loads of spacy atmosphere.</p><p>
    ""Überfahrt"" (alright, quiet down-- it means something entirely different in
    German) is particularly hypnotic, as every melodic and percussive phrase
    slides lazily in and out of the mix, echoing back from whence it came. And
    if you get high enough, you could probably actually dance to ""Rondell Zwei,""
    a tune that marches steadily forward on the strength of a downright catchy,
    substratic bassline.  Somewhere, King Tubby is smiling.</p><p>
    The bad news is that if you already own a Pole record or two, it's tough
    to recommend buying another-- they're just too similar. <i>CD 3</i> completes
    my Pole collection (except for those rare 12-inches), so I now own three albums
    of his minimalist, fractured techno records.  Frankly, it's making me feel like
    an asshole.  So, do I sell the first two and just hold on to <i>CD 3</i>?
    Probably.  Because without a doubt, this is the record I'm putting on next time
    I feel like listening to Pole.</p></div>"|6371.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6371-cd-3/|7.4|Mark Richard-San

    I've learnt so much (and bought so little!) from its glossy, stark pages. For instance,
    when I'm next in Stockholm (no doubt checking out a Svek Records showcase), I'll be
    able to converse in faltering Ikean Swedish. I'll be able to discuss how much joy I get
    from my five-inch tall Snorra Kanin (or ""plush bunny,"" in our vernacular). But I'll never
    learn the correct equivalent of ""lovingly crafted,"" ""expertly finished,"" or ""lifetime
    guarantee.""  This upsets me because I would love to describe Richard Davies' raw,
    predictably over-achieving new album in the resilient language of home decorating.
    But though <i>Barbarians</i> arrives in flat packaging, no assembly is required.</p><p>
    
    Davies and his band have abandoned the polished production of 1998's <i>Telegraph</i>
    in favor of a live-sounding, plug-and-play ambience.  Here, Davies provides critics
    with yet more reasons to throw laurels his way, and still further incentive for the
    public to ignore his obvious talents.</p><p>
    
    Like the Loud Family's Scott Miller, Davies makes songwriting seem a complete doddle.
    Whereas less talented songwriters might crowd a song with clunky lyrics and noodly
    melodic digressions, <i>Barbarians</i> showcases Davies' effortless ability to extract
    straightforward hooks from guitar strings, with no extraneous nonsense to get in the
    way.</p><p>
    
    Despite the fact that <i>Barbarians</i> never provides an ear-melting classic like
    <i>Telegraph</i>'s ""Canteen,"" I'm more than satisfied bugging out to the dominating
    echo that becomes a melody during the flawless ""Palo Alto,"" or the twanged and cracked
    arpeggios of the album's opener, ""Coldest Day.""  ""The Kiss Off"" exhibits paisley
    influences with a bassline that recalls the Incredible String Band's lysergic
    hey-nonney-no.  And who could not be impressed with ""May,"" a song so striking it
    could have been part of Tim Buckley's <i>Dream Letter</i> set?</p><p>
    
    When I saw Davies perform in a tiny D.C. club, he filled the room with his panache.
    He didn't need to fall back on studio trickery. Up on the slightly raised stage, he 
    flaunted his gift and his unmistakable love of music. <i>Barbarians</i> is a wake-up
    call to all those who labor in studios for a unique, fuzzing guitar sound. If your
    songwriting goes to eleven like Richard Davies' does, you just need to be heard, and
    certainly do not deserve to be left on the prefabricated chip-board of
    under-appreciation.</p></div>"|2183.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2183-barbarians/|7.3|Paul Cooper

It's not bad enough that the crime-fighting trio's
    huge, jaundiced eyes haunt me as they stare from the backpacks, t-shirts, and
    Burger King watches of little girls all over the city; the merchandising tour
    de force-cum-television show also concludes with a Bis song.  This means
    millions of homes are being invaded daily by the most aggressively obnoxious
    Scottish band in contemporary music.  That's absolutely reprehensible.</p><p>
    
    Furthermore, fuck the powers that be at ""The Powerpuff Girls"" for giving Bis
    the opportunity to record the song in the first place.  Early releases like
    <i>Bis Vs. the D.I.Y. Corps</i> and <i>This Is Teen-C Power</i> should have
    been sonic suicide notes.  Bis were a fad that never quite caught on; instead
    of fifteen minutes, they had three-- when they appeared on ""Top of the Pops.""
    Maybe the band's imminent demise was wishful thinking on my part, but the
    fact that the Cartoon Network adopted Bis as their very own Alan Thicke has
    postponed any break-up proceedings.</p><p>
    
    On this outing, Bis continue the retarded new wave retreads prominent on
    1999's <i>Social Dancing</i>.  The first 45 seconds of the album's opener,
    ""Dead Wrestlers,"" combines electro-pop with a thick disco bassline a la New
    Order.  When ragged guitars join in during the chorus, the song disintegrates
    into something even Republica would have disowned.  The arena-sized ""Are You
    Ready?"" is half-speed two-step, with beats only fit for handspringing and
    tumbling.  The song could very well give 2 Unlimited staples like ""Twilight
    Zone"" and ""Get Ready for This"" a run for their money at cheerleading
    competitions.</p><p>
    
    The 80's revivalism is only made worse by the perpetually grating Manda Rin
    on vocals.  Rin sings with the finesse of a kindergarten brat with her hands
    stuck in her ears and her tongue lapsing out of her mouth.  She's particularly
    repugnant when tossing off Skid Row-style introspection, like on ""Are You
    Ready?"":  ""My heart beats fast as I try to forget/ What's hiding in my head/
    Will it ever change, or will it end?/ Some days I can't pretend.""</p><p>
    
    Sci-Fi Steven shares vocal duties, and, while technically a better singer,
    he sounds uncannily like Human League's Philip Oakey.  Still, a slightly
    better voice will improve lyrical mediocrity.  On ""How Can We Be Strange?""
    he pleads, ""I'm not a fascist/ Just wish that folk wouldn't be so passive/
    Toward the freak in the subconscious/ It's in us all so don't be cautious.""
    The song's social commentary about people being too ""normal"" could have been
    ripped from the sewn pages of a high school freshman's marble notebook.  It's
    endemic of the band's globe-sized respective shoulder chips that make Bis more
    ridiculous.</p><p>
    
    As they have been for over a half a decade, Bis continue to rage against a
    machine that doesn't care, and one that won't be won over by their rampant
    childishness.  Their music is kitsch gone wrong, and the fact that they're
    sometimes aware of their cornball tendencies doesn't redeem the piss-poor
    material.  Even if they were to mature lyrically, the fashionable new wave
    novelty on <i>Music for a Stranger World</i> suggests that Bis are, and
    always will be, tyke-minded copycats.</p></div>"|724.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/724-music-for-a-stranger-world-ep/|2.2|Richard M. Juzwiak

It would be unimaginable for     Sonic Youth to hail from Tulsa, and impossible for Oasis to reside in     Bakersfield.  Even schlock like Marilyn Manson makes sense in the context     of originating from the moral void that is Miami.  Athens, Georgia has     been Chesnutt's creative crucible for the past dozen years, and it makes a     lot of sense.  His lyrics reflect his environment-- one that's equal parts     small-town charm and southern-weird.</p>
<p>The album <i>Merriment</i> is a collaboration in the <i>Mermaid Avenue</i> sense.  Chesnutt was happily bamboozled into singing and scribing words to     the already-extant music composed by Backburner Records honchos Kelly and     Nikki Keneipp.  One suspects from the aural evidence that the work was done     with Chesnutt in mind all along, and was handed to him to put his indelible     and hand-carved stamp on it.</p>
<p>With a modicum effort, you can hear hints of Lennon, Chilton, Richman,     Black and even fellow Athenian Stipe in the lines and chord progressions.     But <i>Merriment</i> is more an example of archetypal songwriting than it     is derivative.  The arrangements are streamlined and efficient, relying on     linear piano and acoustic guitar integers to serve as the dais upon which     Chesnutt showcases his gifts.  And as always, whether on concept albums like     <i>The Salesmen and Bernadette</i> or in the honesty of his earlier work,     Chesnutt's warped wordcraft and hound-dog yodel take center stage.</p>
<p>The title track sets the tone at the start of the album.  A treatise to     slapstick, ""Merriment"" carries itself with nobility, a majesty flaunting     an ambition to be Vaudeville's national anthem.  The song declares in     closing: ""Bless the idiot/ That makes us split a gut/ Roses for the butt of     all our merriment.""  Throughout the disc, the music itself doesn't vary enough     from its median to distract.  Rather, it serves as a consistent segue     mechanism, linking the miniature narratives together.  Other songs, such as     ""Fissle,"" wax bizarre: ""Carbon ends up caramelized/ In the perforated sky/     Fissle, every one.""  And ""Smell the mighty monkey/ Trainer is a junkie/ And     the tightrope walker/ Has one foot in the grave"" in ""Mighty Monkey"" are the     first brushstrokes of a portrait of a degenerate carnival.</p>
<p>You must realize by now that you've been tricked by Vic Chesnutt, the Br'er     Rabbit of folk music.  He doesn't write songs, he writes short stories.  In     <i>Merriment</i>, ghostly, dream-like images flit across your brain like     fingers across pages, orchestrated by Chesnutt's frail voice and sinister     lyricism.  Chesnutt doesn't write songs, he directs and stars in film shorts:     brief vignettes of wintry, slow-motion nativities radiating holiness and     tableau dioramas of circus train wrecks.  Vic doesn't write songs, he paints     crude, unnerving folk art-- scenes like the album cover in which a smirking     misshapen man with a bandaged head stands in the middle of a dirt country     lane holding 11 roses and a homemade sign.</p></div>"|1428.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1428-merriment/|8.0|John Dark

    fearing the ridicule of being considered insufferable musical wankers.  This comes
    into focus with a band like Beans.  Stylistically, their music lies closer to modal
    minimalism than post-rock, but both styles are notably present.</p><p>
    
    Beans are definitely trying to create a feeling of wistful memory-- perhaps the
    afternoon someone died or the last time you they saw their former lovers.  But
    ultimately, they fail to affect in the way they intend.  Controlled dissonance
    abounds on the ethereal ""Miko,"" yet nothing more than softly strummed guitar,
    atmospheric piano, and bass enters the mix.  And the title track, rather than
    the startling display of originality it longs to be, is essentially early Tortoise
    boiled down to its most essential ingredients, sans vibes and sound layering.
    I mean, I understand that everything's supposed to sound like it's falling apart
    in ""All-Encompassing Dust,"" but glaring musical mistakes distract me from falling
    apart with it.</p><p>
    
    Another strike against them: their music is loose and seemingly unpracticed.
    They're clearly not purposely playing discordant notes and fumbling their equipment
    to create an ambience of depression or personal deconstruction; they just attempt
    music that goes beyond their technical abilities.  <i>Tired Snow</i>'s sparse
    production doesn't help matters.  In fact, it's counteractive-- it puts the
    instrumentation directly under the lens of judgment, making the band seem like
    ants running from the burning spot.</p><p>
    
    But the potential of these compositions saves <i>Tired Snow</i> from its undeniable
    amateurism.  With a bit more rehearsal and more active production, Beans could
    display more ingenuity than incompetence, and create some genuinely powerful music.
    They're on the right track when they take measures to assure they don't overextend
    themselves-- ""Dark Cave at Creek"" tells a simple love story with a brief but
    beautiful poignancy-- but they could stand to do it more often.  For instance,
    ""Alpaca Llama"" is a 16-minute performance piece recorded live with no overdubs
    (as indicated by the spoken intro and muddled crowd noise).  On this track, the
    ambition is definitely present but never sees fulfillment.  And by placing it at
    the end of a 38 minute-long EP, the band leaves the listener with an unpleasant
    feeling of anticlimax and drowsy disinterest.</p><p>
    
    Time could change this band for the better.  All it would take is some restraint
    and gained technical proficiency, things that tend to come more naturally as bands
    progress.  In the meantime, there are thousands of more satisfying records to spend
    money on.</p></div>"|601.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/601-tired-snow-ep/|5.8|Craig Griffith

Writers wearing button-down shirts with 
    the sleeves rolled up don't hustle around a maze of cubicles while Ryan chews out rookies in
    his office.  We have converted no lofts into spacious playpens loaded with iMacs and Nerf hoops.
    No interns yet.  (Unless Ryan's holding back on me.)  Mostly we sit around discussing music.
    And this isn't even done in the photogenic setting of a stoop or a coffeeshop.  We talk about
    music constantly on the Internet, which, admittedly, is geeky.  Plus, we're not even trying to
    sell anything on the Internet, further compounding our stubbornness.  (Some lady beat us to the
    punch with our farming equipment site at Pitchfork.com, but we're still looking into eRakes.com.)</p><p>
    
    Yet every so often-- whether due to astronomical occurrences, economic fluctuations, or inherent
    quality cycles (which have all actually been debated at one point)-- an album comes along that
    inhibits our serotonin uptake, cleans our ears, palpitates our hearts, ignites our passion, and
    justifies our existence.  I've argued that this occurs approximately every three years, due to
    slight financial recessions.  It's that time again.  At this point, I think the world agrees on
    <i>OK Computer</i> as the last major event in album rock.  For at least a few months, the world
    can stop waiting for Radiohead's next album, and start wondering how in the hell Modest Mouse 
    will ever top the monumental, ground-breaking, hypnotic, sublime <i>The Moon &amp; Antarctica</i>.</p><p>
    	
    Somebody just snickered.  Modest Mouse generate a divide between the venerating and violent like
    few other bands.  The latter of which currently questions my ascertations.  Wipe the slate clean.
    You officially have not heard Modest Mouse until you have heard their major label debut.  The
    growth, bravery, and confidence are staggering for a trio that most recently hammered through a
    song about ""doin' the cockroach.""  Producer Brian Deck of Red Red Meat conjures the supernatural.
    Layers upon layers of treated and raw sounds blend into a thick headtrip.  Piano, cello,
    sleighbells, keyboards, chimes, and more can be excavated from the mix.  Singing guitarist
    Isaac Brock constantly obsesses over the afterlife, and with Deck's help he's found it, far out
    in space and inside his clouded, scattered brain.</p><p>
    
    ""3rd Planet"" opens the record innocently enough.  Isaac plucks a lovely fluttering acoustic bed
    before he admits, ""Everything that keeps us together is falling apart,"" tersely summing the
    human condition and the theme of the record in ten seconds.  Suddenly, echoing, truck-sized
    drums stomp over the ebow-dripping chorus as Brock repeatedly pronounces under a sheet of reverb,
    ""The universe is shaped exactly like the Earth/ If you go straight long enough you'll end up
    where you were.""  Those failing to find the brilliance inherent in Modest Mouse at this point,
    please check in your Xanax at the window and an agent will escort you to the Target music
    department.</p><p>
    
    By the time track two, ""Gravity Rides Everything,"" begins with backwards drums, strums, and
    plucks, it's quite evident Mouse Mouse have traveled well beyond their past.  The song's
    percussion relies on jacked drumstick claps and electro-bongos as no less than five guitar
    tracks float on aching melodies.  Deck's hands keep the affair shimmering and clear, in what
    will undoubtedly vault him into the echelon of Fridmanns and Godriches.  Laser guitar lines
    and Brock's wrath blare over violins and undulating bass on the massive ""Dark Center of the
    Universe.""  Structurally, it's still classic Modest Mouse up to this point, excepting the
    volume of warped effects.</p><p>
    
    ""Perfect Disguise"" quietly kicks off the otherworldly passage of <i>Moon</i>.  A chorus sighs
    ""Broke my back"" over delicate pickings, sleepy kickdrums, accentuating banjo, and oddball guitar
    pings.  Looping tones usher a nasty bassline and disco rhythms as ""Tiny Cities Made of Ashes""
    ceremoniously kicks listener ass.  Sinister vocal doubletracking bursts into crackled shouting.
    Those familiar with Modest Mouse's live show will instantly recognize this as a trademark moment
    for Brock screaming into his guitar pickups.  This heavy march, driven by Jeremiah Green's
    hissing breaks, sounds wholly unique and creepy.</p><p>
    
    ""A Different City"" sits like the obvious single.  Flanged riffs pump Pixies-ish glee in Modest
    Mouse's tightest punch to date.  After this brief foray into crunching pop, ""The Cold Part""
    stretches out to infinity.  Chiming guitar, strings, over-dubbed echoes, deteriorating machines,
    and thumping drums fill a dark, beautiful void as a ghostly Brock laments, ""So long to this
    cold, cold part of the world.""  Any of Brock's prose is instantly quotable.  ""Alone Down There""
    announces, ""Hello, how do you do?/ My name is you,"" uncomfortably close to the inner ear.  As
    the song crescendos with building, buzzing guitar, Modest Mouse distills Built to Spill's
    essence in two minutes.  ""I don't want to you to be alone down there,"" Brock pleads.  Angelic 
    harmonies grant him his wish.</p><p>
    
    The epic ""The Stars are Projectors"" furthers the future of rock in grand gestures.  Shifting 
    between acoustic interludes and searing guitar over pounding drums, lyrics postulate the
    Descartian notion that our world is merely an elaborate dreamscape.  Pretty sharp for
    Northwestern punks.  The pace soon accelerates as the song swirls into a sonic twister.  Through
    studio trickery, warbling drums sound as if winds howl outside, prying the roof from above to
    snatch you into a maw of shrill violins and sheer feedback.</p><p>
    
    A stripped death ballad peppered with accordion provides perfect comedown on ""Wild Packs of
    Family Dogs.""  Thus begins the third movement of the record.  ""Paper Thin Walls"" pops along in 
    blue-collar fashion on cowbells and and woodblocks like fIREHOSE, while still injecting the
    haunted flourishes of the album.  If Nirvana played folk with Massive Attack it might end up a
    bit like ""I Came as a Rat.""  Standard power chords melt into astral tape manipulation.  The
    calm, beautiful respite before the closing snarl comes in ""Lives.""  ""It's hard to remember you
    live before you die,"" Brock sings over weeping strings.  ""My hell comes from inside,"" he reminds.
    Back comes the resigned aggression.  ""Life Like Weeds"" jangles and bows with still more poignancy.
    Most grand, expansive, experimental albums of this sort are expected to end with a quiet snuff.
    Modest Mouse explode into the noisiest, fastest piece to close the record.  ""What People are
    Made Of"" cuts abruptly on fuzzed bass, clashing cymbals, and attacking guitars-- an ideal
    ending for a record centered on death and the inability to understand.</p><p>
    
    So I've just taken you through the entire album.  As a fan, I know this sort detail is expected
    of hallmark albums.  In anticipation of the next masterpiece, we all soak up as much info as we
    can get.  Getting geeked up is part of the drama.  For the first time, Modest Mouse craft an 
    album, not a collection of songs.  That they manage to go beyond any other rock band out there
    is staggering.  The sequencing weaves a dramatic ebb and flow of emotion.  Every song is packed
    with fantastic sounds that reach out for space and salvation.  The band is now precise and
    broad.  Eric Judy's fluid bass quietly escorts the ear subconsciously through the appropriate
    moods.  Green's drumming is playful and inventive.  There is no way Modest Mouse will ever pull
    this off live.  The space, equipment, and personnel needed seems limitless.  Yet this scale 
    rockets the album instantly into Vahalla.</p><p>
    
    An intoxicating mix of uncertainty and confidence, <i>The Moon &amp; Antarctica</i> constructs
    hallow approximations of heaven, hell, and deep space-- most of which exist vividly in Isaac
    Brock's questioning mind.  <i>OK Computer</i> must be mentioned, for Modest Mouse just got
    invited to the same club.  They can chat existentially in the sauna.  But unlike's Radiohead's
    unease at technology and quickening society, Modest Mouse grapple with the general conjectures
    of humankind.  The title aptly entails the whole of the album.  Sometimes the most spooky,
    alien places are not too far off.  Similarly, our immediate surroundings and internal
    environment feel even more otherworldly.  Modest Mouse seek salvation in God, death, and
    relationships.  Fortunately, the rest of us can sometimes find it in records.</p></div>"|5358.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5358-the-moon-antarctica/|9.8|Brent DiCrescenzo

The frontman for the in-limbo Red House Painters has
    been down on his luck seemingly since the beginning of time.  Since his band's
    1992 debut, <i>Down Colorful Hill</i>, his desperate longing for childhood
    has plagued his music like an eternal therapy session.  After all these years,
    you'd think he'd be resigned to aging.  Yet, here he is again, mournful and
    bitter as the day you first heard him.</p><p>
    
    After the Red House Painters garnered a substantial cult following on London's
    influential 4AD imprint in the '90s, Kozelek left their roster over creative 
    differences with label head Ivo Watts-Russell-- Ivo wanted to edit the 13-minute
    long guitar jams of 1996's <i>Songs for a Blue Guitar</i> to a more reasonable
    length, but this suggestion was vetoed.  Instead, the Red House Painters took the 
    pleasing, if occasionally plodding, record to filmmaker John Hughes' Island-funded
    Supreme Recordings label where Kozelek was given full creative reign over his
    music.</p><p>
    
    After a major industry buyout, though, Supreme Recordings got the ax and
    has since been in a futile and apathetic search for funding.  In the meantime,
    the Red House Painters' <i>Old Ramon</i>, which was recorded for the label in
    1998, remains unreleased due to contractual obligations.  However, Kozelek has
    apparently been given the right to release material through the Badman Recording
    Company under his own name.  <i>Rock 'N' Roll Singer</i> is his solo debut, and 
    his first release in four years.</p><p>
<i>Rock 'N' Roll Singer</i> is an acoustic album featuring three new Kozelek
    originals, three AC/DC covers, and a John Denver cover.  Already, this doesn't
    look promising.  Red House Painters albums are, for the most part, equally
    affecting, but the guys haven't ever been much for variation.  Their saving
    grace has usually been the nicely arranged instrumentation and production.
    But you can't just do a whole album of melancholy acoustic ballads-- the
    majority of which you didn't even write-- and expect critical acclaim.</p><p>
    
    While Kozelek does have a knack for turning literally anything into an
    authentic Red House Painters ballad, he's long since done it to death.  We've
    already heard his lush, ethereal version of Kiss' ""Shock Me""; do we really
    need his predictably similar take on Bon Scott?  Yes, it's stunning how much
    emotion he can pack into AC/DC's brainless '70s arena rock staples, but why
    three times?</p><p>
    
    Kozelek's originals here are affecting as usual.  His sensitive, downtrodden
    lyrics are again just a bit overwrought, but the simplicity of his delivery is
    still far more convincing than Jeremy Enigk's on Sunny Day Real Estate's <i>The
    Rising Tide</i>.  Yet, sadly, aside from the wistful lead-off track, ""Find Me,
    Ruben Olivares,"" the melodies on <i>Rock 'N' Roll Singer</i> are far from
    captivating, and when your interest drifts from the lyrics, these tracks hold
    your attention like watching the effects of photosynthesis in real time.</p><p>
<i>Rock 'N' Roll Singer</i> is pleasant enough to listen to, but its tossed-off
    nature is transparent.  Kozelek sounds like he wants to go to sleep.  And it's
    a bad sign when you can barely stay awake for your own record's 28 minute duration.
    At this point, he needs an unlikely burst of creativity to propel him past what
    he's been stuck doing for 10 straight years if he wants people to keep buying his
    records.</p></div>"|4524.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4524-rock-n-roll-singer/|6.1|Ryan Schreiber

    As the title makes abundantly clear, <i>Postcards and Audio Letters</i> is
    a collection of found recordings of conversations, salvaged from cassettes
    found at thrift stores and garage sales. Yes, it says ""Damien Jurado"" on the
    disc's spine, but he's credited only with ""tape salvation and editing""; he
    doesn't sing or play on the album. In fact, there's no music on it at all.
    Instead, he's compiled 60 straight minutes of people talking.</p><p>
    
    To Jurado's credit, he has selected and arranged the recordings such that
    a vague theme of love and relationships immediately arises. There's Robert
    and Angel, the regretful ex-lovers living in different countries; the
    bickering grandparents rambling on about what they did for Christmas; the
    lovestruck Dawn and Phil and their mushy answering machine messages; and
    Jim and Sharon, a divorced couple arguing over the welfare of their child.</p><p>
    
    Sound like an interesting concept? Perhaps. Maybe the mere presence of
    Jurado, who's released two excellent albums of Nick Drake-like acoustic
    folk melancholy, is enough to keep your interest piqued. But would you
    really want to pay $10 or more for this? Think about it for a second:
    <i>Postcards and Audio Letters</i> is the type of peripheral art project
    that Jurado could just as easily have posted on his website in MP3 or even
    low-res RealAudio. With the Internet around, there's simply no reason (aside
    from the obvious financial one) to sell a disc of this material.  It's not
    like the sound quality needs to be crystal clear, and besides, you aren't
    likely to listen to it more than twice, anyway.</p><p>
    
    I'm not comfortable making any judgments of the artistic merits of <i>Postcards
    and Audio Letters</i>; as far as I can tell, Jurado succeeded at what he set
    out to do with it.  But in the end, all we're really doing is listening to
    other people's answering machine messages. Voyeurism is only worthwhile when
    the people you're eavesdropping on are saying something interesting.  Yes,
    Damien, it is indeed real life, but there's a reason ""Big Brother"" sucks.</p></div>"|4325.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4325-postcards-and-audio-letters/|2.4|Nick Mirov

It arrived in the form of a sentence, spoken
    by one of the esteemed Pitchfork writers.  It told of big-time music critics
    calling Grandaddy's <i>The Sophtware Slump</i> ""album of the year.""  Now, pardon
    me if I sound disturbed, but it's fucking March.  Consider all the great bands
    with albums in the 2000 pipeline: Radiohead, The Wrens, Björk, The Beta Band--
    do we really want to limit ourselves to Grandaddy this early on?</p><p>
    Atmospheric pop has dominated Critics' Lists for too long.  How long ago did
    Mercury Rev issue <i>Deserter's Songs</i>?  Is this all we can aspire to in
    the future?  Where's the goddamn rock these days?  Isn't anyone interested in
    volume?  While no one may ever step up to answer these questions, one thing
    is for certain-- time is running out for this genre, and I have a feeling it's
    not exactly going to age like wine.  However, even at this late hour, <i>The
    Sophtware Slump</i> manages to sound reasonably fresh, yields its share of
    unshakable melodies, and excels in production.  This is quite possibly the
    last great entry in the atmospheric pop canon.</p><p>
    The lyrical content of <i>The Sophtware Slump</i> focuses largely on failed
    industrial machinery-- crashed airplanes, malfunctioning androids, and abandoned
    appliances-- returning to the earth, or just lying around broken.  Undeniably,
    this is that blasted Radiohead influence rearing its twitchy eye.  Yeah, since
    <i>OK Computer</i>, everyone wants to be them.  Really, you can't blame people
    for attempting their own variations on the theme.  <i>OK Computer</i> is, after
    all, one of the greatest albums our generation has experienced in its time.  But
    bands need to realize that they're not Radiohead, and that no one ever made it
    into the history books by trying to do what another group had already done better.</p><p>
    The Radiohead influence seems obvious here, coming from a band whose last album,
    the 1996 (pre-<i>OK Computer</i>) debut <i>Under the Western Freeway</i>, was
    comprised of light-hearted, Weezer-inspired sing-alongs.  But surprisingly,
    Grandaddy inject the album with an air-tight cohesiveness, and enough of their
    own personality, emotion and creativity to warrant looking past the fact that
    someone's already succeeded in recording the ultimate anti-technology album.</p><p>
    But Grandaddy do manage to stir up raw emotion and genuine sincerity over songs
    that are far hookier and more immediately accessible than Radiohead's.  The album's
    anthemic opener, ""He's Simple, He's Dumb, He's the Pilot"" gives a glimpse into
    the album's multi-layered, airy, Godrich-esque production techniques, as well as
    its general disheartened feel and epic tendencies (the track runs almost nine
    minutes long).</p><p>
    For the most part, the album's songs are solid to the point that they'd have
    the potential of becoming indie rock classics if frontman Jason Lytle wasn't
    content to beat you over the head with them.  Out of the gate, these melodies
    are all enjoyable to an almost surreal degree.  And most of them remain that way.
    The problem arises when Lytle plays the same bars repeatedly without relying on
    choruses or bridges (as in the almost torturous third track, ""Jed the Humanoid"").
    A few of these tracks also drag on just a little too long.</p><p>
    There are few upbeat tracks on the album, and most of them come toward the
    beginning.  After the heavy-hearted weight of ""He's the Pilot,"" the bouncy
    ""Hewlett's Daughter"" serves as a nice breather.  ""The Crystal Lake"" stands
    as one of the album's highlights with its driving chorus and preprogrammed
    Cars-inspired keyboard scale.  ""Chartsengrafs"" follows close behind, fueled
    by buzzing guitars and drawn-out harmonies.  And finally, we come to the
    radio-ready ""Broken Household Appliance National Forest,"" a track about ""air
    conditioners in the woods.""</p><p>
    But that's where the happiness ends.  The rest of the album wallows in a
    depression so deep, it'd make your grandparents stock up on canned foods and
    dress in rags.  The Radiohead influence really becomes apparent on the last
    four tracks.  ""Jed's Other Poem (Beautiful Ground)"" resurrects a verse of
    ""Jed the Humanoid,"" sung a cappella, before launching into a sparkling, glossy
    epic and finally settling into the menacing ""Knievel Interlude (The Perils of
    Keeping It Real)."" ""Miner at the Dial-A-View"" kicks in after two minutes,
    encapsulating the entire album with longing, regretful lyrics (""I dream at
    night/ Of going home someday/ Somewhere, so far away""), distant melodic beeping,
    and a female voice giving instructions on the proper usage of the ""dial-a-view.""</p><p>
<i>The Sophtware Slump</i> comes to a close with ""So You'll Aim Toward the Sky,""
    a spacious five-minute epic that opens with discordant guitar lines over subtle
    technology-related sound effects.  The song repeats four lines over dramatic
    strings, chimes in the vein of ""No Surprises,"" and Jason Lytle's best Thom Yorke
    impression.  And surprisingly, it's more effective and believable than derived and
    cloying.  When the songs winds down, you're left with a feeling of genuine impact.</p><p>
    Now, I'm not saying <i>The Sophtware Slump</i> even comes close to touching <i>OK
    Computer</i>, though I can see what about it might drive someone to call it ""album
    of the year"" this early on.  But we have nine months to go!  If we'd said Built to
    Spill's <i>Keep It like a Secret</i> was the album of the year in January, 1999,

    style over substance.  Purveyors of all things avant-garde and chic in the
    NYC indie underground, the group's hipness quotient is horribly precious.  
    Comprised of Japanese vocalist/guitarist Kazu Makino and Italian twins Amedeo 
    (vocals/guitar) and Simone Pace (drums), Blonde Redhead's self-consciously 
    arty clang has made me wish I was a hip ""no-wave"" New Yorker rather than an 
    mere enthusiast of this band's works.</p><p>
    
    Blonde Redhead's biggest detractors focus on the group's uncanny resemblance 
    to Sonic Youth.  But while <i>Melody of Certain Damaged Lemons</i> won't exactly
    silence such suggestions, it does seem to move conscientiously away from the
    influences that have marred the group's previous work.  The title itself makes
    plain Blonde Redhead's musical M.O.: they've tempered their indulgences somewhat,
    and begun focusing on integrating hooks and feeling into their cavalcade of
    ringing guitars and propulsive percussion.  It doesn't quite qualify as a pop
    album, but it definitely serves as their warmest and most accessible record yet.</p><p>
    
    Perhaps the presence of Fugazi guitarist Guy Picciotto behind the boards has
    had something to do with this progression.  This album is as much an advancement
    over Blonde Redhead's similarly Picciotto-produced 1998 LP, <i>In an Expression
    of the Inexpressible</i>, as <i>Expression</i> was over 1997's <i>Fake Can Be
    Just as Good</i>.  Songs like ""Melody of Certain Three"" maintain the band's
    archetype while strengthening their grasp of dynamics-- Simone still pounds the
    drums in a murderous rage, but also leaves room here for some welcome tempo
    change.</p><p>
    
    More surprising is ""Loved Despite of Great Faults,"" certainly the closest the
    group has come to writing a full-fledged love song.  Amedeo's accented delivery
    of lines like, ""You will move with me/ We will stay still/ And words will move
    around us,"" connect moreso than Kazu's typically orgasmic vocalizations.  Kazu
    is thankfully more restrained here without reducing her vocal contributions, the
    finest of which is ""This is Not.""  Easily one of the most puzzling tracks the 
    group has recorded, ""This is Not"" brings to mind what an unlikely collaboration
    between Blonde Redhead and the Magnetic Fields might sound like.</p><p>
    
    While not necessarily distinguishing themselves immeasurably from setting and
    influence, Blonde Redhead have begun to produce music that evades such nets.  
    The potential evidenced on <i>Melody</i> easily outdoes the band's previous 
    outings and hints at a full flowering of their work in the near future.  After
    all this time, the band are progressively figuring it out.  So, rather than
    musing ponderously on life in the elegantly wasted East Coast Babylon, I can
    finally appreciate what it is Blonde Redhead are doing and expect them to 
    continue doing better.</p></div>"|804.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/804-melody-of-certain-damaged-lemons/|7.8|Hefner Macauley

    entitled <i>Skag, Smokes, Buckfast, and Me</i> comes more mumbling, more tossed off instrumentals,
    and still more stories of fumbled gropings. In other words, Scotland's most beautiful losers 
    return to drive us stumbling for our Valiums and for soothing draughts of liquid Paxil.</p><p>
    
    Despite licensing their debut single, ""The First Big Weekend of the Summer,"" for use in a
    Guinness ad, Aidan Moffat and Malcolm Middleton are still pissed at life, love, and the faint
    glimmer of happiness.  Moffat is still warning us against cheating girlfriends and the paranoias
    they cultivate.  But the fact that solace is never found at the bottom of a pint glass doesn't 
    deter him from questing for that miraculous alchemy. Arab Strap's music is still fractured,
    Smog-like, and woefully beautiful. The group's pitted, narky ambience fuses Irvine Welsh with
    Brian Eno's <i>Another Green World</i>-- <i>Elephant Shoe</i> is ambient for the Tamazipan
    massive.</p><p>
    
    Deep farping organs ground ""Direction of a Strong Man"" as Arab Strap's fine sense of pop rears
    itself majestically out of the morose morass. ""One Four Seven One"" deals with the gnawing 
    suspicions that sneaky lovers engender. They make us dial those four numbers in the British
    equivalent of *69. The song's itchy, scratchy trip-hop beats exacerbate Moffat's barely
    concealed anger. It's a telling understatement when he utters, ""I can't take this lightly; you
    said I'm in a huff."" But the spindly, gangly guitar lines guide him though to his final disgust.</p><p>
    
    Updating Jacques Brel's ""Ne Me Quitte Pas,"" Arab Strap offer ""Pajamas.""  Except that Moffat
    doesn't offer a night unlike any other night we've experienced if we stay.  He mumbles,
    ""Shouldn't we be naked/ Especially tonight/ Instead of being fat/ Instead of being tight?/ If
    you go/ Go for good/ Don't fuckin' joke!"" Moffat suggests that his companion shouldn't wear
    pajamas ""in this heat,"" and grumbles about ""the pissed up kids in the street."" A far cry from 
    Brel's <i>Elysian Promises</i>!</p><p>
    
    Can we condone lyrics like, ""We meet old friends at funerals/ And pretend that we've missed
    them""?  Can we recommend a band that consistently releases albums ringing with loathing and 
    destitute of any joy?  Would we be complicit in a reader's dive into the same deep quagmire
    where Moffat and Middleton have developed gills?  Well, we should at least express a note of
    caution.</p><p>
    
    Arab Strap's depression is as addictive as their expression of it is alluring.  <i>Elephant
    Shoe</i> isn't shocking, outrageous, or source material for a ""Jerry Springer"" special. It has
    none of the alkie humor of their debut; it's even more cynical than <i>Philophobia</i>. It's
    the starkly pedestrian, accurate portrayal of many impoverished, dependent lives. <i>Elephant
    Shoe</i> is a beautiful public service announcement, a plea for more than politicians'
    platitudes and token welfare assistance. The strap is strong now, but one day it will snap.</p></div>"|274.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/274-elephant-shoe/|8.4|Paul Cooper

    tempted by corruption.  No, record companies aren't throwing cash, drugs
    and boy-toys at me in exchange for favorable reviews.  It's something far
    more seductive: laziness.</p><p>
    
    The Aislers Set's latest album, <i>The Last Match</i>, comes with not one,
    but three <i>Pitchfork</i>-ready review paragraphs printed on the back
    cover.  Each is ostensibly about the band, although none of them actually
    describe its music.  The first goes the pretentious route, referencing
    17th century painters and European travel, the second is a sentimental
    description of ""late night obsessive scrawls and early morning echoes of
    kisses curling around the dawn,"" and the last is a self-consciously
    literary account of minutiae like ""a crushed soda can is beneath my foot,
    it's rusted red a dried wound on the frosted grey.""</p><p>
    
    It would be only too easy to repeat one of these verbatim, and pretend to
    be more arty, wussy, or boring than I actually am.  Unfortunately, I'd be
    forced to imply that <i>The Last Match</i> is arty, wussy or boring, and
    none of those things happen to be true.</p><p>
    
    Amy Linton's songs are certainly well-crafted, but they aren't so abstract
    that allusions to other art forms are necessary to describe them.  Musical
    reference points include '60s icons like Phil Spector, who originated the
    Set's girl-groupy multi-tracked harmonies, or a more proficient take on the
    fuzzed-out shambly pop of mid-to-late '80s groups like the Black Tambourine
    that the Aislers Set so clearly inspired.</p><p>
    
    The three songs written by Wyatt Cusack, also a member of the more rocking
    Trackstar, are the most twee of the bunch, particularly since Cusack's fey
    vocals bear an uncannily resemblance to those of Belle and Sebastian's Stuart
    Murdoch.  Linton, on the other hand, knows how to rock, as she proved in her
    mid-'90s group, Henry's Dress, which fused shoegazer shimmer with mod-rock.
    She's since forsaken the My Bloody Valentine influence, but <i>The Last Match</i>
    still packs a mod punch, particularly on ""The Way to Market Station"" and ""Been
    Hiding.""</p><p>
    
    The Aislers Set don't slack on keeping things interesting, either.  Their
    arrangements feature liberal doses of organ, hand claps, and occasional
    brass flourishes.  Linton's lyrics capture the highs and lows of being a
    musically literate urbanite, throwing out lines like, ""I could be your
    sudden let's go out/ Could be your favorite bar in town,"" and a desperate
    plea to the frontman of British cult legends the Television Personalities,
    ""Please help me, Dan Treacy.""</p><p>
    
    Normally, I'm not one to resist assistance, even of the unsolicited variety.
    For the Aislers Set, however, I feel compelled to put forth the effort myself.</p></div>"|85.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/85-the-last-match/|7.5|Meg Zamula

Before he was
    smitten by her playful passing and spot kicks, Kid606 was the ear-shredding
    vandal of IDM. Not only did N.W.A. get a beating from our Kid on his reworking
    of ""Straight Outta Compton,"" and Public Enemy on ""It'll Take Millions in Plastic
    Surgery to Make Me Black,"" but also far softer targets, as on ""Luke Vibert Can
    Kiss My Indiepunk Whiteboy Ass.""  On his own label, Tigerbeat6, 606 offered up
    tracks to like-minded hooligans and released <i>We are All Winners</i>, an
    ironic title unless you consider ""winning"" to be when all participants leave
    the session in tatters and with hearing impediments.</p><p>
    
    The tranquility of <i>The Soccergirl</i> EP is as shocking as any of Kid606's
    brutal gabber.  Over seven tracks, he reaches back to the early days of ambient
    and retextures it with his signature shards of white noise (albeit at a greatly
    diminished intensity).  And in the process, he proves just how much of a big-
    hearted softie he really is.</p><p>
    
    After the gliding Tonefloat drones of ""Start,"" Kid606 describes a ""Defective
    Boy"" in very David Kristian terms. Though a kick drum lurks deep within the
    foggy mix, it's the insistent burbles that propel the track. By the midway
    point, a tiny percussion set vainly strives to fill out the high end.</p><p>
    
    Kid606 treats the forlorn ""If My Heart Ever Ran Away"" with similar poetic care.
    The referencing here is less to early Kraftwerk, and more towards any number of
    Pete Namlook collaborations. A sequencer line dominates and answers the ""if""
    clause of the title with, ""Then life would be repetitive, echo-y, and
    indistinguishable.""  But listen closely as 606 tweaks the surrounding sounds
    just enough to hint that he's lying through his teeth. Playing such tricks is
    a gamble, of course, but as this track clarifies, he's more than capable of
    pulling it off.</p><p>
    
    From toying with Namlook, he takes on Tangerine Dream (their wasted <i>Street
    Hawk</i> years rather than the high magick of <i>Zeit</i>) during ""Thank You for
    Being My Angel,"" but I sense some insincerity in his gratitude. Though the track
    is louder and fuller than the preceding one, it lacks any elegiac nuance. It's
    bold, brash, and conveys very little-- a perfect show-off!</p><p>
<i>The Soccergirl</i> concludes as it began: serenely. ""Over"" hints at Oval's
    wounded disc schtick as Kid606 props up these delicate sounds with even softer
    layers. And just as we've become adjusted to this Kid's dreamy, gentle side,
    the disc ends. In retrospect, the strategy enacted here was pretty obvious.
    606's previous material had so brutalized us that to go any further would be to
    flog a dying horse. Employing restraint and tranquility, Kid606 has startled
    us once again. Goal!</p></div>"|4407.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4407-the-soccergirl-ep/|6.7|Paul Cooper

    the word was that their next release would be a split-CD with a band called
    the Shalabi Effect, to be titled <i>Aural Florida</i>. The split record
    never came to be, and Godspeed eventually released last year's <i>Slow Riot
    for New Zero Kanada</i> EP before settling down to work on the highly
    anticipated <i>Lift Your Skinny Fists like Antennas to Heaven</i>. As for
    the Shalabi Effect, it seems that when they were recording, they couldn't
    find the tape deck's ""stop"" button, and wound up amassing much more than
    a half album's worth of material.  Enough material, in fact, to completely
    pack this two-disc album. Bold for a debut, no? The fact that Godspeed You
    Black Emperor's forthcoming opus also comes on two pieces of aluminum doesn't
    say much for the Canadians' sense of restraint. Have we learned nothing from
    the saga of Smashing Pumpkins?</p><p>
    
    Fortunately, despite similar pretensions, this ain't no <i>MACHINA/The
    Machines of God</i>.  In fact, this isn't even remotely close to being rock
    music, which helps a lot. The idea of extending subtle, meditative, drifting
    soundscapes into minutes in the triple-digits is somehow more forgivable.
    While this band does share a certain stylistic similarity with Godspeed
    (stuff like extended pieces, varied instrumentation, and Hebrew lettering on
    the album cover), the Shalabi Effect generally don't provide the pop payoff
    of Godspeed when their orchestral tension reaches a grand, thundering
    release. Instead, this music is more about the process than the resolution.
    Let's try to break this monster down into its component parts.</p><p>
    
    The most immediately noticeable thing about this music is the strong
    Mid-Eastern feel. Part of it is the wide use of tablas and various hand 
    drums on many of the tracks (there is no standard drum kit), and part of
    it stems from song structures and scales that seem duly influenced by the
    Indian concept of the raga. By combining hand drums with plucked guitars
    and banjos that repeat the same patterns with minor variations (some of
    these phrases consist of only a single note), a hypnotic, trance-like
    effect is created.</p><p>
    
    The number of stringed instruments employed here is astounding. ""Mending
    Holes in a Wooden Heart"" even recruits Godspeed violinist Sophie Trudeau
    to create one of the album's best tracks, an evocative blend of ringing
    electric guitar, tablas, banjos playing Middle Eastern scales, and screechy
    violin that owes a lot to 20th century classical music. And on the next
    track, ""Aural Florida (Approach),"" we're offered nine minutes of twisted,
    mind-blowing guitar feedback, carved out of the silence by leader Sam
    Shalabi with the precision of an ice sculptor.</p><p>
    
    The second disc offers even more variety. ""Mokoondi"" combines several
    flavors of hand percussion with a hypnotic guitar melody lighting up the
    Arabian Night. ""Amber Pets"" culls its ambient mood from slow, dreamy
    guitars processed to the hilt. ""Boardwalk of Apollo Beach"" is the most
    tech-heavy piece, jettisoning the drums and acoustic guitars in favor of
    rumbling, eerie electronics. ""Apparitions"" uses electric guitar drones
    in the manner of late-period Spacemen 3, with wavering chords and drifting
    delays. ""On the Bowery"" is the only track with vocals (sung by Strawberry's
    Deidre Smith), and it is outstanding: ancient Persian trip-hop played on
    period instruments that builds in intensity like the closing montage of
    <i>Apocalypse Now</i>.</p><p>
    
    For consumers, this is what it comes down to: if you're into the drone
    and you're into space, and you don't need melodies, chords, or the other
    trappings of pop music, you're going to like the Shalabi Effect. If the
    idea of an acoustic guitar playing the same two-note pattern for five or
    six minutes while subtly modulating synths swirl around is about as
    appealing as listening to a car alarm, it's not for you. You have been
    warned.</p></div>"|7090.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7090-shalabi-effect/|7.1|Mark Richard-San

Or, even more frightening, the Yes and Rush
    factor?  Not only does <i>The Rising Tide</i> dip its toes into sucking whirlpools of late 70s
    arena prog, but it stands as one of those albums that forces listeners to ponder the inevitable
    third act of even their most fond bands, wherein Our Hero finds his fate in a bloody climax of
    vocal effects, drums solos, eco-conscience, last-flash valiance, and fatal flubs.  And while
    this specific Hamlet hasn't yet expired from the poison tip, his muse Ophelia is long gone,
    and the audience knows all about the venomed chalice.  So what course brought Sunny Day Real
    Estate to this misfortune?  The largest finger-pointing targets are producer Lou Giordano and
    the paring of the band into a trio.</p><p>
    Giordano, most widely known for his work with Live, dunks Sunny Day in a vat of liquid and
    covers them in chrome.  The reflective surface serves only to magnify and spotlight the
    occasional songwriting errors.  On past efforts, frontman Jeremy Enigk's passionate bleating
    benefited from indecipherability.  The mystic and emotional force stemmed from his foreign
    throat.  With greater control and pronunciation, Enigk now recalls a piping Jon Anderson--
    specifically ""We Have Heaven"" from <i>Fragile</i>.  Giordano floats crystalline vocal layers
    above a flat silver landscape of swooning, fervent arena rock.  With this highlighted clarity,
    Enigk can derail a track with one jutting word.</p><p>
    On ""Rain Song"" (there's that pesky, generic, Rainforest Café-brand environmentalism), Enigk
    drops his voice to repeat, ""And it's candy,"" which isn't completely terrible until juxtaposed
    to the surrounding, fluttering castrato sighs.  The real rub is how Enigk enunciates the bulging
    word like ""khaan-DEE.""  It sticks out like a bellybutton on a supermodel.  Similarly, ""Snibe""
    becomes the fist-pumping ""Mah-KET-place!"" and ""Gov-UN-ment!"" song (aka ""that vocoder song"") and
    ""Television"" is remembered at best as the ""Tell-eh-vhiz-sheun-eoooo-ooo-yeoooo-ooooo-uooo"" song
    (aka ""that digital didgeridoo song""), if at all. To further frustrate, Giordano laminates the
    uncountable layers of strings, pianos, plucked acoustics, and synths with tacky corn syrup.
    The obvious signifiers scream, ""Hey!  Lookee! I'm pretty!"" as much as do slow-motion, auburn
    lighting and slow dissolves in a John Woo film.</p><p>
    Occasionally, the drama and props pay off.  ""The Ocean"" slowly drops rippling pearls into molten
    quartz with sweeping effect.  It's the loveliest the band have ever sounded.  The closing title
    track shimmers like vintage Cure sloshing around inside a glass goblet.  And Sunny Day must have
    been lucky band #1,000,000 to name a song ""One"", as it tugs, dances, and punches with seductive
    pomp.  Otherwise, <i>The Rising Tide</i> sits awash in new age imagery-- the ocean, rain, angels,
    the ocean again.  <i>How It Feels to Be Something On</i> mesmerized intimacy, introspection, and
    Eastern textures.  Here, that's all been discarded for Big Themes and Big Guitars-- alright for a
    Saturn drive through suburbia, but not the silk blanket you want to snuggle under.</p><p>
    After their temporary break-up, Sunny Day Real Estate regrouped with fresh spirit.  The resulting
    album sounded like a band rediscovering itself over a batch of superb Enigk solo tracks.  Yet Enigk
    has gone from exhaling, ""If I break down all that I am,"" to preaching: ""Snibe is a monster. He is
    willing to hurt others to retire rich and ugly. He kills the innocent to protect his control. Snibe
    is the greed of money and power. Snibe is in all of us.""  Somebody's been subscribing to <i>The
    Nation</i>. The best justification for the extended metaphor of ""television"" as ""women"" is, ""She's
    in my head/ Like television,"" and, ""She's cool and she's free/ Like television.""  Well, at least
    she's not cable, then.</p><p>
    The songwriting here feels wrung from ""jams"". Splashes and driving rhythms replace intricacy and
    mood.  Drummer William Goldsmith devotes the album to his hi-hat.  ""Pish pish pish pish pish,""
    go the little cymbals, as our British readers giggle.  As Enigk wobbles his fingers over newly
    acquired bass strings and belts lines like, ""Disappear into the sun!"", it's hard to avoid Rush
    comparisons.  The power-trio-with-socially-conscious-singer/bassist equation also recalls The
    Police.  But time transplants <i>Mercury Rising</i>-era Sting into <i>Zenyatta Mondatta</i>.
    Meanwhile, ""Faces in Disguise"" mimics the soft, slow ooze of Peter Gabriel's rainstick ballads.
    So, essentially, this is the pop record 70s prog bands would make in the 80s-- <i>Big Generator</i>
    and <i>Power Windows</i> for a new generation.  Aside from two major blunders, nothing is overtly
    offensive, but simply lachrymose and lactose.  Sunny Day habitat needs candlelight and rugs, not
    spotlight riggings and Astroturf.</p><p>
    Is this a certain progression for rock bands of this ilk?  Chalk some of the scars up to Enigk's
    vocals being thrown into focus.  But what makes maturing singers spit political slogans and
    earth-friendly spiritualism?  Cash and hi-hats are easy culprits.  For the benefit of audiences,
    songwriters in emotional bands are best left in states of emotional turmoil.  Sadly, Enigk seems
    to be pretty comfortable with himself.  That's no fun.</p></div>"|7583.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7583-the-rising-tide/|5.9|Brent DiCrescenzo

    and sneering. For Sha Na Na, good music stopped being made when Elvis went to the Army and Jerry
    Lee married an eighth-grader. They weren't having none of that late-60s mess.</p><p>
    
    And now, as the 20th century fades into the distance, more than a few bands feel the same disdain
    for the 90s. The best example in indie circles are inarguably the bands that make up the Elephant
    6 collective, a paisley constellation that seems to orbit around Robert Schneider and his Apples
    in Stereo. To take these groups seriously, we have to ask: is it possible that the best rock music
    of all time was made in the 60s?  Beatles, Beach Boys, Kinks, Who, Stones, Zombies, Turtles... an
    impressive list, considering they all hit the charts within a four-year period. But the best? Well...</p><p>
    
    Of the aforementioned 60s bands, the Beach Boys are the one that comes up most when people talk
    about the Apples in Stereo. This stems from the fact that, like the Beach Boys, the Apples
    display little Black American influence in their music. The Beatles, after all, knew their way
    around blues changes, and their knowledge of artists on the Chess label went deeper than Chuck
    Berry. The Beach Boys, on the other hand, copped Berry's licks without every wondering where
    they came from. And Robert Schneider's gaze gets a little blurry somewhere right around Carl
    Wilson.</p><p>
    
    If <i>The Discovery of a World Inside the Moone</i> fails to find the Apples branching into
    James Brown territory, it's still the band's most diverse outing, and debatably their finest.
    Wisely jettisoning the noodly experiments that made <i>Her Wallpaper Reverie</i> seem much
    longer than it actually was, the Apples turn their focus squarely back on the catchy song, with
    a more pronounced feel for instrumental variety. ""Go"" kicks off with rollicking horns and corny
    background vocals that give the flavor of a lost Mutantes song. ""The Rainbow"" is far too sunny
    and upbeat for all die-hard power-pop fans, but there's no denying the strength of the tune.
    ""Stream Running Over"" is the best track here and, for my money, the most irresistible thing the
    band has done, with a simple and profound melody drawn from the finest pop archetypes.</p><p>
    
    There's a slight dip in quality on the rest of the record, but it still ranks as smart,
    workmanlike pop for those who like their pop music poppier than necessary. ""20 Cases Suggestive
    of..."" is fuzzy, 80s-style pop/punk, with pregnant drummer Hilarie Sidney offering her Go-Go's-inspired
    vocals. ""The Bird That You Can't See"" finds the band struggling to get on the good foot, as it
    alternates between funk and rock beats, but in the end, the awkwardness makes it a charmer.
    And ""Allright/Not Quite"" changes the pitch up with some screaming from Schneider on some of the
    verses, a technique he should attempt more often. Most of the ballads are pretty ineffective,
    though-- they're just a little too slapped-together to sound sincere.  But the folky, acoustic
    ""The Afternoon"" ends the record on a pleasingly wistful note. Yes, we've heard it all before,
    but it's still pretty good for what it is.</p></div>"|256.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/256-the-discovery-of-a-world-inside-the-moone/|6.5|Mark Richard-San

Not only do they cover most of New
    England, but they're facing a climate that's notoriously unpredictable and
    severe, running the gamut from incapacitating heat to marrow-freezing cold,
    from nor'easters to hurricanes.  Under a hovering deadline, they must assess
    their data using experience, education, and intuition, and then reach a
    conclusion. And all for what? So that their audience is-- as one media
    catchphrase goes-- ""in the know?""  Hmm... these responsibilities sound
    strikingly familiar. After all, music critics also throw their opinions
    out to the world and pray that history doesn't ruin their credibility.</p><p>
    Recently, drastic weather patterns headed for the northeast U.S. had
    meteorologists hailing the ""storm of the half-century."" As the predictions
    became increasingly dramatic, so too did the public's panic. By the time
    the storm was supposed to hit, everyone was too busy closing schools and
    buying emergency supplies to notice that nothing had happened yet. And
    when the storm finally arrived, it wasn't even the storm of the decade.
    Sure, it dumped an inordinate amount of snow. But, in my town alone, the
    'perfect storm' of 1991 sucked a house out to sea, sent forty-foot walls
    of seawater into the air, and threw boulders the size of Geo Metros onto
    the causeway. And that was supposed to be a routine storm.</p><p>
    But that's just the way it is with storms. And rock bands. Some hit without
    warning, like Nirvana, and others are boosted as much by prehype as by the
    music itself-- like Reykjavik, Iceland's Sigur Rós. Since reading our own
    Brent DiCrescenzo's review of <i>\xC1gætis Byrjun</i>-- in which he called them
    ""the first vital band of the 21st Century""-- you've probably seen the hype
    swell, like a beached whale in summer, from indie publications all the way to
    <i>Spin</i>'s Top 20 of 2000. Not that I think the hype is unwarranted: I was
    among all but two Pitchfork critics to have <i>\xC1gætis Byrjun</i> in my Top 20.</p><p>
    While history has yet to fully validate DiCrescenzo et. al., the <i>Svefn-G-Englar</i>
    EP-- originally released in 1999, but just reissued by the UK indie Fat Cat-- is
    additional proof of Sigur Rós' immense talent.  The disc's first two songs also
    appear on <i>\xC1gætis Byrjun</i>: with its rumbling skies, wailing sirens, and a
    distant toll, the nine-minute title track builds like a scene out of <i>The
    Odyssey</i>, then clears in a flash. A calming organ sets the foundation for
    an onslaught of searing guitar notes and Jon Thor Birgisson's alien vocals--
    a Joycean concoction of Icelandic and the band's fabricated patois 'Hopelandish.'
    Aside from the awesome descent at the three-minute mark, the song's movements
    are subtle; one must patiently wade through them to feel the swirl of conflicting
    emotion.</p><p>
    ""Viðrar Vel Til Loftárása"" is a decidedly different piece, opening with a
    plaintive piano and romantic swells of strings. While not carrying as much
    emotional depth, this song is decidedly more uplifting-- even teetering, at
    times, on the level of a dramatic Hollywood film score. But just before
    reaching maudlin proportions, it either pulls back, turns to orchestral
    chaos, or is torn open by a guitar wielded like a power saw.</p><p>
    The two tracks that comprise the second half of the EP were recorded live at
    the Icelandic Opera House in 1999. ""N\xFDja lagið"", a previously unreleased
    number, opens at a turtle's pace with casual kickdrums, a snare, light
    strumming, and a feedback-laden guitar.  When Birgisson's demanding voice
    enters, it doesn't sound nearly as feminine or foreign: he actually sounds
    like a male, and one feels as though, with enough concentration, the lyrics
    are almost decipherable.  While the inhuman nature of Birgisson's wails is
    one of Sigur Rós' most compelling and unique traits, these more hominine
    vocals work well here, particularly during the descending moments when
    Sigur Rós are at their darkest and most poignant.</p><p>
    ""Syndir Guðs"", an alternate version of a cut from 1997's <i>Von</i>, is equally
    slow, but more melancholy than funereal. The trademark guitar streaks are held
    to a minimum (except at the end) and the rest of the instruments are unobtrusive
    for the song's entirety. This places the emphasis fully on Birgisson's voice,
    which vaults into the stratosphere like Neil Young and Elizabeth Fraser
    performing a duet on helium.</p><p>
    For those who don't own any Sigur Rós material, this EP is a good introduction
    to the band. Those of you who already own <i>\xC1gætis Byrjun</i> are understandably
    concerned about the 1:1 ratio of songs you have and have not heard. But the two
    live tracks make this disc worthwhile for at least the addicted fan, of which
    there are more every day. So is Sigur Rós ""the first vital band of the 21st
    Century?""  I'm not venturing a guess.  But they are, without a doubt, a vital
    band.  There's no risk on my part in saying that.</p></div>"|7147.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7147-svefn-g-englar-ep/|8.0|Ryan Kearney

This is not the kind of endorsement
    that instills high hopes in listeners.  Yet, there he is, offering his phoned-in cameo seconds
    before a song called ""Great Expectations"" kicks in.  Fortunately, the announcement comes after
    the Jurassic 5 have set themselves apart from the ranks of standard-issue underground hip-hop
    collectives and stagnating turntablists.  Besides, later on, Sherman Hemsley from ""The Jeffersons""
    makes an appearance, effectively neutralizing the Ono-ization.</p><p>
    
    What sets the Jurassic 5 apart from the dead sea of generic hip-hop crews is their sheer charisma.
    These days, rappers either take their shit far too seriously to interest anyone outside their
    immediate clique or are too preoccupied with the innate shock value of slagging gays and killing
    wives.  But these guys revert to a simpler time through the resurrection of styles first
    implemented by the Treacherous Three and Cold Crush Brothers.  So, no, they're not doing something
    completely new, but at least it's a change from the pompous preachery of backpackers like Common,
    and the hokey forgettability of recent Automator joints.</p><p>
<i>Quality Control</i> serves as a somewhat lackluster follow-up to J5's self-titled 1999 EP,
    though it's got more than its fair share of top-shelf tracks.  Turntable masters Cut Chemist and
    DJ Nu-Mark piece together generally innovative samples that keep the music moving, and occasionally
    even surprising, which is saying a lot considering the increasingly limited possibilities of hip-hop
    soundbytes.  ""Doo Wop"" (not to be confused with the similarly titled Lauryn Hill song) is slick and
    fast-paced with an irresistible sing-along chorus and spliced-in barbershop quartets.  ""L.A.U.S.D""
    sports a J5 mission statement of sorts (""We are no superstars/ Who wanna be large and forget who we
    are/ Don't judge us by bank accounts or big cars/ No matter how bright we shine we're far from being
    stars"") over flourishes of Hammond organ.  But the album's standout comes with ""Jurass Finish First""
    which bounces along on a simple but strangely compelling two-chord piano riff and a massive,
    crystal-clear drum track.</p><p>
    
    Now, I realize that hip-hop's primarily a singles-based genre, and that even a lot of the classic
    records have got their share of filler, but for my money, three out of fifteen's not cutting it.
    After countless, seemingly interchangeable tracks, this record could have benefited from its
    namesake-- or more preferably, a couple of other worthwhile moments.  Cuts like the forgettable
    basketball anthem, ""The Game"", ""Contact"", and naturally, that goddamned intro, would have been better
    left in the vault or on the b-side of an upcoming single.  But all told, it could be a lot worse.
    They could have had Sean Lennon freestyling over samples off Yoko's <i>Starpeace</i>.  Let's not
    think about it.</p></div>"|4330.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4330-quality-control/|6.1|Ryan Schreiber

The kind of thing I'm talking about here is     where one says of a band, ""I'd like them fine if I could just stand the guy's voice.""  Many     have no problem with this hypothetical voice-- some may even like it-- but for you, the voice     provokes a visceral reaction that can only be overcome with great effort, if at all. Such is     the case with my reaction to Gregg Bendian's Interzone, but this being instrumental music,     it's not the voice I can't stand; it's the jazz fusion guitar.</p><p>The guitar in question belongs to Nels Cline. Now, don't get me wrong.  I can separate my gut     reaction from my critical faculties enough to tell you that Nels Cline is a fine guitar player,     picking his way up and down these complex scales with copious technique and sufficient melodic     innovation-- he's easily holding his own with the best of yesteryear's fusion axe-men, the     John McLaughlins and Pat Methenys of the world. But I can't hear the jazz tradition in Cline's     guitar improvisations; all I can hear is a noodly sound that rubs me the wrong way, like bad     Frank Zappa or the Grateful Dead's ""Space"". Fusion guitar solos just don't do it for me.</p><p>So, Cline's guitar work aside, how is the rest of Gregg Bendian's Interzone? Quite good,     actually. This is noir-ish jazz led by Bendian's clarion work on the vibraphone and     glockenspiel, and backed by the energetic, driving rhythm section of bassist Steuart Liebig     and drummer Alex Cline. Some comparisons could be made to John Zorn's more accessible work,     like <em>Spillane</em>, and anyone who can imagine a rocked-up version of the Modern Jazz     Quartet can picture what <em>Myriad</em> sounds like.  ""Intrepid"" is the highlight here, with     Bendian's melodic riffs being pushed into all the right places by Cline and Liebig. The     appropriately titled ""Drive"" is similar-- it experiments even further with stop/start tempo     shifts and punctuated vibe riffs.</p>
<p>Less interesting are the drawn out, moody drone pieces like ""Diaspora"" and ""Sanctuary"" (a John     McLaughlin composition) where the intros can last up to two minutes before the tempos shift at     all.  Still, on balance, this is tasteful, accomplished vibe-driven music that should appeal     to fans of the Chicago instrumental scene willing to take the full jazz plunge. But don't say I     didn't warn you about the guitar.</p>

Five feet
    from its northwest corner stands a single willow tree.  One hazy Sunday afternoon, I set about
    reclining under this tree, when all of a sudden I heard a great rumbling.  The earth beneath me
    began to crumble, and before I could move it bottomed out and I found myself plunging toward
    the bowels of the earth.  Descending towards what I was sure would be my demise, I blacked out.</p><p>
    
    I awoke in a brightly lit environment, surrounded on three sides by endless white space.
    Directly in front of me stood a gargantuan green metal gate, reflecting the mysterious light
    so intensely that I could barely look at it. ""My God!"" I said to myself.  ""I'm... dead!""</p><p>
    
    ""Not so!""</p><p>
    
    I spun around to see where the mysterious voice had come from, and found myself face-to-face
    with six large elephants. To my amazement, the largest began to speak:</p><p>
    
    ""Greetings, visitor. We are the six keepers of the Elephant 6 Kingdom. I am Fluffy, the elephant
    of precious cute.""</p><p>
    
    ""I am Pinky, elephant of psychedelia.""</p><p>
    
    ""I am Zanzithoph, elephant of bizarre and archaic instruments.""</p><p>
    
    ""I am Fatty, elephant of dense, layered production.""</p><p>
    
    ""I am Friendly, elephant of perpetually rotating band members.""</p><p>
    
    ""I am Ringo, elephant of Beatle worship. And you have arrived just in time for the party.""</p><p>
    
    Before I had an opportunity to interrogate the elephants, I was whisked through the green gates
    into a vast open field. The elephants led me to a massive circus tent that lay in the middle of
    the field. ""We cannot go beyond this point,"" spoke Pinky. ""We wish you the best of luck."" And
    with that, the six immense pachyderms dissolved into a sweet-smelling mist.</p><p>
    
    ""Hello? Hello?"" No response, except the echo of my own voice through the distant hills. Timidly,
    I peeled back the curtain leading to the giant big top. The incoming flood of shapes and colors
    almost knocked me on my back. Inside, various creatures, all dressed in tie-dyed business suits
    were mingling, drinking bright green ambrosia from silver goblets. But before I could fully take
    in my surroundings, the ringmaster approached me. ""Welcome,"" he said. ""We've been expecting you.
    My name is Robert Schneider.""</p><p>
    
    ""How did I get here?""</p><p>
    
    ""You got here through the door.""</p><p>
    
    ""Yes, yes, but how did I get here?""</p><p>
    
    ""Ah, but the question is not how you got here. The question is, how did you get <i>there</i>?""</p><p>
    
    I looked around and, to my astonishment, I found myself standing on the opposite end of the
    circus at the base of a giant stage.  Robert was nowhere to be found.  A voice came from behind
    me:</p><p>
    
    ""No time to dawdle! The band is about to play!""</p><p>
    
    ""Robert! What?! What band?""</p><p>
    
    ""Shhhh!""</p><p>
    
    I turned around to find that the stage, which only moments ago had been empty, was completely
    set up.  Three skinny gents in silver t-shirts were standing onstage, guitars in hand, grinning
    at me.</p><p>
    
    ""My name is Kevin Barnes,"" said a man with a guitar, ""and this is my band, Of Montreal. We are
    going to play some songles for you.""</p><p>
    
    ""Songles?!""</p><p>
    
    The band started their set. From the moment they began playing, I could tell I was going to dig
    it. Of Montreal had all the tenets of a great Elephant 6 band-- the catchy melodies, the whimsical
    lyrics, the marching-band-on-acid aesthetic, it was all there in full form.  I turned to Robert,
    who stood next to me, eating porridge out of a tremendous pink flower.</p><p>
    
    ""Bob, these guys sound great! Let me guess... you're their producer?""</p><p>
    
    A pearl-shaped tear welled in Robert's eye.  He replied, ""Alas, no!""</p><p>
    
    ""But Bob! They sound so...""</p><p>
    
    ""So Beatles? Yes, I know! Listen to 'Scenes from My Funeral!' Tell me that guitar part isn't
    taken straight out of 'Getting Better!'""</p><p>
    
    ""Well, they definitely sound like they <i>like</i> the Beatles, but I wouldn't quite compare...""</p><p>
    
    ""Oh, they do.  They <i>really</i> like the Beatles.""</p><p>
    
    ""I love how dense and layered the sound is-- the sound is just huge! It reminds me of...""</p><p>
    
    ""The Beatles?!""</p><p>
    
    ""Uh... Hey, what's he doing now?""</p><p>
    
    ""Oh... you see, Kevin likes to tell stories. This song is called 'Ira's Brief Life as a Spider'.
    It's about a spider who gets bitten by a snake hiding in a lake in a crater on his own tongue.""</p><p>
    
    ""What in the fuck?!  This is starting to freak me out.  I love this music, but the lyrics are
    starting to get on my nerves a little.""</p><p>
    
    ""Granted, the lyrics are a bit twee. But the music is so good! Kevin can write a good melody
    so effortlessly and arrange it impeccably.""</p><p>
    
    ""Wait a second.  Is this a Kinks song?""</p><p>
    
    ""Yes! 'World Keeps Going Round'.""</p><p>
    
    ""Good tune.  But couldn't Kevin have done a bit more with the arrangement?  Wouldn't it have
    been that much better if he'd given Ray Davies a complete psychedelic makeover?""</p><p>
    
    ""Perhaps. Hold on, they're finishing the set!""</p><p>
    
    And as the last few notes rung out from Kevin Barnes' guitar, the array of strange creatures
    that, along with me, had made up the audience, returned to their underground dwellings.  This
    left only Robert and I.</p><p>
    
    ""Say, Bob, that was a really fantastic show! I'm going to pick up one of their records as
    soon as I get back. Wait a second... get back?! How am I supposed to get out of here?!""</p><p>
    
    ""Do not fear.  One sip of this drink will return you to the place that you call home.""</p><p>
    
    I grasped the silver-lined goblet from Robert's hand and took a quick sip of the iridescent
    liquid contained within. The second the drink touched my lips, I found myself standing back
    underneath the willow tree. The Elephant 6 Kingdom seemed nothing but a distant memory.
    Shaken, I gathered my bearings and started to head home. ""Boy,"" I said to myself, ""that was
    one hell of a trip. Kind of like...""</p><p>
    
    A familiar voice echoed in the distance: ""<i>Magical Mystery Tour</i>?""</p></div>"|5950.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5950-horse-and-elephant-eatery-no-elephants-allowed-the-singles-and-songles-collection/|8.3|Matt LeMay

Am I the only one out there getting worn
    out by the inundation of post-rock and avant-garde instrumental music which
    has recently struck us?  Granted, it usually seems rather creative at first,
    but how many times can one really listen to the same unusual riff before the
    wave of aural numbness crashes down?  Modal scales are certainly interesting
    enough in moderation, but only a few bands can successfully integrate them into
    every song without the listener wondering, ""Didn't I hear this same theme in
    songs three and seven already?""  As the indie world waits patiently for the
    reemergence of revered groups like Tortoise and June of 44, only the most
    courageous, avid fans of the genre dare to enter the fray of dangerously
    mediocre post-rock that sounds so bizarre that it often passes for genius.</p><p>
    
    The most recent heirs to the vacant post-rock throne are the Mercury Program,
    a four-piece ubiquitously championed by critics and misanthropic webloggers
    alike.  Many have attributed a prodigious talent to these four musicians that
    may not be undeserved, but is definitely premature.  <i>From the Vapor of
    Gasoline</i> is a fine record, full of atmospheric tones and unique songwriting,
    but it's not the post-rock opus that so many have dubbed it. Of course, this is
    never the fault of the Mercury Program, but instead the record labels that
    incessantly proclaim that each release is ""surely a classic"" or ""certainly
    their best effort to date by far.""</p><p>
    
    Though probably not a classic, <i>From the Vapor of Gasoline</i> is a solid
    sophomore release which carves its own niche in the venerable post-rock
    canon.  This record is home to an interesting blend of noise, twisting,
    flowing guitar figures with ephemeral vibraphone sounds, backed by the
    pervasive, polyrhythmic tapping of snare and crash cymbals.  Tracks like
    ""Reinventing a Challenge for Machines"" and ""Highways Like Veins"" feature a
    cutting breed of puncturing guitar which serves as the Mercury Program's
    signature sound.  As my dad remarked earlier, ""This stuff will knock you
    out."" He was referring not to the sonic might of the tracks, but to the fact
    that the somber moodiness and repetitive quality of many of the songs puts
    one to sleep quickly if one is not careful.</p><p>
    
    Following in the footsteps of many of their musical progenitors, the Mercury
    Program's original sound tends to be a bit too readily apparent and redundant
    in each song, with the feel of each track more or less exactly the same.
    <i>From the Vapor of Gasoline</i> lacks the musical versatility and variety
    of a truly consummate record, as the same combinations of instruments,
    identically calibrated, surfaces throughout.  Like any forward-thinking
    post-rock outfit, the Mercury Program sprinkle frugal amounts of vocals on
    choice tracks, such as the effervescent ""The Sea is in Here"" and the shadowy
    ""Leaving Capitol City for Good,"" but this is not sufficient to drive the
    Mercury Program over the city limits from Pretty-Goodville into Smack-You-Around-Like-A-Naughty-Schoolboytown.
    <i>From the Vapor of Gasoline</i> showcases a band with much potential in the
    form of a record that's good for what it is, but not groundbreaking.</p></div>"|5231.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5231-from-the-vapor-of-gasoline/|7.2|Taylor M. Clark

    INT. CHAMPIONSHIP VINYL
    <blockquote><blockquote>
<div align=""CENTER"">ROB</div>
    What's playing?
    <br/>
<div align=""CENTER"">DICK</div>
    It's the new Belle &amp; Sebastian. You like it?
    <br/>
<div align=""CENTER"">ROB</div>
    I don't know. Yeah, I guess.
    <br/>
<div align=""CENTER"">DICK</div>
    Yeah. <i>[pause]</i> But it's really not as good as their older stuff. I mean, there are some
    good songs on here, I guess, but they're not as good as anything from <i>If You're Feeling
    Sinister</i>, or even <i>The Boy with the Arab Strap</i>. It's weird, because the songs
    definitely sound better, but the album is still kind of disappointing.
    <br/>
<div align=""CENTER"">ROB <i>[half paying attention]</i></div>
    Hmm.
    <br/>
<div align=""CENTER"">DICK</div>
    But, then, you know how when you really like a band, the first album you've heard by them
    usually stands out as the best?  I mean, after that first great album you hear, bands pretty
    rarely measure up to your expectations again.
    <br/>
<div align=""CENTER"">ROB</div>
    Yeah, that seems to happen a lot.
    <br/>
<div align=""CENTER"">DICK</div>
    So, maybe this is really a decent album that I just don't like because my expectations are too
    skewed.  But it certainly isn't the best thing Belle &amp; Sebastian have ever done.  Maybe half
    the album is good, but given these guys' track record, half a good album doesn't cut it.
    <br/>
<div align=""CENTER"">ROB</div>
    What's the problem with it?
    <br/>
<div align=""CENTER"">DICK</div>
    Well, Belle &amp; Sebastian used to be just Stuart Murdoch's songs, but on <i>Arab Strap</i>, the
    other members started contributing songs, too.  That's not so much the problem, though, because
    Isobel Campbell's two tracks here are really good.  It's Stevie Jackson and Stuart David's songs
    that get on my nerves. ""Beyond the Sunrise"" is so pallid and lugubrious it's silly, and ""The
    Wrong Girl"" seems too insipidly poppy.
    <br/>
<div align=""CENTER"">ROB <i>(sarcastically)</i></div>
    A Belle &amp; Sebastian song that's too poppy?
    <br/>
<div align=""CENTER"">DICK</div>
    Hey, Stuart Murdoch's best songs have always been breezy, but they're usually given heft by
    dry wit and eccentric detail. On this album, his better songs are the sadder, more serious
    ones-- ""I Fought in a War"" and ""The Chalet Lines.""  His lighter, more pop-driven songs come off
    more like parodies of Belle &amp; Sebastian songs, or, at best, outtakes from past albums. ""The
    Model"" and ""Women's Realm"" sound like he's trying too hard, cramming in as much lyrical and
    musical detail as he can.  All that decoration just crushes the song, which, you know, wasn't
    that great in the first place.
    <br/>
<div align=""CENTER"">ROB</div>
    So, you don't like the record, then.
    <br/>
<div align=""CENTER"">DICK</div>
    No, no, it's okay. But like I said, it's disappointing. I think in the long run, I'll listen
    to <i>Sinister</i> and even <i>Arab Strap</i> more than this one.

I'd
    almost forgotten that it existed until this morning when I opened my window, and in rushed the
    subtle smell of early spring. As the sweetened wind permeated my room, everything around me
    seemed to get brighter, as if infused by some euphoric energy. And just when I thought that
    things couldn't get any more blissful, the harmonious sounds of The Essex Green's new EP first
    entered by head, each melody dancing around on my brain like an elated sprite.</p><p>
    
    The opening track, ""Fabulous Day"", begins with a beautifully understated acoustic guitar and
    flute motif. As mild vocals and subtle percussive elements enter the mix, the tune begins to
    take the form of a gorgeous, fully realized pop song with a diverse but pleasing chord
    progression.  ""Chester"" showcases singer/guitarist Sasha Bell's clear, almost child-like
    vocals, set against the backdrop of an ever-mutating but always riveting melodic structure.
    The song ends with a stark, beautiful keyboard part, replaying the original melodic theme.
    The final track, and one of the EP's standouts, ""Bald"", opens with an underwater congregation
    of backwards guitar, acoustic guitar, and wah'd-out electric guitar before warping into a
    Zombies-like groove, chock-full of shrieking organs.  Suddenly, the rhythm slows to double-time,
    and the song shifts into blissful chorus.  Then, seamlessly, the song shifts back to its
    original theme, and back into the chorus, before exploding into a divine sea of Hammond
    organ, drums, feedback, and reverb-laden acoustic guitar.</p><p>
    
    The music on this self-titled EP is deceptively simple.  But while it'd be easy to write The
    Essex Green off as just another purveyor of 60s pop, the band packs so many beautiful melodies
    into each track, and complements those melodies with such impeccably chosen instrumentation,
    that to dismiss this band simply for sounding somewhat like other excellent bands from days
    of yore would be a damn shame-- especially considering that The Essex Green don't limit
    themselves to sounds used by 60s groups.  True, this record isn't groundbreaking, but it does
    what it's supposed to do with grace and originality. And months from now, when falls comes
    along, I'll be happy to have it with me as a reminder that spring will return again.</p></div>"|2836.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2836-essex-green-ep/|8.1|Matt LeMay

We have Colombian coffee, Cuban cigars, Japanese
    lanterns, Canadian geese, Russian roulette, Greek gods, Portuguese sweet bread, Spanish
    fly, the Brazilian bikini wax, and Danish danish... es.  Copenhagen's master bakers
    quietly but diligently ship confections bearing their country's namesake to coffee shops
    and bakeries around the world every morning-- but don't let their modesty fool you.  Two
    of Denmark's larger exports are costume Viking hats and those dirty pens that reveal naked
    ladies when you turn them upside down.</p><p>
    I was in Copenhagen for eight hours once, and as far as I could tell, the Danes ride free
    city bikes and drink beer in street cafes all day.  The six-year old girls all looked punk
    rock.  Grueling winters of short days and long nights drive teens into their basements
    where they consume vodka and listen to death metal and industrial music.  Sure, that
    happens in New Jersey, too, but Lou Reed's <i>Ecstasy</i> hasn't cracked the Top 20 there.
    It has in Denmark.</p><p>
    Amazon customers who bought <i>Ecstasy</i> also purchased recent releases by aging rock
    legends including Patti Smith's <i>Gung Ho</i>, Neil Young's <i>Silver and Gold</i>,
    and Marianne Faithfull's <i>Vagabond Ways</i>.  I'm assuming that this demographic rocked
    out to Lou's earlier work only to find their shoulders ""car dancing"" to the irritating
    swagger of horns in Huey Lewis &amp; The News' ""It's Hip to be Square"" several years later.
    This progression adequately prepared them for <i>Ecstasy</i>'s careful studio mix of
    familiar-sounding riff-based rock songs and brass explosions.  But before you can say
    ""adult contemporary,"" Reed sings, ""Not if I wrap myself in nylon/ A piece of duct tape
    down my back,"" pairing his casual and cool vocal execution with lyrics concerning the
    paranoia and masochism which can lurk in a passionate marriage.</p><p>
    While <i>Ecstasy</i> is essentially a concept album about the fantasies and realities of
    love and family, it includes as much sex, drugs, and rock n' roll culture as any of Reed's
    earlier work.  Sadly, the stubborn confidence of his once naïve voice has now disappeared.
    But at this stage in the game, no one's doubting that Reed has paid his dues on the wildside,
    allowing him to devote more explicit attention to the themes of helplessness and vulnerability
    his songs have always touched on.  If some of the poetry is lost in this translation across
    decades, it's still a richly textured document that adds a few pages to the biography of a
    rock legend.</p><p>
    As a huge Velvet Underground fan and a slow learner, I've maintained an unhealthy curiosity
    in Reed's recent output, and <i>Ecstasy</i> is certainly an easier listen than any material
    Reed wrote in 90s, let alone Moe Tucker's <i>Dogs Under Stress</i> or John Cale's <i>Walking
    on Locusts</i>.  But of course, the disc is bogged down by endlessly mundane material.  I
    remember the first time I heard ""The Black Angel's Death Song"".  The recording might have
    been 15 years old, but I'd never experienced anything like the demonic seesaws of its electric
    viola feedback.  Cale's screeching bow broke the veneer of disinterest in Reed's cadenced and
    schizophrenic lyrical poetry.  The old VU classic still hasn't lost its odd thrill, but
    employing it as a comparison to <i>Ecstasy</i>'s ""Like a Possum"", a similar attempt to pair
    a long poem with off-kilter sound collage, pushes ""the possum"" into the category of ""the
    unbearable.""</p><p>
    However, you don't need any sort of attachment to ""The Black Angel's Death Song"" to find its
    bloated, extended relative unbearable.  ""Like a Possum"" begins: ""Good morning, it's Possum Day/
    Feel like a possum in every way/ Like a possum/ Possum whiskers, possum face/ Like a Possum.""
    The song continues through more than a quarter-hour's worth of tragico-absurdist lyrics that Lou
    speak-sings over a sloppy pastiche of slightly dissonant electric guitar and slow washes of fuzz
    bass, until it somehow makes its way to, ""Shooting and coming 'til it hurts/ O, holy morning/
    Calm as an angel.""  Equally cringe-inducing is the rockin' ""Future Farmers of America""-- an
    overwritten piece of commentary on race relations that sounds like Reed's best approximation of
    a young Jon Cougar.</p><p>
    If Marianne Faithfull's latest brings her <i>Vagabond Ways</i> to an adult-contemporary audience,
    Reed takes his old vagabond ways and places them into that audience's living rooms to mingle with
    the lingering fantasies that might be interfering with their troubled marriages.  His limited vocal
    range, which has always straddled the line between singing and speaking, maintains its uncanny
    ability to compel you to listen to his stories.  It's just that those stories now belong to a 58-year
    old.  This might explain the cover photo, which doubles as a shot of a man in ""ecstasy"" and a Bayer
    ad.  Lou's eyes are closed, his lips are parted, and his head is thrown back while a red laser darts
    through his neck.  I can't imagine what's going on here.  Regardless, the Danes are still listening,
    and for a few more rotations, so am I.</p></div>"|6735.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6735-ecstasy/|6.5|Kristin Sage Rockermann

    sorts.  He has shot for the moon, but skids to a halt on the ground, hindered by young wings.  Granted, I'm 20.  He's 20.
    Far be it from me to criticize the efforts of those my age based solely on our greenness, but as my grandmother would say,
    Oberst's eyes are a lot bigger than his stomach.</p><p>
<i>Fevers and Mirrors</i> is home to the sophomoric musical meanderings of a young songwriter who seems to take himself far
    too seriously.  This doesn't mean that the music is that bad, only that it's marred by its own overzealous nature.  Quite
    the contrary, there are a few gems hidden in the niches of this album.  ""The Calendar Hung Itself..."" is an intense piece
    which grinds along to an addictive Latin guitar strumming pattern.  On ""Haligh, Haligh, A Lie, Haligh,"" Oberst makes an old
    chord progression seem new with a strong acoustic hook and nicely executed instrumentation from a vibraphone and slide
    guitar.  However, the album as a whole fails in several departments.</p><p>
    
    What in particular are these fatal flaws that plague Bright Eyes?  Let's begin with Oberst's voice.  Initially, he seems
    wracked with intense emotion.  But listen closer.  His voice has one setting: unsteady quaver.  He sounds hypothermic.
    Nowhere is this more apparent than on ""When the Curious Girl Realizes She is Under Glass,"" where the effect is so extreme
    that it becomes absolutely ridiculous, not to mention unnerving.</p><p>
    
    So much of what passes for emotional and intellectual depth on this album is blatantly contrived nonsense. This would never
    have been so terribly obvious had he not placed a gut-wrenchingly ludicrous staged radio interview with himself at the end
    of ""An Attempt to Tip the Scales.""  I simply cannot stress enough what a maddeningly self-indulgent mass of pseudo-depth
    this section of the album falls into.  In this sickening chunk of narcissism, Oberst makes a laughable attempt to prove to
    his listeners that he is of a penetratingly deep intelligence by spouting strings of stale aphorisms that pass for rich
    understanding amongst those reluctant to have original thought.  Not only this, but the mock interviewer actually interrupts
    Oberst to tell him how brilliant the album is.  On the <i>actual record</i> he says this.  I hate to sound haughty, but I
    have honestly never witnessed such tasteless, ostentatious self-promotion on an album by anyone.  It must be heard to be
    believed.</p><p>
    
    On a strictly musical level, Bright Eyes has his definitive moments but struggles with originality for the majority of
    the record.  ""Something Vague"" showcases one of the most abused chord progressions in existence with little variation on
    what's already been done.  ""The Movement of a Hand"" sounds suspiciously like an Eels song.  And in a sign of lackluster
    songwriting, far too many of the songs on <i>Fevers and Mirrors</i> fall victim to the predictability problem of vocals
    following the bassline at all times.  ""A Scale, A Mirror, and Those Indifferent Clocks,"" ""Arienette,"" and ""The Center of
    the World"" are all paradigm cases of this trait despite being pleasant enough songs.</p><p>
    
    In most places, <i>Fevers and Mirrors</i> makes for an interesting listen considering its flaws.  The instrumentation is
    diverse and tastefully orchestrated by the large cast, and it's clear that a great deal of thought and talent has been
    contributed to its making.  Unfortunately, the album is also contrived and makes too blatant an effort to convince the 
    listener of Oberst's tragic wisdom.  It's a record that can be enjoyable in select places and definitely shows signs of
    potential, yet falls victim to mediocrity when held against the work of truly developed musicians.  Oberst is in the early
    stages of developing a talent that will likely take some years to fully mature.  When it does, I look forward eagerly to
    the result.  For the time being, he's a far cry from excellent.</p></div>"|941.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/941-fevers-and-mirrors/|5.4|Taylor M. Clark

The young ones sure do grow up fast these days.  Just last spring
    I helped a band grow from toddlerhood to adolescence.  To put it mildly, <i>Where's Wolfie</i>,
    Wolfie's sophomore LP, didn't really satisfy me.  Yet, those who heard their debut couldn't
    really call it a ""slump.""  Naturally, Mike Downey (as in ""softener"") e-mailed me voicing his
    objections.  See, he plays guitar/bass and sings in Wolfie.  Turns out he disagreed with my
    opinion!  Mike went on to make other brilliant observations like, ""All music is good,"" ""If you 
    don't like an album, don't review it,"" and ""I'm not a music critic, nor will I ever be, since
    it's the most pretentious profession.""  Just above rockstar, then?</p><p>
    Then a strange thing happened.  Wolfie realized I was right!  On their website, and now in
    the press kit for their new EP, <i>Wolfie and the Coat and Hat</i>, the band proclaims, ""We made
    an album that none of us were happy with from day one of its release.""  Funny, Mike really
    seemed to be behind it at the time.  ""We had made an album none of us could listen to,"" Wolfie
    confess.  Certainly speaks a lot for the fans they sold it to.  My primary criticism with
    <i>Where's Wolfie</i> laid in the heavy reliance on three chords, moog stabs and ""la-la-las.""
    Soon afterward, Wolfie coincidentally ""realized we could do better than a few power chords, a 
    cheesy synth keyboard, and some 'la la las.'\x94  Well then, the big question is: can they?  The
    answer: a resounding ""Eh..."" (4.9).</p><p>
    ""They Call Me Leaves"" opens the EP with fuzzed-out bass that dominates the mix.  Amanda, Joe
    and Mike pass off harmonies like relay batons.  The song skips along with urgency, barely 
    allowing enough time for synchronized fist-pumping, rushing over hilly choruses before
    splashing down with a-- gasp-- Big Rock Solo into a dainty acoustic coda.  The song sticks
    agreeably like chocolate ticks.  Still, shouldn't bands set the high jump bar a little higher
    than the Rentals' <i>Seven More Minutes</i>?</p><p>
    The big light bulb that appeared over Wolfie's collective head flickered Morse code inspiration
    to the awed rockers.  It thus spoke in glows (being collegiate Mathletes, Wolfie easily
    comprehend Morse code): ""Wolfie, put two little songs together to make one bigger song and this
    will be complex songwriting.""  Thus, by the second track, ""It's Hard Luck Being Me,"" tempered
    chugging breaks into a perky four-note blues progression.  (Please keep in mind that this is a
    guitar classification and not any indication of real ""blues."")  ""The All Good People\x94 similarly
    shifts gears midway.  Far from being prog, this short attention span style at least keeps
    listeners on their toes.  Unfortunately, it also gets in the way of any real songwriting
    development.  Still, this is pop at its gummiest.  One shouldn't expect the craft of Canada's
    Greatest, Leonard Cohen.</p><p>
    So, yes, some progressions are made from the last album.  Guitars punch more than scratch (and
    tickle).  Harmonies assist choruses instead of randomly ba-ba-ing for ba-ba-ing's sake.  But
    <i>Wolfie and the Coat and Hat</i> takes baby steps for a band that disowned their last album.
    Grindcore or kraut-rock would be a real conversion.  Perhaps I didn't make myself clear enough
    last time.  Not only is there more to pop than three chords, moog stabs and ""la-la-las,"" but 
    additionally, there's more to pop than thin organ ooze, a few open chords, and some
    ""Ahh-ah-ah-aaaa-ahs"" and/or ""Whoo-oo-ooos.""  Okay, sometimes there's not, but that sometimes
    was back in 1962.  Lyrically, Wolfie could use another Morse code-speaking giant light bulb.
    But until one comes along, let me make some final recommendations.  I just want to help.
    I know you're listening.</p><p>
    1)\tLet Amanda sing more.  Or at least have Joe and Mike see someone about that sinus problem.
    Claritin, perhaps?</p><p>
    2)\tThe instruments seem punched into a computer.  Depth and warmth should slake the production.
    The translucent organ wavers like a whistle.  Picture pipe organs bursting from church balconies.
    Open rooms and multiple tracks exist to be filled.  Don't worry about replicating this live. 
    Build, build, build.  Tone, tone, tone.</p><p>
    3)\tStop singing about birds and flowers and trees and leaves and groves and hats and coats
    and...</p><p>

Here lies Catherine Wheel, an exceptional band for nearly 10 years, owner of several
    masterful albums, ranging from the propulsive shoegazing of <i>Ferment</i> and <i>Chrome</i>
    to the psychedelic brit-rock of <i>Adam and Eve</i>.  The band managed not only to adapt their
    sound as popular tastes changed, but performed the even rarer feat of leaving an indelible mark
    on each style as they went.  With each subsequent album, Catherine Wheel expanded their sonic
    palate and grew more willing to experiment with their signature sound.  (Even if the cost of
    that increased musical experimentation meant lyrical regression.)</p><p>
    
    When word came that Catherine Wheel was releasing their fifth proper LP, <i>Wishville</i>, we
    figured it'd be a slam dunk.  After all, this was a band that had survived the inevitable
    shoegazer backlash by reinventing themselves as a powerhouse neo-grunge outfit.  Perhaps more
    to their credit, they made the transition so credible and seamless that it seemed downright
    preposterous to suggest that they had ever been anything else.  Given that audacious
    transformation, there remained little doubt in our minds that Catherine Wheel could emerge from 
    a label change and a split with their longtime bassist unscathed.  We were grievously mistaken.</p><p>
    
    The record's opening track, which rather fittingly also serves as the lead single, captures all
    of the album's flaws in its four interminable minutes.  ""Sparks are Gonna Fly"" relies on one
    monotonous riff repeated ad nauseam for the duration of the song.  No amount of layering or 
    studio wizardry can hide how paper-thin the song is.  The same basic problem plagues all of 
    these nine songs: the production and layering effects are used in an attempt to mask the
    shortcomings rather than to enhance the melodies.  Many of the additional instruments thrown
    into the mix feel forced, whether it's the harmonica on ""Ballad of a Running Man"" or the violin
    on ""Gasoline.""  This is in sharp contrast to the function of the extra instruments on <i>Adam 
    and Eve</i>, which seemed both effortless and integral to the overall song structures.</p><p>
    
    If anything positive can be said about the band at this stage, it's that they haven't rested on
    their laurels.  Catherine Wheel have indeed morphed their sound once again.  Yet unlike their
    previous efforts, the new sound sees them pushing into some pretty unsavory territory.  ""What
    We Want to Believe In"" sounds like, as its title suggests, the work of a drunken Christian rock
    band (if one actually existed).  Even more embarrassing is ""Mad Dog,"" a song that wouldn't
    sound out of place on a compilation of Collective Soul b-sides.</p><p>
    
    But even when Catherine Wheel manage to stumble into a mildly engaging melody, they successfully
    sully any possible pleasure with laughable couplets like: ""Fuel of fathers' sweat/ Sweet like
    baby's breath,"" or, ""Strong like Superman/ Stinking up the streets I am.""  Other inadvertently
    hilarious lyrics come at the start of ""Idle Life,"" where Rob Dickinson comatosely mutters,
    ""Give me soap to shave around/ With my guts exposed and slippy,"" without the aid of any
    instrumentation.  Yeah, trust us, it sounds even worse than it reads.</p><p>
    
    In case some of you haven't quite gotten the message, or it hasn't been made perfectly clear
    yet: this album is absolutely terrible, a total abomination.  It's a loss in every sense of the
    word.  Ah, well, guys, it's been a great run of it.  Most bands never make it to nine years,
    let alone enjoy a consistently superb output.  But now, in the interest of good taste, it's
    time to pack it in and call it quits.  Services will be held at daybreak.</p></div>"|1348.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1348-wishville/|1.7|Beatty & Garrett

When
    I'd come across a reference to the band, they'd generally be described as some
    retro new wave thing. Then I'd notice later that they were on Mego, a label
    known for releasing the most abstract and challenging laptop music going, and
    that they had some kind of political/theoretical underpinnings. ""I must have
    that new wave angle wrong,"" I thought to myself. ""They must be some kind of
    ambient terrorist provocateurs like Ultra Red or Terre Thaemlitz.""</p><p>
    
    But I heard correctly. Chicks on Speed are obsessed with the sounds of the
    80's, they do have a political agenda, and they are on Mego. They're three
    women from Munich (one of whom is American) and Chicks on Speed is merely the
    latest in a long line of art projects. This work seeks to challenge some
    assumptions about women or music or women in music. Or something like that. I
    honestly didn't spend a lot of time trying to decipher the political slant.
    It's feminist in some way-- I gathered that much-- but the point of view is
    not terribly clear. Fortunately, it doesn't matter much when it comes to
    getting down to digging these tunes, a nice mix of recontextualized covers
    and originals.</p><p>
    
    ""Glamour Girl,"" a fantastically groovy house number inspired in some respect
    by C+C Music Factory, seems to be making some sort of comment about the empty
    gestures involved with a woman getting dolled up for a night on the town.
    ""She's a glamour girl, she stands so still/ Wears a feather bra, her hair is
    so high/ It starts to sway when she brushes her teeth/ Five times a day.""
    Since when is good oral hygiene supposed to be a statement about power
    relationships?  The glamour girl may need a haircut, but she'll likely have
    the last laugh and the toothiest smile.  Sitting here in my filthy undershirt
    with a head full of cavities, it's hard to empathize.</p><p>
    
    So you'll forgive me if I fail to judge this album on its political merits.
    I'm just so much more interested in how the sparse electro machinations on
    this version of Normal's ""Warm Leatherette"" feel wired into my spine, forcing
    me to sway uncontrollably whenever the song plays. It's like the aural
    equivalent of a portrait of Gary Numan laser-carved out of a sheet of tin.</p><p>
    
    The Megoisms bubble up to the surface on the Chicks' cover of the B-52's
    ""Give Me Back My Man."" The vocals are heavily processed and treated like
    another rhythmic component, and the lockstep beat snatches the Neu! pulse
    back from the new wavers and reclaims it for Deutschland once and for all.
    Also impressive on the DSP front is ""Little Star,"" which features a slowly
    building morass of digital noise that finally grows into a bittersweet pop
    tune as the spoken vocals morph into melody.</p><p>
    
    Perhaps the most interesting track here is the last, a cover of Cracker's
    ""Euro Trash Girl."" It's striking partly because it comes from three women who
    could easily have been the objects of David Lowery's affection, but the music
    is what makes it. Brilliantly, they strip the song down to repetitious, minimal
    techno, and sound positively bored speaking the vocals. Maybe for their next
    record, they'll do some incisive gender commentary with a glitch version of
    ""Mr. Wrong."" In any case, I'll probably be checking it out.</p></div>"|1441.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1441-will-save-us-all/|7.3|Mark Richard-San

    of society that spends way too many hours writing about pop music.  The question: what makes one
    person love a song that another person hates?  How can my co-workers prefer Lit to Mingus?  Is
    there an actual reason, defensible on a theoretical level, for how I can love Shudder to Think
    and hate Queen?  The idea of certain music having ""meaning"" has been put forth as an explanation,
    and likely, this is the explanation to which most of us gravitate.  We generally prefer the idea
    of personal significance to the concept of a continuum scale of consensual meaning.</p><p>
    
    But the discussion of meaning in pop music is probably best tabled, and quick.  The question,
    ""What does this song mean to me?"" is a semiotician's nightmare (or freaky sex dream-- what's
    the difference?), and few rock critics are up to that particular ontological and epistemological
    tangle.  Certainly, I'm not.  Forty years after a couple of French eggheads administered a
    fairly sound lashing to the idea that language is capable of any real attempt at communication,
    we're probably better off not suggesting that the Magnetic Fields are better than N'Sync based
    on some tenuous idea of signification.</p><p>
    
    Frankly, it's practically an unanswerable question.  The sooner we abandon our personal quests
    to convince so-and-so that, say, Fleetwood Mac sucks, the better.  Still, for what it's worth,
    I'm attracted to a linguistic approach.  I like the idea that language acts on the brain and
    imposes an order on the actual physical organ.  I like the idea that a sentence, or a guitar
    solo, is constructed based on certain neurological realities.  I like the idea of my brain
    having a ""taste center"" in addition to a ""language center"" and a ""motor center.""  Because with
    that formulation, the issue of self-worth immediately drops out and I get to stop feeling shitty
    for liking music that others hate.</p><p>
    
    Which brings me, in a way, to <i>Wasp Star</i>.  This album went straight to my taste center,
    inhibiting serotonin reuptake and giving me a sense of pleasure and well-being.  Moreover, it
    got me thinking about pop music and the brains that both make it and consume it.</p><p>
    
    Andy Partridge has got some brain.  Whatever deep structure informs his pop syntax, the songs
    that result have just gotten better over time-- and there are a grip of good songs on <i>Wasp
    Star</i>.  The lead-off, ""Playground,"" is a fantastic pop song whose introductory riff recalls
    the opening of <i>The Black Sea</i>'s ""Respectable Street.""  Over crisp guitars and big drums,
    Partridge relates his recent money and romantic troubles to schoolyard drama. ""Playground,""
    ""We're All Light,"" ""I'm the Man Who Murdered Love,"" and ""My Brown Guitar"" are all offspring of
    the sound XTC honed to a monomolecular edge during the '80s-- great hooks, full sound, baroque
    production values.  On the merit of those four songs alone, <i>Wasp Star</i> lives up to its
    potential as an electrified companion to last year's <i>Apple Venus</i>.</p><p>
    
    Partridge's peculiar lyrical sensibility is in full force here as well. Sometimes syrupy, often
    even willfully ditzy, but never hackneyed, <i>Wasp Star</i>'s lyrics closely recall <i>Oranges
    and Lemons</i> in their playfulness and sheer word-per-song density.  Even Partridge's
    occasional patches of bitterness come off as exultant due to their shiny pop settings.  The
    single exception comes with ""Wounded Horse,"" as straight-up a twelve bar blues number as XTC
    are capable of producing.  Colin Moulding's three songs are a bit more subdued and folksy, and
    perhaps more suited to <i>Apple Venus</i>'s sensibility, but they hold up well to the guitar-
    oriented nature of this album.</p><p>
    
    What XTC are never really given enough credit for is Partridge's guitarwork.  He's an endlessly
    inventive guitarist, whether backing a verse with bursts of bizarre, inverted chords or playing
    an all-out jazz-inflected solo.  In fact, his strange phrasing and over-the-bar articulation
    is what got me thinking about linguistics in the first place.  Something in his brain makes his
    guitar sound a certain way, and something in my brain makes that way sound pretty damn good.</p><p>
    
    It's true that <i>Wasp Star</i> is less thematically linked than <i>Apple Venus</i>, and some
    have criticized this seeming lack of cohesiveness.  But honestly, ""cohesive"" is a word that
    crops up in too many record reviews, and if <i>Wasp Star</i> has less of it than other late
    XTC albums, it doesn't detract from the quality of the album.  It's a great bunch of songs,
    and it solidifies the notion that XTC are back from the wilderness and ready to rock the show.
    My brain is glad for it.</p></div>"|8830.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8830-wasp-star-apple-venus-vol-2/|8.0|Zach Hooker

    to its liner notes. David Fricke's lengthy, idealistic prose that accompanies 
    this album pokes through to my sentimental side just enough to make me want 
    to really embrace <i>Surrendered</i>. The vaguely professed goal to make
    so-called ""free"" jazz that can pull listeners in on its own merits with no 
    inherent pretension or difficult complexity to intellectualize is enough to
    make quite a few music lovers feel downright romantic.</p><p>
        And what better place than here? The David S. Ware Quartet is a 
    supergroup of the form, and has the chops to back the clout. Matthew Shipp 
    and William Parker are respected bandleaders in their own right and would 
    nary see fit to upstage Ware on his own turf. Guillermo E. Brown's cymbal-
    heavy atmospherics may not size up to his predecessor Susie Ibarra's work on
    previous Ware Quartet outings, but is capable enough to keep things moving.</p><p>
        But in the end, it's the lineup of the Quartet that accounts for its
    flaws. Ware himself plays so sporadically here that Shipp has no choice but
    to pick up the slack and virtually hold each song down. Brown is of little
    help with his busy flourishes and cymbal rolls, often seemingly unaware that
    any rhythm needs keeping. And Parker's subsonic bass reaches new lows of
    complete inaudibility, preventing him from effectively making up for the
    lack of a solid rhythm section.</p><p>
        ""Peace Celestial"" begins with a grandiose overture-type opening, and 
    maintains its dull air even when the piece hits its climax. Ware and Shipp
    plug away at the same simple melody for so long that the subtleties of their
    improvisation are sunken into a long snore. The short, casual rendition of
    Charles Lloyd's ""Sweet Georgia Bright"" that follows is a welcome respite from
    the overblown introduction. But then, frustratingly, ""Theme of Ages"" returns
    the listener to another long haul of flailing around the same six notes for
    seven minutes. Toward the record's end, Shipp bangs on some low keys for a
    brief moment of interest, but it's a case of too little too late.</p><p>
        Fittingly, <i>Surrendered</i>'s title track is the most effective of the
    original compositions here. It follows the same ponderous formula as the
    others, but is incrementally more dynamic, with Parker actually rising up to
    be heard for a fleeting end passage.</p><p>
<i>Surrendered</i> ends with a 16-minute rendition of Beaver Harris'
    ""African Drums."" Once again, Shipp's piano is the only constant, with Ware and
    Brown stretching into as many variations as possible, and Parker barely a 
    presence. But they keep it up long enough that Shipp actually gets a solo, and
    a rather good one, at that. Eventually, all but the drums drop out, leaving
    Brown to unravel an interesting but barely comprehensible solo. Fortunately,
    this clears the air for the tune to build back up with Parker, Shipp and Ware
    coming in individually and re-introducing the theme, and riding it out to a
    satisfactory finish.</p><p>
        It's good that names like these are indulging in such efforts to forward 
    jazz. But upon further inspection, one is left with the impatient desire for 
    these guys to get down to business and quit theorizing.</p></div>"|8582.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8582-surrendered/|5.8|Al Shipley

    not-yet-disintegrated Blow-Pop.  Impatient as I am, I feel that sucking the
    lollipop down to its bubblegum center takes far too long.  Besides, the hard
    candy coating intermingling with the super-slippery gum is a taste sensation
    unlike any other.  If any album captures such an experience, it's undoubtedly
    Towa Tei's third release, <i>Last Century Modern</i>.  With its ultra-sweet
    pop sensibilities, it's not too far from bubblegum, yet there are plenty
    crunchy electronics to chew on.</p><p>
    
    While it may not be Towa Tei's most cohesive solo album, it's by far his most
    consistent.  It's easy to compare the Japanese ex-Deee-Lite DJ's work to
    Pizzicato Five; both create accessible music that values electronic-based
    high kitsch above all else.  However, when their respective new releases are
    held up to each other, <i>Last Century Modern</i> emerges with a sophistication
    Pizzicato Five have only achieved through their fashion sense.</p><p>
    
    Though the record gets off to a rocky start (the waltzing, accordion-based
    title track), the album slickly takes off and rarely loses momentum.  ""A
    Ring"" is a loungy romp that recalls Dimitri from Paris at his very best; both
    ""Angel"" and ""Butterfly"" find Tei spinning tongue-in-cheek breakbeats around
    more lounge fare and Ayumi Tanabe's luscious vocals; and though the
    instrumental ""Stretch Building Bamboo"" comes off a bit too obtuse and clunky,
    Tei more than makes up for it with the production on his remake of the Tom
    Browne funk classic, ""Funkin' for Jamaica.""  Tei deftly incorporates a
    bassline infinitely thicker and juicier than the original. And though Wizdom
    Life's sloppy, brainless ""rhymes"" threaten to take the song down with them,
    the seamless chorus harmonies from Les Nubians keep the song afloat.</p><p>
    
    As great as Tei's stuff is, the real highlight of the record comes with
    Mighty Bop's remix of ""Let Me Know.""  Whereas the original, which appears
    earlier in the album, is sluggish and skittery, Mighty Bop's reworking pumps
    the song up to a bossanova-flavored, mid-tempo dancefloor ballad.  The
    addition of Brazilian guitar, along with more oohs and aahs, help the song
    achieve greatness.  This track is the reason disco balls slow down, shining
    blue lights on the newly lovestruck.</p><p>
    
    The vocals on ""Know"" are handled by fellow Japanese popster Chara, who sounds
    about four years old.  Her overblown cuteness is the only potential low point
    of the album, seeming calculated to drive the Murder City Devils
    t-shirt-wearing cynics crazy.  I, however, find the sugariness ultimately
    satisfying and will continue to listen to <i>Last Century Modern</i> until
    all of my teeth rot out of my head.  I hope it's not for a while.</p></div>"|7959.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7959-last-century-modern/|7.4|Richard M. Juzwiak

    years. They're recording incidental and theme music for hit TV shows like
    ""Malcolm in the Middle"" and ""The Daily Show."" Their current single is the
    extended theme song from the former, titled ""Boss of Me."" They have two
    full-length albums in the works. They're once again running their Dial-a-Song
    service from their answering machine at home (718-387-6962, still ""free when
    you call from work""). And they're setting up a service with EMusic in which,
    for a monthly fee, John Q. Tmbgfan gets all sorts of Internet music
    exclusives.</p><p>
    
    But the kids, they want a new They Might Be Giants CD. Sure, the duo released
    a full-length in '99, but only on MP3! ""Enough with the MP3s,"" fans shout.
    They can't afford those newfangled portable MP3 players. They want to listen
    to their precious geek-rock anywhere they please.  And so, the cries rung out
    in the ears of the two Johns, and they found a solution.</p><p>
    
    Flansburgh and Linnell went into the studio for a week, and another week later,
    they had their new hard product: the <i>Working Undercover for the Man</i> EP.
    It's still on EMusic, and still released through MP3 distribution; however,
    the first few thousand customers also receive a copy on CD, artwork and all.
    A bit gimmicky, and quite frankly, cheap.  But hey, it's effective, I guess.</p><p>
    
    It's pretty obvious that <i>Working Undercover for the Man</i> was completed
    in a brief window of time.  In fact, it almost feels like a nod to the old
    days, in which their songs were so perfectly concise that they could fit 20
    on a 45-minute record while maintaining cohesion.  There's even a
    drum-machine-and-synth track.  But the sad fact is, they moved on long ago.
    Their last two full-lengths were recorded with a live group, and this EP is
    not exception: an array of Dans (think they did that on purpose?) handle
    second guitar, bass and drums.  It's not truly a bad thing, since the Dans
    are talented, tight and versatile musicians.  But many fans still long for
    the mid-'80s, when They Might Be Giants were backed only by pre-programmed
    MIDI instrumentation.</p><p>
    
    Linnell's material seems substantially more fleshed out than Flansburgh's on
    this effort. We begin with ""Rest Awhile,"" a quick, Linnell-penned-and-sung
    power-pop tune with mellotron-ish keyboards and bouncy guitar providing the
    perfect ironic uptempo beat to Linnell's traditionally morbid lyrics.  It's
    followed by a new version of the Dial-a-Song staple and title track, featuring
    a horn section, drum machine and synth, and a sing-songy chorus to accompany
    Flansburgh's wry tale of a government agent posing as a rock star. The lyrics
    are amusing, but the melody is generally forgettable, especially after
    following such an excellent lead-off rocker. ""I Am a Human Head"" serves as
    the record's longest track, a true epic at just under 3 minutes.  It's easily
    the highlight of the EP, pairing the classic Linnell flair for melody with
    the band's nonsensical career-long fascination with the cranium.</p><p>
    
    ""Empty Bottle Collector"" is, on the other hand, utterly disposable; culled
    from the ""Malcolm"" incidental music files, it's basically an improvisation
    on muted trumpet over a jazzy beat and some acoustic bass. Finally, ""On the
    Drag"" spotlights Flansburgh's love for hyper new-wave punk-pop, and features
    one of the most scorching keyboard solos since... um... something by Boston.
    Admittedly, it does seem a bit derivative, but it still manages to pull off
    a little of its own charm.</p><p>
    
    They Might Be Giants would like you to think that <i>Working Undercover for
    the Man</i> doesn't really end there.  Okay, sure.  There are a few ""bonus
    tracks"" thrown in for bargain hunters.  You get: three 15-second jingles
    promoting their online Radio TMBG service, and a throwaway heavy metal take
    on an otherwise benign cut off their forthcoming children's album.  But the
    fact is, these tracks contribute to the filler and make the EP seem like more
    of an afterthought.</p><p>
    
    Therefore, since this EP is incredibly short, I will use the fail-safe,
    <i>Pitchfork</i>-approved method of rating each track individually, and
    totaling the average (as originally implemented by Matt LeMay in his
    review of Console's <i>Rocket in the Pocket</i>):</p><p>
<li> Rest Awhile: 8.0<br/>
<li> Working Undercover for the Man: 6.5<br/>
<li> I Am a Human Head: 8.6<br/>
<li> Empty Bottle Collector: 4.3<br/>
<li> On the Drag: 7.2<br/>
<li> Radio TMBG jingles: 3.0<br/>
<li> Robot Parade (Adult Version): 5.5<p>
    
    Hence, a 6.1. Seems appropriate. <i>Working Undercover for the Man</i>
    certainly has its moments, but in the end, it's just not meaty enough to
    pass as ""necessary.""  I mean, it's only 15 minutes long, for Christ's sake.
    Advice: hurry up on those full-lengths, guys. It's been five years.
    Honestly.</p></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></p></div>"|7992.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7992-working-undercover-for-the-man-ep/|6.1|Spencer Owen

    to late-'70s British punk and post-punk, so much so that you half-expect
    bassist/singer Anthony Roman to break into a refrain of ""This is Radio 4 on
    pirate satellite"" at some point during <i>The New Song and Dance</i>. Tommy
    Williams' guitarwork splits the difference neatly between the clanging,
    reverb-heavy sound of the Clash, and the fractured, Tourette's-like outbursts
    of Gang of Four. One could even assume, without too much of a stretch, that
    they named themselves after the BBC radio station. But what to make of the
    album's title? Is it mere clumsy irony, or an upfront admission to the fact
    that everything old eventually becomes new again in today's recycle-happy
    culture?</p><p>
    Perhaps it's both, but in the end, <i>The New Song and Dance</i> is mostly
    old and more of the same. Not to say that being heavily influenced by
    first-wave British post-punk is a bad thing-- indeed, the world would be
    arguably a much better place if more bands took their cues from the likes of
    Wire and the Fall-- but, as with any influences, bands either need to
    transcend them and establish a sound of their own, or be so damned catchy
    that it's easy to ignore the fact that they're ripping off some other band
    wholesale (hi, Elastica).</p><p>
    Radio 4 bring only improved production techniques to their stuck-in-the-past
    formula; while all their songs dutifully hover between 2\xBD to 3\xBD minutes in
    length, their hooks are built for even shorter attention spans, repeating
    themselves just a little too often to not feel like they're being hammered
    into your skull with a big cartoon-like mallet. They become the type of
    things that you find yourself humming along to even as you're thinking,
    ""That's kind of annoying.""  Eventually, the neverending parade of short,
    sharp riffs can become the aural equivalent of Chinese water torture.</p><p>
    One gets the feeling that Radio 4 are a solid live band-- the kind that can
    incite a crowd into getting down in that embarrassing white-people-shuffle,
    Courtney-Cox-in-the-""Dancing in the Dark""-video sort of way. On record,
    though, Roman's and Williams' constant scratchy-throatted yelling seems
    strained, and the band's energy comes off a bit too pushy. Even at under
    35 minutes, <i>The New Song and Dance</i> overstays its welcome.</p></div>"|6649.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6649-the-new-song-and-dance/|6.3|Nick Mirov

    Either <i>The First of the Microbe Hunters</i> is an apologetic missive for the career nadir
    of <i>Cobra and Phases Group Plays Voltage in the Milky Night</i> or the fatal Jenga pull on
    Stereolab's credibility after ceaseless releases.  Fortunately for ""the Groop"" and the world,
    the former is the case.</p><p>
    More than anything, this release documents the crippling production of Jim O'Rourke.  It's
    refreshing to hear Stereolab escape the productive thumb of Chicago's dry art figures.
    Seemingly, O'Rourke and John McEntire would have Stereolab wallow in a bog of sterile
    cocktail wank-like rotting cranberries.  McEntire's lone studio contribution on <i>Microbe
    Hunters</i>, ""I Feel the Air (of Another Planet),"" grates and retreads past offenses-- ""ba""
    is repeated ad nausea over frigid blips and echoing, muted piano.  I think I remember them
    saying ""ba"" once before.</p><p>
    Elsewhere, Stereolab engage in the funkiest, heaviest music of their career.  While monotony
    still remains a passion, subtle psychedelic flourishes and thick percussion pumps add much
    needed verve.  The wonderfully titled ""Outer Bongolia"" remembers that jazz also existed in the
    '70s, when artists like Herbie Hancock, Mongo Santamaria, and Les McCann rocked nasty.
    ""Intervals"" picks along on a quiet acoustic while a gooey electric is strums with LSD tabs.
    Soon the song shifts into an analog forest of chirping keyboards and snapping drums.
    Thankfully, songs shift and return.  ""Retrograde Mirror Form"" similarly passes through three
    phases of organ-punched grooves.  When monotony is called for, such as on ""Barock-Plastik,""
    phat, ass-moving bass keeps the vital juices flowing.</p><p>
    Don't write off Stereolab just yet.  Possible, intriguing new directions are hinted at on
    <i>Microbe Hunters</i>.  ""Nomus Et Phusis"" bounces on jungle timpani, sounding so refreshingly
    non-caucasian.  Forget their past trails-- <i>Microbe Hunters</i> drifts away from the
    droning pop of their recent releases.  In the context of electronic music and dance, Stereolab
    actually sound groundbreaking again.  Of course, we still beg for any sort of lyrical
    development; and the strength of this release is obviously its sitcom-length brevity.
    The best Stereolab albums have always been their EPs.  Still, the cover isn't brown and
    orange, and <i>Microbe Hunters</i> comes closest to capturing the live Stereolab experience.
    Stereolab need to record in Brazil or the Ivory Coast and stay away from Chicago.  And unlike
    last time, that isn't a plea for them to leave me alone.</p></div>"|7496.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7496-the-first-of-the-microbe-hunters/|6.8|Brent DiCrescenzo

    How are you?  I am fine.  My name is Billy.  I am 8 and 5/8 years old (9 in 137 days).  I
    like soccer and playing with my rocketships.  Do you like pizza?  I think pizza is the best
    food in the whole world, especially with lots of cheese.  One time, my big sister Beth ate
    way too much pizza and she threw up right in front of a guy she had a crush on.  She was
    so embarrassed that all she could do for a whole week was sit in her room and listen to
    Alanis Morrisette on repeat, saying, ""Isn't it ironic?  Don't'cha think?""  She's a major
    dork and has cooties.</p><p>
    
    I am writing because I think my brother Kevin is obsessed with you.  My parents are really
    worried.  Before <i>Supermodified</i> came out, he had this countdown calendar up in his room
    between a giant poster of the cover of <i>Bricolage</i> and a framed picture of you looking off
    in the distance.  Every day, he would sit in his room and stare at that calendar and rip off a
    number exactly at midnight.  I think it's creepy.  He says you are ""the manifold deity of
    digital polyrhythms, descended upon this wretched corporeal shell of a world to illuminate
    the path to enlightenment through sonic perfection.""  He's really smart because he goes to
    college.  Nobody understands what he's saying.</p><p>
    
    Who do you think would win in a fight between a Velociraptor and Spider Man?  I think Spider
    Man would, because he would use his spider sense to avoid danger, then wrap it up in super
    powerful webs.  I think Spider Man is the coolest ever.  One day, my brother Kevin got into a
    bad fight with his friend Eric.  They both wear big pants and like those glow sticks that you 
    use on Halloween and stuff.  Anyway, Eric and Kevin were going to get into Eric's car and Eric
    wanted to listen to Roni Size.  Kevin wanted to listen to your second album, <i>Permutation</i>.
    They got really mad at each other.  Finally, Eric told Kevin, ""Dude, Amon Tobin is too weird
    and esoteric.  At least Roni Size won the Mercury Prize.  That must mean he's better.""  Kevin
    sprang at him really fast and started to claw at his face, screaming words like ""cretin"" and
    ""imbecile.""  This other time, my sister asked him why he didn't listen to more mainstream
    electronic stuff like Fatboy Slim and Moby, because they were so much cooler.  I've never seen
    him so angry.  He went off for like half an hour.  He had just gotten <i>Supermodified</i>, so
    this is what he told her:</p><p>
    
    ""You poor plebeian, devouring mainstream culture like so many Chalupas and Doritos.  If you
    would simply pause for a mere second and lend an ear to the remarkably intricate and razor
    sharp compositions offered on <i>Supermodified</i>, you would become revolted at only the
    thought of such derivative drivel.  Amon Tobin creates aural treasures each time he touches
    studio equipment.  He breathes vitality into a stagnant genre with each drum hit.  He
    rejuvenates the pallid genre of electronica every time he permits the world to glance through
    the twisted digital window of his music.  Take the opening track, 'Get Your Snack On.'  In even
    the inaugural morsel of the album, Tobin breaks new ground for funk-infused rhythms.  It is
    easily the most addictive song he's recorded to date, replete with thumping bass line and
    ludicrous drum breaks.  Then we have 'Saboteur,' a subtle epic that hovers on the edge of
    genius, yet is able to shatter walls in its sheer restraint from exploding into rhythmic
    madness.  'Deo' again presents an intellectual Amon Tobin who allows his tracks to evolve,
    weaving a elaborate oriental rug of organic tones and beats.  I am literally contorted with
    giddiness when hearing certain sections of <i>Supermodified</i>.""</p><p>
    
    She tried to walk out of the room, but he chased her around the house with a boombox that was
    playing ""Four Ton Mantis"" until my sister threatened to tell his girlfriend that he once said
    that ""Believe"" by Cher was ""sort of interesting.""</p><p>
    
    I sometimes get funny feelings when I listen to your music.  On your other two records, it
    was different because I kind of felt alienated from the music.  It was so weird and random and
    intense at times.  Now, the music sort of draws me in and I can't stop listening.  Kevin says
    it's because this disc is much more ""accessible than anything he's done before, yet it surpasses
    them insofar has he has shown the beginnings of a total sonic mastery of each subtle aspect of
    a work.""  Everything just fits together so well, like Lego blocks making a castle.  It used to
    be that the beats would be really scary because they didn't quite fit the background music, but
    now everything is just so proper and seems in its place.  Please help me, Mr. Tobin.  I don't
    want to grow up to be obsessed with you like Kevin.  I want to be able to leave the house
    sometimes when I grow up.  I want to be a fireman!  But I just can't stop listening now.  Be
    kind, Mr. Tobin, I'm only 8 and 3/4 years old!</p></div>"|8082.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8082-supermodified/|9.1|Taylor M. Clark

See, I love the Lilys like
    I love warm summer days, butter pecan ice cream, and birthday blowjobs. For me, they can do no
    wrong. If Kurt Heasley and whoever's backing his ass up these days came over to my house and
    recorded the sound of them beating me to a pulp, I'd still buy it. Hell, everyone would buy it
    because nothing says ""entertainment"" like hearing me scream, ""Have I mentioned how much I love
    <i>Eccsame the Photon Band</i>? Oh god, <i>no!</i> Not the <i>pliers!</i>
    nnnnnggggeeeEYEEEYYYAGGGHH! <i>[sound of shattering cartilage]</i></p><p>
    
    But enough about my sadomasochistic fantasies. What we have here is a sampler of sorts, thrown
    together mostly to get the new Tiger Style label off to a running start: four previously
    unreleased Lilys tracks left over from the <i>Eccsame</i> sessions, four new songs from 
    psychedelians Aspera Ad Astra, and some bizarrely ugly cover art depicting apes wrestling with
    giant earthworms. (Don't ask, I don't get it either.)</p><p>
    
    Now, only hardcore Lilys fans could possibly get excited over a handful of seven-year-old demos,
    and sure, these four songs aren't anything special compared to their more polished work. The
    dreamlike, acid-drenched pulse of ""Elsa"" and ""Hymn"" merely recall better tracks from <i>Eccsame</i>,
    and the crunchy pop stomp of ""Coby"" is the missing link between the hazy garage-gazer of <i>In
    the Presence of Nothing</i> and the thick, vibrant power-pop of <i>A Brief History of Amazing
    Letdowns.</i> But those unfamiliar with the Lilys will at least get a pretty good idea of the
    band's pre-1995 vibe, before they transformed from shoegazery indie-poppers into British
    Invasion doppelgangers.</p><p>
    
    Aspera Ad Astra's half of the disc is fairly decent, but naturally a bit of a letdown after the
    Lilys have worked their magic. The heavily sedated, Spiritualized-like shimmer of their full-
    length debut, <i>Peace</i>, is distilled into smaller psych-pop nuggets here, which is kind of 
    disappointing; ""Good Beat Down"" and ""Tin Pan Miracles"" sport melodies so twee and precious
    you'd think Drew Mills' whiny quaver was coming from a jolly yet neurotic dwarf. Only when the
    big globs of effects-laden distortion come raining down are the songs salvaged, as on ""Feed the
    Fantasy."" And even then, Aspera Ad Astra's sing-songiness is a bit much to handle. In culinary
    terms, this album is like only getting to smell a glass of wine, and then chugging a glass of
    maple syrup. Mmm... Maple syrup.</p></div>"|4796.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4796-split-ep/|6.2|Nick Mirov

He was a special
    little boy, for he was known far and wide as being the boy with the beats. He spun wax at Grandmother's first four house
    parties, and all the other boys, girls and woodland creatures had sucked their pacifiers and bounced around, so he became
    known as Little Boy Beat. On this particular day, Little Boy Beat had to get to Grandmother's House Party 5 because he was
    the live attraction, and he'd heard that Grandmother was sick.  So, with a basket of vinyl under his arm, he went into the
    dark and lonely woods. Just then, a wolf-- neither fat nor slim, and known among those parts as being a bit of a badass-- 
    happened along:</p><p>
    
    ""Where are you going, Little Boy Beat?"" he asked.</p><p>
    
    ""I am going to Grandmother's House Party, Mr. Wolf,"" answered the little boy.</p><p>
    
    ""Where does she live?"" asked the Wolf.</p><p>
    
    ""Oh, at the third cottage past yonder mill. Grandmother is very ill, so I am taking her these sweet beats which my producer
    has made for her.""</p><p>
    
    ""If she is so ill, I will go and see her too,"" said the Wolf. ""I will go this way, and you go through the woods, and we will
    see who gets there first.""</p><p>
    
    So saying, he shambled off, and ran all the way to the cottage.</p><p>
    
    Tap, tap-- he knocked at the cottage door.</p><p>
    
    ""Who is there?"" asked Grandmother, who, by all accounts, was once called Pete Tong.</p><p>
    
    ""It is I,"" answered the Wolf in a soft voice, ""Little Boy Beat! I have brought you nice, fresh cakes and butter.""</p><p>
    
    ""Pull the bobbin and the latch will lift up,"" called out Grandmother.</p><p>
    
    The Wolf pulled the bobbin, lifted the latch, and entered the cottage.  Then, he ate up poor Grandmother, put on her
    nightgown, and pulled her nightcap right over his ugly wolfhead, and crashed on the couch. ""The old bitch was a bit
    tough,"" he mumbled to himself, ""but the little boy will be a delicate morsel.""</p><p>
    
    Meanwhile, Little Boy Beat lingered on in the woods. It was so bright there; the birds sang merrily in the trees, and the 
    brook chattered as it ran down to help the mill do its work. Everything was full of life. He chased the dainty butterflies,
    and then gathered a posy for Grandmother who could not get out and see the Spring flowers grow. At last, tired with his
    play, he set off to reach Grandmother's house party.</p><p>
    
    He knocked at the door, and the Wolf, softening his voice, called out: ""Pull the bobbin, and the latch will go up."" Little
    Boy Beat opened the door and walked in.</p><p>
    
    ""Put the basket on the table, and come into bed with me,"" said the Wolf, ""for I feel cold.""</p><p>
    
    Little Boy Beat thought that his grandmother's voice was very hoarse, but then he remembered that this might be on account
    of her cold.  Being an obedient boy, he got into bed, but when he saw the hairy arms, he began to grow frightened.  ""What
    long arms you have, Grandmother!""</p><p>
    
    ""The better to hug you with, my dear.""</p><p>
    
    Then he saw the long ears sticking up out of the nightcap.  ""What great ears you have, Grandmother!""</p><p>
    
    ""The better to hear you with, my dear.""</p><p>
    
    ""What great teeth you have, Grandmother!""</p><p>
    
    ""The better to eat you with, my dear!"" shouted the Wolf.  With one bound, he sprang out of bed, and would have gobbled
    Little Boy Beat right up had the boy been a second slower. Little Boy Beat whipped out his wax, leaped behind the tables,
    and shouted, ""I am Paul Oakenfold the Mighty! Ye shall obey me!"" Then he laid down some smooth trance grooves, mixing like
    a king and making the little piggies in the backyard pen roll in the mud with delight.</p><p>
    
    The Wolf was stunned, but hungry, so he lunged at the other tables-- the ones with the giant stacks of speakers.  His
    tongue flapped out of his mouth and his eyes rolled lasciviously as he slapped some old faves on the deck and started
    spinning. It was battle. He drooled: ""Fatboy Slim is fuckin' in heaven!"" And they went at it.</p><p>
    
    It lasted for what seemed like hours, but in actuality only lasted 154 minutes. By the end, all the children and woodland
    creatures had come to watch the battle. The Wolf started with a subtlety that no one expected, but soon he was driving
    Little Boy Beat into submission with heavy, hard house sounds that bore his personal mark. The raccoon kept a list as the
    Wolf brought it from all sides-- new, old, stuff you've heard in various conflagrations, all warped into an intoxicating,
    mesmerizing beat factory. Racoon was shouting now: ""Major Force! Art of Noise! Chemical Brothers! Underworld! Armand Van
    Helden!"" The list went on, but was drown out by the encompassing peace that swallowed the Wolf's groove: Little Boy Beat's
    decks were, as the field mouse said, ""en fuego.""</p><p>
    
    Little Boy Beat, for such a small boy, had the wisdom of years in front of house parties. He let his roots be the yin to
    the Wolf's yang. Where the Wolf bound the listener into dancing submission with cascading beats, Little Boy Beat went
    old-school cerebral on his ass. Shimmering, space-age synth loops came and went in gentle succession, sometimes matched
    with delicate melodies, sometimes framing dense beats. The Raccoon came running soon enough, a little out of breath when he
    gasped: ""Luzon! The Unknown! Brainchild! Jan Johnston! Solar Stone!"" And we marvelled at the breadth of Little Boy Beat's
    selection which mirrored-- yet was completely different from-- the Wolf's.</p><p>
    
    When it was all over, someone realized that Grandmother wasn't dead at all, but chewing frantically on several pieces of
    Trident in the corner. Little Boy Beat had gained a new respect for the harnessed aggression of the Wolf, and the Wolf was
    no longer hungry, for little boy's beats had fed him. They gave each other a wet kiss with plenty of tongue and danced into
    the sunset.</p><p>
    
    We all thought it was over until we saw that the DAT recorders for each had been recording the whole thing, separately!
    The weasel, who was very good with such things, made compact discs for everyone so they could listen to the legendary
    duel.  Everyone agreed that both performances were exceptional, but no one could agree on whose was better. The Wolf was
    an illustration of trance-beat hypnosis in its smoothest guise, but Little Boy Beat had crafted an incredible testament to
    skills, experience, sharp ear, and synthesis. The debate raged on for many years, and no agreement was ever reached, but
    everyone that witnessed the Great Battle that day was glad to have been a part of it. And to this day, people walking
    through the forest can be seen wagging their hips to the reverb of that wondrous event.</p><p>

    anymore.  2000 turned out to be such an incredible year for new releases.  For the first time
    in so long, music both challenging and infinitely pleasing has poured in from all angles--
    music that either creates genres within genres, or totally redefines the familiar ones.</p><p>
    
    And then there's music like Mojave 3's <i>Excuses for Travelers</i>, which not only accepts
    genre stereotypes, but somehow seems to define the stereotype better than the stereotype itself.
    If I were to tell you that <i>Excuses for Travelers</i> is a folk-country record, my job would
    be pretty much done. Every song on the record contains some combination of strummed acoustic
    guitar, slide guitar, Hammond organ, harmonica, soporific vocal melodies and harmonies, and
    lyrics about love and/or pick-up trucks.</p><p>
    
    Mojave 3 frontman Neil Halstead does his best to sound ""folky""-- he now ranks up there with
    Tom Petty on the list of people who make me want to go back in time and strangle Bob Dylan.
    Sure, we'd lose one of the great musicians of the 20th century, but think of all the shitty
    imitators we wouldn't have to deal with.  And let's not even discuss the whole Jakob thing.</p><p>
    
    To even call Halstead a Dylan imitator, though, would be giving him more credit than he
    deserves. Whereas Dylan went through a period where his voice was whiny, nasal, and
    occasionally downright annoying,  Halstead's vocals are just boring.  Of course, that's the
    least of his concerns.  Whereas Dylan truly broke new ground for rock lyricism, Halstead
    delivers lines like ""I love the sun/ And the highlights in your hair/ They turn me on""
    with all the eroticism of a eunuch at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show.</p><p>
    
    Indeed, one of <i>Excuses for Travelers</i>' greatest weaknesses is that the album is too
    uniformly boring to be affecting in the least. Only two or three minutes into the record,
    you've already stopped giving a shit about what Halstead is saying.  The words all seem to
    blur together into a beige-colored blob of monotony. By the middle of the album, odds are
    you're either reaching for caffeine pills to stay awake, or digging for another record to
    listen to.</p><p>
    
    It must be stated, of course, that there are people who will find this album incredibly
    appealing.  If you've ever taken an acoustic guitar to a deserted beach and sang Woody
    Guthrie songs at the ocean, you may be one of them. If you've ever told anyone to ""mellow
    out, man,"" you may be one of them.  And if you think Jeff Tweedy is a ""serious badass,""
    you're definitely one of them.</p><p>
    
    To summarize: <i>Excuses for Travelers</i> is boring. It's about as dynamic and enthusiastic
    as an afternoon nap and half as refreshing. The guys and gals in Mojave 3 have made exactly
    zero attempts to take their sound further than 1998's fairly excellent <i>Out of Tune</i>,
    and as a result, there's little reason for this record to enter your collection.  So I
    guess we have to face the facts: no matter how much rock music has evolved over the past
    35 years or so, boring is still boring.</p></div>"|5377.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5377-excuses-for-travellers/|5.5|Matt LeMay

    Air did the score; now comes the <i>Music from the Motion Picture</i>, a somewhat dicier
    proposition. This soundtrack seeks to replicate the feel of mainstream mid-'70s radio, and to
    that end, it's a wild success. I was there and this is what it sounded like-- from the banal pop
    of 10cc to the raw (okay, medium-rare) power of Heart to the epic romanticism of Styx. Forget
    disco, CBGB's, punk, and new wave.  That stuff didn't play in Peoria until much later. For a
    real taste of what a suburban kid playing ""Space Invaders"" was likely to hear pumping over the
    arcade sound system, this collection is the real thing. The problem is, no one ever said
    mainstream '70s radio was particularly <i>good</i>. It was like the mainstream radio of any
    other time, with a few true innovators, a glut of imitators, and a handful of the truly awful.
    All are represented here in their proper proportions.</p><p>
    
    The innovators are pretty much limited to Al Green (who contributes the quintessential ""How Can
    You Mend a Broken Heart"") and Todd Rundgren (whose ""Hello It's Me"" and ""A Dream Goes on Forever""
    influenced sophisticated pop revivalists like the Aluminum Group and the High Llamas).  The
    imitators, naturally, are more numerous. For faux-Zep riffery, few could touch Heart, and they
    contribute two of their best anthems: ""Magic Man"" (heard frequently in 1978 in my hometown of
    East Lansing, Michigan, in tribute to local hero Earvin ""Magic"" Johnson) and ""Crazy on You.""
    Sloan's ""Everything You've Done Wrong"" is, of course, from the '90s, but it fits in just fine
    here, sounding like a bouncy slice of pre-disco Bee Gees, and Air's two tracks (""Ce Matin La,""
    off <i>Moon Safari</i>, and a remix of ""Playground Love,"" from <i>The Virgin Suicides</i> score)
    also sport convincing period camouflage.</p><p>
    
    After that, it gets a bit worse. The Hollies are way past their '60s peak on ""The Air That I
    Breathe,"" a corny ballad I always thought was by Air Supply, probably because it had ""air"" in
    its title. Similarly puny and insipid is 10cc's ""I'm Not in Love,"" guaranteed to induce
    headaches in anyone born before 1970. Gilbert O'Sullivan's ""Alone Again"" is an undistinguished
    McCartney rip-off, and things really bottom out on the album closer, ""Come Sail Away"" by Styx.
    It's all coming back to me now: except for disco, which only came at the end, '70s radio sucked.
    No wonder those virgins committed suicide.</p></div>"|7885.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7885-the-virgin-suicides/|4.8|Mark Richard-San

    street assures passers-by that the end is coming. I think she's desperate to
    convey her message.  Though the United States is saber-rattling with the
    People's Republic of China, it seems that everyone has overcome their
    millennial tension, and the eve of destruction has turned to a morning of
    devil-may-care optimism.</p><p>
    
    Collectively, we're overjoyed that, without much effort or awareness, we
    kicked the Beast's ass. The Beast, as prophesied by some locust-muncher out
    in the Negev Desert thousands of years ago, was supposed to arrive last year
    and annihilate us before being mightily smote by our Lord and Savior Jesus
    Christ. I missed this.  Living as I do in America's capital, the seat of
    iniquity and corruption, I should have had ring-side seats to the most
    righteous beatdown of all time. I even missed witnessing the Rapture, the
    faithful's assumption to the right hand of God that was suppose to occur
    just before Satan's saurian shredded all of creation.</p><p>
    
    The homeless lady implores those who walk by to believe.  ""You've not gotten
    away with your godless existence,"" she seems to be saying, as she sits
    surrounded by two shopping carts and two decades' worth of daily newspapers.
    She never gets ranty or violent, and by and large, is on the presentable side
    of destitution.  This way, one doesn't feel sullied when approaching her
    personal space to drop a dollar into her plastic cup.  She always tells you
    you're blessed by Our Redeemer and wishes you a beautiful day. Nonetheless,
    she tirelessly reminds everyone that the end is coming.</p><p>
    
    She's right, of course. At some future point, by virtue of the inescapable
    effects of entropy, the universe will collapse in on itself and unimaginable
    havoc will ensue. But that's about a trillion years into the future, so I'm
    not going to let that distant apocalypse disturb me too much.  However, the
    homeless lady's admonitions do remind me that, though I won't likely be around
    to fall victim to the utter destruction of time and space-- the reducing of
    everything to an infinitely small and massive energy blip-- some things around
    me now are evanescent, transitory, limited.</p><p>
    
    These evanescent, transitory, limited things are the stuff of poetry. They're
    the familiar beauty of Dante's <i>Beatrice</i>, the redeeming orchestral
    tuttis in the third movement of Saint-Saens' <i>Organ Symphony</i>, the
    consummate swish of Ted Nugent's cat tail. To this incomplete list, we must
    now add several moments from Arovane's <i>Tides</i>.</p><p>
    
    After his Pole-ish remix of Various Artists' ""No. 8"" and his Autechre-indebted
    debut, <i>Atol Scrap</i>, I was ready for Uwe Zahn (aka Arovane) to express
    himself rather than pay homage to his IDM heroes. And instead of drawing
    inspiration from the insides of his iMac or the boom-bip sounds of yesterday's
    tomorrow, Zahn dug the sea. Yup, a trip to the French coast fired Zahn up to
    combine ambient undulations of a vaguely Vini Reilly guitar with ebbing and
    flowing beats. After the harpsichordian trills of ""Theme,"" the title track
    focuses on the subject of Zahn's meticulous study. And study he has.</p><p>
    
    These brief tracks need no remixing or extending for club action; they're far
    from being the background to bong hits. Their encapsulation of the hypnotic
    motion of water and the uniqueness of each wave marks Arovane out as
    unquestionably in the same small class of self-assured and talented musicians
    as Boards of Canada and Jake Mandell.</p><p>
    
    ""Tomorrow Morning"" is a windchime melody surrounded by cicada strings and the
    almost imperceptible hum of moth wings.  It gives way to the Bill Frisell-like
    impressionist guitar lines of ""Seaside.""  ""The Storm"" begins as another
    harpsichord etude before torrential rain pours down in the form of
    pounding-as-John Bonham beats. Zahn returns to tranquility with ""Deauville,""
    enhanced by oddly graceful squarks of seagulls gliding overhead.</p><p>
    
    Zahn has resisted the temptation to describe in glitch minimalism the
    hydrodymanics of solar and lunar influences on our oceans.  And surprisingly,
    <i>Tides</i> is not an amateur attempt at eco-journalism (Zahn's seashore
    isn't littered with garbage and melanoma-hungry humans)-- it's an artist's
    impression of an earthly paradise.</p><p>
    
    The prominence Zahn gives to the harpsichord through this album exemplifies
    the deliberate, contemplative unrealism he wishes to communicate; he's taking
    a sound commonly associated with Baroque parlors and betwixt-minuet trysts,
    and attempting to reprogram our associations.  And while I can't say that I've
    been wholly won over by this aspect of <i>Tides</i>, I have been-- and continue
    to be-- astounded by the rare reflective grace of the music.  So let the end
    come.  Satan's stormtrooper will destroy me, never less than charmed by the
    ceaseless undulation of <i>Tides</i>.  I can conceive of far worse ways to
    go.</p></div>"|296.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/296-tides/|8.8|Paul Cooper

He could have been strumming the chords to
    ""Wonderwall"" or close harmonizing with the monobrow Gallagher brothers. He declined their
    Neanderthal entreaties and cast aside the chance to contribute to the greatest rock and roll
    swindle since Guru Josh was denied his hard-earned place in Sheffield's Rock and Roll Museum.</p><p>
    
    As you read this, Warren may be in a parallel universe blundering through the guitar tabs for
    ""Glass Onion"" or commenting on Liam's lyrical innovations (""I am a polyurethane parsnip/ I
    wander where my fancy takes me/ Then again I sometimes stay home with the wife/ And play
    whist""). He may be as ""mad for it"" as his fellow dribbling band mates. He may already have been
    ""outrageously"" arrested for possession of two grams of recreational PCP. We don't know.  Not
    even Bill Nye knows.  Luckily for us, we don't inhabit that universe. And I think Warren is
    happy about that good fortune, too. Because if we were spinning around in that nastiverse,
    Warren wouldn't be free to express his deliciously skewed notions of ""pop.""</p><p>
    
    Pop, as it's presently packaged, is the polar opposite of rage rock. Pop is therefore either
    the sly jailbait purr of Britney Spears or the NAMBLA-approved falsetto of N'Sync. Echoboy
    wants <i>Volume One</i> to appeal to those confused about where to align ourselves. Do I
    devolve several steps down my phylum and invest in the Sony compilation <i>Music for Date
    Rape</i>? Or do I sport Abercrombie threads and risk being considered effete at best, a right
    twat at worst? It's not Mother Nature that forces us to make such delineated decisions; it's
    your evilly pimpalicious stepfather, Capitalism, and his malevolent MC, Creation of Demand.</p><p>
    
    Not only does Echoboy want to offer an alternative to the above dilemma, he also wants to garner
    some of the applause reserved for experimental artists, too. Rather than being an art-house
    poseur like labelmates Appliance, Warren's strategy is to touchingly reference his skinny
    installation-whore buddies and sprinkle pop dust atop and throughout their click-cut-and-drone
    confections.</p><p>
    
    For example, ""Kit and Holly"" comes on like Spaceman 3 on nitrous oxide. Boppy drones and
    contently eerie synth strings accompany a giddy Warren vocalizing his joys. And though I can
    detect traces of <i>Playing with Fire</i> throughout the track, I concentrate on Warren's
    unfettered, bewildering delight. Kit and Holly must be beautiful people and even better as a
    pair.  You can't honestly say that about many of our species.</p><p>
    
    Initially ""Model 352"" recalls the amphetamine electro of Suicide's ""Cheree,"" but Warren soon
    bores of the sulfate NYC 1970s and decamps to the claustrophobic sounds of Neu!'s Cologne.
    Rather than wanting to hurl himself from the 750-year-old cathedral spire of Cologne's main
    tourist attraction (medieval places of worship can sure be used as agents of Demand, says your
    evil stepdaddy!), Warren finds majesty and glamour amid the smog-incrusted stones. ""Model 352""
    begins to ascend in a glorious revelation of unforeseen verticality. And dollars to donuts, I 
    bet not even Mandy Moore can even bring your town perv to such ecstatic heights.</p><p>
    
    From there, Warren flies us to ""Constantinople."" Amid the chirps of carapaced nocturnal beasties,
    Warren yanks the oriental melodica from the cold lips of deceased dub legend Augustus Pablo and
    riffs away until a barrage of white noise beats crush that ancient city into the malaria mud of
    the Bosphoros. But the melody seeps out of the ooze and proudly reprises itself once, before
    evaporating into whiffs of Turkish delight.</p><p>
    
    Whether Warren wanted to scoop the world's zoologists or not, his ""Crocodile Milk"" introduces a
    hitherto unaware world to the sound of reptilian lactation. And what a disorienting sound it is!
    Bowed guitars thrim and scourge! Cologne Cathedral's organ plangently tones! The whole of
    Spiritualized's <i>Royal Albert Hall</i> rushes at me in fewer than six minutes! My heart
    beats thunderously! Now you understand why he would decline the Gallaghers' hairy-palmed offer.</p><p>
    
    Echoboy slakes our thirst for accessible but quirky pop. He's not bursting to sound like a
    Tortoise side project like Kieren Hebden's Fridge outfit. He doesn't cling to retro-futurisms
    like Appliance and Trans Am, nor does he gild the lily like squirmtronicians such as Schneider
    TM and To Rococo Rot.  And unlike Sean O'Hagan's High Llamas, who thrive on turning pop into dusty
    museum exhibits, <i>Volume One</i> succeeds by courting lip-gloss dalliances with the avant-garde,
    while showing off a coquettish midriff.  It's a far more alluring sight than the Gallaghers'
    hirsute jowls, I assure you.</p></div>"|2678.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2678-volume-one/|8.2|Paul Cooper

It's not that I'm unobservant or a fuckwit or
    anything. But sometimes events pass me by as I'm gazing, no doubt, at something far less
    exciting. For instance, I found out the best place to score drugs in my neighborhood isn't
    the street corner (as HBO would have you believe) but rather the upscale hair salon. Yes,
    hidden behind the Paul Mitchell hair care products, there are baggies galore of all your
    pharmaceutical faves.</p><p>
    When I was growing up, the barber (my town enforced a strict ""no hair stylist"" policy) might
    mutter as he was buzz-cutting the little annoying hairs on your neck, ""Anything for the
    weekend, sir?"" By this, he did not mean a few twists of whizz or a coupla tabs. Nope, he meant
    rubbers. In fact, his crazy prophylactics were displayed on a cardboard dispenser. The
    dispenser had wee hooks on it which held aloft the johnnies. Printed on the cards were a really
    fast car and some woman in a bikini (0 to last base in 9 seconds or less-- not the image of the
    unselfish lover that might have been portrayed). You could gauge whether my town's male
    population was getting horny by how much of the image had been revealed since you last sat in
    the barber's chair. No one missed a thing back then.</p><p>
    But somehow I missed the Delgados' transition from record label-owning stars-in-their-own-right
    to record label-owning prog-rock wannabes. The Delgados, as well as providing shelter for the
    immensely boozed-up talents of Arab Strap, Suckle and Mogwai with their aptly-titled Chemikal
    Underground Records, released a delicate wisp of Scottish indie-pop entitled <i>Peloton</i>.
    That album nearly gave itself a double hernia with all the imaginative songs and production 
    sleights it gamely bore.</p><p>
    Now the band follows up the greatest Scottish record since the Nectarine No. 9's <i>A Sea with
    Three Stars</i> with the ponderously self-conscious, woefully proggy <i>The Great Eastern</i>.
    Remember how disappointed you were when Belle and Sebastian followed up <i>If You're Feeling
    Sinister</i> with <i>The Boy with the Arab Strap</i>? Well, here's the reprise.</p><p>
    In flagrant disobedience to the teachings contained in <i>The Urban Buddhist's Handbook</i>, I
    do not seek out disappointment. It's quite happy seeking <i>me</i> out, truth be told. <i>The
    Great Eastern</i> is the teeth-gnashing, lip-biting sound of a talented band reveling in studio
    time and awkward time signature changes. At this point, I'd like to let it be known that I've
    never divined the so-called appeal of Steely Dan. The Delgados probably love the quirky jazz
    changes that Fagan and Becker whack off in. Me, if it's got guitars in it, it'd better be in
    the style of either Iggy &amp; the Stooges' <i>Raw Power</i> or Love's <i>Forever Changes</i>.</p><p>
    To be fair, <i>The Great Eastern</i> doesn't show off in 15/8 compound time, though there are
    enough jarring transitions from 4/4 to waltzing \xBE. But one has to wonder why the band felt
    compelled to create some highly-wrought art when the simple directness of <i>Peloton</i>
    endeared itself limpit-like to my heart. Did the band members marry each other and turn their
    thoughts to creating immortal representations of their late thirty-something selves? Did they
    think they could out-wank Sonic Youth? Could be.</p><p>
    Or maybe they bought hook-line-and-sinker the critics' fawning adoration and decided to give
    back <i>real</i> music with <i>real</i> musical significance.  Sadly, this entails empty,
    platitudinous support of innovations such as speed garage and techstep drum-n-bass. For crying
    out loud, people, that's the only reason the Pastels exist-- so that <i>NME</i> and <i>Magnet</i>
    can drone on that real musicians remain unrecognized and tirelessly bemoan that the public
    adores stringy ginger-bearded geekatrons with PowerBooks running FuckmeElectro Version 7.46.</p><p>
    Which is pretty much the reason why <i>The Great Eastern</i> doesn't execute well. It works too
    damn hard. The most seductive indie pop fluffers have been the Smiths' <i>The Queen is Dead</i>,
    Belle and Sebastian's <i>Tigermilk</i>, and the Stone Roses' self-titled album. James, Inspiral
    Carpets, and the Manic Street Preachers have fallen by the wayside, and with good reason.</p><p>
    Unhinged from the huge <i>Abacab</i>-era Phil Collins drum sound, <i>The Great Eastern</i>'s
    opening track, ""The Past That Suits You Best,"" would sound as pretty as a Spring rainfall on a
    Scottish glen. The band overburdens the simple beauty of ""Accused of Stealing"" with jarring
    time changes.  On ""American Trilogy,"" however, the band captures the right blend of gently
    strummed guitars and overblown symphonic strings with tubular bells. The middle section even
    hints at the fey end of grunge, which is echoed in the line, ""No one can depress me more than 
    I can."" ""Reasons for Silence (Ed's Song)"" showcases Emma Pollock's dreamy, pastoral vocals in a
    song that Nick Drake might have recognized from his <i>Bryter Layter</i> album.</p><p>
    Pollack duets with Alun Woodward on ""Thirteen Gliding Principles"" as they trade half lines
    (""Lock the door/ Wash the floors/ Shine the shine"") until Metallica-esque heavy riffing and
    orchestral accompaniment barge their way into the domestic arrangements.  Fortunately, that
    track is followed by the subdued piano figures and mournful cello of ""No Danger."" Woodward
    lullabies, ""Now I've got to choose/ Who from you is gonna lose and who is going through."" The
    responsibility weighs on him: ""We don't know we're strong enough and now we're singing out of 
    tune."" After a brief reprise of the opening tranquillity, the band's rock tendencies steam in to
    rip up the peace. Pity.</p><p>
    I understand that the band didn't want to release <i>Peloton II</i>. Nonetheless, it sounds 
    like the Delgados threw their charming, sweetly laughing baby out with the bathwater and
    replaced it with all manner of musical flummery. Absurdly, they've gilded (or steel-girdered)
    a fragile lily. I hope I don't allow any stripped-down version to pass me by.</p></div>"|2267.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2267-the-great-eastern/|5.7|Paul Cooper

    and Sebastian is clearly defined.  At one end, there's Stevie Jackson and
    Isobel Campbell, whose contributions to <i>Fold Your Hands Child, You Walk
    Like a Peasant</i> make for intermittently painful listening.  At the other
    end is Stuart Murdoch, whose empathic accounts of young outsiders have
    captured the hearts and imaginations of the wussier subjects of the
    disenfranchised youth market.  In between is ex-Belle and Sebastian bassist
    Stuart David, who has left the band to devote himself fully to Looper, a
    project based around keyboards and samplers.</p><p>
    
    Looper has more in common with twee-tronic acts like Kitty Craft and the
    Busy Signals than his former band, a disparity that has grown remarkably
    more noticeable since Looper's first full-length, <i>Up a Tree</i>.  Here,
    the addition of two bandmates and David's increased focus on the project
    has allowed for greater complexity than ever before.  Sure, <i>Up a Tree</i>
    had its pleasures, but they were simple ones-- the gentle balladry of ""Quiet
    and Small,"" and David's account of the postal romance he shared with wife
    Karn were indisputably charming, but far from innovative.</p><p>
    
    Although Stuart David is a novelist as well as a musician, the lyrics on
    <i>The Geometrid</i> sometimes tend towards the banal.  This is probably
    linked to the phasing out of the sing/speak technique he employed on past
    efforts.  However, repeated choruses of ""Hey, Uncle Ray/ Hee-eeey, Uncle
    Ray"" and ""Cut your money hair"" leave me nostalgic for the innocuous story-
    telling David of <i>Up a Tree</i> and <i>The Boy with the Arab Strap</i>'s
    ""A Spaceboy Dream.""</p><p>
    
    ""These Things,"" which pairs drum machine beats and assorted beeps with a
    ""wee"" guitar melody (as the liner notes put it), is one of the album's
    standout moments.  David lists the things that bring him closer to happiness,
    including ""Seinfeld,"" IQU and New York.  The pairing of technology and
    simplicity works best here, and on ""Tomorrow's World,"" on which Karn
    harmonizes in a pretty but unpolished manner, with her husband adding a
    very human vulnerability to the all-electronic arrangement.  When David
    sings, ""I'm a precious little boy,"" he nails it on the head.</p><p>
    
    Although it's unlikely that Stuart David will ever become as gifted a
    songwriter as Stuart Murdoch, he's crafted a distinctive sound with this
    band.  <i>The Geometrid</i> serves as a charming, if slight, pleasure, but
    with more time to devote to the project, Looper may yet create a more
    substantial sound.</p></div>"|4852.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4852-the-geometrid/|6.8|Meg Zamula

    singer of The (International) Noise Conspiracy, translated from Swedish:</p><p>
<i>Dear Mr. Lyxzen,<br/>
    I have bad corns on my feet.  I have tried all the recommended creams, 
    medicines, and even acupuncture.  These corns scare my children and keep up 
    my wife at night.  If they don't get better, she is going to leave me.  How 
    do I get rid of them?  Help.  Axel, Axvall</i></p><p>
    
    Dear Axel,<br/>
    These ""corns"" on your feet serve as a microcosm of the tools the ruling 
    elite use to destroy the potential of the proletariat artist.  They are a 
    testament to the fact that the ordinary worker suffers at the hands of the 
    elite's brutish corporations.  Stop sustaining the system!  Liberate 
    yourself from societal boundaries and you shall truly be free.  Solidarity.
    Dennis</p><p>
<i>Dear Mr. Lyxzen,<br/>
    Your singing for the Refused was rad.  My friends and me thought all that 
    political talk was so neat.  I even went to the mall to buy an anarchy 
    patch.  It was expensive, but so worth it!  Anyway, is your new band as cool 
    as the Refused?  I hope so because you rule!  Erik, Saltsjo-Boo</i></p><p>
    
    Dear Erik,<br/>
    Music is nothing but an abstraction of an old and dull idea of bourgeois 
    self-realization, the self-made success of the creative artist, thus leaving
    the rest to choke in the dust, settled to consume ""creativity"" in a boring 
    package. Dennis</p><p>
    
    Whoa!  Did I just see what I think I saw?  The last response you read was 
    not a pathetic attempt by the author to belittle the (International) Noise 
    Conspiracy and their politics; rather, it actually appears verbatim in the 
    liner notes of <i>Survival Sickness</i>.  The irony is, this album all but
    defines the ""boring package"" the Conspiracy is so adamant in destroying.</p><p>
    
    Musically, the Noise Conspiracy seems content to rehash the mod sound into 
    the same predictable ruts and and chord progressions honed by countless 
    others.  ""The Reproduction of Death"" and ""Smash It Up"" plead to be anything 
    by the Make-Up.  How revolutionary is a band that constantly retreats into 
    standard verse/chorus routine?  Oh, wait, I must be wrong since ""the lyrics
    all have to fit into the limits of the song, thus making them objects to 
    issues like rhythm, rhyme and length, making the words one-dimensional and 
    hallow of sorts.""</p><p>
    
    This kind of excuse is a thumb-in-the-eye of all musical innovation.  Just 
    because these guys haven't created their own unique sound doesn't mean they
    should downplay the accomplishments of others.  Have they heard the latest
    from Modest Mouse?  Does the name Radiohead ring a bell?  If you enjoy the
    pedantic babbling of some pseudo-intellectual anarchist know-it-alls, consider
    this album your new bible.  The rest of us will wait for something better.</p></div>"|4109.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4109-survival-sickness/|4.2|Adam Ohler

    birds that live in the clock in the bathroom. It was six o'clock and the Northern
    Bluebirds' calls were strong and clear. Coming to the stairs, I could hear
    <i>Oddities</i> chirping in a way all its own. As I ascended the staircase
    toward Spring Heel Jack, the songs of the Northern Bluebirds began to merge,
    melding in a most intriguing way. With each step, the joyous birdsong became
    softer and the primal electronica of <i>Oddities</i> grew more dominant,
    finally grinding the birds to silence at the top of the steps.</p><p>
    
    In the kitchen making dinner, chopping avocado and scallion, I heard the phone
    ring. It was my friend, the opera singer. He began to tell me about his programs,
    his singing, and his women.  His voice, trained to be powerful, began to linger 
    with <i>Oddities</i>, which was playing in a boombox a few feet away. Opera
    voice and sharp electronic tones did battle between the sides of my brain. His
    voice, powerful and molasses-smooth, demanded attention with a velvet handgrip,
    but <i>Oddities</i> bludgeoned me with mechanical attacks in forward and reverse--
    stretched and crushed beats and synth blasts. I shut off the player, sat down,
    and talked to my opera-singing buddy.</p><p>
    
    The stereo's got a disc changer that'll play forever. You can fill it with music
    and just let it play. The other night, after the first disc of <i>Yesyears</i>
    played out, <i>Oddities</i> began. The Hippie and I were eating animal crackers
    and talking about the zucchini plants. She was topless, I was aroused. ""Root""
    began to build, massaging my member with beats that were building... building...
    toward a climax. The zucchini hasn't been doing as well as it should. We discussed
    what could be done to save them as ""Root"" fell apart in tumbling pile of mislaid
    beats.  I felt the blood rushing back to my head.</p><p>
    
    I sat up here on the third floor, two fans running, writing this review. The
    speakers were blasting <i>Oddities</i>. I was smiling because somehow, <i>Oddities</i>
    has crept in. A long time ago, I wrote a disparaging review of Spring Heel Jack's
    <i>68 Million Shades</i> and there was still a residue of that sentiment when
    <i>Oddities</i> came in the mail, but it has far surpassed my expectations. Made
    up of music from the private collection of John Coxon and Ashley Wales, <i>Oddities</i><i>density</i> of all the tracks is impressive.</p><p>
    
    While not a terribly listenable album, the tracks that have beats are excellent and 
    the ones that don't keep you guessing. The six-table ""BBC Radio 3"" gets tedious but
    it's courteously nestled at the end of the album, where only the truly strong dare
    tread. Don't bother if you're looking for drum-n-bass, though.  <i>Oddities</i> is
    often beatless and would be more of a frustration than pleasure. Primal and strange,
    but so perfectly so, <i>Oddities</i> is for those seeking to mix abstraction with
    birdcalls.</p></div>"|7437.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7437-oddities/|7.7|James P. Wisdom

I'm depressed about music.  Tito Puente
    died and left us alone with Marc Anthony.  Fox recently called Britney Spears ""the voice of a
    generation.""  Sting just won't go away.  It's depressing.  And what's even more depressing is
    reading about music: everyone's a critic, and every critic's a polemic.  Weblogs trade barbs
    and apologies, and at some point the music itself is sloughed off, discursified, made
    circumstantial.  Death of the author, death of the lead guitarist, whatever.  It's
    depressing.</p><p>
    So, in an atmosphere like this it comes as a pleasant surprise when your editor tries to
    kill you.</p><p>
    Seriously.  I spent the first four minutes of this disc muttering, ""What the hell is going on
    here? What is happening here?"" but by the six minute mark, I had changed my tune.  ""Christ,
    Ryan's trying to kill me.  I don't know why he sent me this <i>thing</i>, this <i>creature</i>,
    but it's going to kill me.  He sent this thing to me in the mail.  It's a letter-bomb-- it's a
    letter-<i>thing</i>, it's a letter-<i>creature</i>-- and it's, oh my god, what is that noise?""</p><p>
<i>Nipples</i> is a 1969 recording, freshly re-released by Atavistic, of a famous session
    featuring some of the biggest names in European free jazz.  The creature I thought was going to
    take my life, the title track, is nearly 20 minutes of amorphous noise recorded by a sextet 
    consisting of piano, double-bass, drums, guitar and two saxes.  The second track is slightly
    shorter and slimmed down: fifteen minutes of sax, piano, double-bass and drums.  The entire
    album clocks in at just over 33 minutes, but they're some of the most frenetic and alien
    minutes you may ever live through.</p><p>
    Initially, <i>Nipples</i> seems like the work of a sextet of toddlers who have been unleashed
    in a room full of musical instruments.  It's grating and frustrating, and seems to exhibit a
    lack of structure surprising even for free jazz.  After the third or fourth time through,
    though, a logic begins to present itself.  Blocks of instruments drop in and out to highlight
    the tensions between the various sounds with a bowed double-bass and sax often serving as a
    foundation for the movements of other instruments.  These six people listen to each other,
    coordinating their movements over a framework that remains invisible throughout.  Stereo
    effects are used to enforce a sort of organization, marking out the individual territories of
    the various instruments.</p><p>
    The first of the two tracks is the most rewarding, and achieves an almost mesmeric effect that
    the second track never gets close to.  The presence of two saxes contributes quite a bit to
    this: they carry on a conversation of sorts that makes the 20 minutes of noise slide by quicker
    than seems possible.  At points, it becomes difficult to believe that this music was recorded
    live in the studio-- these people make noises with their instruments and construct a layered
    sound that eludes most players with walls of effects at their disposal.</p><p>
    There's a point about two-thirds of the way through <i>Nipples</i> where all the instruments--
    with the exception of Peter Brotzmann's tenor sax-- stop playing.  For about one minute, the
    sax emits long, almost toneless keenings.  The sound just doesn't make sense.  Then, you realize
    that Peter Brotzman has stopped playing his saxophone, and Papa Legba has taken over instead.
    Papa Legba is riding this man's sax-- a human being could not possibly be responsible for a
    noise like this.</p><p>
    Today's musical landscape is marred by the footprints of lightweights and the layabouts who
    write about them.  Emo-rockers who record albums while cramming for the SATs?  So-called Latin
    superstars who have to see a tutor before recording a song in Spanish?  Überhip geeks who spend
    less time and energy on their music than on installing home theaters in the mansions of famous
    murder victims?  Forget it.  <i>Nipples</i> may be by turns aggravating, inscrutable,
    cacophonous and soulless, but sitting next to today's crop on the New Release rack of your
    local Sam Goody, it seems the work of giants.  Crazy, strung-out, Teutonic giants, but giants
    nonetheless.</p></div>"|965.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/965-nipples/|8.4|Zach Hooker

    Posthumous Legacy package, right between the unfinished album of demos and the
    inevitable b-sides compilation. But it's also something of a necessity for Jeff
    Buckley, who did a fairly exhaustive amount of touring in support of his one
    modestly successful record. When Columbia signed him, before booking weeks'
    worth of studio time or letting him put together a backing band, the first
    thing they did was issue the <i>Live at Sin-E</i> EP as a showcase of his raw
    talents.</p><p>
    
    Like any live performance, <i>Mystery White Boy</i> exemplifies both the 
    weaknesses and strengths of Buckley and his band.  His voice is, naturally, 
    the greatest asset to the package, but in concert, he was more prone to
    spiraling off into indulgent falsettos, and often struggled to match the
    band's intensity. Elegantly dynamic songs like the opener, ""Dream Brother,""
    and ""Mojo Pin"" are given a slightly rougher touch for added climax.  Sadly,
    the latter fails to improve on the fragile perfection of its studio counterpart,
    with otherwise immaculate drummer Matt Johnson rushing through the frantic
    triplets of the crescendo.</p><p>
    
    ""Grace"" and ""Last Goodbye,"" on the other hand, are honored with impassioned,
    but far from unique, renditions that do them reasonable justice. On ""Last
    Goodbye,"" Buckley runs through his only hit with luxurious slide guitar that
    puts more emphasis on the soaring string arrangements.  Elsewhere, variation
    proves fatal for ""Eternal Life,"" whose temporarily intriguing death metal
    version fails to enhance the already cringe-worthy bridge lyric.</p><p>
    
    Several previously unreleased Buckley compositions are presented here, if
    purely to make the compilation more salable.  These tracks often come off as
    a bit ragged and underwritten alongside the complex material of <i>Grace</i>.
    ""I Woke Up in a Strange Place"" is hard rocker that whimpers off, as if there
    was a killer ending planned that never got written.  But ""What Will You Say""
    succeeds by its simplicity with one of the most affecting melodies of
    Buckley's brief career.</p><p>
    
    Jeff Buckley's always had a fluid repertoire of covers in addition to his 
    respectable originals, and that's represented perhaps too well on <i>Mystery
    White Boy</i>. The last 20 minutes of the record are dedicated solely to
    covers.  The off-the-cuff Gershwin classic, ""The Man That Got Away,"" is as
    enjoyable as anything else here, but certainly didn't need to put in an
    appearance. The majestic ""Kanga Roo"" is well worth the 10 minutes it requires
    to rise into a fury, and Buckley gets extra points for taking on a Big Star
    song other than ""Thirteen,"" for once. Appropriately enough, the set ends with
    Buckley's definitive reading of Leonard Cohen's ""Hallelujah,"" here labeled a
    medley for the impromptu inclusion of a few lines from Smiths' ""I Know It's
    Over.""</p><p>
    
    Such collections are never complete without one glaring omission.  In the case
    of <i>Mystery White Boy</i>, it's the surprising absence of ""Lover, You Should
    Have Come Over."" Both the penultimate Buckley ballad and a surefire litmus test
    for any potential fan, ""Lover"" begs a powerfully passionate performance, and 
    finds it only in the disc's counterpart home video, <i>Live in Chicago</i>. This
    seems especially odd and undeserved given that several of the songs from
    <i>Grace</i> included here have already appeared in live form on previous
    singles and EPs.</p><p>
    
    But flaws are to be expected of live albums, even when severe missteps are
    overlooked in editing and remastering. And despite a selection that leaves 
    something to be desired, <i>Mystery White Boy</i> is a vital document of not
    only the late Buckley's talent, but of the chemistry and generosity he shared
    with his bandmates.</p></div>"|992.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/992-mystery-white-boy/|7.5|Al Shipley

    Dean Martinez's <i>Shadow of Your Smile</i> stage so much.  Lately, Friends of Dean Martinez
    had become distant and contemplative... she hadn't been her upbeat self. I was getting tired of
    having to listen to her somber dronings (especially having known her before she ""changed""). So
    my friend sent Calexico over. Boy, was she <i>ugly</i>! Look at that cover!</p><p>
    
    But on my friend's
    recommendation, I decided to give it a go. We went out for coffee. The conversation was good.
    She had a southwestern accent and a beautiful voice. I gradually found myself enthralled by
    the music that came out of her mouth. It was fun. Surprisingly, I seemed to be attracted to
    Calexico based purely on her personality! While it hurt my eyes to look at her, I found that
    if I closed them and listened I was in love! It all seemed like some sort of fable where true
    love overcame all boundaries-- except that every time I opened my eyes I was repulsed by her
    ugliness!</p><p>
    
    After our coffee, I didn't call her again. I felt kind of bad... but things had gotten busy at
    work and I eventually forgot about her. Time passed. In a time of desperation I tried to
    rekindle the old feelings for Friends of Dean Martinez and our <i>Shadow of Your Smile</i>
    days together, but it was no good. The more I remembered our past the more I couldn't take her
    now. And that Calexico. Calexico! I suddenly pined for her! What could have happened to change
    Friends of Dean Martinez so much? Maybe it was because she stopped hanging out with Joey Burns
    and John Convertino. They were around all the time back when I first knew her. Then, suddenly,
    they stopped hanging around and spent most of their time with Calexico! Friends of Dean Martinez
    was pretty... but I needed to have those good feelings we had shared in the past again. What
    ever had happened to Calexico?</p><p>
    
    No sooner did I just say that than she bumped into me on the sidewalk. Man, she was still so
    ugly! But the sound of her saying my name brought me memories of a desert I'd never visited
    and cool nights over warm sand. This time I listened intently. She sounded better than ever.
    She talked much more now than in the past. She seemed upbeat! I clung to every word and story--
    from the traditional border instrumental balladry of ""El Picador"" and ""Tres Avisos"" to the
    syncopated waltz ""Sonic Wind"" which swept me off my feet from verse to chorus. She was not as
    swept up in the lounge or experimental ambient scenes as Friends of Dean Martinez had ever been.
    Every interlude came with a purpose.  She punctuated her speech with pauses (all necessary) of
    both slight reflection and deliberate energy.</p><p>
    
    In the end, Calexico ended up moving to Oregon. Perhaps this was for the best. We stay in touch,
    calling one or the other every week or so. I still love to hear her voice... her mellow
    gracefulness. Once in a while, she even pulls out the pedal steel for me like she had with
    ""Service and Repair."" Sometimes when I can't fall asleep, her face pops into my mind and I
    wonder what really matters in love. Can one love blindly? Are looks that important? Can a
    beautiful soul transform a grotesque face simply by association? Then I take a leak and call
    Calexico on the phone, happy in the knowledge that I can listen to her without ever having to
    see her ugly mug again.</p></div>"|1229.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1229-hot-rail/|7.9|Chip Chanko

    of delivering a crucial payload. Arch-squirmers Tarwater-- an offshoot of the squirmily
    palindromic To Rococo Rot-- have finally raised the bar. Before <i>Animals, Suns and Atoms</i>,
    I judged squirm by the Notwist's crunchy outsider-electro LP, <i>Shrink</i>.  Released on
    Stereolab's Duophonic label, <i>Shrink</i> elevated squirm from two-minute patch-corded
    interludes to album-length approximations of the unrealized soundclash between Can's <i>Schloss
    Nörvenich</i> acid excursions and our post-drum-n-bass ProTools culture.</p><p>
    Frontman Ronald Lippok lazily states the facts and repercussions of insect disappearance as
    percussive blips and Farfisa-generated choir cloak his reminiscences, while encouraging us to
    ""Come on down/ Break it up."" With one foot firmly placed in the same puddle of pop irresistibility
    as Britney Spears' Swedish producer, and the other in that grand Kraut-rock tradition, this
    track, ""All the Ants Have Left Paris,"" sounds like the perfect combination of high-falutin'
    avant-garde expression and low-brow pop thrills.  At least, until the following track, ""Noon,""
    lollops in and fulfills our dreams of Kate Bush taking a shot at the genre with warm pianos
    and swaggering percussion clicks.</p><p>
    As Lippok mutters, ""Abuse committed by criminals itself commits a crime,"" a female accomplice
    harmonizes in a Zanax fog. Underneath, a student learns to play the sitar until a ""European
    Son""-like attack of the John Cales overcomes his reverence for the instrument, and he
    throttles it.  Of course, Tarwater, like the camera-wielding kid next door in ""American
    Beauty,"" are fascinated by this strangulation and give it prominence.</p><p>
    ""The Trees"" is a far less energetic track than ""Ants,"" but Lippok nonetheless snaps at his Dada
    chorus (""Don't ever antagonize the home"").  His strangely unnerving vocals are propelled by a
    nagging cello and percussive mouth harp as he reveals, ""I like to yell when it's snowing.""
    I'm sure his neighbors appreciate that.</p><p>
    But the band saves their oddest and most surreptitious moments for last.  On ""Seven Ways to
    Fake a Perfect Skin,"" Tarwater act out their fantasies of becoming one of Brian Eno's oblique
    strategies (or, at the very least, an out-take off <i>Here Come the Warm Jets</i>).  Giddy
    analog synth loops and plucked harpsichord haunt the background. But Tarwater's frivolity is
    offset by Lippok's sinister whibble and fake London accent.</p><p>
    On <i>Animals, Suns and Atoms</i>, Tarwater have finally realized that though analog mood sauce
    can be spread over phat hip-hop beats, it doesn't mean it necessarily should be.  After all,
    they have to do better than the Notwist's ""Day 7"" and ""Chemicals"" at some point. Those two
    superb Notwist tracks defined the direction in which squirm should be headed. I want to hear
    outsider vocals accompanied by skewed, electronic cracks, blips, and a hearty gutbucket of
    hip-hop funk.</p><p>
    I'm thrilled that Lippok and Jestram have picked up on the Notwist tactic. Tarwater have easily
    equaled <i>Shrink</i> in terms of effectiveness and creativity.  They've captured the funk of
    <i>Ege Bam Yasi</i>-era Can, run it through with a provocative dub disquiet, and ended up
    with an album that marks new heights in electronic music.  Here is an album I'll return to
    frequently.  It's your squirm now!</p></div>"|7949.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7949-animals-suns-and-atoms/|8.9|Paul Cooper

Every high school class had at least one, usually several. He was the kid who
    was always on time to class, always got straight A's, read Shakespeare for fun, and calculated
    the gravitational fields of black holes in his spare time. But no one really picked on him
    because he pretty much kept to himself. Occasionally, people snickered when he had to give a
    presentation in front of the class, donning his trademark oversized glasses and skintight polo 
    shirt. But, for the most part, Jake was harmless, a bother to no one, just an amusing nerd at
    best. Then one day during senior spring, our mild-mannered Jake does something completely
    incomprehensible. He strolls into the lunchroom wearing a pair of Tevas, his backpack, and
    nothing else.</p><p>
    
    We all knew Jake was a little weird, but up until now he'd just been a loner kind
    of weird. Anyway, he walks over to the sandwich cart, as if everything is perfectly normal.
    What is he doing? Is he really waiting in line for a sandwich with his member dangling in front
    of the deli meats? He sits down at a table alone with his sandwich in hand and begins eating. 
    Perfectly normal, save for his bare ass on the wooden seat. Finally, the Dean of Students comes
    over and has a little conference with Jake and promptly escorts him from the dining hall. Jake
    gets put on probation for the remainder of the year but graduates along with everyone else, and
    even gets a few math awards to boot. But, to this day, no one knows why he did it. Was it for
    pure shock value? Was he living out a personal porn-star fantasy?  Some things are better left
    alone.</p><p>
    
    Listening to Idlewild's sophomore effort, <i>100 Broken Windows</i>, for the first time is the
    shocking musical equivalent of watching Jake saunter into the lunchroom on that fateful
    afternoon. Like Jake's naked form in the context of a large dining area, the sound on this
    record came as a completely unexpected surprise. (Okay, a surprise minus the queasiness.)
    When we bought the album, we figured we had a sure-fire predictable band on our hands-- same
    faded cover art, same agitated song titles.  But then, just when we were ready to give up on
    them, we pressed the play button and bang! Jake walks into the dining hall buck-naked.</p><p>
    
    No more screeching. No more punk-guitar chaos. No more uncomfortable strain. The chord
    progressions are crisp and the hooks immediate.  An added bonus, Roddy Woomble, the lead singer
    with a name so weird you had to remember it, sounds so much like the once-young and energetic
    Michael Stipe that we're sure a lawsuit has already been filed. In fact, we're going to go out
    on a limb here and say that this is the great album R.E.M. could have made after <i>Green</i>
    (if they hadn't veered off into ""Shiny Happy People"") with specks of Superchunk.</p><p>
    
    But we only gave this album an 8.3, so there must be something wrong with it.  And indeed there
    is.  After about a dozen or so listens, one thing becomes fairly apparent: these songs have a
    tendency to blend together. But, hey, that's the same criticism that's been leveled at
    Superchunk for years now and it hasn't hurt them any. Nor should it. Like that renowned
    Carolina-grown indie band, Idlewild thrives within the three-to-four minute song structures.
    Simply put, they know to convert a searing hook into a rocking, accessible song. And if the
    result of this talent is that the song structures are fairly uniform, they still come out
    winners.</p><p>
    
    The band's newfound maturity goes beyond the songwriting, though.  Even the lyrics belie
    Idlewild's youthful exuberance.  Favoring a more oblique lyrical approach this time out,
    Woomble is able to tap a much broader emotional palate.  Where <i>Hope is Important</i>
    collapsed under the weight of its own self-importance and heavy-handedness, <i>100 Broken
    Windows</i> succeeds with subtlety.  We're not sure what he means when Woomble says, ""It's a
    better way to feel/ Don't be real, be post-modern"" on ""These Wooden Ideas,"" but regardless of
    its intent, when he utters the lines, they're strangely affecting.  Part of the difference
    certainly lies in his soothing, empathic delivery, but the strength and genuineness of the
    words themselves can't be overlooked, either.</p><p>
    
    So, assuming you enjoy quality punky power-pop, here's the plan:</p><p>
    
    1.      (Optional)  Wait for <i>100 Broken Windows</i> to be imported. You can skip directly
    to Step 3 if you have no intention of doing so.<br/>
    2.      Roll over or have yourself turned over periodically to prevent bedsores.<br/>
    3.      Get off your ass.<br/>
    4.      Put your pants on.<br/>
    5.      Get in the car, or catch the bus, and go to the fucking Virgin Megastore.  You don't
    have a Virgin Megastore?  Get on the Internet.  Don't have the Internet?  Then how are you
    reading this?<br/>
    6.      Go to the Rock section.  Flip past Hurricane #1.  If you get to Iron Maiden, you went
    too far.  Go back.<br/>

    as Britney and Mandy from my considerations, the UK trio Placebo have always
    struck me as the most calculating of bands.  <i>Black Market Music</i>, the
    third installment of Placebo's rolling plan, only strengthens my convictions.
    The title alone justifies my concerns. Not only does it cause us to think that
    the music is illicit and illegal, it also overtly references one of London's
    hippest record shops, Black Market Records. (25 D'Arblay Street, close to
    Oxford Circus, backpacking vinyl fiends!)</p><p>
    Placebo's eyeliner-and-lipgloss power-pop will never compare favorably with
    the masters of the trio, the Minutemen, Hüsker Dü, the Jam, and the Jimi
    Hendrix Experience. And frankly, that's not the band's aim. Their aim,
    apparent from their first days on the scene as London Suede emulators, is to
    sell consistently androgynous product to teenagers titillated by the screaming
    parade of someone else's bisexuality. Frontman Brian Molko is as convincing in
    this rub-me-the-right-way-and-I'll-make-out-with-you way as Brian Warner is at
    ducking pantomime Alice Cooper comparisons, and the closest he gets to the
    Ziggy Stardust he longs to be is wearing an <i>Aladdin Sane</i> Halloween
    costume.  We're never led to believe that Molko has sex with men-- in fact,
    he's obviously about as bisexual as Tennessee Ernie Ford.  Sometimes you just
    have to allow a guy his own fictions.</p><p>
    As I suspected, Placebo retread the catchier moments from 1998's <i>Without You
    I'm Nothing</i> on <i>Black Market Music</i>, and roughen them up just enough
    to ensure top billing on commercial alternative playlists.  Opening with ""Taste
    in Men,"" Placebo lazily reprise the Roland 303 industrial funk of ""Pure Morning.""
    Molko begs us to change our taste in men while he simpers and kills ""time on
    Valentine's/ Waiting for the day to end.""  Molko also reveals, intentionally
    or otherwise, that ""it's been this way since Christmas time."" From this
    disclosure, we assume that a relationship that stretches from late December
    to the middle of February is a long one for him.  The song also features a
    white-noise screech that's remarkably similar to the one that begins Depeche
    Mode's ""I Feel You."" ""Days Before You Came,"" no doubt, revels in the ""come""
    double-entendre, as well as the flagrantly phallic imagery of ""a horn of
    plenty."" The song, a sad retread of ""You Don't Care About Us,"" proves that
    solipsism and self-plagiarism are now the band's most exercised skills.</p><p>
    Placebo get that much meaner for ""Special K""-- probably not a paean to
    Kellogg's weight-watching breakfast cereal.  Though lyrics like, ""Coming
    up beyond belief/ On this coronary thief/ More than just a leitmotif,"" and,
    ""Can this saviour be real/ Or are you just my seventh seal,"" are undeniably
    clumsy, Molko one-ups even these lines by referencing a series of trip-hop
    compilations in the couplet, ""You come on just like special k/ Now you're back
    with dope demand.""</p><p>
    Brian Molko's hooker fantasies are paraded in the card-game-as-metaphor, ""Spite
    and Malice,"" which also attempts to resurrect the career of LSD rapper Justin
    Warfield. ""Aces take your time/ Queens are left for dead/ Jacks can stand in
    line/ And touch themselves instead."" It's later revealed that, in this
    squalling streetwalker symphony, the queens are also ""soft and wet"" as Molko
    prophesizes that ""everything will blow tonight/ Either friend or foe tonight.""</p><p>
    After the product-of-a-broken-home bluster of ""Black-Eyed"" (how about this for
    masturbatory: ""I was never loyal/ Except to my pleasure zone?""), Molko and his
    merry men tell us about a novel they've written, which they've dedicated to
    mom.  Of course, Molko can't resist rhyming ""mom"" with ""Uncle Tom,"" and spends
    the second half of ""Blue American"" questioning race relations: ""I read a book
    about Uncle Tom/ Where a whitey bastard made a bomb/ But now ebonics rule our
    song/ Those motherfuckers got it wrong.""</p><p>
    ""Slave to the Wage"" marks out the next target of Molko's teenage sloganeering,
    incorporating a clanking allusion to Bob Dylan's ""Maggie's Farm"" (""Sick and
    tired of Maggie's Farm/ She's a bitch with broken arms"").  But it's the opening
    lines of ""Commercial for Levi"" that really showcase Molko's laughable lyrical
    talent: ""You're the one who's always choking Trojan/ You're the one who's
    always bruised and broken!""  And how we stagger at the irony of the song's
    title.</p><p>
    Later, on ""Haemoglobin,"" Molko gets to meet Jesus as he portrays himself as
    strange fruit, hanging from a tree. This self-obsession makes the Aquarian,
    Gaia-feminist male lyrics of James' Tim Booth seem like Cole Porter by
    comparison. And it's not as though Molko's voice distinguishes him when he
    delivers such cant; his whiny bluster has all the subtlety and attention to
    performance of a B-29 Superfortress.</p><p>
    Bassist Stefan Olsdal and drummer Robert Schultzberg occasionally break from
    the lite-industrial rock that matches Molko's technique blunder-for-blunder.
    Their most effective, lighter-waving moment comes with the duet version of
    ""Without You I'm Nothing,"" which is apparently performed with David Bowie.
    Of course, Bowie's so far off-mike that his ""presence"" just seems like a
    marketing teaser.  I'm sure, though, that it does Molko's immense ego a cosmos
    of good to upstage the original apostate androgyne, and the choice of this
    song for their duet proves that, had Bowie not paraded his kabuki man-woman on
    stage 30 years ago, Molko would probably be a bag-boy at Sainsbury's.</p><p>
    The Depeche Mode squall cut-and-pasted into ""Taste in Men"" is reprised for
    Placebo's cover of ""I Feel You."" While their version contributes nothing but
    more growling guitars to the song, I'm astounded at the restraint and grace
    that Martin Gore imbued his lyrics with in comparison to the shameless
    juvenilia that Molko screeches.</p><p>
    I suppose that the backstreet <i>Black Market Music</i> will endear itself to
    gender-exploring teenagers who find the girl-on-girl action in <i>Buffy the
    Vampire Slayer</i> ""fucking awesome.""  Placebo seem to be tweaking their
    release schedule so that every couple of years-- as a new crop of bi-curious
    seventh-graders begin to ""experiment""-- they can ensure a fresh soundtrack to
    young boys' fashionably bi-polar circle-jerking.  And best of all, it'll be
    available at every mall in America!  How black market!</p><p>
    But how long can Placebo and Molko continue reprising the same themes, the
    same vacant power-pop bravado? I predict Molko will most likely persist in
    his adolescent outsider fantasies until he's 57, whereupon Placebo will
    disband and he'll out himself as a card-carrying Tory and rail against gays,
    dole-scroungers, and the demise of the British Empire.  Molko has already
    caused me to give praise the penitential, filthy-sacred lyrics of Martin Gore;
    now I'm forced to appreciate Steven Tyler, who, damnit, at least had the
    courage of his teenage lesbian nympho convictions when he cast his daughter
    in the ""Crazy"" video.</p><p>
    The one sustainable quality that the songs <i>Black Market Music</i> possess
    is their resistance to parody.  However hard I tried, Molko's lyrics outdid
    me in glammy doggerel. My best attempt is as follows:</p><p>
<i>""Libertine swigs Listerine<br/>
    Ephedrine makes bad dreams<br/>
    But I'm the reigning queen<br/>
    Strawberries and cream taste supreme<br/>
    But tulips on my organ make me scream<br/>
    Oh the pain, oh the pleasure<br/>
    It's my thrill, measure for measure<br/>
    Pay the bill and wipe up later.""</i></p><p>
    Though my Yankovician mockery flirts with internal rhymes and gauche, hints at
    hardcore substance abuse, and feigns predilection for low-rent trade, Molko
    will always outclass me.  To him be the glory!</p></div>"|6327.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6327-black-market-music/|2.4|Paul Cooper

Sonic Youth, Archers of
    Loaf, Brainiac, Girls Against Boys, and Neil Young (electric) are a few that
    come to mind. Then there are the artists I'm ten times more likely to play on
    Sunday than on any other day, like Brian Eno, Duke Ellington, Otis Redding, Yo
    La Tengo and Neil Young (acoustic). Great artists, of course, are great seven
    days a week (or, in the Beatles' case, eight days a week). And furthermore, in
    the right circumstances, I'll play these artists on any day of the week.</p><p>
    
    Although perhaps not as exceptional as any of those mentioned above, the Jayhawks
    have always been my quintessential Sunday band-- their music always sounds
    particularly poignant or affecting on the Day of Rest. And this album,
    <i>Smile</i>, starts off like it could be their most Sunday album to date. It
    opens with an acoustic strum, a decremental piano bar, another acoustic strum,
    and again, a decremental piano, this time mimicked by an electric guitar in
    the background.  ""Wake up/ Put your shoes on,"" sings frontman Gary Louris.
    ""Take a breath of the northern air/ And rub those eyes.""</p><p>
    
    Louris' voice is so inviting that I oblige: I'm up, out of bed, shoes on. Now
    what? Well, I still need to find an apartment and a part-time job in the self-
    proclaimed greatest city on earth. No more than two weeks have passed and I'm
    already beaten down, dejected, and suffering from metropolitan loneliness and
    isolation, Charles Baudelaire-style. ""Chin up, chin up,"" chime Louris and Karen
    Grotberg. ""You don't really have a problem."" And goddamn, they're right.</p><p>
    
    These rock stars-- they're so smart. So why the hideous distorted guitar jabs
    and unnecessary orchestration in the middle of the opening title track?  It's
    the hand of grandiose producer Bob Ezrin-- the man behind the boards of Pink
    Floyd's <i>The Wall</i>, Kiss' <i>Destroyer</i>, and, of course, Kiss' <i>Music
    from ""The Elder""</i>-- whose flourishes spoil many of this record's perfectly
    fine moments.  For instance, during the following track, ""I'm Gonna Make You
    Love Me,"" the Jayhawks are indulging in their trademark style of ruralternative
    when (presumably) Ezrin douses Louris' voice in reverb during the bridge. In
    doing so, he pulls the music out of the barroom and artificially implants it
    into a bad sci-fi novel.</p><p>
    
    But the first true experimentation comes on the third track, ""What Led Me to
    This Town."" It begins with isolated acoustic chords and Louris' gentle tenor.
    But it's suddenly interrupted by mechanized drumbeats, accompanied by subtle,
    but very noticeable, Pole-like static blips. If hardcore Mark Olson-era Jayhawks'
    fans felt betrayed by the dark pop of 1997's <i>Sound of Lies</i>, they'll be
    downright vigilant after hearing <i>Smile</i>.</p><p>
    
    A handful of other songs rely on looped beats that are, in some cases, sped up
    to the point where they approach hip-hop (""Somewhere in Ohio"") or even drum-
    n-bass (""(In My) Wildest Drums""). There are also moments of arena rock, and 
    even arena-rock balladry, like the frighteningly Journey-esque ""Pretty Thing,""
    on which Marc Perlman takes mic for a humble Jeff Tweedy impersonation. But 
    <i>Smile</i> contains its share of front-porch songs, featuring the backing
    vocals of Grotberg. And even when showcasing greater musical ambition, their
    sound somehow remains essentially the same as it was three years ago.</p><p>
    
    The biggest change, however, is that <i>Smile</i> is the thematic antithesis of
    <i>Sound of Lies</i>. Whereas the latter focused on the pain of broken
    relationships, this album is a much happier affair. And if there's one thing you
    can't fault the Louris-era Jayhawks for, it's aptly titling their albums. That's
    why <i>Smile</i> is more of a, say, Saturday afternoon album. I want my Sunday
    albums consistent, predictable, and preferably gloomy, reflective or sedate. I
    don't want Louris telling me to smile; I want him singing, ""My whole life has
    gone haywire,"" as he did on <i>Sound of Lies</i>.</p><p>
    
    But I can't fault Louris for being happy or traveling new musical territory.
    Although not nearly the <i>Smile</i> Brian Wilson once created while slowly
    snapping, nor even as artistically successful as Wilco's genre break-out <i>Summer
    Teeth</i>, this is one of the finer, genuinely happy albums of the year.  And
    maybe this is exactly what I need right now, whether it's Sunday or not.</p></div>"|4221.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4221-smile/|7.5|Ryan Kearney

A little Casio keyboard.  It had cheap plastic drum pads and goofy
    preprogrammed ""computer"" sounds.  Unfortunately, I had to give it back to the kid I borrowed
    it from, but while the fun lasted, I got a huge kick out of its 100-instrument tone-bank.
    And from the sound of it, Trans Am did, too.  Their new Japanese b-sides collection, <i>You
    Can Always Get What You Want</i>, employs that same preprogrammed Casio ""computer"" patch as
    the primary structure for the opening track, ""American Kooter.""</p><p>
    
    Essentially, the track, which originally appeared in nine-minute studio form on their excellent
    self-titled 1995 debut, is a demo of all the cool sounds that very Casio can generate.  The
    buzzing ""airplane"" sound, the emergency faux-""ambulance"" siren, the ""piano""-- it's all here
    in tinny, distorted glory, backed by a thunderous drum section and confused bass line.  And
    though the track's low-fidelity epileptic funk is powerful enough to move crowds of uptight,
    arty Chicago scenesters, ""American Kooter"" remains both one of the band's least inspired songs
    to date.</p><p>
<i>You Can Always Get What You Want</i> assembles 65 minutes of Trans Am's massive catalog
    of import-only and previously unreleased tracks, and opens and closes with live performances.
    The first three songs, ""American Kooter,"" ""Simulacrum"" and ""Man-Machine,"" are culled from a
    1993 EP on UK-based SKAM records, and were recorded live at the Cave in Chapel Hill, North
    Carolina during that summer.  But regardless of the fact that these are some of the band's earliest
    recordings, they're performed with an intensity that the band has rarely been able to achieve
    on subsequent studio albums-- guitars pick on frayed nerve-endings, hi-hats click with robotic
    precision, and crowd cheers reverberate in drunken frenzies.  Strangely, the album's final
    tracks-- live versions of four songs from 1996's <i>Surrender to the Night</i>, recorded that
    fall at Washington, D.C.'s Black Cat-- are much closer to their studio counterparts and
    considerably less engaging.</p><p>
    
    The majority of this record is composed of lost studio cuts yanked from the several hard-to-find
    releases of Trans Am lore-- a 1995 <i>Strength Magazine</i> split 7"", <i>Tuba Frenzy #3</i>, the
    rare Australian comp <i>In Flux Us</i>-- alongside stray vault tracks like the beautifully
    haywire ""Nazi/Hippie Empire,"" a chopped-up ""Party Mix"" of <i>Futureworld</i>'s ""Am Rhein,"" and
    the ambient, kraut-inflected ""Monica's Story.""  It's during these tracks that Trans Am provide
    fans with their most promising music to date, and hopefully, foreshadow future albums.</p><p>
    
    Despite this compilation's general lack of cohesiveness and its seemingly aimless live closers,
    <i>You Can Always Get What You Want</i> hits more than it misses.  And in the end, it fulfills
    its purpose to save fans hundreds of dollars on overseas postage and import mark-ups.  No longer
    will Trans Am junkies tirelessly search eBay in hopes of encountering a $30 copy of the band's
    <i>Illegal Ass</i> 12"" or scrounge through racks of disorganized 7""s in New York record stores.
    If you're looking for a place to start with these guys, though, go for their 1995 debut or
    1998's <i>The Surveillance</i>.</p></div>"|8133.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8133-you-can-always-get-what-you-want/|7.3|Ryan Schreiber

It was all the rage a few years ago. It gave film nerds
    the chance to impress the hell out of friends and colleagues by putting their inane, useless
    knowledge of trivia to use.  But why should movie fanatics have all the fun?  We indie rock
    losers are just as knowledgeable-- why should we not sink to these same levels of inanity?
    Especially when we can challenge each other with Six Degrees of J. Robbins or, better yet,
    Jim O'Rourke.  Granted, neither have the same ring to them as Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon, or
    the untouchable comedic value introduced by the mention of such a dendrite of '80s pop culture.
    But hey, it gives us indie fans a reason to know our shit (other than that it comes in handy
    when in the market for new albums). Here, I'll try a few:</p><p>
    GUIDED BY VOICES played on the <i>Lounge Ax Defense and Relocation</i> compilation with
    TORTOISE, whose song ""Reference Resistance Gate"" was remixed by JIM O'ROURKE.</p><p>
    NEUTRAL MILK HOTEL is on Merge Records, a label started by SUPERCHUNK, whose album <i>Come
    Pick Me Up</i> was produced by JIM O'ROURKE.</p><p>
    Of course, I used two more difficult examples.  If I'd started with anything out of Chicago, it
    would've taken two steps at most for me to find a connection with Jim. That's because the
    Chicago post-rock scene has played itself out in a seemingly endless series of permutations,
    resulting in a vast number of collaborative efforts. For the most part, these collaborations
    have been thoroughly enjoyable. <i>Synesthesia</i>, a collaboration between Isotope 217
    cornetist Rob Mazurek and noted Chicago jazz drummer Chad Taylor, doesn't deviate from this
    trend-- it's a thoroughly enjoyable record, at times reaching even beyond that.</p><p>
    Unfortunately, Mazurek's electronic wizardry doesn't always couple well with Taylor's more
    traditional free jazz stylings. Whereas other Chicago collaborations have been virtually
    seamless, <i>Synesthesia</i> can, for the most part, be broken down according to the influences
    of its two creators. The more adventurous passages obviously spring from the able mind of
    Mazurek, whereas Taylor's portion consists of extended forays into free jazz, complete with 
    wanky drum solos.</p><p>
<i>Synesthesia</i>'s opening track, ""Blue Sparks from Her and the Scent of Lightning,"" stands
    out as simply one of the most remarkable pieces of music I've heard in a long time. Clocking in
    at well over 11 minutes, ""Blue Sparks"" manages to pull off what very little music from any
    genre can, subtly foreshadowing what's coming next. The first four or so minutes hint at an
    oncoming storm with ominously building layers of atonal synthesizers paired with intermittent
    blasts from Mazurek's horn. As these layers of cacophonous melody are stripped down to a single
    repeating vibraphone melody, a squelching synthesized bassline comes in, just in time for the
    track to explode into an orgy of Latin-tinged percussion and screeching coronet. This eruption
    of sound gives way to almost absolute silence, broken only by a whispering synthesizer.</p><p>
    Unfortunately, the exotic noises and immense sonic variety of ""Blue Sparks"" are not to be seen
    again until much later in the record. <i>Synesthesia</i>'s midsection suffers from a severe lack
    of innovation. Tracks like ""Bellatron"" are straight up free-jazz tunes which would be fine on a 
    record of straight-up free-jazz tunes, but sound uninspired when compared to the sheer
    originality of some of <i>Synesthesia</i>'s other tracks.</p><p>
    It isn't until the fifth track, ""Fluxus,"" which features fellow Chicagoan Sam Prekop on Moog,
    that <i>Synesthesia</i> once again begins to pick up steam.  Here, Mazurek and Taylor shift
    seamlessly and effortlessly between the chaotic and the melodic, displaying serious talent
    that could only be the result of years of practice.  For a record with such startling and
    emphatic dynamics changes, the better portions of <i>Synesthesia</i> are remarkably smooth.</p><p>
    Before there was the Chicago Underground Duo, there was the Chicago Underground Trio. Before 
    that, there was the Chicago Underground Orchestra. Mazurek seems to be chipping away at band
    members and, in doing so, bringing his own unique brand of genre-twisting, rock-influenced
    electronic jazz into focus. With <i>Synesthesia</i>, Mazurek proves once and for all that he's
    more than just an ace horn player.</p></div>"|1437.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1437-synesthesia/|7.8|Matt LeMay

    grandparents to the joys of rock.  I figured, you know, they're pretty hip
    for old people-- they usually win at bridge, and they drive at night. Perhaps
    it'd be easier for me to relate to them if we had at least some sense of
    musical common ground.</p><p>
    So, my grandfather entered into a pact with me: he would listen to a Beatles
    record if I would sit through the classic 1942 James Cagney Musical, <i>Yankee
    Doodle Dandy</i>. It seemed like a glimmer of hope, but it wasn't meant to be.
    The agreement quickly dissipated and my grandfather returned to blasting the
    ""noise"" that I listen to. ""It all sounds the same anyhow,"" he said.</p><p>
    Immediately, I was on the defensive. I was prepared to rip my poor,
    defenseless grandpa to bits with my biting wit and immense store of rock
    knowledge. But instead, I found myself stumbling for something to say that
    could explain the differences between rock bands to an 80 year-old man who
    still considers Lawrence Welk ""cutting-edge.""  Of <i>course</i> rock bands
    sound different! I mean, to say that the Beach Boys and AC/DC are virtually
    identical just seems off the mark.</p><p>
    But for the most part, rock is defined by the presence of a few distinct
    elements-- mainly, the guitar/bass/drums setup. Plus, rock music hasn't
    traditionally broken out of fairly standard tonalities-- the majority of
    rock music, especially popular rock music, has always centered around a
    pretty limited number of chords and scales.  And yet, out of these elements
    have come not only such a wide range of sounds, but a startlingly wide range
    of quality. Some bands have attained this by honing in on particular aspects
    of the rock sound-- one could very easily say something to the effect of, ""I
    like band a because of their x."" (Example: ""I like Don Caballero for their
    drummer,"" or, ""I like Britney Spears for her full, heaving melodies."")</p><p>
    But the best rock music has very little to do with having one standout
    element. Not to slip into gestalt or anything, but the best rock truly is
    that which manages to be infinitely greater than the sum of its parts.
    It's an inexplicable quality, really, but the most important in rock. It's
    what sets apart the true playas from the sucka MCs. And Clinic has it in
    truckloads.</p><p>
    There's nothing particularly ""experimental"" or ground-breaking about
    <i>Internal Wrangler</i>. Guitar, bass, and drums are the predominant
    instruments, with flourishes of organ and tinny drum samples thrown in.
    There are no microtonal guitar solos or squelching analog synthtones. The
    true beauty of Clinic is that they have, using a relatively standard rock
    vocabulary, constructed a truly distinctive, energetic, and magnetically
    appealing sound.</p><p>
    ""Voodoo Wop"" opens <i>Internal Wrangler</i> with layers of drums, including
    bongos, which build upon a slinky bassline and snippets of ambient noise.
    Coupled with budget reverb that lends a garage-rock aesthetic, the track
    creates a wall of tension and uneasiness.  But it isn't until the record's
    second track, ""Return of Evil Bill,"" that Clinic unleashes their secret
    weapon: lead singer Ade Blackburn.</p><p>
    Blackburn's delivery melds the drony expression of Lou Reed with the fragility
    of Sigur Rós frontman Jón Thór Birgisson and the instability of Thom Yorke; he
    employs his voice not merely as a vehicle for lyrical expression, but as an
    entirely separate melodic and percussive element. One of the album's many
    peaks comes with Blackburn's incoherent ramblings on ""The Second Line."" As
    opposed to the ""yeah yeah yeah's"" that have become such a trite aspect of
    rock music, the mess of vowels and consonants that Blackburn spits out
    during the course of the song serve as a visceral outlet for his amazingly
    expressive voice.</p><p>
    Clinic aren't interested in studio sheen and perfected instrumentation, which
    is exactly what makes them innovative.  In a world of anally retentive college
    boys who spend hours at the mixing board to assure that every note is
    flawlessly delivered, in key, and not a 16th of a second off beat, Clinic's
    degree of spontaneity lends them an air of complete originality. To them,
    it's not about the production qualities, the change-up, or the nit-picking.
    It's not about anything other than playing the music itself.  And more than
    anything else, that's what comes through on <i>Internal Wrangler</i>.  Their
    delivery captures a mind-blowing live performance, despite its studio
    origins.</p><p>
    It's tough to pick a single best moment from the record.  Initially, I was
    drawn to the ""Heroin"" and ""Motion Picture Soundtrack"" hybrid, ""Distortions.""
    Over a nicely sequenced drum machine beat and hollow organ, Blackburn cries
    through a straitjacket of vacuum-sealed production, ""I want to know my body/
    I want this out, not in me,"" as a lone trumpet releases a shrill yelp in the
    distance. As the song progresses, the lyrics become more cryptic and moving,
    culminating with indelible lines like, ""You cannot know how often/ I've
    pictured you in coffins/ My baby in a coffin."" As the lyrics grow bleaker,
    the song takes off, its rhythm increasing slightly as the trumpet returns
    with unfocused blasts.</p><p>
    The closing ballad, ""Goodnight Georgie,"" is the most sparse track on
    <i>Internal Wrangler</i>, and one of the best. Relying almost exclusively on
    a gently strummed guitar, Blackburn's deeply affecting vocals, and occasional
    flourishes of trumpet, piano, and tambourine, the song brings into focus the
    band's astounding melodic sense, showcasing one of the most perfectly
    constructed vocal melodies to grace a record in years.</p><p>
    But the brilliance of Clinic is not relegated to quasi-ballads like ""Goodnight
    Georgie."" Sloppy garage punk tracks like ""C.Q."" and ""Hippy Death Suite"" crank
    out raw, clanging noise, utilizing the same elements as their slower, more
    consonant counterparts, never sacrificing their seemingly inherent sense
    of dense rhythm and soaring melody.</p><p>
    Many bands spend their entire careers trying to find a signature sound and
    perfect it.  Clinic, on the other hand, have accomplished this feat with their
    debut full-length. Passionate, visceral, and immensely moving, <i>Internal
    Wrangler</i> is a landmark achievement not only for Clinic, but for all of
    rock music. It's the perfect testament to why rock will never die-- there will
    always be groups like Clinic who cannibalize their influences, pick out the
    tastiest bits, and reconstruct them into something that is not only completely
    their own, but embodies all the primal appeal of rock and roll. <i>Internal
    Wrangler</i> is that kind of album-- so engaging and well-executed, I can't
    imagine how anyone could not love it.  Except, maybe, my grandpa.</p></div>"|1513.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1513-internal-wrangler/|9.3|Matt LeMay

    when a song of theirs was banned from UK radio in 1998.  Their first single,
    ""Child Psychology,"" cooed wisdom in its chorus: ""Life is unfair; kill yourself
    or get over it.""  Sure, they were just being wry and British, but it didn't
    matter to the powers-that-be; apparently, kidding or not, telling people to
    commit suicide was far too scandalous.</p><p>
    
    It's important to note that our own MTV Yank also refused to air the video
    until the line was edited.  And so it was.   The video was aired, like, once
    on ""120 Minutes"" (naturally), and Black Box Recorder slipped into the typical
    obscurity British bands can come to expect in America.  It didn't really matter
    though, because their debut, <i>England Made Me</i>, was an unremarkable bit of
    pretentious moroseness that pleased itself more than it could possibly please
    most listeners.</p><p>
<i>The Facts of Life</i> isn't necessarily a conscious move to keep censors
    and listeners happy, but it's bound to do both much more successfully than its
    predecessor.  With this record, the Black Box Recorder crew-- John Moore,
    ex-Auteur Luke Haines, and vocalist Sarah Nixey-- trade straight-faced,
    desert-arid humor for genuine grins.</p><p>
    
    Musically, the album is more finely crafted than <i>England Made Me</i>, even
    if it follows the same minimalist, laconic approach to pop music.  But this
    time out, the bare-bones approach is more lush and rich, paradoxically proving
    that ""minimal"" does not necessarily have to mean ""sparse.""  The album's opener,
    ""The Art of Driving,"" is a majestic, sweeping number that uses an echo-laden
    beat, sodden bass, and lightly strummed guitar to create a pillow of sound.
    The chorus of ""French Rock 'N' Roll"" is graced with a searing guitar hook that
    intensifies the canned drums and xylophone twinkling.  ""Straight Life"" is as
    subdued as the rest of the record, though buried is a perfect midtempo, subdued
    electro beat.</p><p>
    
    It's all extremely pretty, and without seeming completely manipulative or
    cloying.  Black Box Recorder, however, are still a bit dopey when it comes to
    lyrics.  True, they're no longer fretting over the end of the world and all
    things maudlin.  Instead, they exhibit a preoccupation with transit, on tunes
    like the aforementioned ""The Art of Driving"" and ""The English Motorway System.""
    Vocalist Sarah Nixey still sounds faulty in her cleverness and smugness.  The
    male-female spoken banter on ""The Art of Driving"" plays like a British answer
    to <i>Mad</i> magazine's ""Snappy Answers to Stupid Questions"" as Nixey is asked
    ""Do you believe in love at first sight?/ Do you believe in fate?""  Her terribly
    silly answer is: ""I believe that good things only come to those who wait.""</p><p>
    
    The lyrics fare no better when the subject turns to sex, as it often does. The
    title track sports a lite reggae beat and melody that sounds all too similar
    to Dido's ""Thank You."" We find Nixey staccato, nearly rapping during the verses
    when she takes the role of a fifth grade health teacher: ""When boys are just
    11/ They begin to grow in height/ At a faster rate than they have done before/
    They develop curiosity/ And start to fantasize/ About the things they've never
    thought of doing before.""</p><p>
    
    Similarly ""naughty"" (or at least, <i>they</i> seem
    to think so) is ""Sex Life,"" which tries its hand at being provocative with lines
    like ""Girl on girl/ In your dreams/ Girl's on top/ In between/ Girls together/
    Girls alone/ In your dreams/ In your dreams.""  She goes on to substitute girl
    with ""boy,"" which is obviously not enough to make the lyrics any less laughable.
    Plus, Blur beat them to the punch with ""Girls and Boys.""</p><p>
    
    But Nixey isn't utterly at fault since she's merely a mouthpiece.  She doesn't
    write any of the lyrics (or music, for that matter) that she sings, which may
    account for her sleepy delivery.  When she's not merely speaking and opens her
    pipes to really sing, she proves herself a righteous puppet.  Her delicate,
    melismatic approach is often gorgeous and perfectly suited by the music the
    boys lay under her.  Her voice is uncannily similar to Olivia Newton-John's
    and what's even scarier is that it works.</p><p>
<i>The Facts of Life</i>, contrived bawdiness and all, probably won't cause the
    stir of ""controversy"" that the first record did, and Black Box Recorder sound
    all the better for it.  Still, there's no telling what the UK or our great
    nation may deem inappropriate; even Newton-John's ""Physical"" was banned from a
    few radio stations in Utah.  Apparently, some Mormons even frown on euphemism.
    No matter, because the question here isn't so much, ""Have you never been mellow?""
    as it is, ""When have you not been mellow?""  For Black Box Recorder, it's been a
    long time.  Let's hope they find themselves even more chill when it comes time
    to write lyrics for the next album.</p></div>"|742.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/742-the-facts-of-life/|7.3|Richard M. Juzwiak

I'm not referring to tanks, battlerams and
    firearms, but musical instruments.  Granted, the incessant thunder and crack of explosives is
    percussive, albeit erratic. The quick history lesson on the Bicentennial quarter reminds us that
    suckers with snares kept the beat of destruction. Tolkien's trolls thumped skin timpanis. Genghis
    had gongs. War has rhythm. I was reminded of this at the two most exhilarating concerts I've seen.
    Last weekend, a pogo bacchanal erupted in a cramped club. Clothes were shed and azzes were backed
    up on an altar with a $6 cover. Six months ago, a crowd stomped dust and flicked cigarette ash
    off the floor of Chicago's Metro as three drummers locked into a primal groove. Revolution starts
    with a dance that the stuttering chugs of guitar can't provide. Funk, not volume, pulls people to
    the streets.</p><p>
    
    Primal Scream have always understood the power of a groove and a lyrical grenade. Their entire
    career reaches a melting point on the raw, caustic <i>XTRMNTR</i>. With this album, Primal
    Scream point their finger at multinationals and conservatives, and forewarn the fate of
    Pentheus.</p><p>
<i>XTRMNTR</i>'s sound lies somewhere between the kraut-loving Chemical Brothers and
    latter-era Fugazi. Recent recruits Mani from the Stone Roses and Kevin Shields of My Bloody
    Valentine up the ante. Mani's gritty, nasty basslines form the coral of Primal Scream's
    gunmetal grey and apocalyptic orange reef. The title track bounces guitar freakout sparks
    across congealed grease of bass. ""Swastika Eyes"" races on high-velocity loops like the
    soundtrack to a behemoth final boss in a spaceshooter video game.  Primal frontman
    Bobby Gillespie seems to see himself as the little ""Gradius"" ship facing the myriad-howitzer
    monster of the WTO, NATO, and whatever other ""The Man"" organization you can name.</p><p>
<i>XTRMNTR</i>'s lyrics are sparse and terse, but Gillespie spits bullets like, ""You've
    got the money, I've got the soul,"" and, ""Tell you the truth/ The truth about you/ The truth
    about you?/ You've been true.""  Even when his delivery is awkward (i.e. like an aging white
    Brit trying to flow, as in the former examples), it's barked as if sincerity has locked his
    jaw like rabies. It's hard to disagree with sentiments like ""Kill All Hippies."" Even the music
    mirrors the anti-superfluidity, anti-nostalgic, anti-bucolicness, anti-bathos lyrics. The
    vehicle is stripped and the skeleton spiked. Like the vowel-less title on the cover,
    <i>XTRMNTR</i> is all corners and crunch.</p><p>
    
    Typically, electronic-rock fusion falls flat for smelling too much like silicon and solder.
    <i>XTRMNTR</i> defies such classification thanks to the brilliance of Kevin Shields. This
    is the man who crafted one of the most sonically incredible records of all time, and his
    work here proves his skills have not diminished. ""MBV Arkestra"" drifts in hypnotic rhythms.
    Shields mixes countless tracks of accelerated drums into a thick snakecharm. Layer upon
    layer of sandstorm guitars and horns sweep over the shifting dunes of beats. The song
    feels like a drugged-up rush through a packed Punjabi streetmarket. People, it's My Bloody
    Valentine!  On ""Accelerator"" Shields pushes the volume to an exploding point like gravity
    pulling an MC5 song back into the atmosphere. White flames flare off charred drums as strings
    turn to magma.  Elsewhere, his influence is felt, like on the wargame instrumentals of ""Blood
    Money"" and ""Shoot Speed/Kill Light"".</p><p>
    
    The album has its shortcomings. ""Keep Your Faith"" and ""Insect Royalty"" dip a bit too much into
    the more sentimental song-based style of the last record, <i>Vanishing Point</i>, and ""Swastika
    Eyes"" needs no reprise. But the fighting spirit keeps Primal Scream ahead of the pack. Gillespie
    now sports post-lice hair and mysterious face scratches. He's a battered veteran who's making up
    for some horrible moments in the past. Rest assured, Rod Stewart will not be able to cover
    anything from <i>XTRMNTR</i>.</p><p>
    
    Some still sadly associate Primal Scream with their baggy rock days. Yet few other bands evolve
    this deep into their career, let alone care.  At some point in the mid-90s, Primal Scream woke
    up and realized they'd made a mistake.  Their new political agenda digests much easier than bands
    like Rage Against the Machine who market their entire career off such stances.  In the end,
    Primal Scream understood that under all of the rants there has to lie a steady throb of
    rump-shaking war.</p></div>"|6474.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6474-xtrmntr/|8.1|Brent DiCrescenzo

It took me a while to get it. It wasn't until I opened up Ween's latest album and saw the insert, with one side whitewashed and the other covered in multicolored peppers, that I began to dissect the album's name, and eventually came upon my epiphany. ""White Pepper. White. Pepper. White Album! Sgt. Pepper! White Pepper! Shit!"" Either I'm reading way too much into this album's title, or Gene and Dean have spliced together the names of two of the greatest albums ever into a spicy, yet seemingly benign title.</p><p>
    Right now, you are either seething with rage or chortling with glee. It all depends on whether or not you've actually heard this record. If you haven't heard the record, you probably fall into the former category. ""What's that!"" you say, ""how dare a band compare itself to the greatest single rock and roll band ever! Gene and Dean are blasphemers! Death to them! Death I say!"" Well, settle down. That was my initial reaction, too. But as I listened to the record more and more, I began to see just how clever this album's title is. For the record, this album does not sound like the Beatles, with the exception of maybe a few tracks. <i>White Pepper's</i> similarity to the Beatles lies not in its sound, but rather in its execution.</p><p>
<i>White Pepper</i> bears a much stronger resemblance to the first half of its moniker than to the second. The <i>White Album</i> covered all points on the stylistic map. Play it through once, and you can find the origins of almost every major modern musical style in at least one track; even with all the stylistic curveballs, though, it still sounded like a Beatles record. <i>White Pepper</i> continues Ween's quest to prove that they can cover just about any style of music with impeccable wit and accuracy. Like the <i>White Album,</i> <i>White Pepper</i> lacks the cohesiveness of earlier works, but it also demonstrates how a band can undergo some serious genre-bending, while still retaining a sound that is uniquely theirs.
    </p><p>
    The first thing you'll probably notice about <i>White Pepper</i> is that, for the first time ever, Ween sounds like an entire band. While <i>The Mollusk</i> merely hinted at a bigger, fuller sound, <i>White Pepper</i> serves as the <i>Do the Collapse</i> to <i>The Mollusk's</i> <i>Mag Earwhig!</i>. Except good. But despite the new hi-fi sound, which is due in no small part to the presence of Gene's and Dean's touring band on the album, <i>White Pepper</i> is unquestionably Ween. Gene's unmistakable voice and impeccable sense of melody come off sounding even better than they did back in the days of 4-track recording. And Dean's guitar work is at its most versatile and enjoyable, ranging from jazz licks on ""Pandy Fackler,"" a song about a retarded girl who ""sucks dick under the promenade,"" to flamenco guitar on ""Bananas and Blow.""
    </p><p>
<i>White Pepper</i> kicks off with ""Exactly Where I'm At,"" a rocking, if overly repetitive song featuring some classic psychedelic Dean Ween soloing. ""Exactly Where I'm At"" is rivaled in its arena-rocking status only by ""Back to Basom,"" a thoroughly fucked-up power ballad about smiling waste, and dancers with lost legs. Or at least I think that's what it's about. ""Even if you Don't,"" one of the two tracks on <i>White Pepper</i> that sound remotely like the Beatles, is a charming McCartney-esque piano-driven tune. But Ween finds itself at its most Beatlesque on ""Ice Castles,"" a wobbly Strawberry Fields-ish instrumental that was originally titled simply ""Baroque Jam.""
    </p><p>
    Unfortunately, <i>White Pepper</i> is a bit of a disappointment as compared to <i>The Mollusk</i>. First of all, a few tracks, like the hard rocking ""Stroker Ace,"" just don't hold up with the rest of the album. And while many of the tracks are quite excellent, none of them approach the sheer brilliance of songs like ""The Mollusk"" or ""Buckingham Green."" Its lack of thematic consistency renders <i>White Pepper</i> incapable of making any vast statement such as <i>The Mollusk</i> did. And, let's face it, the lack of profanity, including the complete absence of the word ""fuck,"" renders it incapable of being as funny as early Ween faves like ""She Fucks Me,"" and the ever-popular ""LMLYP."" Still, <i>White Pepper</i> is hardly a step back for Gene and Dean. More like a lateral. Ween has taken on 70's prog, Prince, country, and now arena rock. And they've managed to do all of it well. So what does the future hold for Ween? Who knows. Maybe they'll take on techno. When ""Everything is Beyond the Ultraworld"" comes out, I'll buy it.

Paul D. Miller (aka DJ Spooky)     investigates how it is that anyone can understand anyone else, how language works and how     we frame our world; Robin Rimbaud (aka Scanner) eavesdrops on cellphone communications and     reconfigures the recorded conversations into art installations.  So you'd expect a     collaboration between these two receivers to be lengthy, abstract, and probably academic     to some degree.</p><p>Luckily, you'd be wrong. This soundclash isn't featherweight, either; both parties have reined     in their tendencies to enter into discourse and predication, and instead concentrated on     substantial illbient grooves.

""Ngugi"" rattles     and shakes on strange percussion and sirocco breezes, before a Thomas Köner-like ground     wobbles and distorts the foundations. ""Synchronism 2"" recalls early Wordsound releases like     Dubadelic's <em>Bass Invaders</em> with its dub-cavern bass and crumpled, collapsed keyboard     stabs.  Here, it's hard to tell who's influencing who-- unlike some collaborations, <em>The     Quick and the Dead</em> is a true fusing of talents as opposed to a convenient marketing     ploy (selling two artists on the same disc to sell twice as many copies) or a call-and-response     routine (like Scanner's collaboration with Signs ov Chaos).</p>
<p><em>The Quick and the Dead</em> is the first in Sulfur's Meld series and, if the consistency and     relevance of this debut are maintained, this series should be as vital as Fatcat's <em>Split     1-8</em> series. Miller and Rimbaud have kept to-the-point and chosen not to waste words. So     following their shining example, I won't either: Purchase with confidence.</p></div>"|2384.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2384-the-quick-and-the-dead/|7.6|Paul Cooper

    ""Loser"", so, too, must this review address Nada Surf's MTV hit, ""Popular"", from
    their 1996 debut, <i>High/Low</i>. Of course, Beck's <i>Mellow Gold</i> was a
    much more promising debut, and he's since recorded five mostly outstanding records
    that have more than disproved the one-hit wonder status initially bestowed upon
    him.  Nada Surf, on the other hand, have only made <i>The Proximity Effect</i>
    since their first record. Needless to say, their fate is still up in the air.</p><p>
    I remember the cheerleaders in the ""Popular"" video, but to be honest, I don't
    remember the song very well. I think the verses were talky, and then there was
    that catchy, ironic chorus.  I don't remember the rest of it.  So, even as far
    as hits by sweater-wearers go, it wasn't nearly as memorable as ""Loser"".</p><p>
    Nada Surf actually completed <i>The Proximity Effect</i> in 1998, whereupon it
    was released in Europe, supposedly ""selling briskly and garnering critical
    acclaim"" (this according to the press release; I guess I'll take their word for
    it). But after it tanked in the U.S., Elektra wasted no time dropping them. Nada
    Surf eventually regained the rights and have now released it on Mardev, their new
    self-run label.</p><p>
<i>The Proximity Effect</i> opens interestingly enough, with a guitar somehow
    manipulated to resemble bagpipes and quick drums like a skipped heartbeat. But
    ""Hyperspace"" quickly delves into uninspired driving pop-rock à la the Foo
    Fighters.  Aside from the notes in his higher register, which sound like Brian
    Wilson on speed (rather than on, say, anti-depressants), singer/guitarist Matthew
    Caws' voice is pretty unexceptional.  Think Weezer's Rivers Cuomo, but with
    limited inflection and without defining characteristics-- a particularly apt
    comparison, given that most of Nada Surf's music recalls Weezer's early work.</p><p>
    The following number, ""Amateur"", is one such song that makes it impossible to
    ignore the Weezer influence. With decent hooks and spontaneous drums, Nada Surf
    seals the comparison with self-doubting lyrics that scream, ""Hey, look at me--
    I'm ironic and messed up!"" Delivering his lines in a cavalier, ""Buddy Holly"" sort
    of way, Caws sings, ""You said I should get professional help/ It always makes me
    cry/ I know I'm just an amateur/ But I've gotta try.""</p><p>
    ""80 Windows"" shows some potential, though.  Relying on a slower, more reflective
    mood, the song glides along like a pick-up on a country road. It's pleasant enough
    until Caws delivers the central lines, ""The moon is closer to the sun than I am to
    anyone."" When I first heard it, I wasn't sure whether to laugh or cry.  In a bad
    way.</p><p>
    The same problems plague the rest of the album. ""Bacardi"" is another decent,
    introspective number, but it's about someone getting drunk on Bacardi and
    watching <i>The Late Show</i>. Employing handclaps to encourage the listener,
    ""Bad Best Friend"" would have a certain sing-along quality if... well, just look
    at the title, for Christ's sake! And snatching its opening riff from Nirvana's
    ""Stay Away"", ""Dispossession"" features addictive, manipulated background vocals
    that give the song an interstellar, searing quality.  But without being clever
    or intentionally funny, Caws talks (not sings: remember ""Popular""?) about leaving
    behind his coat and belt and not wanting them back.</p><p>
    Weezer are a prime example of how maudlin and ironic pop music can move a music
    snob to dance and mope without guilt.  And while not as sharp, curvy, or ensnaring
    as Weezer's, Nada Surf's hooks would suffice if not for unavoidably sub-par lyrics.
    They wear their hearts on their sleeves while also addressing the banality of human

I mean, think how impoverished our lives
    would be without buoyant, catchy-as-all-fuck melodies and treacly chord
    progressions to snap the brow-beating monotony of ""serious,"" ""intelligent""
    or (self-)""important"" music.  Pop seems to be at its best when it's
    straightforward, without pretense, gimmicks or aspirations to be something
    more.  And when it works right, song-lovers converge on it like kids on
    piñata innards.  That said, not all pop music is created equal.  Oftentimes,
    it doesn't work at all, and the very fact that it wants to win us over, but
    can't, is enough to invite our most bitter scorn and derision-- the sort of
    contempt usually directed at bad pick-up lines, insincere flattery, and clumsy
    liars.</p><p>
    Then there's the so-so stuff.  Fountain Valley, California's Bikeride lives
    right on the periphery of so-so, just across the tracks from ""really good.""
    Tony Carbone, the principal songwriting force of the group, draws thirstily
    from the well of 60s pop innovators like Brian Wilson, Burt Bacharach, The
    Beatles, et al.  But who hasn't?  There are two perils inherent in this strategy:
    Pulling 60s tricks in 2001 isn't interesting anymore, it's just retro. And
    second, the old guys did it best. So, toeing the nostalgic line, as Bikeride
    do, is always an iffy, hit-or-miss stunt; either you do the tradition proud
    or you bellyflop.</p><p>
<i>Summer Winners/Summer Losers</i>, true to its title, has a lot of both.
    As well it should, I guess, considering that it's not a regular LP, but a
    compilation of several old EP tracks, previous unreleased songs, and LP
    bonus tracks heretofore only available on Japanese releases. Perhaps terms
    like ""cohesiveness"" and ""flow"" have little or no place in the discussion of
    compilations, but borrowing as it does from many of their previous releases,
    <i>Summer Winners/Summer Losers</i> is a convenient place from which to judge
    Bikeride's work as whole.</p><p>
    Bikeride completists (all four of you) are going to buy this no matter what.
    For the rest of us, a little history is in order:  Carbone and friends started
    the group at Loyola Marymount University. They've since released two full-lengths
    (1997's <i>Here Comes the Summer</i>  and 1999's <i>Thirty-Seven Secrets I Only
    Told America</i>), as well as the <i>Dogs</i> EP, the <i>America's Favorite
    Omelettes</i> EP, and the <i>Raspet</i> EP.</p><p>
    This record's opener, ""Here Comes Summer"", is its only previously unreleased
    song, and an odd choice for a lead-off; of all <i>Summer Winner</i>'s 19 tracks,
    it's the least representative of their work.  Fuzzy, delayed guitar chords and
    a driving beat lay the foundation for a chorus of harmonizing voices singing
    about, um, the coming of summer.  The song boasts some gorgeous chord changes
    during the bridge, but the overall feel is spoiled by the unnecessary addition
    of a violin playing a Middle-Eastern scale over the otherwise standard pop
    progression.  Before long, we're introduced to ""Meghan"" and ""Leah &amp; Nikki"",
    both mid-tempo, California-style pop songs with flute melodies, tambourine,
    harmonica, and lyrics about-- you got it-- summer.</p><p>
    ""New Year's Girl"", originally from the <i>Raspet</i> EP, brings a welcome shift.
    If The Cars had been a 60s band with Moog synths, they might have sounded like
    this. (Sorry, Ric.)  Which brings us to ""Carl Wilson Suite"", which simply
    switches between torpid, strummy verses and garish choruses that sound kind
    of like old Neil Diamond.</p><p>
    ""You Stepped on My Guitar"" is a less-than-half-baked idea that should never
    have seen plastic.  Illustrating how fish-out-of-water these guys sound
    attempting to ""rock out,"" the song features annoyingly twee lyrics (""you
    hurt my baby [guitar]"").  ""Shawna"", meanwhile, puts lyrics to a Casio keyboard
    demo song: In a word, <i>awful</i>.  ""Continental Divide"" sounds brilliant
    in comparison.  At the risk of wearing out my bad musical hybrid license,
    imagine old Billy Joel covered by David Bowie trying to sound reggae-ish.
    Odd, but curiously enough, not all that bad.</p><p>
    It's not until the tenth track, however, that we get an actual good song. ""Fine
    and Dandy"" is less than two minutes in length, but is among the best <i>Summer
    Winners</i> has to offer. Folky guitar, pitter-patter drums, and Carbone
    utilizing Dylan-esque vocal techniques make for a successful and rare moment
    of peace and quiet in a compilation littered with frenetically ""cute"" odes to
    voices and styles long dead.</p><p>
    ""A Summer Song"", the first of two covers, reprises the early 60s bubblegum
    classic, and peddling quickly behind is ""Handlebars"", the easy pick for the
    album's best track.  Here, the songwriting is strikingly similar to that of
    Blanket's Chad Crouch, with sparse, delicate chords, and even toy piano
    toward the end.  And yet another surprise comes with the sing-songy ""Country
    Driving"", which boasts great harmonies and bluegrass licks on clean-toned
    Fender guitars.</p><p>
    ""The Four of Us in June"" is the saddest, prettiest cut, but only lasts a little
    over a minute. Nice use of church bells, though. ""Endless PCH"", meanwhile, serves
    only to reaffirm Bikeride's so-so tendencies.  And then, we reach the final
    track: A rendition of The Go-Gos' ""Our Lips are Sealed"" that busts out the
    banjo and the 3/4 timing to good effect, if a little too late.  A so-so ending
    to a so-so collection that Bikeride fanatics can wrap their so-so loving hearts
    around.</p></div>"|692.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/692-summer-winnerssummer-losers/|6.0|Camilo Arturo Leslie

    in the record store.  I was so distracted by the unexpected record and its bad cover art-- a
    found portrait doctored with psychedelic fluorescent pastels-- that I didn't even notice it was
    marked $27.50.  At first glance, the sketch looks like the work of a bad artist on a bad acid
    trip.  But look more closely... the man represented has a third eye!  This is borderline absurd,
    but Beck takes it to the next level by allowing the third eye to sprout a thought balloon
    announcing, ""A Collection of B-Sides.""  This is funny, right?  Kind of, but not funny enough
    to redeem its hideousness.</p><p>
    
    Don't let new-age chalks of fuchsia irony fool you, this album is expensive.  The $30 price tag
    for eight b-sides of import singles averages out to just under $4 per song.  When I paid for it,
    I asked the cashier if she knew if DGC had plans to reissue it in a package that was less
    Japanese and less thirty dollars.  She didn't know.  In my copious research I didn't come across
    any mention of a domestic release in the near future.  So for the time being, the question remains--
    are these songs worth $4 each?  Let's test out their exchange value together.</p><p>
<li> First up!  Do you spend four of your dollars on ""Halo of Gold,"" track two off <i>Stray Blues</i>,
    or on a tube of ""Lash-o-lishous"" mascara from the sale bin at Store-24?<p>
    
    Come on, when are you really going to wear that mascara, anyway?  By the time you get around to
    using it, it'll be all clumpy.  In comparison to annoying gobs of black paint covering your
    eyelashes, Beck covers Alexander Lee Spence's ""Halo of Gold"" quite smoothly.  I haven't heard
    the original, so I can't comment on Beck's version comparatively, but he's certainly soaked the
    song in his own style (of that moment)-- the production and overall sound of this 1998 recording
    is distinctly marked as <i>Mutations</i>-era Beck, complete with sitar, harpsichord-like synths
    and drug-induced washes of sound under strong choruses.  The song works as a lofty platform
    from which Beck can show off his proclivity for genre-bending pastiche by dropping accents of
    thin, twangy guitar over dense fuzz-bass.  Beck beats Lash-o-lishous.</p><p>
<li> ""Burro"" -vs.- a loaf of kalamata olive bread.<p>
    
    I'll admit that citing this level of specificity in baked-goods could only arise from a
    considerable passion for fancy olives stuck in bread, but this only serves as an example of
    the potential satisfaction that can be bought for $4.  The stakes are high for these songs!
    While the bread was baked fresh today, ""Burro"" has been sitting around since 1997.  Here,
    Beck offers his best attempt at lounge-singer vocals (in Spanish) backed by a real Mariachi
    band.</p><p>
    
    ""Burro"" serves as a Mariachi tribute to Beck's ability to take on musical styles and genres
    like fellow chameleons Ween, Blur, and Neil Young.  It's a reptilian tribute to his postmodern
    game of dress-up, but it's also a vaguely entertaining throwaway track.  If one of your friends
    performed something like this at a Karaoke bar, you might pay $4 to have a video of your
    friend hamming it up Mariachi style.  You'd probably watch it for a laugh once every five
    years or so.  But Beck isn't my friend, and I don't have a video of this performance.  I
    mean, if a song is going to cost $4, I better want to listen to it more than twice a decade.
    The kalamata olive loaf wins over ""Burro"".  You knew it would.</p><p>
<li> <i>Stray Blues</i>' opener ""Totally Confused"" -vs.- a $3.99 Blockbuster rental of <i>Dazed and
    Confused""</i><p>
    
    I know what you're thinking: Blockbuster has a two-for-one weekday special, so you'll probably
    get more than just <i>Dazed and Confused</i> for the price of this track.  To level the playing
    field, I'm going to throw in track five, ""Lemonade"", as part of the deal.  These songs were
    recorded in 1993 and 1994, respectively, and it's clear why they didn't make it onto <i>Mellow
    Gold</i>.  They're pleasant enough listens, but they don't hold their own like ""Soul Suckin
    Jerk"" or ""Nitemare Hippy Girl"".</p><p>
    
    ""Totally Confused"" lays Beck's raw, slacker-like ruminations atop a melodic, rolling chorus.
    But ""Lemonade"" trades off contrasting sounds rather than layering them.  A primitive pot-clanking
    rhythm and incoherent percussive vocals give way to shimmery, overproduced pop arrangements.
    These hard shifts between contrasting styles could be jarring or annoying.  Instead, the
    thumping racket brings out the driving beat under the soft stuff, and the prissy pop confections
    work to highlight the more melodic elements in the lo-fi noise.  Similarly, <i>Dazed and Confused</i>
    documents style and mood while seeming more like a series of outtakes than a finished artifact.
    Maybe you want to experience both, but not on a regular basis.  It's a draw.</p><p>
    
    Also included are ""Clock"", a track with a distinctly 80s sound that was produced by the Dust
    Brothers, and a rock ballad called ""Brother"".  Beck's guitar work and vocal performance on
    ""Brother"" recalls White Lion or maybe Poison's softer side, until you listen more carefully to
    the lyrics which are strangely smart: ""Brother, are you really here/ The package I received is
    gone/ Are you a phantom detective/ Can you read my soul backwards?/ I would glide with you/ If
    you are a backwards ghost/ I will hire you.""</p><p>
<i>Stray Blues</i> is a diverse compilation.  You could take that as a complement to Beck's
    stylistic range or as a euphemism for this record's lack of cohesion or theme.  But it doesn't
    try to avoid the word ""compilation""-- it's upfront about the fact that it's a collection of songs
    and not an album.  And the songs are good!  However, none of them made it onto Beck's full-length
    albums for one reason: those records are a lot more than good, and we know Beck can do better
    than <i>Stray Blues</i>.</p></li></p></li></p></li></p></div>"|616.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/616-stray-blues-a-collection-of-b-sides/|7.0|Kristin Sage Rockermann

In over two years
    of writing for Pitchfork, I've waited for the one album that would warrant a 0.0-- perhaps even
    covet the lesser o.o.  In my five years of reading Pitchfork, I can only remember a couple of
    0.0s, likely spouting from the scalding keyboard of Jason Josephes.  Now, finally, my generation
    has its <i>Metal Machine Music</i>-- an unfathomable album which will be heard in the squash
    courts and open mic nights of deepest hell.  At least Lou Reed had the good grace to keep his
    mouth shut on his grinding hallmark of pretentious ejaculation.</p><p>
    
    We Chicagoans are stubbornly proud.  We shout insults to New York with mouths full of all-beef
    hot dogs and Old Style beer.  This general resentment mostly stems from being dubbed ""The
    Second City.""  However, landmarks like <i>NYC Ghosts &amp; Flowers</i> refocus our dislike with
    greater alacrity.  Sonic Youth's umpteenth album wads everything we hate about New York into
    one convenient tissue.  The only thing missing is the Mets.  Sonic Youth remind us that white
    New Yorkers still grow soul-patches and goatees, wear berets and Rastafarian caps, dine on
    grilled tofu in an emulsification of goat butter and kumquat, and watch Dutch documentaries
    about fisting, thinking it's original, intellectual, or influential.</p><p>
    
    These 40+ year olds continue to operate under the perception that they matter.  However, one of
    the prerequisites for being ""experimental"" or ""underground"" is that, down the road, somebody
    has to be influenced by the work and appropriate elements into the common collective.  The
    minimal noodling on <i>NYC Ghosts &amp; Flowers</i> merely retreads the rancid corpses of beat
    poetry and avant-garde noise.</p><p>
    
    In a way, Sonic Youth's offenses are no different than, say, the Bloodhound Gang's.  Where the
    Bloodhound Gang push recycled Beastie Boys and ""South Park"" jokes on will-less consumers, Sonic
    Youth scrap together Yoko Ono, Glenn Branca, and Allen Ginsberg into major label product.  But
    just like living in the Big Apple, you're merely paying more for it.  These are not new ideas.
    These are ideas that were arrogant and unlistenable upon birth 30 years ago.  Sonic Youth are
    even old enough to know that!  Thurston Moore stuck the sleeves of John Cage albums into his
    spokes and Kim Gordon played house with her Kathy Acker action figures.</p><p>
    
    Shockingly, aside from some distorted crescendos on ""Renegade Princess"" and ""Nevermind,"" the
    volume here is kept at a muted minimum.  Flashing and bleating overrules chords.  Now <i>neither</i>
    word in the name ""Sonic Youth"" is apt.  A ""song"" might be merely thwacking a bass repeatedly
    (""side2side"") or rubbing callused fingers over gainless guitar strings (mostly everything else).</p><p>
    
    The horror-score chiming of ""Free City Rhymes"" comes closest to older Sonic Youth-- or at least
    the worst moments from <i>A Thousand Leaves</i>-- and features the album's only qualified
    'singing.'  Elsewhere, it's straight spoken word (or in Gordon's case, grunted), the quality of
    which brings to mind freshman poetry classes where that one Doors worshiper recites beat prose
    to the general embarrassment of the entire class.  Each line is a prime example, but some demand
    extra warning.  For example, Kim Gordon moans (in lowercase): ""boys go to jupiter to get more
    stupider/ girls go to mars, become rock stars,"" before daring God with the closing, ""strike me
    down/ strike me down/ with lightning.""  Her underwear fascination continues on ""side2side"" with
    sighs of ""bra"" and ""special/ underwear.""</p><p>
    
    Producer Jim O'Rourke keeps the guitars thin and the electronic bleeps ready in a Hefty sack
    while Thurston drops his voice into comedic Norse mumbling on ""streamXsonic subway.""  In a
    rushed cadence, he spits cyberpunk mumbo-jumbo like, ""clipped on my streetmatick clogs/ pushed
    thru the hyped-out fervent fogs/ found my way with sensoid jogs/ new radio structure.""  Picture
    this barked over what sounds like a riding mower running over a line of Tonka trucks.  Whoever
    stole Sonic Youth's equipment, please give it back.  Or, perhaps you didn't steal enough.
    And this being democratic badness, Lee Ranaldo speaks hilarious William S. Burroughs
    impersonations on the title track.  ""Hey did any of you freaks here ever remember Lenny,""
    he asks as if wearing a trenchcoat in a opium den.</p><p>
    
    As Chip Chanko pointed out:<br/>
    Sonic Youth = communism<br/>
<i>Daydream Nation</i> = Russian Revolution<br/>
<i>Experimental Jet Set</i> = <i>Hunt for Red October</i></p><p>
    
    So, essentially: an idea that seemed right on paper and in initial, riotous action, but one
    that has since corroded into a hollow sham.  Plus, one could only wish Sonic Youth even
    approached the sound of <i>Daydream Nation</i> here.  Instead, we're left with structures
    based on toggling the pickup selector on a Fender.  The last two lackluster albums at least
    left beautiful epics like ""Diamond Sea"" and ""Hits of Sunshine,"" but this record merely squirts
    out electro-duck quacks over nothingness on the opening to ""Lightnin'.""  Everything down to the
    grammar and paintings inside is lamentable.  Peppering speech with 'fuck' and typing ""that's
    whatchoo got crawling in yr panic net"" fails to qualify as inventive or hip these days.  Melody
    and harmony have been banned in Sonic Youth's camp.  Merit badges are now awarded for bleeding
    squeaks from amps and rhyming 'punk' with 'slunk.'</p><p>
    
    A 0.0 is monumental.  I have to keep questioning this decision, but the evidence is there.  It
    takes a giant to fall and make this big of a splash.  Home movies may be sloppy, but titanic
    disasters like <i>Hudson Hawk</i> and <i>Bonfire of the Vanities</i> go down in history when
    even the dam of skill, better judgment, and experience fails to stymie the flood of bile.
    Sonic Youth seem intent on staying in New York, and <i>Ghosts &amp; Flowers</i> sounds like a
    conceptual dedication to their home.  New York, their mother, should even feel ashamed.
    Chicago sleeps soundly knowing we didn't produce such an album... doh!  Jim O'Rourke! Just
    move, already!</p></div>"|7342.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7342-nyc-ghosts-flowers/|0.0|Brent DiCrescenzo

    young boy in Ridgewood, New Jersey?  After all, we were too young to think of
    memory.  Or even of respecting the dead, for that matter. The older kid-- who
    we deemed ""cool"" solely because he was older-- came up with the idea.  He'd
    even tied the rope around the neck of the bird, which lay slumped in the wet
    leaves by the roadside.  But he couldn't commit the final act, leaving it
    instead for someone younger and more impressionable.  Someone who wanted to be
    seen as cool by the older kid.</p><p>
    
    Someone who wasn't me. My best friend and next-door neighbor stepped up, grabbed
    the string, whirled the bird. I believe he yelled, ""Lasso!"" just as the body
    separated from the head and flew aloft in an NFL Films-style slow-motion arc.
    With onlookers mouths' agape, it descended through the sunroof a yellow Le Car
    that had come to a stop at the nearby intersection.  The denouement wasn't enough
    to instill laughter, fear, the flight response, or anything else related to
    emotional shock or physical paralysis.</p><p>
    
    The car door flung open, as car doors have a tendency to do in such moments, and
    a tall, hysterical, mini-skirted woman flung herself from the small cab. Her long
    brown hair danced in the wind, and her white blouse rippled like the main sheet
    of a jibing sailboat. But that tight skirt kept her legs from pumping hard enough,
    so that despite our delayed reaction, escaping was relatively easy.  Once safe,
    the other emotions kicked in. We laughed in disbelief, then felt fear that she
    recognized one of us, and finally ""broke up,"" fleeing to our respective homes to
    avoid capture and reduce suspicion, as all smart suburban guerrillas will do.</p><p>
    
    I bet Paul Barman had an experience like this. Not exactly, but something like
    it. Everyone who grew up in Ridgewood had at least one. But then again, like
    most aspiring rappers these days, Paul left Ridgewood to attend Brown University.
    So maybe he was always smart enough to avoid such inhuman behavior as ours.  But
    Prince Paul must have heard something he liked because he decided to produce
    this EP.</p><p>
    
    Thus, the opening track, ""Joy of Your World,"" begins with a stuttered beat that
    rises in volume before breaking into a steady, unchallenging groove, accompanied
    by a leisurely clarinet and harp swipes. A lounge piano is haphazardly beaten
    during Barman's rhymes, but-- in typical Prince Paul fashion-- that's all you
    get. You shouldn't, wouldn't and don't buy this album for fresh, inventive beats.</p><p>
    
    The first six lines are a perfect representation of the ""not so enigmatic as the
    press seems to think"" MC Paul Barman (see the right column for a quick breakdown):</p><p>
<pre>
    Lines:                               Means that Paul Barman:
    ""My brain makes the earth dark""      ...is arrogant
    ""but I'm hung like a birthmark""      ...and self-deprecating!
    ""I like to suck toes""                ...is a sexually repressed
    ""Yours secrete fructose""             [change ""repressed"" to ""disturbed""]
    ""I make paintings based on grids""    ...likes to draw [see back page of <i>Spin</i>]
    ""Just like Chuck Close""              ...pretends he's erudite [it's pretentious]
    </pre></p><p>
    
    What saves Paul Barman is that his lyrics, while sometimes offputting, are often
    very funny. ""Joy of Your World,"" for instance, is a slight parody of Lauryn Hill's
    ""To Zion.""  During the chorus, he sings, ""Now the joy/ Of your world/ Is Paul
    Barman,"" immediately followed by a high pitched ""beautiful, beautiful Barman.""</p><p>
    
    He's funniest, however, when rapping about sex-- ""I'll still be rhymin' when I'm
    in your hymen.../ I'm a hunter-gatherer, a cunter-latherer""-- or lack thereof--
    ""Those ancient Hamptonites/ They're always like, 'I can't tonight.'"" Reading those
    first two lines, you might be slightly disturbed. But given his obvious lack of
    seriousness, as well as the frequency with which he criticizes his sexual inadequacies,
    Barman won't have you crying, ""Misogyny!"" as Eminem would. Rather, it's just the
    subconscious musings of an Ivy League rapper whose distorted-speed flow sounds like
    a warped cassette in a broken tape deck.</p><p>
    
    Like wrapping a string around a dead bird, spinning it through the air, and seeing
    its body fly into the sunroof of a Le Car, MC Paul Barman is odd, funny, and mostly
    harmless. The main difference is that, in a few months, he won't be decapitated-bird
    funny.  He'll just be ha-ha funny.</p></div>"|566.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/566-its-very-stimulating-ep/|5.8|Ryan Kearney

We are floating in     dreams-- dreams woven of sustained overtones, duration and pitch playing     tricks on our ears and distorting our sense of time and place.  It began     with this, funny enough.  Lou Reed's infamous <em>Metal Machine Music</em>;     Jim O'Rourke's unlikely entrance in the pantheon of indie rock; all those     SYR EPs and Sonic Youth's rectum-suffocated worship of the avant-garde; these     instances and countless others were all born from the same seed: the legend     of the Theatre of Eternal Music, La Monte Young's Dream Syndicate.</p><p>One of the most significant and controversial releases of 1965, <em>Inside the     Dream Syndicate</em> offers a glimpse behind the mysterious curtain.  It's what     you might have heard had you been fortunate and bold enough to sit in on one     of the Dream Syndicate's legendary '60s performances.  Mind-numbing waves of     amplified strings, slowly bowed to maintain overlapping drones the likes of     which you never thought you'd ever want to listen to-- alienating, enveloping     sound, seemingly devoid of notation and sense.</p><p>""Outrageous!"" was the cry when Lou Reed unleashed <em>Metal Machine Music</em>.     ""You should have heard the Dream Syndicate,"" was Reed's response.  But don't     let the band's name fool you: they're not to be confused with the Paisley     Underground psych-pop band that adopted the moniker as a high-brow homage in     the early '80s.  This is the high-throttle point when 20th Century Classical     almost became rock 'n' roll.  This is the Big Bang of Minimalism.  And just     look at the star power: a pre-Velvets John Cale on viola; venerable avant-garde     composer and filmmaker Tony Conrad on violin (he was Mercury Rev's mentor at     SUNY Buffalo, don'tcha know); poet and percussionist Angus MacLise on tabla;     and one of the weirdest, most visionary of artistic marriages in John Cage     protégé La Monte Young and visual artist Marian Zazeela, who provide vocal     drones and conceptual direction to the project.</p>
<p>La Monte Young owns the original performance and rehearsal recordings of the     Dream Syndicate and refuses their release, much to the frustration of Cale and     Conrad.  He insists that he should be credited to the sole ""composer"" of the     music-- himself.  Cale and Conrad have always maintained otherwise, that it     was a collaborative effort in performance and improvisation, and that they shall     never cede complete authorial credit to Young alone.  This dispute, along with     Young's intractable perfectionism, has prevented the world for the past 35 years     from hearing just what those five headcases were up to.</p>
<p>However, some high-quality bootlegs (""an additional cache of tapes,"" it's said)     have surfaced, so here we have it: a healthy dose of controversy and confusion,     and the first semi-legit release of Dream Music ever, credited to all five.  La     Monte Young is pissed, noting imperfections in the mix, length, etc.  But any     way you cut it, avant-garde indie Table of the Elements has balls, and this     release is ideal.</p>
<p>This music is not meant to be listened to on headphones.  It is difficult,     should fill space, bounce off walls, clear rooms, and mess with your head.     Appropriate volume levels do not exist for what is on this disc.  Originally,     Dream Syndicate performances were debauched night-long endurance tests,     presaging the vibrant rave scene that would follow.  <em>Goodbye 20th     Century</em>?  I think not.  The past always comes back to haunt you.</p></div>"|1226.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1226-inside-the-dream-syndicate-volume-i-day-of-niagara-1965/|8.1|S. Murray

Actually, I sold
    all but two. It took me three days to decide whether or not to go through with it.  The final
    compromise was that I would keep <i>You're Living All Over Me</i> and <i>Where You Been</i>
    and dump the rest. I listened to each of the discs one last time before packing them up along
    with my Some Velvet Sidewalk records and that two-disc <i>Chairman of the Board</i> Sinatra
    tribute album Grass Records put out forever ago.</p><p>
    
    I don't know why I held onto these two albums specifically. Yeah, they were my favorites of the
    bunch, but in the end, it wasn't enough.  My kind heart and high school memories gave way to an
    empty wallet, and I eventually even sold those to a used CD store. I was Dinosaur Jr-less for
    four years until now. My hopes sprang when I saw I was being handed this new BBC collection to
    review.  After so long without the simple comforts of J Mascis and friends, I was pretty eager
    to hear them again.  Maybe I'd changed in all those years.</p><p>
    
    I hadn't.  Or at least, distance hadn't made the heart grow fonder. Dinosaur Jr live sounds pretty
    much the same as their old albums, and that sound is pretty much the same, even after our period
    apart. Of course, all but two of these tracks were recorded in 1988-89 (dating up to <i>Bug</i>)
    so they <i>should</i> sound like the first few albums.  But while these recordings catch the band
    in both their seminal line-ups, with Lou Barlow on bass, and at the peak of their early years, the
    actual performances hardly stand apart from their studio counterparts. If anything, it's easier
    to tell what's going on in the songs more without the super lo-fi, in-the-red, shrill feedback
    production to get in the way.  But is that a good thing?  I miss the fuzz.</p><p>
    
    The two standout moments come with the leadoff track, ""In a Jar"", and ""Raisans"", both culled
    from <i>You're Living All Over Me</i>.  In these rare instances, the band really puts on a
    tight performance, with Mascis' guitar wailing masterfully, Barlow's creative basslines and
    Murph's insidious drumming proving the band's technique had advanced substantially over two
    years.  But sadly, nothing else jumps out, because ultimately, it's all much more interesting
    on the original albums.  If you still have those old records, just play them instead of going
    out of your way for this one. And if that doesn't satisfy you, I still have that two-disc
    Sinatra tribute.</p></div>"|2323.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2323-in-session/|5.5|Chip Chanko

    I was undone the first time I heard it.  The music on that disc seemed to alternate capriciously
    between the sound of conspiracy and the sound of accident.  In certain moments, <i>Millions Now
    Living</i> actually sounded millions of years in the making: the layers had happened upon each
    other in an accidental intimacy in the manner of continents.  So when Tortoise's <i>TNT</i>
    failed to produce this uncanny preordained sense of absolute rightness, people turned on it
    somewhat, overlooking its facile loveliness.</p><p>
    
    Savath &amp; Savalas' hokey-titled <i>Folk Songs for Trains, Trees and Honey</i> is electronic
    Chicago post-rock in the vein of <i>TNT</i>.  It's easy ambient, not quite as terrestrially
    expansive as, say, Global Communications' <i>76:14</i> or astronomically warped as <i>The Orb's
    Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld</i>.  The music is truly beautiful, the groove is faithful
    and the effects enchant without alienating.  The whole project has a massage-chair energy,
    purring constantly under the backside of the mind.  What you get with the vibrating massage
    chair is consistency; what you sacrifice is the awkward and often vague sexuality of a human
    massage.  There's no jeopardy in <i>Folk Songs</i>: you don't risk losing your mind, but you
    don't chance falling in love.</p><p>
    
    Socrates points it out in Plato's <i>Symposium</i>: Love is temporal.  What we love passionately
    today we love all the more passionately because there's always the possibility that the object
    of our affections will not be there tomorrow.  But the pleasant grooving sway of <i>Folk Songs
    for Trains, Trees and Honey</i> will always be there, right where you left it when your mind and
    ears wandered off.  This is not to disparage the subtlety of Savath &amp; Savalas' craft, because
    the pleasantry is textured and self-effacing by design.  But it fails to terrify.  You never get
    the sense that you must listen to a particular moment because the entire record exists on the
    verge of being undone.  Just the opposite, actually-- this is ambient true to Brian Eno's
    intentions: sonic wallpaper, perfected in disappearance.  Like a stick of incense, Savath &amp;
    Savalas' music will continue to perfume the environment long after you have ceased to pay
    attention to the source.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, <i>Folk Songs for Trains, Trees and Honey</i> just barely breaks the 30-minute
    mark.  Great ambient needs time to erase itself, to nuzzle itself in the quiet of an ordinary
    room, unobtrusive as passing traffic and street-level exchanges, or footfall overhead.  But
    the album is nevertheless a fine if somewhat innocuous debut, and it'll sketch and slip about
    the sonic periphery with almost feline equipoise. No more bad dreams. It's easy like Sunday
    morning.</p></div>"|7007.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7007-folk-songs-for-trains-trees-and-honey/|7.0|Brent S. Sirota

    stink.""  Alas, I must now waste time and brain coming up with approximately 600
    words justifying the sub-1.0 rating above.  Certainly this is more time than the
    Promise Ring spent writing these four songs.  And this is not speculation.  It
    takes approximately 0.7 seconds to conceptualize these songs, because they've
    already been written 0.7 x 10^7 times-- this year.</p><p>
    
    On the opening title track, Davey von Bohlen hisses and spits up, ""I live on a
    small street/ With very small shoes/ But in a big house/ With a big wardrobe,""
    over a bassline lifted from the Pixies' ""Where Is My Mind?""  Then-- get this-- a
    slow C-G power riff comes in!  For those unfamiliar with chords, this basic fifth
    is essentially the progression of just about 78% of all pop songs ever written.
    This continual dumbing down of rock music must stop.  It's insulting that the
    Promise Ring would even try to pass this off as original songwriting.  Right
    now, 13 year-olds in basements are figuring out the very same song on their own
    with clumsy pubescent fingers, thanks to some downloaded Blink 182 tabs.
    ""Strictly Television,"" the second track, bops along on little more than a C
    chord.  Squirt some absurd poetry on top through the lispy lips of a white guy
    who couldn't carry a tune in a wheelbarrow and, yay, it's the Promise Ring!
    Yay!</p><p>
    
    Mike Patton recently released a CD by the Kids of Widney High on his Ipecac label.
    This shameless album showcases the songwriting of 'special' kids from Widney High.
    Frighteningly, these children with Down's Syndrome craft better pop than the
    Promise Ring.  In fact, the parallels are remarkable.  If I asked you which of
    the two groups wrote the songs ""Pretty Girls,"" ""Doctor Doctor,"" and ""Every
    Girl's My Girlfriend,"" which would you say?  If you guessed the Promise Ring for
    any of those, the joke's on TPR.  Even with the crushing guilt of cruel
    exploitation hovering over my head, I'd listen to the Widney kids before the
    Promise Ring.  I enjoy the better singing.</p><p>
    
    ""American Girl"" (see?!) drops back into predicable acoustic balladry as Davey
    rattles, ""American girl/ Queen radio/ Plays hours low/ Fills the spaces we know/
    And time is tight/ But not tonight."" Why does a band that blatantly yearns for
    the mainstream with below-basic structures and simple rhyme schemes try to
    alienate with slop lyrics and wounded pig vocals?  Is this their tether to the
    'underground?'  Oh I see, it's art because it's unlistenable.  But I don't think
    doctors on ""ER"" will be singing this to cancer patients in upcoming episodes.
    As much as they want to hit rock radio and the soundtracks to Joshua Jackson
    flicks, the Promise Ring will simply never get past the excruciating vocals.
    For further spoil, the Pringle boys will not get to savor intended irony as
    their new song ""Make Me a Mix Tape"" will not actually show up on anyone's mix
    tape.  Ah, who am I kidding?  Some kid with Hobbit hair is dubbing it right now
    for a girl in Delia's garments.  This same fellow will soon take a break from
    analog romance to scribe some hatemail to me.  I have prepared a generic response
    in anticipation.  You may save yourself the effort and paste the following into
    an e-mail to yourself:</p><p>
    
    ""Anything, <i>anything</i>, is more important than this record.  This vitriol
    and venom comes from severe disappointment, not bitterness.  Is this the best
    independent music has to offer?  If indie rock has come to slowed-down,
    pillowfight pop-punk, punch me out.  Attached you will find a list of 457 bands
    I recommend over this release.  If you're such a fan, you're welcome to change
    your name to 'Electric Pink,' open up a weblog titled Electricpink.org, and

Let's face it: when you
    pick up a record by a band with cover art like this, and a name like Hot Snakes, you have a
    pretty good idea what you're getting yourself into.  <i>Automatic Midnight</i> is no feast for
    the eyes.  And judging by those first couple of sentences, this review's nothing special,
    either.  To do justice to Hot Snakes, though, it's got to do its job predictably-- and do
    it predictably well.</p><p>
    
    This particular breed of Hot Snake could hardly come from a better line of descent.  John Reis
    and Rick Fork (aka Speedo and Eric Froeberg, respectively) are the boys that brought you Rocket
    from the Crypt and Drive Like Jehu, and drummer Jason Kourkounis of The Delta 72 adds a percussive
    x-factor to the proceedings.  These three mesh like well-worn gears, dousing the machines of their
    history with fresh oil.</p><p>
    
    Hot Snakes commit a revival, and one not too conceptually distant from the Credence Clearwater
    camp.  These guys refuse to be anything but what they are.  The opener, ""If Credit's What
    Matters I'll Take Credit"", betrays a bit of Fork's Fogarty leanings.  Where Reis once tied
    his CCR to vintage-sounding roots-rock perfection and took all the blame and fame, Hot Snakes
    confidently delve deep into the proven past of Rocket from the Crypt and Drive Like Jehu,
    certain they'll turn up gold.  ""I'll Take Credit"" showcases Fork's signature falsetto bawl; his
    unintelligible exhortations achieve meaning through sheer ferocity.  The drums may ache more
    than Fork's throat at the end of this one.</p><p>
    
    ""No Hands"" crunchingly juxtaposes Jehu-styled guitar arithmetic with Kourkounis' metronomic
    devastation; his simple power derives from the Russell Simins school of might over matter.  By
    this point in the record, it's clear that the mathy time-keeping of Drive's Mark Trombino have
    succumbed to a less kind, less gentle momentum.  Kourkounis manages to come off more rock, more
    real, and somehow more America.  ""Salton City"" speaks of Fork's ""civic duty"" and that he's
    ""read up on Bergen/ Belsen,"" just before a distant female yells, ""Give us a kiss,"" a call
    echoed in some vague '60s bubblegum pop classic.</p><p>
    
    Cleverly buried Americanisms litter <i>Automatic Midnight</i> throughout.  ""Apartment 0,"" heavy
    on toms, less so on direction, wants badly to recall instrumental surf-punk.  Instead, it lurks
    the San Diego shore in shark-like search of a fallen surfer.  A similar pound on ""Our Work Fills
    the Pews"" introduces a lyric/retort sermon, preaching the kind of swagger that's kept Royal
    Trux's collection plate full for so long.</p><p>
    
    In the end, <i>Automatic Midnight</i> makes you want to drive a littler faster down a potholed
    road, turn the stereo up a notch higher than usual, and nod minutely at anyone annoyed by your
    raucous passing.  The smashing of the millennial barrier hasn't broken anything in Reis and
    Fork's model for San Diegan dominance.  And what ain't broke, Hot Snakes ain't fixin' here.</p></div>"|3931.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3931-automatic-midnight/|7.6|Judson Picco

    mountain. At night the villagers used to hear her baying at the moon. Alas, the impassioned
    Sleater-Kinney frontwoman has left her banshee goat of a wail up to pasture on the craggy
    cliffs. <i>All Hands on the Bad One</i> finds the Northwest power-trio at their most melodic,
    playful, sarcastic, and punchy. Occasionally the spirit of the goat god still springs from
    Tucker's belly, but these screams follow baiting pop harmonies. Besides, when <i>Rolling
    Stone</i> uses the words ""brilliant"" and ""fury"" in the latest glowing Britney Spears review,
    Corin's outbursts feel positively baptismal.</p><p>
    
    Sleater-Kinney and Fugazi reside alone in the top echelon of American punk rock. They make
    darling twins. Both bands continue to grow in talent, despite the jaded whines of old schoolers.
    Both feature dueling guitars that bobble complex, inventive lines like ping-pong paddles. (And
    Sleater-Kinney don't even need a bassist to lock the groove.) Both can raise the hair on the
    back of your neck, the ass out your seat, and the volume on your stereo. Most importantly, both
    hold a mirror up to the face of themselves, their scene, and society in general. You better
    believe that ""And for all the ladies out there I wish/ We could write more than the next/
    Marketing bid/ Culture is what we make it/ Now is the time to invent!"" is the ""We owe you
    nothing/ You have no control!"" of 2000. Now that the smoke has blown away after the media
    exploitation of the riot grrl scene, the true believers remain behind-- not working PR for
    emo bands.</p><p>
    
    But preaching has its limits. After all, a band can't write a song called ""You're No Rock n'
    Roll Fun,"" and load it with lyrics such as, ""Like a piece of art/ That no one can touch/ Your
    head is always up/ In the clouds/ Writing your songs/ Won't you ever come down,"" without
    actually having some fun. The album opens with the proposition of ""Eye cream and thigh cream/
    How 'bout a get-high cream"" before shouting ""but I gotta rock!"" and bursting into oo-waah's and
    handclaps. ""Milkshake n' Honey"" spits wit at expatriates in Paris as Corin rolls her eyes at
    the type of denizens in <i>The Sun Also Rises</i>. Acting the roll of the insolent daughter,
    Tucker exclaims, ""Daddy says I got my mama's mouth/ I'm all about a forked tongue and a dirty
    house.""</p><p>
    
    But this isn't poetry! More than ever, S-K put four to the floor and hammer away on infectious
    riffs. A brash return to vigor after the mellower <i>The Hot Rock</i>, <i>All Hands</i> will
    win over new ears who previously found the sound too sky high, loose, and angular. Like a David
    Mamet character rewrite over a Joel Schumacher script, Corin reveals greater character depth
    than ever before. <i>All Hands on the Bad One</i> finds Sleater-Kinney at their most
    fist-pumping (on the title track), lovely (""Leave You Behind""), longing (""The Swimmer""), and
    bratty (""The Professional""). Janet Weiss hammers harder, Carrie Brownstein smothers with perfect
    harmonies while digging deeper on the E string, and Corin grabs your aorta and strokes. When
    Sleater-Kinney, the band with the busiest guitar lines and boldest voice, turn in their best
    effort yet, it demands your attention.</p></div>"|7239.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7239-all-hands-on-the-bad-one/|8.3|Brent DiCrescenzo

    I admit without qualm that it began for me with <i>Animals</i>. My brother was in college, and one day I went through his records and listened to the ones with the coolest covers. <i>Animals</i> fascinated me then as it still fascinates me today. It is the acute anthropomorphic fantasy, possessing a timeless quality that has thrust it into the category of ""classic,"" though it may remain forever in the shadow of its more commercially successful older brother, <i>Dark Side Of The Moon</i>. Consisting of three tracks each longer than ten minutes and two tracks under two minutes, <i>Animals</i> is not for the attention- span- deficient. However, within this impenetrable fortress of radio- unfriendly tracks, we hear Dave Gilmour's guitars at their absolute best, get a full-on dose of Roger Waters' powerful lyrical imagery, and are presented with the worst elements of our own humanity- packaged in the skins of ""Sheep,"" ""Dogs"" and ""Pigs (Three Different Ones)"". For those weaned on <i>The Wall</i> and <i>Dark Side</i>, you'll find <i>Animals</i> to be a whole new bag of feed. Where Floyd's two most recognizable albums made their mark with operatic aggression and fear, <i>Animals</i> deals in dirt- under- the- fingernails reality, the common smallness that simultaneously binds and repels us all. ""Dogs,"" a 17-minute study in the commonest of all faults, lazily dispenses bite after venomous bite into the desires that drive us to seize the fast buck and screw anyone that gets in our way:</p><p>
<i>You have to be trusted by the people that you lie to,<br/>
    So that when they turn their backs on you,<br/>
    You'll get the chance to put the knife in.</i></p><p>
    
    All this wrapped up in the flaky coating of two hauntingly similar and musically identical tracks casting opposite views of cynicism and hope on the proceedings. <i>Animals</i> is like George Orwell's <i>Animal Farm</i> run through a full- audio acid test- spectacular in every aspect and now in full color. </p><p>

    Professor:  The basic crutch of the critic is simple comparison.  It is uninspired, yet
    inevitable.  The easiest way to describe band B [The Professor scribbles ""B"" on an overhead 
    projector] is to compare Z to bands X and Y [""Y"" and ""X"" are similarly scrawled].  Now, the
    juxtaposition of X and Y are an immediate indication to the quality of band B.  Now, let's 
    assume the difference between bands X and Y-- whether it be through genre or quality or time or
    geography-- is D.  Graphing /D/ with the X axis being D and the Y axis being the resulting
    rating, or opinion, of the critic, what you have is a typical parabola.  [The Professor

    difference between X and Y, increases, so, too, does the critic's love or hate of the record
    increase...</p><p>
    
    Boy: So, wait, Professor...</p><p>
    
    Professor:  Yes?</p><p>
    
    Boy:  So, like, the bands X and Y, are they like the x and y axis of the graph?</p><p>
    
    Professor:  No, I just coincidentally happened to name the variable bands ""X"" and ""Y.""</p><p>
    
    Boy:  Oh, so it's the 20th century punk band from California, X, and the '40s one-hit wonder,
    Y, who had that big song, like, ""Y U B Treatin' Me B. A. D.?""  You're comparing those two
    bands?</p><p>
    
    Professor: No, it's not that either.  They're just variables.  But it could, conceivably be
    those bands.  Now, please, if I may continue I can clear this up.  For example, let's say
    you're reviewing the new record by the Wickets.  Now if you write that the Wickets sound like 
    a cross between Sepultura and Joan Armatrading, the reader infers that album is either very
    good or very bad.  Other examples would be, say, a cross between Kanda Bongo Man and Uriah
    Heep.  This is how you express a band's originality through juxtaposition.  Conversely, saying
    band B sounds like a cross between NOFX and Blink 182 isn't an endorsement.  Even when press
    kits say ""sounds like a cross between the Beach Boys and Beatles,"" it's typically a dead ringer
    for some rancid indie pop.  Now...</p><p>
    
    Girl:  Professor Wisdom?  What happens if two bands actually do come together to form a new
    band?</p><p>
    
    Professor:  Hmm, an interesting hypothesis, but of little concern.  Such things do not happen.</p><p>
    
    Girl:  Actually, Professor, I was digging through the archive in the library and I found a
    review by DiCrescenzo...</p><p>
    
    Class: ...  [A reverent moment of silence.]</p><p>
    
    Girl: ...dating from 2000.  It's an album by Macha and Bedhead.  A collaboration.</p><p>
    
    Professor:  Interesting.  What did he have to say?</p><p>
    
    Girl:  He said it sounded ""like a cross between Macha and Bedhead.""</p><p>
    
    Professor:  Hmm.  A rather unmotivated moment in his career.</p><p>
    
    Girl:  Quite.  It's not even ironic.  Anyway, he says tracks two and three-- ""Never Underdose""
    and ""You and New Plastic""-- sound more like Bedhead where as tracks 1 and 4-- ""Hey Goodbye"" and
    ""Only the Bodies Survive""-- the album's best, borrow more from Macha's work. The last track is 
    a Cher cover.  ""'Hey Goodbye' sounds like a cross between Radiohead and Indonesian shoegazer,""
    an obvious positive remark according to your system.  Indonesian shoegazer doesn't even exist.
    And the obligatory Radiohead reference, although overused, makes sense.</p><p>
    
    ""Floods of zither and dulcimer rush up in the choruses,"" he continues.  ""Yet the exotic
    instruments are used more as enriching texture.  On Macha's solo releases, the Indonesian din
    wafts third world ambiance as if guitar necks, dulcimer hammer, and drumsticks were slowly
    burning incense sticks.  Yet, mulched upon Bedhead's sandman strumming, the effect is more
    ambiguously alien-- disconnected from images of eight-armed gods, woven rugs, and brass
    merchants.  'Sesame Street' writers and puppets weep as co-operation peaks in efficiency.
    Bedhead's beauty breathes more bizarrely, while Macha's fog slows to intoxicating speeds.  Both
    groups operate in the ethereal realm, and as music approaches its gaseous state, bonding becomes
    accelerated.""</p><p>
    
    Professor:  That presents a completely different scenario.  I was assuming this on a solid
    state.  Ah, yes, but how different were Macha and Bedhead?  How big is D?  Little insight can
    be spilled on our dilemma without knowing this difference. </p><p>
    
    Boy:  I believe it was 24 decibels.</p><p>
    
    Professor:  A-ha.  Therefore, we'll plug that into our equation, and we get... 7.9.  The system
    is perfect.</p></div>"|5018.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5018-bedhead-loved-macha-ep/|7.9|Brent DiCrescenzo

    The clock approaches midnight as the players prepare for the concert. The curtain
    rises; a roaring noise is heard from the stage. Suddenly, the noise stops, as the
    club fills with smoke. A crowd of well-dressed men and women have gathered for the
    ceremony. The singer screams out to the audience and the band begins to play.</p><p>
    If you can get past this ridiculous monologue which opens the Makers' <i>Rock Star
    God</i> without cringing or laughing, then good for you-- you're ready to rock.
    Sadly, the band isn't.  The track that immediately follows ""Intro (Ladies and
    Gentlemen)"" is not the blistering anthem that the introduction longs to prime
    the listener for. ""Star Power"" opens with undistorted guitar, cello, and-- of all
    things-- piano. For a brief moment, it appears promising, an unexpected moment
    that actually sounds pretty good.  But soon, the song devolves into limp <i>Rocky
    Horror Picture Show</i> revivalism.  This doesn't look promising.</p><p>
    What's in a name?  Well, when it comes to stage names, a large degree of 
    significance can be imbued to a moniker. When the Makers started out, the 
    members took Maker as their respective surnames, a la the Ramones (or, more
    recently, the Donnas).  And it made sense, playing simplistic garage rock,
    clad in black leather and sunglasses.  Then, on 1998's <i>Psychopathia Sexualis</i>,
    the Makers adopted goofy names like Michael Machine and Jay Amerika to fit their
    new glam image.  But the rebirth of glam had come and gone with the art-house
    disaster <i>Velvet Goldmine</i>.  And that these guys were merely no-name indie
    rockers attempting arena antics instantly rendered their gimmick ridiculous.  Now,
    with <i>Rock Star God</i>, the Makers take an overt stab at authenticity by-- for
    the first time in their history-- embracing their real names.</p><p>
    Clocking in at nearly an hour with 16 tracks, <i>Rock Star God</i> simply begs 
    to be described as ""epic,"" but comes nowhere near such a venerating adjective.
    It's one of those albums with liner notes boasting all kinds of auxiliary
    instruments; clarinet, marimba, timpani, harmonica.  Yet, when you actually listen
    to the record, these additional textures scarcely show themselves. The bulk of the
    tracks feature straightforward acoustic guitars and plinking piano, and everything
    else gets buried in the mix (although ""I'm a Concrete Wall"" does sport some nice
    junkyard percussion sounds).</p><p>
    The problem with a band like the Makers is that they think that variety and
    versatility come from aping several different bands instead of just one. Their
    opening chords make each influence instantly recognizable: plenty of T. Rex
    and Stones, plus the occasional touch of the Who and Big Star, just as plainly
    and unimaginatively as the press material dictates. The thing is, it's still
    evident that the Makers have talent and prowess on their side, and possibly even
    some untouched creativity.  Someday, they may abondon their clichés, backup singers,
    sunglasses, and pouty poses, and manage to make something moderately compelling and
    original. But I wouldn't count on it.</p></div>"|5056.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5056-rock-star-god/|3.8|Al Shipley

    the discs into two piles: one marked ""sooner"" and the other marked ""later."" The more straightforward rock discs
    usually get marked ""sooner."" And in general, the first impressions of these albums don't lie-- after about 4-6
    listens, I've pretty much made up my mind. Jazzy, electronic, and ambient discs often get marked ""later"" because
    they're generally more difficult to evaluate.  It can sometimes take a few good weeks of listening to distill all
    the musical complexities into a two-digit rating.</p><p>
    Jazz pianist Matthew Shipp's latest, <i>Pastoral Composure</i>, easily secured itself a place in the ""later"" pile.
    I was expecting the album to be typical of today's avant-jazz scene: rewarding, yet difficult to decipher.  But as
    Shipp, horn player Roy Campbell, bassist William Parker, and drummer Gerald Cleaver made their way through seven of
    Shipp's originals and two covers, my excitement grew. This, folks, is everything a jazz record should be. It's
    remarkably complex and musically proficient, yet instantly accessible, and a keeper in every respect.</p><p>
<i>Pastoral Composure</i> seamlessly blurs the line between traditional and avant-jazz. On his cover of ""Prelude to
    a Kiss,"" Shipp alternates between a smooth rendition of the Ellington classic and violent, claustrophobic bursts of
    atonal piano. In doing so, Shipp manages to combine the expressiveness of avant-jazz's hyper-emotional blasts with
    the melodic sense of classic jazz. The benefits of this fusion come through equally clearly in the quartet's schizophrenic
    take on ""Frère Jaques,"" which frequently breaks down into blasts of orgasmic horns, plunking bass, and thumping piano.
    Undoubtedly, all four members of this quartet are amazingly proficient players. But even when a song collapses into a
    more improvisational bit, there's always just enough structure to hold the piece together.</p><p>
    Thirsty Ear released <i>Pastoral Composure</i> as part of their ""Blue Series,"" a procession of recordings designed to
    ""[Marry] jazz's many languages... in a way that will hopefully challenge, probe, excite, and perhaps even anger
    listeners."" While this is perhaps an overly bombastic statement, Shipp has, remarkably, come awfully close to pulling
    it off. That Shipp manages to walk the line between intensity and dissonance without sacrificing the accessibility of
    the music is an even greater achievement.</p><p>
<i>Pastoral Composure</i> plays out like a well-written history of jazz. Traces of everything from Duke Ellington to
    Miles Davis to more recent jazz innovators like Peter Brotzmann and Evan Parker echo throughout. And the fact that
    the album will only cost you a measly $11.19-- a good $38.81 less than <i>The New Grove History of Jazz</i>-- is an
    added bonus.</p></div>"|7115.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7115-pastoral-composure/|8.6|Matt LeMay

If a band merely fills the studio
    molds with too-perfect clarity, fans want for the lack of stage improv. If the band jams on the
    closing riff for six minutes, the fans yawn. So what's the perfect balance of fiddling and
    play-by-numbers? If you've ever exclaimed, ""Man, the guitarist adds a little vibrato to the
    one note in the hook! And the riff has this little extra stutter,"" ask yourself why this really
    matters. Do five subtle changes really warrant praise? And if it's freeform re-interpretation
    you want, go like Phish.</i></p><p>
    
    The above sentiments appeared verbatim in my review of Sunny Day Real Estate's <i>Live</i>. You
    can argue that I'm lazy, or that I'm filling a contractual obligation to the Editor, or that
    I'm pleasing more of my diehard fans by re-offering some classic prose riffs. The truth is,
    that's how I view live albums. Well, actually, I'd like to improv on that paragraph a bit. You 
    can't spell ""improve"" without ""improv."" Oh dear, that was unfunny, unnecessary banter. But I'm
    dictating this review live.</p><p>
    
    Built to Spill's live album, aside from its uninspired title, restores purpose and value in the
    format.  Primarily because Built to Spill restore purpose and invention to the guitar.  On their
    1997 album, <i>Perfect from Now On</i>, Built to Spill's slave fingers stacked slabs of reverb
    and bricks of glitter-dipped notes into a Record of Babel under the whipping brilliance of Doug
    Martsch's mind. <i>Keep It Like a Secret</i> chopped up the anthemic architecture into more
    livable suburban models. While other bands like Radiohead and Sunny Day Real Estate carved
    majestic epics, nobody else truly used the sheer volume and sparkling colors of jacked amps.
    Built to Spill weld Television-esque interplay to the head-melting swirl of Spiritualized or
    Spacemen 3. That Martsch can turn such fireworks into acute hooks is genius.</p><p>
<i>Live</i> smartly pulls primarily from the two recent LPs. The universally held favorite, 
    ""Car,"" makes a welcome appearance-- the first live recording of the band's best song with their
    best line-up. Caustic Resin's Brett Nelson sprays vapor trails over half of the album, upping
    the fist-pumping factor to three behemoth guitars. These nine songs provide an idol for guitar
    fans who sicken at the sound of dancing solos.  This is slow motion synchronized gymnastics,
    not a tap recital. Doug Martsch worships the guitar. He was born to play 19 minute scorches.
    <i>There's Nothing Wrong with Love</i> seems plainly cute in hindsight. Other Northwest bands
    scratch the itch for high-pitched pop nuggets-- Quasi and Elliott Smith will serve you. Built
    to Spill, and especially their live album, are for people who want to air windmill, air-strum,
    air-riff, air-solo, and air-drum without the guilt of actually listening to classic rock.</p></div>"|1013.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1013-live/|7.6|Brent DiCrescenzo

    a bit of a disappointment.  And in a way, I guess it is: after the sonic
    barrage of their first album, its two successors may seem a bit dry.  In
    fact, by some standards, Laika have gone downhill not just since their
    first album, but since the first 20 seconds of their first album, which
    were arguably 20 of the most exciting seconds electronic music produced
    in the 1990s.  Consider, for example, the generally shoddy treatment
    Stereolab has recieved from hipsters regarding their post-<i>Emperor
    Tomato Ketchup</i> LPs.</p><p>
    
    The thing of it is, see, that the phenomenon known as electronic music--
    half music and three halves public relations-- has always set itself up
    as The Future.  The Future, of course, is always one step ahead, and this
    has led to the development of a freakishly malproportioned set of criteria
    by which electronic music is to be judged: one which values innovation
    above all other things.  Constantly striving to push the envelope (in
    order to push the product, naturally), electronic music plunges blindly
    ahead into what so many fawning reviews refer to as ""uncharted territory.""
    This is all fine and good, except for one thing: left behind in the
    neverending move forward lie vast expanses of half, sorta and barely
    charted territory.</p><p>
    
    Few blues singers are criticized for lack of innovation-- they're instead
    evaluated on their musicianship, songwriting and knowledge of their craft.
    Meanwhile, electronic music's mainstream has been largely unable to value
    itself as a tradition to the extent that artists are allowed to explore the
    nooks and crannies of their own genre.  When an album like <i>Good Looking
    Blues</i> is released-- one that moves towards accessibility-- the general
    reaction tends towards dismissals of the ""I've heard this before"" or ""Nothing
    new here"" variety.</p><p>
    
    Admittedly, <i>Good Looking Blues</i> doesn't seem like much at first--
    pretty run-of-the-mill trip-hoppy shit: some loops here, some scratching
    there, a dash of hip-hop for flavor, shrinkwrap it and call it a day.
    Certainly, it's nothing like the grinding and irresistible <i>Silver Apples
    of the Moon</i>.  But as bands like Stereolab have proven, a sheen of
    accessibility can conceal a wealth of texture, and <i>Good Looking Blues</i>
    more than makes up for its lack of originality with plenty of detail and
    craft.</p><p>
    
    While generally more song-oriented than previous outings, <i>Good Looking
    Blues</i> is built on a foundation of acid-jazzy, polyrythmic beats-- the
    kind that just seem to shuffle along until you pay attention to them, at
    which point they prove to be more layered than Barthes' S/Z. Organic
    texture is provided throughout by such unhip instruments as the bass
    clarinet, the trumpet and the flute.  Margaret Fiedler's vocals are much
    further up in the mix than on past releases.  This is a welcome thing for
    the most part, though at points you may wish you could gloss over the
    lyrics: the opening ""Black Cat Bone"" in particular, whose stilted rap is
    basically Blondie's ""Rapture"" updated for the new millenium.</p><p>
    
    Still, <i>Good Looking Blues</i> shows a Laika that has learned from its past
    mistakes-- they don't get lost in their own loops like they used to-- and
    willing to stretch out and explore their surroundings.  I'd gladly see
    electronic music lose its innovation if it meant more music like this album's
    creepily sublime title track or the quiet Reichian beauty of ""A Single Word.""
    Of course, the hipsters would never stand for it.</p></div>"|4641.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4641-good-looking-blues/|7.5|Zach Hooker

    The above sentiments appeared verbatim in Brent DiCrescenzo's review of
    Built to Spill's <i>Live</i>. They also appeared in his review of Sunny Day
    Real Estate's <i>Live</i>. Now I'm using them for my own purposes because
    this Posies album is also live and he used it twice so it must mean something.
    This record's not called <i>Live</i>, though. I bet you gathered that from the
    information up there at the top. Did you? If you did, then you also saw that
    it says stuff about icebergs and being alive. Yeah, this is a postmortem 
    release capturing the Posies at what they consider to be their greatest moment
    before sinking (and resurfacing in places like Big Star, Sunny Day Real Estate
    and Fountains of Wayne).</p><p>
<i>Alive Before the Iceberg</i> was recorded in Barcelona on a July night in
    1998. Judging from guitarist Ken Stringfellow's liner notes, the Posies seemed
    to, uh, like playing in Spain. From what I gather (actually, he spells it out
    in lurid detail) they drank a lot, passed out a lot, woke up not knowing where
    they were a lot, and Fucking Rocked a lot. <i>The Posies</i> did this? But they
    do such nice harmonies! My mom likes them! (She doesn't really, but I bet she
    would). They fucking rocked?!</p><p>
    
    They did. And maybe that's their point with this release: ""Listen up people, we
    fucking rocked! It's all right there. Listen you assholes!"" Jon Auer and Ken
    Stringfellow's harmonies are belted out like they're playing Giants' Stadium 
    without mics as they try to stay in tune and presumably, stay standing. The
    guitar is all over the place while keeping to the confines of each song. There's
    no unnecessary soloing on the tracks, which combine songs from the band's last
    three albums and a gut-punching cover of Cheap Trick's ""Surrender.""</p><p>
    
    Recorded before the release of <i>Success</i>, it ""premiers"" songs from that
    album; the perfect opener (here and on <i>Success</i>), ""Somehow Everything,""
    the cyclic guitar triplets of ""Start a Life,"" and the mesmerizing grandfather
    clock harmonies on ""You're the Beautiful One"" are captured in a previously
    undocumented state. <i>Iceberg</i> pulls mostly from the Posies' 1996 album,
    <i>Amazing Disgrace</i>, with a light-speed rendition of ""Grant Hart"" splitting
    the set in two and leading straight into an equally energized ""Flavour of the
    Month.""</p><p>
<i>Iceberg</i>'s track listing largely serves as a selection of some of the
    band's better lesser-known songs (despite the inclusion of their restrained hit
    ""Dream all Day"") and as a sign of the Posies' impending destruction. Before the
    chain-gang staccato guitars of ""Broken Record,"" Auer announces, ""Maybe you can 
    get off the damn dance floor for this one."" I can just picture a crowd in front 
    of the stage taking that as an invitation to pound a giant crater into the floor.
    I think that's what he pictured, too. The band knew exactly what they were doing,
    even then.  They knew they were close to the end and that's what they captured
    here.</p><p>
<i>Alive Before the Iceberg</i> is the Posies summing up their career up with 12
    songs played half-drunk in front of a crowd of Spaniards who probably didn't know
    that a posie is a bunch of flowers. It didn't matter. What mattered to them was
    the moment-- the energy of a band wound so tight they would explode later that
    year. They didn't care about freeform re-interpretation here, and I didn't either.
    If that's what I want, I'll go see Phish next month at Radio City Music Hall.</p></div>"|6428.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6428-alive-before-the-iceberg/|7.9|Chip Chanko

    dearth of coverage the main media outlets allotted to the events.  If you
    paid attention to the little that was aired, or if you sought the news out
    elsewhere, you would have also noticed that just about everybody-- from
    indifferent Joe Blow on the street, to the international business titans in
    attendance, as well the ever-present morass of punditry-- <i>everybody</i>
    was able to arrive at a happy accord on one point.  Namely, that the amorphous
    thing vaguely referred to as ""the radical left"" is too directionless,
    clamorous, adolescent, and by implication, idealistic to ever succeed in
    communicating a unified agenda. The same basic critique is consistently lobbed
    at the academic radical left, for more or less the same reason: it isn't
    possible to reconcile and combine so many different voices of dissent into
    one philosophically tenable stance.</p><p>
    
    You could make a strong case, if you were a heartless and cynical bastard,
    that the Nation of Ulysses is founded on that very argument, and that their
    entire body of work is a merciless satire on those million voices of dissent.
    It wouldn't be a difficult stretch. A tour of the inserts from their first two
    full length albums, <i>Plays Pretty for Baby</i> and <i>13-Point Program to
    Destroy America</i>, is a dizzying, and often hysterically funny tour through
    a semiotic cyclone of influences and signs that are only loosely bound by the
    theme of resistance.</p><p>
    
    First, the eye candy. The Nation of Ulysses' beautifully designed graphics pay
    direct homage to the poster design and photomontage of Stalin-commissioned
    artist Alexander Rodchenko and his wife Stepanovna. The design and iconography
    of '50s/'60s America also figure heavily, with pictures of post-War appliances
    and the mail-order back section of a <i>Boys' Life</i> magazine.</p><p>
    
    But as sharply executed as the visuals are, it's in the accompanying texts
    that the group's performance really shines, and the Nation takes shape.
    References to worldwide anti-imperialist, anti-colonialist, and anti-capitalist
    resistances are everywhere-- among the groups the band alludes and claims
    brotherhood to are the Maoist Shining Path from Peru, the New People's Army of
    the Philippines, Islamic Jihad, and Lebanon's Hezbollah. What would a righteous
    revolution be without a divine mandate?</p><p>
    
    Don't worry, there's plenty of religion here, too, from the man who would go
    on to gospel yeah-yeah. To complement the schizoid-preacher's delivery of
    frontman Ian Svenonius (who adopts El Gato as his saucy nom de guerre), the
    CD librettos invoke the idea of religious ecstasy through privation, urging
    Nationals to stave off sleep by whatever means. Never ones to eschew paradox,
    though, they turn right around and proclaim their vampirism.</p><p>
    
    The general tableau here is, of course, a depiction of destruction as a means
    to creation and reinvention. In one of the band's funnier moments, they shower
    praise on Menudo for its built-in mechanism of eternal youth, and in an
    extravagant gesture of self-preservation, declare their own ages fixed at a
    perpetual 18.</p><p>
    
    Mining the schematics of German expressionism, the tanned, acne-free skin
    and robust health of the masses are frowned upon as symptoms of moral decay
    and stupidity. And so, to ensure healthy moral rectitude, a cosa nostra-style
    code of conduct is strictly enforced (""A kid who tells on another kid's a
    dead kid""). Because the individual is posited as a capitalist metaphor, the
    Nation of Ulysses requires that everyone be Nationalized, wear dapper
    Fashionista uniforms, and undergo a procedure for fingerprint effacement.</p><p>
    
    Holding the destruction of everything corrupt as their end goal, even the
    Norse Armageddon myth of Ragnarok is used as a way to prefigure the final
    showdown between the Nation (""of Ulysses must prevail!"") and the consumerist
    bloat of our sleepwalking philistine Society. For added effect, this entire
    mess is heavily soaked with the language of espionage, subterfuge, sabotage,
    paranoia, and overthrow.</p><p>
    
    But <i>is</i> this a satire on the Left?  Hilariously cruel as that would be,
    I prefer to think that, at least in the spirit of the venture, that's not the
    case. Judging from Svenonius' work in the Make-Up, and his writings outside of
    his music, their body of work seems relatively irony-free. And no, I would not
    like to buy a bridge from you, thanks.</p><p>
    
    So now you know why they ruled, and we can get on to why this one doesn't.</p><p>
<i>The Embassy Tapes</i>, as implied by its name, is a collection of four-track
    tape recordings captured during practices and performances at the rehearsal
    space lovingly referred to by the Nation of Ulysses as ""The Embassy."" Recorded
    in September of 1992, it finds the group at the end of its rope, mere weeks
    before dissolving. It's unfortunate that this will be seen as the coda to the
    Nation's short but bright-burning career. The truth is, this record just
    doesn't stand up to the rest of their work.</p><p>
    
    As always, the packaging and text are wonderful, but the music offers little
    to enjoy, aside from a couple of old favorites (alternate versions of
    ""Shakedown"" and ""P-Power,"" and ""Last Train to Cool""). From the most instantly
    quotable D.C. band ever (""Membership: as few as five, possibly hundreds""),
    and from the voice that performed one of the swiftest, most blasphemous, and
    brutal acts of musical patricide ever (""I'm not talking about a Beatles song,
    written a hundred years before I was born""), I would have hoped for something
    more from their last chapter. More violence, maybe.</p><p>
    
    Nevertheless, <i>The Embassy Tapes</i> is interesting in that it hints at what
    would have been had the Nation of Ulysses continued. ""Hex-Proof"" indicates the
    group may have veered off in a more controlled direction, losing the saxophone
    and reining in the guitar noise a little. Even flashes of rockabilly appear on
    tracks like ""R.O.T.T.E.N,"" ""Outline for Hangout,"" and ""Gimme Disaster.""  So,
    for the expatriate, this disc will no doubt be mandatory.  Those who missed
    the last train to cool back in the day are strongly advised to purchase the
    first two albums before taking this one on.</p></div>"|5716.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5716-the-embassy-tapes/|6.6|Camilo Arturo Leslie

    Viacom; Pope Denounces Gay Pride Parade; Gates and Drug Companies to Help Poor; Professors and Student in Thesis Clash;
    ""Brother"" Gears Up for Long Summer, and Marianne Faithfull Has Not Lost Her <i>Vagabond Ways</i>.</p><p>
    
    Well, obviously.  You don't star in films with sparse dialogue, such as Jack Cardiff's 1968 faux-porn disaster, <i>Girl
    on a Motorcycle</i>, and just up and lose your vagabond ways.  Nor do you console yourself by purchasing lots of satin Anello &amp; David shoes when the Sussex Police find you wrapped
    in nothing but a fur rug at Keith Richard's acid party-- only to lose your vagabond ways thirty years later.  But you might 
    reestablish yourself as a mainstream singer/songwriter by recording an adult-contemporary album on which you sound like an
    aging drag queen.</p><p>
    
    But what an aging drag queen! Faithfull's signature nicotine-scorched vocal chords can brand even the most banal lyrics
    with edgy texture and emotional impact.  Faithfull is in total control as her husky throat empties out delicately at the 
    end of each phrase, producing a quality that sounds like a little girl's voice put through the most extreme weathering
    imaginable.  Imagine Cyndi Lauper's thin, angular vocals in ""Time after Time"" after several decades of smoking two packs
    of Lucky Strikes a day.  Now wash it down with a Kurt Weill fascination and ample scotch: ""Then you say, go slow/ I fall 
    behind/ The second hand unwinds...""</p><p>
    
    But stop weeping-- Faithfull didn't record a version of ""Time after Time"" on <i>Vagabond Ways</i>.  Instead, she's resorted
    to attacking Leonard Cohen's ""Tower of Song"" and Roger Waters' previously unreleased ""Incarceration of a Flower Child.""
    Faithfull's at her current best on self-penned numbers like the catchy title track, but sadly, the quality of her writing
    misses the knowing tenor of her voice on ""Wilder Shores of Love"" and ""Marathon Kiss.""  The instrumental arrangements here
    are weak throughout, too, tossing in clunky string sections and dated keyboards.  The underwater synth-gun effect-- a sound
    that seems, miraculously, from both the '70s and the future-- is showcased in the Roger Waters number.  And not surprisingly,
    ""For Wanting You"" (which Elton John wrote specifically for Faithfull) and the spoken-word extravaganza, ""After the Ceasefire,""
    are both unbearable.</p><p>
    
    I'm guessing you'd have better judgment than to spend your money on <i>Vagabond Ways</i> without me having to tell you not
    to.  But the album is darker and grittier than most major-label adult-contemporary albums, so it might interest your
    parents-- if only to make them feel young and pure in comparison to Faithfull's thousand years.  At this point in her
    career, Faithfull's been down the road and back again, but she hasn't run out of things to say.  She's even developed
    a striking vehicle though which to say them, as her raspy voice seems to speak of the human experience with each syllable.
    You hardly notice the lyrics, and forgive her merely passable songwriting.  Faithfull, whose look at the times has resembled
    Meryl Streep, David Bowie, Jane Fonda, and Markie Post, now looks more like a mummified Courtney Love, and her songs
    certainly suggest she's ""lived through this.""</p></div>"|2959.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2959-vagabond-ways/|4.7|Kristin Sage Rockermann

I mean, really badly. He wants to be
    your unique, personal, do-it-yourself, enigmatic folk/pop singer/songwriter,
    and he'll do whatever it takes to get there.  He'll cover his album art with
    weird, tribal drawings he made himself. He'll play more than just guitar if
    you want, sometimes even harmonica.  He'll even experiment with different
    genres on a couple songs.  In his liner notes, Arthur cryptically refers to
    himself as ""benzo,"" and gives his supporting musicians equally puzzling
    aliases like ""darkstar"" and ""lovehammer."" He packs his lyrics with surrealist
    imagery that <i>could</i> pertain to traditional love or loss, but what he
    really wants is for you to ask: ""Is that actually what he means? Could it be
    deeper than this?""  Yet, as the album's final seconds tick to a close, the
    real question at hand ends up being: ""Does it matter?""</p><p>
    
    And the answer? Well, no. But you knew I was going to say that. On his
    second full-length, <i>Come to Where I'm From</i>, Arthur's self-imposed
    pseudo-enigma status is more easily discarded than decoded.  There are enough
    solid songwriting chops behind the facade to sustain him, and there's just as
    much-- if not more-- to be said for the production. T-Bone Burnett, Rick Will,
    and Arthur himself each take co-producer titles, and what results is a raw,
    endearing sound that blends each instrument perfectly while remaining crisp
    as a bell. It's some of the best production and mixing this side of Tchad
    Blake, who also happens to mix two of these songs, probably not all that
    coincidentally.</p><p>
    
    As already established, Joseph Arthur's at his strongest when his ambiguously
    mystical lyrics don't get in the way, and most of the time, they don't. In
    ""Invisible Hands,"" the line ""There are things we cannot know/ Invisible hands
    who guide the show/ From up above"" doesn't hold significance as a spiritual
    revelation, but rather, simply as a way to meld his vocals with the subdued
    and effective melody. The track's rhythmic base pulses as Arthur moans and
    hums through the track's five minutes while guitars, harmonicas, and subtle
    buzzes of feedback float in and out. It's this eerie tone, and not the prose
    contained within, that provides him with the mysterious atmosphere he's
    tried so desperately to achieve.</p><p>
    
    And then there are those times when the embittered victim in Arthur spills
    haphazardly onto his lyric sheet.  On ""Creation or a Stain,"" <i>Come to Where
    I'm From</i>'s most painful moment, he sort of, well, tries to rap about it.
    Actually, it isn't a rap as much as a failed Patti Smith impression. But
    whatever it is, Arthur manages an off-the-scale reading on the Rock Bottom
    lyricist detector: ""I'm a walking crucifixion/ I'm a fucked-up memory.""  Over
    the course of its trying four-minute length, the track condemns all corruption,
    and laments the beggars and starving people of the world.  And all this over
    the same two chords!</p><p>
    
    Better for Arthur to stick to what he knows best. His most substantial material
    doesn't go for the throat, the heart, or even the intellect, but the ears.
    ""Cockroach,"" one of <i>Where I'm From</i>'s standouts, is built solely on
    ambient street sounds, a folksy acoustic guitar progression, and a drumkit
    that sounds like it's made of rocks. It seems to recall memories-- possibly
    even <i>actual</i> memories-- of bygone days busking on urban street corners.
    The song is enhanced by the occasional delayed fuzz lead, supportive female
    backing vocals, and the subtle, haunting echo of Arthur's voice as he sings
    his heart out with every line.</p><p>
    
    So I suppose it's safe to let Joe into your home. He's pleasant enough, and
    moderately talented.  Plus, he's got quite a few nice tunes in his repertoire.
    But lay down some house rules first: make sure he sticks to his more musical
    material, don't ask him where he gets his lyrics, and never let him make you
    call him ""benzo."" It's not very becoming of him.</p></div>"|302.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/302-come-to-where-im-from/|7.4|Spencer Owen

    the Spinanes were a likable rock duo that invigorated the lively Northwest scene
    with alternately brooding and rollicking tunes.  Wedding Gates' lachrymose pop
    musings to Plouf's propulsive percussion, the band's most notable aspect was
    their ability to deliver a full-bodied sound with a limited palette of materials.
    This six-song assemblage of early recordings for Imp Records compiles the group's
    first couple of singles and hard-to-find tracks.  Truly, a release for only the
    most loyal of Spinanes fans.</p><p>
    
    The songs on this disc are presumably rare, but virtually indistinguishable in 
    execution from the rest of the Spinanes' body of work, with the exception, perhaps,
    of <i>Arches and Aisles</i>, the album Gates recorded with friends after Plouf left
    to become Built to Spill's permanent drummer.  The first two Spinanes albums, though,
    are better documents of what they had to offer.  The shambling singles tracks bear
    the blueprint of Gates' familiar vocal habits and failed-relationship wordplay.</p><p>
    
    It's telling that the most affecting song on <i>The Imp Years</i> comes with a
    cover-- ""Handful of Hearts"" manages to render the break-up of the duo somewhat
    touching.  The moment is fleeting, but it leads to ruminations on the death of
    ""indie"" as a self-sustaining, legitimizing force of amateurism and obscurity in
    music.  The listener is left with the sagging realization that the Spinanes came
    and went, and that neither their presence nor absence amounts to very much in the
    long run.</p><p>
    
    This realization, of course, necessitates qualification by the fans, those who
    at one point or another took a strong liking to the Spinanes and for whom this 
    will doubtless be a significant release.  The fact should be made plain that 
    retrospective releases for defunct indie bands such as this are hapless attempts
    at bringing together loose threads for threadbare audiences paralyzed by the
    notion that the time and energy invested in appreciating these bands have met
    with diminishing returns.  The ability of this release to spark interest in
    the Spinanes is undercut by the stylistic redundancy of their accomplished
    but ultimately standard take on the whole indie rock shtick.  Their catalog
    is a dead horse best left unbeaten.</p></div>"|7416.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7416-the-imp-years-ep/|5.9|S. Murray

He's always been an ugly man.  We were just more willing to tolerate
    it when he fronted a band as ferociously talented as the Stone Roses.  These days, as a ""solo
    act,"" the Monkey Man's total lack of presentability has never been more readily apparent and,
    strangely enough, embraced by the man himself. His ugliness, in an abstract and simplified form,
    is on full display on the cover of <i>Golden Greats</i> in an array of cheery pastels.  His
    mutt-fugly mug also adorns the inside cover in full photographic glory, in case you required
    a more sobering confirmation of his hideousness.  And if that isn't enough, the CD is 
    <i>enhanced</i> with a clip of the video for ""Love like a Fountain"" and a photo gallery for
    your viewing pleasure.  The video features a chess piece, a shoe, a pailful of painfully obvious
    Christian imagery, and a treasure trove of homely.</p><p>
    
    After his incoherent February 1998 debut, <i>Unfinished Monkey Business</i>, Ian Brown became
    renowned for alleged gay-bashing, slugging a flight attendant, and a subsequent two-month stint
    in the slammer.  His career adopted a slight, Weilandish hue.  According to his biography, this
    unfortunate string of events-- in addition to his complete lack of musical talent-- made him
    consider becoming a landscape gardener.  He didn't.  (We suspect it might have had something to
    do with an inability to hide a lack of talent as a landscape gardener by surrounding yourself
    with other, more talented landscape gardeners.)</p><p>
    
    Of course, it only makes sense that this poor bastard would finally squeeze out a relatively
    engaging album.  After all, you can't be this dumb and ugly and have bad luck on top of it.
    For the most part, Brown has left the instrumentation on <i>Golden Greats</i> to hired hands,
    leaving behind the elementary school proficiency that marred his first solo effort.  He's also
    opted to mask his bong-cured vocals in an assload of distortion, which lends a pleasing
    nondescript accent to most of the tracks, and helps wash down some of his unforgivably asinine
    lyrics.</p><p>
    
    The album runs the gamut stylistically, from the Zeppelin-esque riffs of ""Gettin' High""
    to the laid-back bass line of ""Neptune.""  But the music is by no means organic-- Brown melds
    that reliable old genre, drum-n-bass, with his rock sensibility.  ""Free My Way"" rides a
    skittering beat, but somehow manages the rock with blazing guitarwork and bass-drenched
    cello.</p><p>
    
    Of course, <i>Golden Greats</i> seems to owe its eclectic sound more to its host of capable
    engineers and session musicians than to any talent or inventiveness on Ian Brown's part.  But
    that's beside the point.  If nothing else, Brown at least lends some charisma and name
    recognition to the album, which earmarks it for attention.  If you can get past the misguided
    cover art and multimedia, <i>Golden Greats</i> proves a worthy listen.  But we in the States
    might want to wait for its slated mid-April release before rushing out to purchase the $30
    UK import.  It's not <i>that</i> fucking good.</p></div>"|968.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/968-golden-greats/|7.3|Beatty & Garrett

This
    lazy day mood stretches throughout Travis' sophomore release.  The tunes stay in their sweats
    and don't get around to showering until 5:45pm-- fifteen minutes before the pizza arrives.  The
    tunes flip through football and golf.  Healy sounds like he's spilling his soul to an empty
    cabin after 13 hours of sleep.  Check out a daily planner, though-- Sunday has the least amount
    of space.  This is the least productive day, yet most anticipated.  Travis fulfills the musical
    equivalent of this basic human need for the occasionally mundane.  While by no means groundbreaking, <i>The Man Who</i> massages with sincerity and crisp precision.</p><p>
    The production is cool and spacious thanks to Nigel Godrich (of <i>OK Computer</i> fame), and
    his breath can be seen slowly puffing throughout.  Icicle pickings chime over jangling acoustic
    ballads.  Elegent and deceptively simple, like unfinished furniture, the ten songs never rise
    to a scream, yet the trembling ambience is nonetheless smothering.  Your ears will shift focus
    through translucent layers of sound.  Godrich truly is blessed.  Fran Healy sounds remarkably
    like a stable Thom Yorke, and songs like ""The Fear"" point directly to this influence, but with
    a more folky, tender approach.  Some of his notes will make your cheeks tingle.  And eminating
    from his lungs, the repetition of ""Turn"" brings goosebumps.</p><p>
    Travis' debut shamelessly prayed to power rock like a British Weezer, and there are still echos
    of that boyish glee here.  Along with Weezer, Travis keep the flame of the righteous guitar solo
    lit while uninspired, obvious guitarists continue the Tom Pettification of this lost art and
    continue to piss on it.  The ability to imbue solos with any sort of soul and intensity should
    be cherished.
    </p><p>
    On <i>The Man Who</i>, power comes from restraint and space.  There are enough subtle flourishes
    buried beneath the pillowy snow to reward repeated listens-- the chimes and ominous keyboard
    under ""As You Are,"" the wind in ""Slide Show,"" and the sitar strums on the dramatic chorus to
    ""The Last Laugh of the Laughter.""  The hidden track even rewards those who need to rock with
    bellowing choruses, gong guitars, and unnerving cymbal ticks.
    </p><p>
    British bands tend to leave a bad aftertaste with American audiences with their cognizant conceit.
    If anything, the raw humility of Travis is refreshing.  Figures that this has still only seen
    release in the UK, while Gay Dad is being dumped on us from bombers.

    somewhere around 2007. You can trace his progression down the decibel scale from the angry
    punk scruff of Squirrel Bait through the gothic angst of Slint to the sublime but uneven work
    of the For Carnation.  <i>Fight Songs</i> and <i>Marshmallows</i> trod too close to conventional
    post-rock territory to make much of an impression, but this eponymous album, while not the
    aesthetic breakthrough <i>Spiderland</i> was, is miles beyond anything McMahan has done before.
    It may, in fact, be the album he'd always meant to make.</p><p>
    The primary mood of this record is one of calm and creeping dread-- impressionistic yet
    confidently rigid strokes of percussion and bass, sinister noises perched on the edge of your
    auditory range, and whispery vocals so close you can almost feel the air that carries the
    sound. It could easily be called trip-hop if that didn't sound like an insult, as the For
    Carnation have immersed themselves nostril-deep in the same atmosphere of suffocating, syrup-
    thick menace as the likes of Tricky and Massive Attack. This album is the sonic equivalent of
    standing on a deserted dock at midnight and watching fog roll towards you with a nagging feeling
    in your gut that some evil presence is near.</p><p>
    ""Emp. Man's Blues"" and ""Moonbeams"" ooze so slowly from the speakers that even the reverb
    sounds mired in sludge. The paranoia becomes more palpable on the more, um, ""energetic""
    tracks such as ""A Tribute To"" and ""Tales (Live from the Crypt),"" but the For Carnation
    retains control of its sound, sublimely heightening or lessening tension with expert 
    placement of each noise. Spooky serpentine synths emerge from the ether to snap at your
    nose, only to dissolve away just as quickly; distorted static bubbles up like the
    screeches of distant vampire bats. But ""Being Held"" is the undeniable apotheosis of the 
    album; it consists of little more than an insistent bell-like drone, subsonic bass feedback,
    and a neck-snapping drum solo.  That's all the For Carnation needs to keep you in white-
    knuckled suspense for 5\xBD minutes.</p><p>
    Sure, there's still a touch of post-rock to the album, especially on the woozy jazz 
    shuffle of ""Snoother,"" but that's to be expected with John McEntire contributing. And it's 
    never as obvious as on previous For Carnation albums, where the distinct influences of
    fellow Tortoise alumni Doug McCombs and John Herndon seemed to dilute McMahan's vision.
    Compared with past efforts, this record is the first to truly deserve its title: it's as
    close to the For Carnation as the band has come so far. How much lower can Brian McMahan
    go? Time will tell.</p></div>"|3151.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3151-the-for-carnation/|8.0|Nick Mirov

    Voight suppresses the playful streak he exhibits as Mike Ink when he sits down
    to make Gas music. Previous releases like <i>Zauberberg</i> and <i>Köenigsforst</i>
    adhered to a strict formula of sampled symphonic passages (sometimes described
    as Wagnerian, though they could be from anywhere) swirling atop an incessant
    50Hz bass thump. This steady 70-80 bpm bass pulse is the Gas trademark. Though
    it seems a bit comical at first (and definitely would have turned me off a few
    years ago), the bass anchor becomes mesmerizing over the course of an album,
    lending the intricate string patterns needed thrust and clarity.</p><p>
    On <i>Pop</i>, Voight switches things up. Gone are the gloomy samples, and the
    signature bass heartbeat appears on but two of these seven long tracks.
    Instead of containing linear motion, <i>Pop</i> is an exercise in sonic
    texture. UK music scribe Simon Reynolds pointed out that electronic music
    labeled ""IDM"" frequently has a marked fascination with timbre. Much of
    <i>Pop</i> takes this idea to its logical extreme, backgrounding things like
    melody and rhythm in favor of pure sound.</p><p>
    I read an essay about Erik Satie's <i>Trois Gymnopédies</i> that compared the
    famous piano pieces, all very similar in melody and structure, to viewing a
    sculpture from different angles. Just as a few steps to the left gives
    insight into a visual work, identical musical elements can be shuffled
    slightly to provide a deeper look. I'm reminded of this analogy when I hear
    the first three tracks on <i>Pop</i> (no titles, natch). Each of these
    contains a warm synthesizer drone that wobbles gently between two pitches
    and several layers of fuzzy electronic distortion that trigger images of wind
    and trickling water, but slight tweaks in the arrangement of each track casts
    light on the construction of individual sounds.</p><p>
    Together, these carefully placed packets of noise blend into an immersing,
    downright amniotic environment, especially at sufficient volume. The delicate
    synthesized drones will veer too close to new age music for some, but fans of
    Eno's dreamiest ambient work and Aphex Twin's <i>Selected Ambient Works II</i>
    will find <i>Pop</i> easy to curl up in.  The fourth track finally brings the
    familiar bass drum, paired with a loop of a gorgeous ringing sound that could
    be a sampled electric guitar (similar in tone to passages of Burger/Ink's
    <i>Las Vegas</i>).  The fifth cut is pure sonic velvet, the layered drone
    radiating a palpable warmth. I wouldn't have complained if this track had been
    stretched to the length of a CD; sadly, it lasts a <i>mere</i> eleven minutes.</p><p>
    But while it begins cozy, uneasiness begins to creep into <i>Pop</i> just after
    the halfway point. By the sixth track, the mood becomes downright eerie.
    Though many of the textures from the first three tracks are present, the mix
    feels all wrong, with the synth punched up to ominous levels, and the
    temperature seems to plummet. Here, the cover art of <i>Pop</i> seems to come
    into play.</p><p>
    The photographs in the liner notes consist of extreme close-ups of tree
    branches.  At this vantage point, the twigs take on another quality, and we
    get a small glimpse of the worlds that exists between knots on a twig. This
    change in perspective reminds me of the opening montage in David Lynch's
    <i>Blue Velvet</i>, where the camera moves from the placid long shots of
    Lumberton to the guy having a heart attack while watering his lawn down
    to the horror happening at the microscopic level of the soil. Greater detail
    makes the world increasing unpleasant.</p><p>
    Similarly, as you move deeper inside the world of <i>Pop</i>, it changes.
    The closer adds a marshal kick drum (this time complete with hissing high
    hat) to the previous track's drones, finally fleshing out the threatening
    scene.  It's an unsettling end to a fascinating sound ride, and when it fades
    out, you'll enjoy the silence with sharpened ears.</p></div>"|3402.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3402-pop/|9.0|Mark Richard-San

    frontman Aarington Dionyso is a little Black Francis, a little Darby Crash,
    some Birthday Party-era Nick Cave and part talentless Agent Orange-addled
    Vietnam vet derelict shoveled off the street and thrown, mid-acid
    flashback, into a recording studio. Like Francis on the Pixies' <i>Surfer
    Rosa</i>, Dionyso also enjoys shrieking in both Spanish and English, except
    that Francis' freakouts admittedly seem pretty tame and sane in comparison.
    And Dionyso, well, he screams unintelligible gibberish in Italian, too.
    Pretty gooda, eh?</p><p>
    Amazing, though, I can actually tolerate this new EP for awhile, unlike
    that crass pile of digitized monkey shit-- and of course, critical
    favorite-- <i>Uterus and Fire</i>. I can only guess that the band's only true
    appeal is the Old Time Relijun live experience in which a crowd of normal,
    problem-free college kids get off on seeing some poor brain-drained mental
    case suffer nervous breakdowns on stage, as he rants about certain
    locations of doors, buying cola in a casino, and that weird electrical
    smell in the house. Truthfully, though, hypocrite that I am, if Old Time
    Relijun came to my city, I can't say I wouldn't be right there among all
    the other wide-eyed entertainment-starved voyeurs and cheap thrill-seekers
    watching Dionyso go apeshit.</p><p>
    But then again, Old Time Relijun isn't much more than your average
    old-timey carnival freak show. In fact, I'm suddenly reminded of the great
    fartist ""Le Petomaine"" whose musical flatulence entertained Parisian high
    society back in the early 20th century. He was the toast of the town and a
    big draw, too. It's astounding, I know, but that froggie gentleman's anus
    had a keener sense of melody than anyone in this sorry band. Maybe it's
    time to try blowin' a little ass on CD, fellas? 
    </p><p>
    Well, gee, maybe I'm being a little harsh. On a positive note, where did
    Dionyso's cute little guitar riffs suddenly come from? He must've sampled
    his K Records mentor Calvin Johnson's old band Beat Happening. A few of the
    guitar parts have, in fact, advanced from <i>Uterus and Fire's</i> untuned sonic
    slop to almost-catchy two- and three-note demento spy-theme hooks. Like on
    ""Adaga,"" he'll take some old B-52's guitar line and truncate it to a few
    shaky notes, making for, at least, a halfway-listenable experience. 
    </p><p>
    And, I guess all the suit-and-tied mohawks at Punk Planet will be crying
    ""sellout"" on the almost downright poppy ""Circuit Breaker."" I found my head
    bobbing to the child-like guitar figure, threatened, of course, by some
    mean-sounding vacuum-cleaner drone in the background.  And the 
    ""composition"" they named after a line from Walt Whitman, is a Benny-
    Goodman- meets- Ornette- Coleman free-form clarinet squawk-fest. Ah, no jazzo
    frio! Por favor!
    </p><p>
    Let's face it, it's cynical as hell to release and/or condone a proud- to- be-
    crappy band like this. They're praised to the heavens by the same
    attention-starved geeks who champion the annoying Shaggs and Half
    Japanese's <i>Destroy All Monsters,</i> and believe that all worthwhile music has
    to be totally incompetent, mindless, and secretly suffered through. I can
    appreciate that to an extent, but, come on, who really listens to this
    garbage more than once? You can bet Old Time Relijun hate their own
    music for leisure listening they'd probably opt for something even more
    sick and twisted, like Bjorn Again or Hanson. I mean, there'll always be
    the militant post-structuralist cashiers at the local indie record store-- y'know, 
    guys who read Lee Ranaldo's poetry chapbooks and play stuff like Old
    Time Relijun to impress/annoy their snippy Foucault-misinterpreting
    colleagues.
    </p><p>
    Anyway, I'd venture to say that <i>La Sirena De Pecera</i> could be an actual
    ""improvement"" upon <i>Uterus and Fire</i>. Dionyso's maniacal shrieks are louder
    here, providing a greater distraction from his band of circus chimps
    responsible for the banana-brained bass lines and obnoxious drum solos
    pointlessly clattering away. And no matter how ""cool"" and ""punk rock"" it is
    to pretend to love this stuff, Old Time Relijun's brand of white noise is
    usually just rickety, rhythmically retarded, and pretty damn boring, if ye
    ask me.  
    </p><p>
    To be fair, though, Dionyso may be a no-talent wreck of a half-man
    half-beast, but he does prove that genuinely depraved dudes can be really
    amusing sometimes.  I'll admit, this guy makes Jon Spencer look like the
    staid, Ivy-educated, son of a famous psychologist he really is. I mean
    Spencer these days, is, at best, a skinny Elvis impersonator riding a
    prolonged sugar rush. Dionyso is a rabid, frothing, genuine hombre de loco
    in comparison. Still, does that mean <i>La Sirena De Pecera</i> will be a mainstay
    in my sellout non-punk 5-disc cd changer? Will I send the freak five bucks
    for a book of third grade drawings he's peddling on the inside cover? You
    figure it out. Meanwhile, if you like a little creativity and talent to go
    along with your maniac lead singers, go out and buy a Roky Erickson and the
    Aliens album.

He would have you
    know that he gave that gritty style an elegance, a grace, an acceptable glamour. His <i>Logical
    Progression</i> DJ sets and the labels associated with his Good Looking Records organization
    all promoted what he and his acolytes termed ""intelligent drum-n-bass."" Herein lies the problem.</p><p>
    
    Bukem is a snob. The internal logic of the term ""intelligent drum-n-bass"" requires that we must
    think of everyone else's as moronic, noisy, and unkempt. Bukem's style, so the logic runs, is
    progressive, pioneering, and ground-breaking, yet when you listen to the many Good Looking
    compilations, they recall Roger Dean's Hypgnosis artwork and the preposterousness of 1970s
    progressive rock. Why would anyone use the term ""progressive?"" How many melodramatic trance
    tunes have beset us under the nauseating guise of ""progressive house?"" Progressive is code for
    ""a load of wank.""</p><p>
    
    So it's ironic then that Bukem has abandoned his so-called progressive sound to produce
    <i>Journey Inwards</i>, a record that invites comparison to 4 Hero's <i>Two Pages</i>.  Bukem
    is no longer interested in stunning us with his liquid ambiance.  Instead, he's joined other
    junglist deserters in their common and quite pointless quest for a lost sequel to Herbie
    Hancock's <i>Sextant</i>. Mix it Bukem's delusional Rick Wakeman keyboard theatrics and Ian
    Anderson flute malarkey, and you've nailed this double album.</p><p>
    
    Yep. Two-discs.  This extended set only gives further evidence of Bukem's Yes tendencies. The
    session musicians he's hired are solid enough, though. (They <i>are</i> session musicians, after
    all). They proficiently flesh out Bukem's undernourished ideas. But there's a passion lacking
    from the proceedings. Each of these 14 tracks are laid down to satisfy the requirements of your
    local hip martini and sushi bar. This album's mellow Rhodes piano and ride cymbal flourishes
    will complement your local's frosted windows and utterly sophisticated white walls.</p><p>
    
    Nonetheless, <i>Journey Inwards</i> outs Bukem as the conservative I'd always suspected him to
    be. His junglist work eschewed the grit and psychosis of the original hardcore breakbeat cadre
    to return to a dreamy, unspoiled, unreal place in space. Unlike genuine offworld pioneers like
    Sun Ra and Derrick May, Bukem's journeys into the universe weren't exactly in search of a
    harmonious world, free of Earth's manifest bigotries. I suspect him of more middle class
    aspirations. Hopefully, he'll find his own happiness on <i>Journey Inwards</i>, because this
    isn't the species of joy I'm comfortable being surrounded by.</p></div>"|1017.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1017-journey-inwards/|3.9|Paul Cooper

    learns to express himself with Popsicle sticks. Say you feel some existential angst over the
    unpredictability of the expanding universe; you might dump a handful of popsicle sticks and a
    glob of glue into a bucket, shake randomly, and let the sticks fall where they may. Because I
    spent many years in summer camp enrolled in these kinds of classes, I never learned to
    differentiate the art from the craft. It's all the same to me. I buy a table because I need a
    place to set my highball glass, and I buy an album because I need help feeling something.
    Plumber, writer, boat detailer, cellist-- they're all the same thing.  The one you choose just
    depends on what you're looking for.</p><p>
    
    Dirty Three have a special place in many an indie rock fan's heart because they have a strong
    sense of craftsmanship. They call themselves the Dirty Three because they're not afraid to roll
    up their sleeves and get to work; if a little excess muck gets flung about when they're in the
    midst of construction, well, that's just part of the job. These guys are working stiffs. I
    mean, who wouldn't want to suck down a few jumbo cans of Foster's with Warren Ellis, Mick
    Turner and Jim White?  No one wouldn't, that's who.</p><p>
    
    I may have used a double negative at the end of that last paragraph, but I am doubly positive
    that if you dig the Dirty Three in any way you will absolutely love <i>Whatever You Love, You
    Are</i>.  It's their best album yet, beating the holy crap out of already great albums like
    <i>Horse Stories</i> and <i>Ocean Songs</i>. For the first time, Dirty Three delve heavily into
    orchestration, adding layers to Ellis' violin, making him sound like a quartet all by himself.
    And the instrumental melodies are, simply, among the most beautiful you'll hear this year.</p><p>
    
    ""Some Summers They Drop Like Flies"" is a swooning bolero that patiently works through slight
    variations in melody. ""I Really Should've Gone Out Last Night"" layers Ellis' picked fiddle over
    White and Turner's lurching, off-the-beat rhythm, until Ellis emerges with an emotional bowed
    passage. ""I Offered It Up to the Stars and the Night Sky"" starts with a canon-like figure
    comprised of at least four tracks of Ellis' violin repeating variations on the same refrain,
    and eventually finds its way to one of the trio's patented epiphanies, aching with drama and
    transcendence. ""Some Things I Just Don't Want to Know"" is the most cinematic track, conjuring
    images of big sky and drunken peasants dressed in rags. And the gorgeous ""Lullabye for
    Christie"" makes me wish, for the first time I can recall, that my name was Christie. Get this:
    I am this album.</p></div>"|2329.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2329-whatever-you-love-you-are/|8.9|Mark Richard-San

Perhaps it's being overshadowed by towering evergreens that
    instills a modest reverence for beauty. Perhaps it's the evergreens remaining ever green under the gusts of
    snow which keeps hope alive. Perhaps it's the cradling of cold coast and the Rocky wall. Whatever the causes,
    the Pacific Northwest has played womb to some of the most skyward, heart-wrenching, and gentle pop music of
    recent history.</p><p>
    
    The trademarks of the Northwest sound continue to be cherubic eunuchs on vocals, crisp production, slow
    rollercoaster melodies, and tales of crushes and the crushed. Built to Spill, Elliott Smith, Quasi, Sunny
    Day Real Estate, and even Modest Mouse and Caustic Resin, to some extent, all revolve around this central
    axis of Northwestern pop. In two short albums, Death Cab for Cutie have firmly established a stylistic
    nexus from which all of these bands spoke. Like history in reverse, <i>We Have the Facts and We're Voting
    Yes</i> documents the proto-Northwest sound as a footnote to a decade of tranquilizing rock.</p><p>
    
    Death Cab for Cutie effortlessly weep gems like a band stuck deep in a comfortable career.  Subcutaneous
    organ and glockenspiel infuse warm, rich tones which bruise slowly between skeletal percussion and waxy
    guitar pickings. Sometimes the band patiently fills wooden cathedrals with echoes of reverberating slowcore,
    like on ""No Joy in Mudville"" and ""The Employment Pages"". The latter builds to an e-bow climax that weakens
    like a welcome influenza. ""For What Reason"", ""Lowell, MA"", and ""Company Calls"" click along at quick clips,
    yet maintain the shroud of delicate beauty thanks to Ben Gibbard's lachrymose wails. From a distance, the
    group appears manilla. But even top secret documents come stuffed in manilla. Subtle technological flourishes
    glimmer under the organic pulp like microchips in lumberjacking valleys.</p><p>
    
    If fault can be found, it's Death Cab for Cutie's continual quest to shine a diamond from petrified wood and
    dark coal instead of letting some of the rough, raw rock pass through. But then again, that's why the
    Northwest gave us Modest Mouse and Built to Spill. Guitar heroics can be found elsewhere. Death Cab for
    Cutie have a killer name and lugubrious elixir. The hooks are barbless and coated in Novocaine. They pull
    through your skin and leave obscure scars. But in today's rock climate, this sort of gentle niche makes for
    a relaxing vacation with some good prospects of getting laid.</p></div>"|2227.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2227-we-have-the-facts-and-were-voting-yes/|7.5|Brent DiCrescenzo

One of
    these is that nearly everything from the past eventually comes back, and
    with a vengeance. While this undeniable truth is responsible for a lot of
    distinctly horrible things (house that relies on disco samples), it also
    contributes to some of the most mind-boggling, and often enlightening,
    stylistic combinations.</p><p>
    
       The UK sextet Broadcast are not the first to marry electronic music's
    underlying futuristic bend with elements of film noir and classic torch
    song writing.  One can't help but make the Portishead comparisons, what
    with the icy detached cool of vocalist Trish Keenan and the unhurried,
    slightly blunted beats.  But where Portishead's prevailing mood contained
    a sense of doom and that of staring across a chasm toward some unattainable
    happiness, Broadcast are much less about burying their music in your psyche
    and more about beaming it at you from somewhere in outer space.  There's also
    a lot more layers to get lost in here, whereas the Portisfolks made you
    concentrate on the meaning of every well-placed speck of sound in the stark
    spaces they created.</p><p>
    
       While the soft-focus, hazy atmosphere is the result of modern
    technology in the studio, the music isn't content to fall back on it.
    In fact, the band roster would even like every doubter to realize that
    they're indeed a band and not just a talented bunch of egghead producers.
    Yes, there's a bassist, there's a guitarist, and there's even a real drummer.
    While the deadly precision of the samples-and-sequences method of making
    music has its merits, the approach could not achieve the chilling organic
    qualities that Broadcast exudes.  There's a prevailing sense of definite
    vision, but not one of the product being excessively labored over.  Sure,
    there's craft at work here, but whereas most albums recorded over long
    periods of time sound weary and defeated in the final analysis, <i>The Noise
    Made by People</i> is positively vibrant and alive.</p><p>
    
       Though it's slightly disconcerting to hear sounds like this without being
    floored by a sense of daring and originality, it's a testament to the explosion
    of genre-bending music that was the underground's biggest artistic accomplishment
    in the 1990's.  Broadcast one-ups the avant leanings of most of these
    juxtaposition-experimenting acts by making these advances work in the context of
    memorable pop songs.  Sure, there are precious few limbs-aloft choruses here, but
    I challenge even the most pop-hating avant-o-phile to not warble along with
    Keenan through the lovely melodic hooks of ""Come On Let's Go"" and ""Look Outside.""</p><p>
    
      Special praise must be given to the band for the sonic imprint here.  Drums are
    cyclonic washes of lovely pattering and lovelier noise.  Guitars chunk away
    purposefully as often as they slide on single note lines through the background
    ether.  Strings and keyboards evoke sublime visions of soundtracks to old films
    as well as those yet to be realized.</p><p>
    
       But for all the sound and song, Broadcast's vision seems relatively narrow,
    and several ideas are spread a bit too thinly across the album's length.  The
    band obviously have the talent and the means.  Now perhaps, with the doubters
    silenced and the integrity assured by this release, they can explore some other
    avenues on future releases.</p></div>"|946.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/946-the-noise-made-by-people/|7.8|Dan Gardopee

I'm
    writing, but I'm typing slowly under the album's spell.  I'm also asking myself, ""Isn't a 7.6 a
    bit high for a covers album?""  Chan Marshall didn't write these songs-- I heard she didn't even
    practice them.  She likely spent less than an afternoon in the studio.  Sure, it's an endearing
    concept, but 7.6 for a ""it's just me and my guitar and the fakebook from my brother's closet""
    kind of affair?  Come on, Rockermann; let's be reasonable here.</p><p>
    
    This, of course, is not about reason, it's about a strange force called Cat Power. Cat Power
    tempts you to forgive the inconsistencies in her albums.  And inexplicably, you won't feel like
    asking for your money back when Marshall fails to make it through 12 minutes of her $12 show.
    This bizarre Cat Power also charms an audience into responding ""a little higher"" when she
    nonchalantly asks if anyone in the room ""knows a B."" Cat Power has inspired tautological
    delusions in more than one skinny boy: ""I understand her/ She is misunderstood by everyone/
    Like me/ Thus, I understand her.""  To demonstrate this phenomenon, Matador has taken 12 songs
    and exposed them to Cat Power.  The data was then collected on <i>The Covers Record</i>.
    Let's check out some of the results.</p><p>
    
    Chan sings: ""When I'm drivin' in my car/ And that man comes on the radio/ And he's tellin' me
    more and more,"" but there's no trace of Mick-- or of the renowned chorus-- in this version of
    ""(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction."" Marshall has put a blue cover over a red song, and it's one
    of the album's stronger tracks.  The other standouts come when Chan doses sparse numbers
    heavily in Cat Power and makes them her own.</p><p>
    
    Imagine Chan Marshall sending herself, John Malkovich-style, through her own portal, and you
    have Marshall's cover of the Cat Power original, ""In This Hole"".  The slow sadness of this
    version has its appeal, but it might have been more effective if the piano arpeggios were less
    prominent in the mix.  It would shift the focus off the amateurish simplicity of the song and
    onto Marshall's vocals which seem fragile not because they're slight, but because her lyrics
    sound like they could snap under their own weight. That's what you paid the $12 for.</p><p>
    
    In the past, I've been wary of Velvets covers. This might be the product of a recurring
    nightmare about a Velvet Underground tribute album which includes Jewel performing
    ""Afterhours"", Belle &amp; Sebastian doing ""Sunday Morning"", and Wolfie's take on ""Black Angel's
    Death Song"". So I was naturally hesitant when I noticed that Marshall covers ""I Found a
    Reason"" here. I mention this not to self-indulgently map out what is sacred to me, but
    to point out that Marshall traipses around on just about everybody's hallowed ground here
    and pulls it off masterfully.</p><p>
    
    Cat Power's cover of ""I Found a Reason"" might actually make you weep until Marshall comes
    back around to lick your wounds, all in under two minutes. You can call me a wuss or say
    it's because I'm a girl-- keep in mind that I didn't shed a tear at <i>Saving Private
    Ryan</i>, which some critic apparently called ""wound-porn""-- but Cat Power's <i>The Covers
    Record</i> is the real deal, the embodiment of wound-porn.  Buy it now; hide it under your
    mattress.</p></div>"|1344.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1344-the-covers-record/|7.6|Kristin Sage Rockermann

    retro-groove mavens Sukia. In addition to releasing an EP, they've done remix and production
    work for fellow travelers like Takako Minekawa and Fantastic Plastic Machine. From the company
    they keep, you'd guess that DJ Me DJ You's music is supposed to be clever, light, fun, and
    funky.  You'd be about half right.</p><p>
    This album begins with DJ music's most overworked device: a sample from a test record. Hearing
    yet another straight-laced voice from the early 60s telling us how to position the speakers of
    our hi-fi doesn't bode well for an original listening experience. We brace ourselves for a dull
    tour of some Salvation Army beathead's obvious record collection, and we expect the worst sort
    of cut-and-paste clichés. But the problem with this album doesn't stem from a lack of originality
    or the fact that fragmented, kitschy collages are passé.</p><p>
    A quick listen reveals that <i>Rainbows and Robots</i> is loaded with bizarre aural scraps of
    the most obscure order, and the limitless possibilities of sample-driven music suggest that
    another few dozen great albums are waiting to be born.  But rather than <i>make</i> one, these
    guys pile the oddball soundbytes to the moon without acknowledging the essential rule of pop
    composition: Give 'em something to grab on to.</p><p>
    Successful pop music needs at least one of following components: A beat, a riff or a melody.
    And despite their skill with offbeat sounds, DJ Me DJ You is stingy with all three. The drums
    throughout <i>Rainbows and Robots</i> are mixed way back, distancing the music from its hip-hop
    origins. Fragments of guitars, sci-fi movie quotes, ethnic voices, video games and sound effects
    records pan back and forth without any repeating hooks to tug you into the sonic maelstrom. And
    of the many cheesy Moog lines coursing through these tracks, few will have you humming.</p><p>
    There are a couple of exceptions. ""Video City Boy"", which combines what I believe are <i>Galaxian</i>
    samples with a tasty disco string riff, would sound great on any stereo if the volume was high
    enough.  The title track parlays a killer electric piano line straight out of a 70s sitcom and
    aged drum programming into genuine pop magic. Unfortunately, these are exceptions on what is
    ultimately a pretty mediocre record.</p></div>"|2368.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2368-rainbows-and-robots/|5.1|Mark Richard-San

Whereas much contemporary
    electronic music prefers to skitter spastically on the surfaces in high frequencies,
    Laswell's recent electronic projects are all anchored by an unassailable bottom. The
    sound has back. What else could we expect from a bassist who cut his teeth in
    late 70s head-funk outfits like Material and Massacre?  As aggressively diverse
    as Laswell's influences must be, the dominant mode in his last five years of musical
    output has unquestionably been dub. A soiled dub-- aeons from the Home Town Hi-Fi
    sound system that Osbourne Ruddock hotwired to become King Tubby-- but dub all the
    same, marked by the same deep beat, spacy echoing and vertigo reverb.</p><p>
    
    This year's harrowing <i>Invisible Design</i> was something of a departure from the
    space-junk dub Laswell's been overseeing for most of the decade. The ""head's up""
    to Amon Tobin's lawyers aside, Laswell's <i>Permutation</i> returns him to the
    company of his old cronies: Nicky Skopelitis (aka Ekstasis), Hassan ibn Ali, and Dark
    Matter.  The results aren't difficult to predict: expertly played, dub-based world
    music, heavy on the reverb and cut with some solid drum-n-bass underneath.  Ideal as
    a soundtrack for sludgy narcotized sex and all the requisite mind games that precede
    it.</p><p>
<i>Permutation</i> has a great deal more gravity than the graceful but somewhat
    undernourished Ekstasis album, <i>Wake Up and Dream</i>, which is something of
    a predecessor. Skopelitis' warm and cautious guitar work is suspended over the
    abysmal depths of Laswell's bass and overall production technique, precarious as
    a rope footbridge. Sitar, tabla, wind instruments from every continent all add
    local color but the Laswell/Skopelitis interchange remains the heart of the
    album.</p><p>
    
    The album takes some chances here and there, notably ""Iron Black"", a fuzzy,
    riff-powered space-rock tune which divides its time between Chemical Brothers-style
    big beat and the lysergic jams of Funkadelic. But for the most part, this record
    doesn't cohere thematically; rather, it sounds like an afternoon workout of five
    gifted musicians jamming with the tapes left rolling. There's nothing urgent
    about <i>Permutation</i>, nothing necessary. You'll enjoy it, but you probably
    wouldn't pause it to take a piss.</p><p>
    
    This is the problem with so much of Laswell's recent output: its appeal is
    undeniable, its throb is unavoidable, but it demands very little. It has the
    quality of studio sessions, rather than a singular artistic statement. And this
    may come down to a question of policy. Laswell seems to value multiple solid
    releases annually over the possibility of a single great release every two years
    or so-- one that could conceivably be culled and constructed from the many great
    moments that wind up scattered throughout each year's reliable but rarely
    revolutionary handful.</p><p>
    
    Perhaps this is why Laswell's <i>Invisible Design</i> was so striking: its
    confessional candor, compositional rigor and disavowal of masks made it
    such a radical offering. None of Laswell's other works had anticipated
    his performance on that piece; by contrast, <i>Permutation</i> immediately
    takes its place among the glut of reliable world-dub samplers that Laswell
    has constructed over the last decade. <i>Permutation</i> still works wonders
    for that hazy funk-love that makes the world go round, but the clarion of
    <i>Invisible Design</i> continues to ring like Doomsday.</p></div>"|4698.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4698-permutation/|6.0|Brent S. Sirota

    store at about the same time a dress rehearsal for the apocalypse was
    taking place in front of the city's casino. It was a time of civil
    disobedience-- the windy and confused sequel to the Seattle riots.
    Returning home, there was a vague feeling amongst the populace that the
    end was nigh. Reclining at a safe distance from the city, I played Low's
    new live EP, <i>One More Reason to Forget</i>, greatly anticipating that
    it would provide the soundtrack to society's long-awaited end.</p><p>
    
    The first scene was set by the aching, organ-drenched melody of <i>Songs
    for a Dead Pilot</i>'s ""Be There.""  As an ambulance flies past in outer
    Louisville, Alan Sparhawk gently sings, ""You can't sleep backwards/ You
    can't save the animals."" Instantly, the collision of dogma and batons
    outside begins to lose its edge.  As the album forges its somber path,
    Sparhawk and Mimi Parker's melded vocals plowing the tall grass ahead,
    I lose hope in sedated bliss.</p><p>
    
    These tracks were recorded to DAT at Louisville, Kentucky's Church of St.
    Phillip Neri on November 6th, 1997.  The acoustics make for a spare ambience,
    most notably on the brooding ""Landlord.""  Punctuated by the occasional snare
    and Zak Sally's quaking bass, Sparhawk cries out with deep conviction rarely
    seen in this age of musical self-reflection.</p><p>
    
    Contributing violinist Ida Pearle expertly drives the classical melody of
    ""Condescend,"" shadowed by the soft vocals of percussionist Parker.  And
    when the band's stunning rendition of <i>The Curtain Hits the Cast</i>'s
    17-minute, reverb-soaked noise epic, ""Do You Know Tow to Waltz,"" the
    escalating violence outside quickly disappears behind my newfound warm
    myopia.  There seems to be no weak track on this release; the songs appear
    carefully chosen to create a dense, but hopeful, atmosphere.</p><p>
<i>One More Reason to Forget</i>, capturing a stellar performance predating
    the existence of <i>Secret Name</i>, is as heartbreaking as it is soporific,
    leading me to believe that their strong Mormon religious convictions are
    partially responsible for the consistent quality of the material.  This band
    has but one goal: to achieve an unsettling calm through highly melodic,
    droning vocals, minimalist percussion, and tense acoustics.  Indeed, Low
    require no apocalypse to soundtrack; they create one.</p></div>"|4896.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4896-one-more-reason-to-forget/|8.3|Pete Nicholson

    for hours without making sense of the thing, or you see it instantly. Likewise,
    when Britain-born Richard Youngs kicks into one of his half-hour length,
    piano-and-vocal ballads, it's either wonderful or excruciating, depending
    on whether you're willing to commit enough time to put it together.</p><p>
    
    Usually, if a song is 22 minutes long, it's because it's so overstuffed with
    changes, tempo shifts, and experimental passages that it can't possibly fit
    into the 3:40 format accorded the average pop song. Youngs, on the other hand,
    doesn't stretch a track like ""Warriors"" to a positively epic length by
    cramming it with prog-rock theatrics and guitar solos; he does it by
    slooowwwwwing thhhhe thiiiiiiing dowwwwwwwn.</p><p>
    
    Come to think of it, ""epic"" isn't the word for ""Warriors"" at all-- that would
    imply elaborateness, or at least a wide scope.  This track's just a pair of
    piano chords repeated at a glacial pace and Young's wan, frail voice. You
    heard right. One song. For 22 minutes. I am not making this up. It sounds
    like Young recorded a spritely little number and had a field day with the
    variable-speed fader. Each chord echoes and reverberates before the next one
    begins. Youngs' voice quavers over single syllables for deciminutes at a time.</p><p>
    
    Surprisingly, this isn't nearly as excruciating as it sounds. For utterly
    intangible reasons, Youngs' formula is surprisingly effective. Having
    previously released a similarly paced suite of acoustic guitar numbers about
    his recently passed dog, he seems to know what he's doing.  And despite its
    repetitive qualities, the unresolved nature of ""Warriors"" manages to come off
    surprisingly evocatively.  Each chord hangs in the air for a minute, and the
    lyrics-- standard fantasy-rock fare about ancient battlefields or something--
    unfold their narrative slowly and assuredly, allowing the track to firmly
    hold attention for most of its duration.</p><p>
    
    All this said, <i>Making Paper</i> relies entirely on the listener's frame of
    mind.  For one listen, the record induces a trance-like state full of
    contemplation; on the second or third helping, it seems like the worst mistake
    ever. With so little going on, it's necessary for the person on the other end
    of the speakers to connect the conceptual dots.  If you're up for it, give it
    a try.</p></div>"|8840.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8840-making-paper/|6.2|Sam Eccleston

    disappointing fifth (and assumed to be final) album, <i>MACHINA/The
    Machines of God</i>.  The laughable attempt at storyline, the terrible
    songs, and the ungodly production flourishes glued the final sequin on
    Billy Corgan's velvet-lined coffin.</p><p>
    
    Though I'd been a fan for many years, even through 1998's unfairly
    maligned <i>Adore</i>, I didn't bat an eye when Corgan announced the
    band's imminent breakup.  Then comes this new, hastily issued ""final
    album.""  Rejected by their label, the band printed 25 copies (consisting
    of three ten-inch EPs and a 2xLP set) on their own imprint, gave them to
    25 people, and instructed those people to distribute it digitally.  This
    was their best option to get the material out, since Virgin would have
    blocked any attempt to release it on another label.</p><p>
    
    It would be extremely easy to dismiss this album as Billy simply taking
    out the accumulated garbage of the past couple years.  It would be easy,
    that is, if it didn't almost redeem the Pumpkins.  You certainly can't
    accuse them of trying to make a buck, as they've probably lost at least
    a couple hundred printing up the source copies of this Internet-distributed
    release.  And it's all the more frustrating that this album features an
    abundance of tracks that throw the deficiencies of their previous record
    into even sharper relief.</p><p>
    
    Within the first three songs, I'm immediately reminded of everything I
    ever loved about the Smashing Pumpkins: perfect examples of the
    dream-pop/arena-rock hybrid they forged back in 1993.  The performances
    are, for the most part, raw and mostly live sounding, with some tracks
    actually recalling the glory days they spent in Butch Vig's basement.
    Basically, you get the one thing missing on <i>MACHINA I</i>: the sound
    of a band playing.</p><p>
    
    But there's plenty of filler in this set, too, and it's not really sequenced
    to be played as a continuous album.  Several songs are unnecessarily repeated.
    And did we really need a ""demo"" version of the still-awful ""Heavy Metal
    Machine""?  Probably not.  But all these faults aside, within this collection
    resides an album that would have been infinitely superior to <i>The Machines
    of God</i>.  The high points are high enough to erase any bad taste left by
    that album.</p><p>
    
    Songs like ""Dross"" and ""Glass' Theme"" could have provided the ""return to
    rock"" that <i>MACHINA I</i> failed to deliver.  The long-standing live
    favorite ""Let Me Give the World to You"" could have been the hit single
    the group never managed to score. ""Here's to the Atom Bomb"" sounds like an
    answer to ""1979"".   ""Vanity"" and ""Home"" are simply gorgeous, songs only the
    old Pumpkins could have made.</p><p>
    
    There isn't really any new ground broken here, but the band revisits nearly
    every style they've adopted over the years.  Throughout, they sound energized
    and at a creative peak.  Jimmy Chamberlin's muscular, fluid drumming provides
    the backbeat missing from the Pumpkins' music for the last couple years.
    James Iha has developed from a merely competent rhythm guitarist into a
    creative lead player, providing a spacy ambience to Corgan's power-riffing.
    And as easy as it's been to dismiss Corgan as a fame-hungry self-aggrandizing
    egomaniac over the years, this set proves that he's also a songwriter of
    considerable talent.</p><p>
    
    So take this as a proper farewell to the Smashing Pumpkins-- it's a nice album
    to remember them by.  Believe me, it's the last album I expected to enjoy this
    year.  And the icing: it's free.</p></div>"|11828.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11828-machina-iithe-friends-and-enemies-of-modern-music/|7.7|D. Erik Kempke

Anyone whose primary references to the word ""skank""
    have something to do with really trashy girls from back in school, put your hand
    up.  Okay, get out of here, the lot of you!  This record ain't for you pansies!
    This is the real ""ragga-ragga"" deal, and if you disagree, Horace will have you
    know that it's been tested and approved by a panel of ""hardcore, ragga-ragga,
    ghetto people.""  No, I'm not joking.</p><p>
    Neophytes and other stragglers still reading this should be given the quick,
    obligatory rundown: no, Massive Attack did not discover Horace Andy busking
    outside a cafe a la Damo Suzuki and Can.  He's a living legend with an impressive
    discography now spanning three decades and an instantly recognizable voice.  He
    was picked up from relative obscurity for Massive Attack's seminal <i>Blue
    Lines</i> album in 1990.  Suddenly, Andy's passionate, soaring, wide-vibrato
    voice was blaring from every hipster's stereo system in the UK.  And with the
    hype machine building everywhere else, his contributions to 1994's <i>Protection</i>
    were even more prevalent.  That said, the quick-to-judge might shoot an eyebrow
    up at this brand new set: all Horace, appearing on Massive Attack's Melankolic
    label.  Is this his sell-out album?  Certainly not.  For the most part.</p><p>
    Make no mistake.  This is no reggae-pop album.  This isn't Sting slumming it with
    Shabba Ranks.  It's pure, unadulterated ""ragga ragga,"" as stated above. Refraining
    from whoring himself out to an undoubtedly rabid niche of British electro-wanks
    and ending up with a post-modern mess of an album, Horace Andy goes back to the
    studio the best way he knows how: back in Jamaica, with crack session musicians
    hand-picked from the island gathered at Tuff Gong Studios in Kingston.  Listening
    to this album, you may wonder about his decision.  There is, after all, something
    to be said for classicism, not to mention class, and both are in abundance here.
    The passion, though, is ironically often plundered from these tracks thanks to the
    upfront, dry, and crystal-clear sound-- a common sonic quality of what is
    rightfully called ""contemporary reggae.""</p><p>
    Here's a hint: there's a reason you probably can't name too many contemporary
    reggae artists, even if you can name quite a few old-timers.  Well, it's true.
    The old guys did it better.  Fans of the echo-chamber pilfered in more recent
    years by Mad Professor and his ilk will find little to get lost in here.
    <i>Living in the Flood</i> is unfortunately rather by-the-numbers as a whole,
    though some concessions are made.  Some of the tracks are difficult to distinguish
    from each other-- always a problem for the non-fanatics trying to make their way
    through an entire reggae album.</p><p>
    Multiple listens, however, provide more insight into these occasionally beautiful
    songs.  The opener, ""After All,"" is a tightly-woven groover to which the listener
    might contemplate his imminent suicide as he's ""looking for a soft place to fall.""
    Andy's voice perfectly complements the haunting mood.  ""Don't Blame the Children""
    shakes up the rhythmic formula a bit, providing a more uptempo and funky backdrop
    that gives his voice a bit of a different angle than the traditional slow-burning
    stompers. Here, he handles it with sublime grace and tenderness, invoking memories
    of childhood in Kingston watching ""John Wayne and James Bond"" and being moved to
    possess guns, and drink alcohol ""to be cool."" Sure, there's nothing fancy about
    Andy's lyrics here, but when the issues are so real and the sentiments so personal,
    why dress it up in opaque wordplay?  This is Horace, not Roland Orzabal.</p><p>
    Elsewhere, charged Rastafari cries (""My Lord,"" ""Seven Seals"") and another socially
    conscious message track (""Johnny Too Bad"") bring out the best in Horace and his
    backing band.  Yet, despite his passionate voice, he falters on the album's three
    obvious love songs (""True Love,"" ""Right Time,"" ""Girl of My Dreams"").  ""Right Time""
    in particular is schmaltzy, not a bit touching (even viewed in a naïve light),
    and downright silly.  While not obvious failures, the Joe Strummer-penned title
    track and ""Doldrums,"" written up for Horace as a bit of a thank you by Massive
    Attack's 3D Del Naja, are comparatively yawn-worthy and perhaps among the most
    musically staid, given the collaborators involved.</p><p>
    As any seasoned listener knows, there's nothing more irritating than an uneven
    album from a great artist.  The best moments reflect their lofty talent and echo
    the prime work of their career.  The worst moments challenge the notion that
    their artistry is still relevant and worth your attention.  Here, as is typical,
    the low points seem to come from unnecessary collaboration and inappropriate
    production.  Andy's voice needs to sparkle, yes, but not everything else does.
    Allowing some rough edges to survive post-production might've helped add some
    grit to these heartfelt and generally poignant songs.  As it is, you're left
    with a contemporary reggae album sporting several instant classics, some real
    crap, and in the middle of it all, a singular talent trying desperately to be
    heard.  Here's hoping that next time around, there's nobody rolling any boulders
    in his way.</p></div>"|185.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/185-living-in-the-flood/|7.0|Dan Gardopee

<b>There's no such thing as a throwaway</b><br/>
    People love records. The more records you put out, the more people will like you.  Naturally,
    this means writing as many songs as you can. I recommend setting up a tape recorder, taking in
    a 12-pack of Michelob, noodling around on your guitar, and then waking up a few days later
    and listening to what you did. This invariably produces good songs.</p><p>
<b>Never use the same band twice</b><br/>
    This is a big one. Bands are like beers. Once you've been through one, you want another. And
    another. And you can't drink Bud all the time. Sometimes you have to switch it up.  Go with a
    Guinness or a Harp.  Maybe a Rolling Rock once in a while.  Remember Zima?  I liked a Zima now
    and again, but I have to say, a nice, warm Sam Adams tops 'em all.  Oh, and never use bands
    from outside of your own state.</p><p>
<b>Words are alright, and more importantly, necessary</b><br/>
    I never thought there were enough words in rock music. I recommend picking at least two
    unrelated words and stringing them together. Then write a song about it. Some possibilities:
    ""telephone hazings"", ""Everest imaging"", ""fraternal nightingale...""  It's a pretty simple
    process.  Hey, if you get really good at it, you can even try alliterating a bit: like
    ""robotic reasons"" or ""the fantastic frying football fillet.""  This is a basic trick that'll
    have you writing and performing music of some kind in no time.</p><p>
<b>Re-use songs</b><br/>
    This is cool. Sometimes a song is so good, you can't release it just once.  Also, sometimes you
    might be too drunk to remember which songs you've already released.  Like this one time when
    I was recording this song with Doug Easley or someone, and we were just knocking 'em back.
    Anyway, it was like three in the morning, and the well ran dry.  All we needed was just maybe
    another half a beer between us and this song would turn out awesome.  So we dug around in my
    fridge and we found this old, stale open can of Pabst from probably like six months earlier.
    And I just figured the alcohol had evaporated, but Doug found it had kind of fermented into
    this really potent, sickeningly sweet, weird beer.  Anyway, we finished it off, and it was
    sick as hell, but we definitely thought it was stronger than Everclear.  We were just on the
    floor, trying to finish this song.  Anyway, shit happened and we got the song done, and we
    realized after we put it out that it was just ""Kicker of Elves"" played faster.</p><p>
<b>Sound British</b><br/>
    Another biggie.  People love British people.</p><p>
    
    Friends, I'm gonna level with you: there was a time when Pollard could pull songs out of his ass
    that most songwriters would spend their lives trying to compose. But, as <i>Do the Collapse</i>
    demonstrated, those days appear over.  The band's new nine-song EP, <i>Hold on Hope</i>, which
    consists mostly of outtakes from <i>Do the Collapse</i>, is more of the same over-produced junk
    Pollard just can't stop himself from releasing these days.</p><p>
    
    ""A Crick Uphill"" is a feeble attempt at alt-country-- the kind of boring, weak shit one would
    expect to find on <i>Kid Marine</i>. ""Idiot Princess""-- aka ""Snuff Movie (She's Gone)"", aka
    ""Reptilian Beauty Secrets""-- which was released on the fanclub-only album <i>Tonics and
    Twisted Chasers</i>, is a mediocre blast of unfocused fuzz. ""Underground Initiations"",
    ""Interest Positions"", ""Avalanche Aminos"", and ""Do the Collapse"" all sound like what they are:
    leftovers from <i>Do the Collapse</i>. And while Ric Ocasek's production is, in Pollard's
    words, ""slick as snails,"" the glossy coating can't hide the fact that Pollard's on the verge
    of losing his muse.  The only really worthwhile track on this EP is ""Tropical Robots"", a
    40-second acoustic ballad that harkens back to the good old days of GBV when UFOs were
    hardcore, demons were real, and blimps went 90.</p><p>
    
    Funny thing is, all of these outtakes are better than the actual album cut, the sugary-sweet
    ""Hold on Hope"".  Note to Bob: we all liked it better when your lyrics were whimsical and
    absurd instead of trite and infuriatingly dull. ""Everybody's got to hold on hope/ It's the
    last thing that's holding me.""  If Pollard's recent output is any indication, he'd better
    hold on hope that the elementary school he used to work at will take him back.</p></div>"|3594.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3594-hold-on-hope-ep/|4.5|Matt LeMay
